Description
This recycling project was initiated by the Unalaska City School in 1992.
It evolved out of the "Cans for Camp" program - a program that sends kids to camp from the proceeds generated from aluminum can recycling.
Due to tremendous growth in the Unalaska/ Dutch Harbor area, Linda Miller, the Unalaska City School Recycling Coordinator, decided to expand the scope of the program to conserve space in their local landfill.
Collection.
Six days a week, a paid driver and two students pick up recyclables from 10-15 collection sites located on both municipal and private lands around the city.
A drop-off site is also located at the school.
Some collection bins were built by the school, others have been provided by local businesses.
Storage/Processing.
Prior to shipment, recyclables are stored in several 40' containers at various locations (such as parking lot space donated by local businesses).
The shipping containers are provided by Sea-Land.
Processing (e.g., baling or crushing of the materials) is not required; but the more compact recyclables packed in the vans, the higher their market price.
Unalaska currently crushes their aluminum cans but does not bale their materials.
They are planning to purchase a baler in the near future.
[Note: if a business has enough recyclable material to fill an entire 40' van, Unalaska City School will coordinate with Sea-Land to drop a van off for their exclusive use.]
Shipping.
Unalaska has established a free shipping agreement with Sea-Land (this was started under the "Cans for Camp" program and has continued through the expanded recycling program).
When the 40' shipping containers are full, they call Sea-Land for pickup.
This agreement allows them to ship up to 72 containers a year for free on a space-available basis.
To date, Sea-Land has been able to ship the containers when requested.
Recycling Company.
Unalaska made several phone calls to recyclers in the Tacoma area and opted for Tacoma Recycling because they agreed to receive Unalaska's shipments without prior inspection and without the cardboard being baled.
Current Status of Recycling Project.
The project has been extremely successful.
In 1993, 48 containers of materials were recycled (the maximum amount allowed under their agreement with Sea-Land at that time).
In 1994, under their expanded contract, the school plans to send at least 72 containers.
Linda Miller indicates that as long as she's running the program and Sea-Land is donating free shipping, the program will continue to thrive.
Future projects include purchasing a baler (to increase the price received per shipment) and a better collection truck.
Factors Critical to Project's Success
Establishment of Free Shipping Arrangements With Sea-Land
This is the single most important aspect of Unalaska's The arrangement evolved in the following way: recycling program.
This free shipping agreement saves the school $3,000 per shipment or $216,000 per year.
* Sea-Land was providing free shipping of aluminum cans under the "Cans for Camp" program.
When Linda Miller decided to expand the scope of Unalaska's program, Sea-Land offered to continue providing free shipping of the materials.
These written contracts are renewed annually.
Initially the shipping agreement was for 48 vans per year, on a space-available basis.
In January 1994, at the request of Linda Miller, Sea-Land agreed to let Unalaska fill up to six van loads per month (a total of 72 per year) for free.
This demonstrates Sea-Land's strong commitment to working with the school on its recycling efforts.
* Six van loads a month, however, is still not enough to handle the large quantities of recyclable material being generated in the Unalaska community.
By March, 1994, the city had already shipped (30) vans.
Linda Miller plans to ask Sea-Land for additional van loads per month.
Strong School and Community Involvement/Individual Initiative.
* The Unalaska City School has been extremely supportive of Linda Miller and the overall recycling program.
During week days, she arranges and coordinates various aspects of the program.
The school also maintains and donates gasoline for the collection truck.
* It should be noted that Linda Miller, as the recycling program coordinator, is largely responsible for the program's success to date.
As an unpaid volunteer, she has expanded it from a cans only program to the current multiple-materials program.
Revenues and Costs
Revenues and Other Benefits of Recycling
Revenues.
This program is extremely profitable, primarily because of the free shipping agreement with Sea-Land.
Unalaska City School estimates that the shipping costs would normally be $3,000 per van load, which would render the program unfeasible.
1994 estimated revenues for the school are $30,000.
Benefits of Recycling.
This money primarily funds camp programs and student leadership programs.
The school is also donating money to selected nonprofit organizations.
Other benefits of recycling include the reduction of solid waste going to the local landfill.
Program Costs
Labor.
Volunteer hours total about 30 per week (including Linda Miller and school kids).
There is a paid driver who works two hours per day, six days a week.
Funding Mechanisms.
The program generally pays for itself
Shipping/Equipment/Capital Expenditures.
Expenditures include truck maintenance (certain things not covered by school); purchase of materials to build collection @ins ($600/per bin); and a dozen plastic containers with can-crushers attached ($80 apiece).
