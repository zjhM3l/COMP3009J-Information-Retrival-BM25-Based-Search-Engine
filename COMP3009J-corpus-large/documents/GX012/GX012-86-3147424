Description
Elfin Cove is a seasonal fishing port with a population of 30-50 in the winter and over 300 during the summer.
The town does not have a landfill due to unsuitable terrain and concerns about attracting brown bears.
Traditionally most people have either burned their garbage or sunk it in the ocean.
In 1988 when the town was considering building an incinerator, one Elfin Cove resident, Barbara Dowe proposed initiating a widespread recycling project to eliminate, or postpone, the need for an incinerator.
Within weeks, the program was underway and plans for the incinerator were shelved.
This project demonstrates the impact that one person's efforts can have on a small community, and may serve as a model for other small communities.
Collection.
Materials are collected in harborside dropoff bins (4'x4'x4') which Barbara Dowe built herself.
These bins initially were also used for shipping.
Storage/Processing.
All materials are stored in the harborside bins until they are transported to Seattle twice a year.
The material is not processed (e.g., crushed or baled) before shipment.
Shipping.
After experimenting with several other shipping lines, Elfin Cove established an arrangement with Alaska Outport Transportation Association (AOTA).
The original plywood collection bins have proved impractical for shipping and the town is now trying to switch over to lighter-weight and sturdier plastic crates.
Recycling Company.
Elfin Cove secured a special arrangement with Jonathan Howe of West Seattle Recycling.
Mr. Howe picks up their freight in Seattle, pays the shipping fee, then works out a payment for Elfin Cove based on the market value of the recyclables in the shipment minus the shipping fee.
Current Status of Recycling Project.
Due to Barbara Dowe's initiative and motivation, this project was extremely successful for several years.
However, now that Ms. Dowe has moved away from Elfin Cove, the momentum of the project has slowed.
Factors Critical to Project's Success
Elfin Cove's Commitment to Finding Satisfactory Transportation Methods
Elfin Cove's perseverance in overcoming numerous hurdles to secure effective transport arrangements is a critical factor in the success of the recycling program.
* Initially, they experimented with sending shipments of crushed class to Seattle on fishpacker boats in the autumn.
Although the transportation was free, it proved problematic because crushing glass was labor-intensive, and they couldn't guarantee that the glass would be picked up in Seattle by a buyer.
* In 1991, Elfin Cove experimented with transporting its recyclables to the city of Sitka.
Under an agreement with the Sitka Paper Mill, the mill shipped Sitka's and Elfin Cove's materials, at no charge, to Seattle.
This arrangement proved problematic due to transportation of the materials from Pelican to Sitka.
Although the state ferry offered discounted rates, the shipments did not meet certain ferry specifications and Elfin Cove was charged higher rates than anticipated.
* Finally, Elfin Cove secured an arrangement with West Seattle Recycling and Alaska Outport Transportation Association [AOTA].
AOTA freight rates were relatively inexpensive and AOTA helped find a buyer for Elfin Cove's recyclables that could provide dockside pick-up and would accept uncrushed glass.
Positive Working Relationship With West Seattle Recycling
This relationship was a critical factor contributing to the success of Elfin Cove's recycling program.
Without it, the program probably would not have been feasible economically or logistically.
* At West Seattle Recycling, Elfin Cove found not only a secure market but also a means of transport from the water to the inland recycling facility.
A West Seattle Recycling employee picks up the shipment, pays the AOTA shipping bill, and then invoices or pays Elfin Cove depending on the value of its recycled materials minus the shipping fee.
* Currently, West Seattle Recycling also provides pick-up service for the towns of Pelican and Tenakee Springs.
They have indicated that they would be more than willing to work with other towns that are launching recycling efforts.
Revenues and Other Benefits of Recycling
Revenues.
As owner of the recycling project, Barbara Dowe made a small profit on each shipment.
When she moved away, the community received these profits.
While prices on recyclables vary, in March of 1994 West Seattle Recycling was paying (and charging) the following: for aluminum, 15-250/lb. payment; for glass, 20/lb. charge.
(These prices include the pick-up of materials.).
Benefits of Recycling.
The goal of this project was to reduce the volume of solid waste.
For the past several years, Elfin Cove has annually shipped over 10,000 lbs. of materials that would otherwise have been landfilled, incinerated, or sunk in the ocean.
According to Ms. Dowe, people in the town have been extremely supportive and enthusiastic about the program from the start.
Project Costs
Labor.
While Ms. Dowe personally did most of the work for the Elfin Cove recycling project, she occasionally assembled volunteers to assist her.
Shipping/Equipment/Capital Expenditures.
AOTA charges Elfin Cove the reduced scrap rate for shipments over 5,000 lbs. (40/lb).
The town sends approximately 2 shipments south per year.
Funding Mechanisms.
The initial costs for the Elfin Cove recycling project were absorbed solely by Ms. Dowe (she estimates that she spent a few hundred dollars before the project started breaking even).
In addition, an Amway donation of $2,500 was received in 1992.
