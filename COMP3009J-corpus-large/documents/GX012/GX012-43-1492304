GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Respondent
and
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, LOCAL 1705 Charging Party
Case No. 3-CA-1016
DECISION AND ORDER
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED THE ATTACHED DECISION IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED PROCEEDING, FINDING THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD ENGAGED IN CERTAIN OF THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT AND RECOMMENDING THAT IT BE ORDERED TO CEASE AND DESIST THEREFROM AND TAKE CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
THE JUDGE FOUND THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD NOT ENGAGED IN ANOTHER UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT, AND RECOMMENDED DISMISSAL OF THAT PORTION OF THE COMPLAINT.
THEREAFTER, THE GENERAL COUNSEL FILED EXCEPTIONS TO THE JUDGE'S DECISION AND THE RESPONDENT FILED AN OPPOSITION TO THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S EXCEPTIONS.
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS (5 CFR 2423.29) AND SECTION 7118 OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (THE STATUTE), THE AUTHORITY HAS REVIEWED THE RULINGS OF THE JUDGE MADE AT THE HEARING AND FINDS THAT NO PREJUDICIAL ERROR WAS COMMITTED.
THE RULINGS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED.
UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THIS CASE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ADOPTS THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AS MODIFIED HEREIN.
THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT THE "RESPONDENT DISPARATELY ENFORCED AGAINST THE UNION A POLICY REGARDING NO-DISTRIBUTION DURING EMPLOYEES' NON-WORK TIME TO THE EMPLOYEES' DESKS AND ON WINDSHIELDS OF EMPLOYEES' CARS IN THE EMPLOYEES' PARKING LOT, THEREBY INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING, AND COERCING EMPLOYEES" IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE.
THE JUDGE CONCLUDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGATION THAT RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW DESK-TO-DESK DISTRIBUTION OF THE UNION LEAFLET CONSTITUTED UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE WITH EMPLOYEE RIGHTS IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE.
THE JUDGE REASONED THAT THE CASE INVOLVED "A SPECIFIC REQUEST BY THE UNION TO DISTRIBUTE THE (LEAFLET) AND THE ACTIVITY'S RESPONSE," RATHER THAN A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT "FORMULATED SOME TYPE OF AN OVERBROAD 'NO DISTRIBUTION' RULE."
THE JUDGE FOUND, IN THIS REGARD, THAT AS THE INITIAL REQUEST TO DISTRIBUTE THE LEAFLET DESK-TO-DESK WOULD HAVE INVOLVED EITHER THE DISTRIBUTOR'S OR THE RECIPIENT'S WORK TIME, THE REQUEST TO DISTRIBUTE WAS EFFECTIVELY A REQUEST FOR OFFICIAL TIME PURSUANT TO SECTION 7131(D) OF THE STATUTE.
/1/ FURTHER, THE JUDGE FOUND "(E)VEN IN LIGHT OF THE ALLEGED DISPARATE TREATMENT . . .
(S)ECTION 7131(D) SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THE GRANTING (OF) OFFICIAL TIME FOR THE CONDUCT IN QUESTION IS A MATTER FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THUS, IN EVENT OF AN IMPASSE, TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THE FEDERAL SERVICES IMPASSE (SIC) PANEL."
THEREFORE, THE JUDGE CONCLUDED THE UNION WAS NOT ENTITLED, IN THE ABSENCE OF AN AGREEMENT, TO DUTY TIME TO DISTRIBUTE THE LEAFLETS.
WHILE AGREEING WITH HIS CONCLUSION, THE AUTHORITY DOES NOT ADOPT THE JUDGE'S REASONING.
IN THE VIEW OF THE AUTHORITY, THE ISSUE INVOLVED HEREIN CONCERNS THE UNION'S RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE LITERATURE.
/2/ UNDER SIMILAR FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE AUTHORITY HAS CONCLUDED THAT A UNION HAS A RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE LITERATURE "IN NON-WORK AREA(S) DURING NON-WORK TIME . . .
" /3/ SUCH RIGHT FLOWS FROM SECTION 7102 OF THE STATUTE WHICH GUARANTEES TO EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO "FORM, JOIN, OR ASSIST" A LABOR ORGANIZATION.
HOWEVER, THERE IS NO STATUTORY RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE LITERATURE IN WORK AREAS DURING WORK TIME, AND ABSENT AGREEMENT BY AN AGENCY AND BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE, AN AGENCY MAY VALIDLY PROHIBIT SUCH DISTRIBUTION.
THEREFORE, THE UNION HEREIN HAD NO STATUTORY RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE ITS LEAFLET "DESK-TO-DESK" AS REQUESTED, AS THIS DISTRIBUTION WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN WORK AREAS.
/4/
THE GENERAL COUNSEL ALSO URGES THAT BECAUSE DESK-TO-DESK DISTRIBUTION OF THE UNION'S LITERATURE HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY, AND BECAUSE OTHER TYPES OF LITERATURE ARE ROUTINELY DISTRIBUTED TO RESPONDENT'S EMPLOYEES, RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL OF THE UNION'S REQUEST HEREIN CONSTITUTED DISPARATE TREATMENT OF THE UNION IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE.
EXAMPLES OF LITERATURE ROUTINELY DISTRIBUTED ARE: NOTICES FROM THE GENERAL SERVICES EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATION; NOTICES OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION MEETINGS; NOTICES OF BLOOD, SAVINGS BONDS AND COMBINED FEDERAL CAMPAIGN DRIVES; INFORMAL NOTICES OF EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PARTIES; AND TWO PRIOR UNION FLYERS DEALING WITH INFORMATION CONCERNING A PROPOSED PAY CAP AND MANAGEMENT'S CONDUCT OF NEGOTIATIONS.
THE RECORD REFLECTS THAT MOST OF THE ABOVE-NOTED SUBMISSIONS WERE AGENCY-SPONSORED LITERATURE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE AGENCY MAIL SYSTEM AND NOT DESK-TO-DESK.
WITH RESPECT TO THOSE MATERIALS WHICH WERE NOT AGENCY-SPONSORED AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED DESK-TO-DESK, SUCH AS INFORMAL RETIREMENT PARTY NOTICES, AND THE TWO FLYERS, THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT RESPONDENT'S PERMISSION WAS SOUGHT OR THAT RESPONDENT KNEW OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS, THAT SUCH ACTIONS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONDONED, OR THAT SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ACTIVITY-WIDE.
AS THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED A PAST PRACTICE OR PERMITTED OR CONDONED HEREIN, THE AUTHORITY FINDS THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO PERMIT THE DISTRIBUTION HEREIN AMOUNTS TO DISPARATE TREATMENT OF THE UNION IN VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE.
HOWEVER, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE JUDGE, AND NOTING PARTICULARLY THE ABSENCE OF EXCEPTIONS BY THE RESPONDENT, THE AUTHORITY FINDS THAT RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO PERMIT DISTRIBUTION OF THE LEAFLETS IN THE PARKING AREA, A NON-WORK AREA, DURING THE NON-WORK TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTOR CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE.
AS NOTED ABOVE, THE AUTHORITY HAS CONCLUDED, IN SIMILAR FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT DISTRIBUTION OF UNION LITERATURE BY AN EMPLOYEE DURING NON-WORK TIME IN A NON-WORK AREA IS A RIGHT ASSURED BY THE STATUTE.
ACCORDINGLY, THE AUTHORITY CONCLUDES THAT RESPONDENT'S CONDUCT IN THIS REGARD WAS VIOLATIVE OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE, AND THE RESPONDENT SHALL BE ORDERED TO CEASE AND DESIST THEREFROM AND TAKE APPROPRIATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY AND SECTION 7118 OF THE STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ORDERS THAT THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION SHALL:

DECISION
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
THIS IS A PROCEEDING UNDER THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, CHAPTER 71 OF TITLE 5 OF THE U.S. CODE, 5 U.S.C. 7101 ET SEQ (HEREINAFTER CALLED THE STATUTE) AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY 5 C.F.R.
CHAPTER XIV, SEC.
PURSUANT TO A CHARGE FILED ON MARCH 21, 1980, A FIRST AMENDED CHARGE FILED ON JUNE 19, 1980, AND A SECOND AMENDED CHARGE FILED ON JUNE 20, 1980, BY THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, LOCAL 1705, (HEREINAFTER CALLED THE UNION AND/OR CHARGING PARTY), AGAINST THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, BY THE ACTING REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR REGION 3, ISSUED A COMPLAINT AND NOTICE OF HEARING ON JUNE 25, 1980 ALLEGING THAT RESPONDENT HAD ENGAGED IN AND WAS ENGAGING IN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE.
THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT ON MARCH 14, 1980 RESPONDENT DISPARATELY ENFORCED A POLICY REFUSING TO PERMIT THE UNION TO DISTRIBUTE A LEAFLET DURING EMPLOYEES NON-WORK TIME TO EMPLOYEES' DESKS AND WINDSHIELDS OF EMPLOYEES' CARS IN THE EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT.
RESPONDENT ADMITS JURISDICTION BUT DENIES THAT IT VIOLATED THE STATUTE.
A HEARING IN THIS MATTER WAS CONDUCTED ON SEPTEMBER 22 AND 23 IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
AT WHICH TIME THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND RESPONDENT WERE REPRESENTED AND AFFORDED FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, TO EXAMINE AND CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES, TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE BEARING ON THE ISSUES HEREIN AND TO ARGUE ORALLY.
BRIEFS WERE FILED BY RESPONDENT AND COUNSEL FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL ON NOVEMBER 6, 1980 AND HAVE BEEN FULLY CONSIDERED.
/5/
UPON THE ENTIRE RECORD /6/ IN THIS MATTER, MY OBSERVATION OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, AND FROM MY EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING:
FINDINGS OF FACT
A. INCIDENT AT ISSUE
AT ALL RELEVANT TIMES THE UNION HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE EXCLUSIVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE FOR A UNIT COMPOSED OF ALL GENERAL SCHEDULE AND WAGE GRADE NON-PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES OF THE RESPONDENT'S CENTRAL OFFICE IN THE METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON, D.C.
AREA.
THE UNION AND RESPONDENT WERE PARTIES TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE DURING MARCH OF 1980.
FURTHER THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN MODIFIED BY THE PARTIES BY A SEPARATE AGREEMENT.
ARTICLE XX SECTION 1 OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE INTERNAL MAIL SYSTEM OF THE RESPONDENT MAY BE USED BY THE UNION TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE EMPLOYEES AND UNION OFFICIALS BUT THAT " . . .
IT SHALL NOT BE USED FOR THE SOLICITATION OF MEMBERSHIP OR DUES, OR OTHER INTERNAL UNION BUSINESS."
ARTICLE VII SECTION 6 PROVIDES THAT THE UNION CAN POST NOTICES ON OFFICIAL BULLETIN BOARD SPACE AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT PROVIDES THE UNION WITH BULLETIN BOARD SPACE AT 5 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.
APPROXIMATELY 3,000 GSA EMPLOYEES WORK IN THE GSA MAIN BUILDING AT 18TH AND F STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C.
THE SUBJECT BARGAINING UNIT REPRESENTED BY THE UNION IS COMPOSED OF APPROXIMATELY 1,600-1,700 EMPLOYEES, WITH SOME 1,300-1,400 OF THEM EMPLOYED AT THE GSA MAIN BUILDING.
THE REMAINING 300 EMPLOYEES IN THE SUBJECT WORK UNIT WORK ELSEWHERE.
THE GSA MAIN BUILDING HAS AN EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT WITH APPROXIMATELY 141 SPACES IN THE EAST AND WEST COURT, AND ALSO HAS A CAROUSEL, OR STACKING RAMP, WITH ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES.
EMPLOYEE-DRIVERS HAVE IDENTIFICATIONS THAT PERMIT THEM TO UTILIZE THE PARKING FACILITIES.
AT ALL TIMES MATERIAL HEREIN GUARDS WERE STATIONED AT THE TWO PARKING LOT ENTRANCES TO CHECK THE DRIVER IDENTIFICATIONS.
THERE ARE ALSO PEDESTRIAN ACCESS DOORS FROM THE GSA MAIN BUILDING TO THE PARKING AREA.
ON MARCH 14, 1980, AT ABOUT 12:15 PM UNION PRESIDENT SALLY JOYCE HYMES WAS ADVISED, TELEPHONICALLY, BY NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DIRECTOR OF CIVILIAN AGENCIES BRANCH, CHARLES BERNHARDT THAT, BECAUSE CONGRESS MIGHT PASS A PENDING PAY REFORM BILL BEFORE PROPER HEARINGS COULD BE HELD, HE WAS CALLING VARIOUS NFFE LOCALS, DIRECTOR BERNHARDT STATED THAT BECAUSE THIS PAY REFORM BILL WAS OF A CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES NFFE'S NATIONAL OFFICE WANTED THE LOCAL UNIONS TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO CONTACT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS, SPECIFICALLY HOUSE SPEAKER O'NEIL, TO ENSURE THAT PROPER HEARINGS WOULD BE HELD.
UNION PRESIDENT HYMES TYPED A UNION FLYER ENTITLED "URGENT NOTICE TO ALL UNIT EMPLOYEES, UNION MEMBERS, PROFESSIONALS, MANAGERS, SUPERVISORS, ETC.", WHICH OUTLINED THE INFORMATION CONVEYED BY BERNHARDT AND WHICH URGED THE READERS TO CONTACT THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES AND/OR SENATORS WITH RESPECT TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING HEARINGS ON THE PAY REFORM BILL.
UNION PRESIDENT HYMES THEN DISTRIBUTED ABOUT 15 TO 20 FLYERS IN HER IMMEDIATE WORK AREA AND IN SURROUNDING AREAS BY PLACING THEM ON DESKS OR IN "IN-BOXES".
IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVING THE DOCUMENT WAS WORKING AT HIS DESK, UNION PRESIDENT HYMES SUMMARIZED THE FLYER, ASKED THE PERSON TO READ IT AND TO TAKE THE IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUESTED.
THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVING THE FLYER THEN READ IT.
UNION PRESIDENT HYMES DECIDED TO SEEK MANAGEMENT'S APPROVAL TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLYER "ON THE CLOCK" AND IN THE WORK AREAS.
TO SECURE SUCH APPROVAL UNION PRESIDENT HYMES CALLED THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS BUT THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.
SHE THEN CALLED TOM GASQUE, ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE LABOR LAW DIVISION, WHO SUGGESTED THAT SHE CALL WILLIAM PAZ, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOR HUMAN RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION.
MS. HYMES CALLED MR. PAZ' OFFICE AND SPOKE WITH MR. PAZ' EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, BRUCE HOWARD.
MS. HYMES DESCRIBED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE FLYER AND ASKED PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE IT. MR. HOWARD STATED THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE HER AN ANSWER AND ASKED TO SEE THE FLYER.
MS. HYMES WENT TO MR. HOWARD'S OFFICE TO SHOW HIM THE FLYER AND WAS TAKEN TO SEE MR. HOWARD'S ASSISTANT, TOM HUIBIN.
MS. HYMES AGAIN DESCRIBED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE FLYER AND ASKED PERMISSION TO IMMEDIATELY DISTRIBUTE THE FLYER, ON-THE-CLOCK ON A DESK-TO-DESK BASIS.
MR. HUIBIN AND MS. HYMES WENT TO THE OFFICE OF NORMAN L. LINTON, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL, WHERE THEY SPOKE WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN P. HANKARD.
MS. HYMES DESCRIBED THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO MR. HANKARD, HANDED HIM A COPY OF THE FLYER AND ASKED PERMISSION FOR THE UNION TO IMMEDIATELY DISTRIBUTE THE FLYERS BY A DESK-DROP ON-THE-CLOCK.
MR. HANKARD OBJECTED THAT THE FLYER APPEARED CLOSE TO LOBBYING AND, AFTER CONSULTING WITH LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST WILLIAM CONLEY, INFORMED MS. HYMES THAT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE TO LOBBYING HE COULD NOT PERMIT THE UNION TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLYER AT THE DESKS AS REQUESTED.
MS. HYMES DISPUTED THAT THE FLYER CONSTITUTED LOBBYING AND INSISTED THAT THE UNION SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE IT.
DURING THE DISCUSSION MS. HYMES POINTED OUT THAT THE UNION DISTRIBUTED TWO OTHER FLYERS DESK TO DESK, BOTH ON AND OFF THE CLOCK AND THAT MANAGEMENT HADN'T OBJECTED.
/7/ MS. HYMES STATED THAT SHE WANTED TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLYER IMMEDIATELY BUT MR. HANKARD REPLIED SHE COULD NOT DO IT ON THE CLOCK.
MS. HYMES THEN STATED SHE WOULD DO IT OFF THE CLOCK AND WOULD DISTRIBUTE IT DESK TO DESK.
MR. HANKARD STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT PERMIT THAT EITHER.
MS. HYMES THEN STATED THAT SHE WOULD GO TO THE PARKING AREA, OFF-THE-CLOCK, AND PUT FLYERS UNDER THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS OF THE PARKED CARS.
MR. HANKARD DENIED HER PERMISSION TO SO DISTRIBUTE FLYERS IN THE PARKING LOT BUT SAID SHE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE FLYER IN THE PUBLIC AREAS SUCH AS THE LOBBY, CAFETERIA AND THE ACCESS TO THE PARKING AREAS.
MS. HYMES THEN WAITED UNTIL THE END OF HER WORKDAY AND DISTRIBUTED FLYERS IN THE MAIN LOBBY FOR AN HOUR.
FURTHER, ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND TUESDAY, MARCH 17 AND 18, MS. HYMES AND OTHER UNION VOLUNTEERS HAND OUT FLIERS, ON THEIR OWN TIME, IN THE PUBLIC AREAS AND POSTED THEM ON THE TWO UNION BULLETIN BOARDS.
B. PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS
IN JANUARY 1979 MS. HYMES AND THEN UNION PRESIDENT GLENN DISTRIBUTED A FLIER ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY FEDERAL RETIREMENT ISSUE TO ABOUT ONE-THIRD TO ONE-HALF OF THE DESKS IN THE MAIN GSA BUILDING.
MS. HYMES AND MR. GLENN MADE A SECOND FLIER DISTRIBUTION IN JUNE 1979 CONCERNING PICKETING AND THE PAY CAP.
THIS DISTRIBUTION WAS MADE DESK TO DESK BOTH ON AND OFF THE CLOCK.
A THIRD DESK TO DESK DISTRIBUTION WAS MADE BY MS. HYMES AND UNION NEGOTIATOR TEAMS ON OR ABOUT JUNE 23, 1979 REGARDING THE STATUS OF CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS.
AFTER DISTRIBUTION RESPONDENT'S LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST NICK CAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE UNION REPRESENTATIVES HAD GOTTEN INTO LOCKED OFFICES.
NO MANAGEMENT PERMISSION WAS SOUGHT AT ANY OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS AND, OTHER THAN THE CONVERSATION ALREADY DESCRIBED, RESPONDENT MADE NO OBJECTION TO THESE UNION DISTRIBUTIONS.
THE RECORD ESTABLISHES THAT FLIERS BY VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES ARE DISTRIBUTED AND CIRCULATED.
ALTHOUGH THESE FLIERS ENDED UP ON INDIVIDUAL DESKS, THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH WHETHER THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED "DESK-TO-DESK" OR THROUGH THE INTERNAL MAIL SYSTEM, THROUGH WHICH FLIERS ALSO END UP ON INDIVIDUAL DESKS IN-BOXES.
THE RECORD DOES ESTABLISH THAT SOME NOTICES AND FLIERS REGARDING RETIREMENT AND BIRTHDAYS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN LOCAL WORK AREAS ON A DESK TO DESK BASIS DURING WORK TIME.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
THE AGENCY CONTENDS THAT IT WAS PRIVILEGED TO REFUSE THE UNION'S REQUEST TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS BECAUSE THE FLIERS WERE AIMED AT LEGISLATION PENDING BEFORE CONGRESS AND THUS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE FLIER WAS OUTSIDE AGENCY CONTROL AND OUTSIDE EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP.
FURTHER RESPONDENT URGES THAT BECAUSE THE FLIER WAS DIRECTED TO MANAGERS, SUPERVISORS AND PROFESSIONALS, IN ADDITION TO EMPLOYEES, THE UNION HAD ABANDONED ALL CLAIMS TO PROTECTION UNDER THE STATUTE.
A UNION'S CONDUCT IN ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE CONGRESS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT WORKING CONDITIONS, AS WOULD THE PROPOSED PAY REFORM LEGISLATION, HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS LEGITIMATE UNION CONDUCT WHICH IS ENTITLED TO FULL PROTECTION.
SECTION 7102(1) OF THE STATUTE PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES ACTING FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO "PRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATION TO . . .
THE CONGRESS . . .
" SEE ALSO U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, A/SLMR NO. 925, 7 A/SLMR 948(1977); AND EASTEX VS. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556(1978).
THIS RIGHT OF A UNION TO COMMUNICATE WITH CONGRESS IS ESSENTIAL IN THE FEDERAL SECTOR BECAUSE SO MANY FUNDAMENTAL WORKING CONDITIONS ARE DIRECTLY DETERMINED BY CONGRESS THROUGH LEGISLATION.
THEREFORE, THE AGENCY'S ARGUMENT THAT THE UNION CONDUCT IN THE INSTANT CASE, ATTEMPTING TO GET EMPLOYEES, UNION MEMBERS AND OTHERS, TO COMMUNICATE WITH CONGRESS, WAS SOMEHOW UNPROTECTED BECAUSE IT DID NOT INVOLVE THE "EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP" MUST BE REJECTED AS TOO NARROW AN INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE'S PROTECTION OF UNION CONDUCT.
CF. EASTEX VS. NLRB, SUPRA.
IN THE INSTANT CASE THE FLIER WAS DIRECTED BOTH TO EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE UNIT REPRESENTED BY THE UNION AND TO THOSE NOT REPRESENTED AND EVEN TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED BY THE UNION, I.E. MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS.
IT IS FURTHER URGED THAT, BECAUSE THE FLIER WAS DIRECTED TO A GROUP BROADER THAN THE GROUP REPRESENTED BY THE UNION, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FLIER WAS SOMEHOW NOT PROTECTED UNION CONDUCT, OR THAT THE CONDUCT LOST ITS PROTECTION.
HERE AGAIN WHERE THE UNION WAS AIMING ITS OTHERWISE PROTECTED CONDUCT AT A GROUP WHOM IT SUBSTANTIALLY REPRESENTED OR COULD LAWFULLY REPRESENT, THAT CONDUCT MUST BE PROTECTED.
/8/
THE COUNSEL FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL URGES THAT THE AGENCY, IN THIS CASE, FORMULATED SOME TYPE OF AN OVERBROAD "NO DISTRIBUTION" RULE THAT IS UNLAWFUL.
RATHER THIS CASE INVOLVES A SPECIFIC REQUEST BY THE UNION TO DISTRIBUTE THE SUBJECT FLIERS AND THE ACTIVITY'S RESPONSE.
MS. HYMES AT FIRST ASKED, DURING THE EARLY AFTERNOON, FOR PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS, ON THE CLOCK, DESK TO DESK.
PERMISSION WAS DENIED.
THEN MS. HYMES ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS IMMEDIATELY, DESK TO DESK OFF-THE-CLOCK.
PERMISSION TO DO THIS WAS DENIED BUT SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS "OFF-THE-CLOCK" IN THE PUBLIC AREAS (CAFETERIA, LOBBY, ETC.), WHICH SHE DID.
SHE WAS ALSO DENIED PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS IN THE EMPLOYEE PARKING AREA, "OFF-THE-CLOCK".
SECTION 7131(A) OF THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT, WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, EMPLOYEES WHILE "REPRESENTING AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT . . .
" SHALL BE AUTHORIZED OFFICIAL TIME.
SECTION 7131(B) PROVIDES HOWEVER THAT AN EMPLOYEE ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES "RELATING TO THE INTERNAL BUSINESS OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION . . .
" SHALL PERFORM SUCH ACTIVITIES ON A NON-DUTY STATUS.
SECTION 7131(D) OF THE STATUTE PROVIDES:
"(D) EXCEPT OR PROVIDED IN THE PRECEDING SUBSECTIONS OF THIS SECTION--
'(1) ANY EMPLOYEE REPRESENTING AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE, OR
'(2) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER MATTER COVERED BY THIS CHAPTER, ANY EMPLOYEE IN AN
APPROPRIATE UNIT REPRESENTED BY AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE, SHALL BE GRANTED OFFICIAL TIME IN
ANY AMOUNT THE AGENCY AND THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE INVOLVED AGREE TO BE REASONABLE,
NECESSARY, AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST . . .
"
THE AGENCY URGES THAT THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE PROVEN BECAUSE THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S EVIDENCE OF DISPARATE TREATMENT WAS INADEQUATE; BECAUSE THERE WERE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO THE PARKING LOT; AND FINALLY, BECAUSE THE UNION HAD WAIVED ANY RIGHT IT HAD BY NEGOTIATING METHODS OF COMMUNICATIONS IN ITS CONTRACT.
THE GENERAL COUNSEL URGES THAT SECTION 7131(B) LIMITATIONS ON USE OF OFFICIAL TIME RELATE ONLY TO THE DISTRIBUTOR OF LEAFLETS, NOT TO THE RECIPIENTS, AND THAT, IN ANY EVENT, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FLIERS IN THE INSTANT SITUATION DOES NOT RELATE "TO THE INTERNAL BUSINESS OF A LABOR ORGANIZATIONS . . .
" AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7131(B).
THE FLRA ANALYZED AND CONSTRUED SECTIONS 7131(A)(B) AND (D) IN TWO NEGOTIABILITY CASES.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 2823 AND VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL OFFICE, CLEVELAND, OHIO, 2 FLRA NO. 1(1979), (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE VA CASE); AND AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1692 AND HEADQUARTERS, 323RD FLYING TRAINING WING (ATC), MATHER AIR FORCE BASE, 3 FLRA NO. 47(1980), (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE MATHER AIR FORCE BASE CASE).
IN THESE CASES THE FLRA CONSTRUED SEC.
7131(B)'S REFERENCE TO "INTERNAL BUSINESS OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION" RATHER NARROWLY STATING THAT IT REFERS TO MATTERS "SOLELY RELATED TO THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION" VA CASE, SUPRA, SL.
OP. PAGE 6.
HOWEVER IN DISCUSSING CONGRESSIONAL INTENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ENACTMENT OF SEC.
7131(B) OF THE STATUTE THE AUTHORITY STATED "IN THIS REGARD, CONGRESS INTENDED TO PROSCRIBE THE USE OF DUTY TIME FOR ONLY THOSE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE UNION AS AN ORGANIZATION AND PERTAINING TO THE OPERATION OF THAT ORGANIZATION, SUCH AS UNION BUSINESS MEETINGS, COMMUNICATION WITH MEMBERS, CONTRACTING FOR GOODS AND SERVICES, PAYMENT OF BILLS, AND OTHER SIMILAR AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES . . . ", VA CASE, SUPRA, SL. OP/ PAGE 5.
THUS THE AUTHORITY SOMEWHAT BROADENED ITS CONSTRUCTION OF "INTERNAL BUSINESS OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION" SO AS TO INCLUDE "COMMUNICATION WITH MEMBERS".
HOWEVER, SINCE THE UNION, IN DISTRIBUTING THE FLIERS, WAS NOT SOLELY ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MEMBERS, THE AUTHORITY'S CONSTRUCTION WOULD NOT COVER THE CONDUCT IN QUESTION AND THUS IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THE UNION WAS NOT ENGAGING IN "INTERNAL BUSINESS OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION" AS DEFINED IN SECTION 7131(B).
SECTION 7131(D) APPLIES TO GRANTING UNION OFFICIALS DUTY TIME FOR ACTIVITIES NOT COVERED BY SEC.
7131(A) OR (B) AND WOULD THEREFORE APPLY TO THE SUBJECT CONDUCT, THE DISTRIBUTING FLIERS.
SECTION 7131(D) PROVIDES THAT OFFICIAL TIME SHALL BE GRANTED "IN ANY AMOUNT THE AGENCY AND THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE INVOLVED AGREE TO BE REASONABLE, NECESSARY AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST . . .
" THE CONTRACT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY AGREEMENT THAT THE OFFICIAL DUTY TIME SHALL BE GRANTED TO ENGAGE IN THE CONDUCT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS CASE AND THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT ANY SUCH AGREEMENT WAS OTHERWISE ENTERED INTO BY THE PARTIES.
FURTHER, SINCE IT IS, PURSUANT TO SECTION 7131(D), THE SUBJECT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, THE UNION CAN NOT BYPASS THE IMPASS PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE BY DEMANDING THAT IT IMMEDIATELY BE GRANTED DUTY TIME TO DISTRIBUTE FLIERS AND CONTENDING THAT FAILURE TO DO SO CONSTITUTES AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.
RATHER THE STATUTE ENVISIONS, IF SUCH A REQUEST IS MADE AND THE PARTIES CAN NOT AGREE AFTER NEGOTIATION THAT SUCH AN IMPASS GO TO THE FEDERAL IMPASS PANEL FOR DISPOSITION.
/9/ EVEN IN THE LIGHT OF THE ALLEGED DISPARATE TREATMENT /10/ SECTION 7131(D) SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THE GRANTING OFFICIAL TIME FOR THE CONDUCT IN QUESTION IS A MATTER FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THUS, IN EVENT OF AN IMPASS, TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THE FEDERAL SERVICES IMPASS PANEL.
IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING THEREFORE, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF AN AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE UNION WAS NOT ENTITLED TO DUTY TIME TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS IN QUESTION.
THIS LIMITATION PLACED BY SECTION 7131(D) ON THE USE OF OFFICIAL TIME TO DISTRIBUTE THESE FLIERS MUST APPLY TO THE RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTORS.
MS. HYMES TESTIFIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE 15 OR 20 FLIERS WHICH SHE DID DISTRIBUTE DESK-TO-DESK, THAT WHEN A WORKING EMPLOYEE RECEIVED THE FLIER MS. HYMES EXPLAINED IT TO THE EMPLOYEE AND ANSWERED THE EMPLOYEE'S QUESTIONS AND THAT THE EMPLOYEE THEN READ THE FLIER.
THE RECIPIENT, WHO WAS AT WORK, INTERRUPTED HIS WORK TO READ AND DISCUSS THE FLIER.
THUS THE WORK OF THE EMPLOYEE WAS DISRUPTED AND THE EMPLOYEE WAS ENGAGING IN THE VERY CONDUCT COVERED BY SECTION 7131(D) WHILE ON DUTY STATUS, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGREEMENT PERMITTING SUCH CONDUCT.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IN THE LIGHT OF SECTION 7131(D), AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGREEMENT, THE RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE STATUTE BY REFUSING TO PERMIT THE UNION TO DISTRIBUTE THE FLIERS DURING THE WORKING TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTOR OR DURING THE WORKING TIME OF THE RECIPIENT.
HOWEVER IT IS CONCLUDED THAT RESPONDENT DID VIOLATE SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE WHEN IT REFUSED THE UNION PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE FLIERS IN THE PARKING AREA DURING THE DISTRIBUTOR'S NON DUTY TIME.
RESPONDENT DID NOT SUBMIT ANY EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS, UNDULY DISRUPTIVE, ETC.
TO PERMIT DISTRIBUTION IN THE PARKING AREA.
THUS SINCE THE DISTRIBUTION, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IS PROTECTED CONDUCT /11/ AND IT WAS TO BE CONDUCTED DURING NON-WORK TIME IN A NON-WORK AREA, REFUSING TO PERMIT IT CONSTITUTED UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE WITH PROTECTED UNION ACTIVITY AND THUS VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE.
THE GENERAL COUNSEL URGES THAT WHEN RESPONDENT LIMITED ITS PERMISSION TO "PUBLIC AREAS" RATHER THAN "NON-WORKING AREAS" THIS WAS TOO RESTRICTIVE.
THIS CONTENTION MUST BE REJECTED BECAUSE THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE PARKING AREAS, THERE ARE ANY "NON-WORK AREAS" OTHER THAN THE "PUBLIC AREAS".
IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTANT SITUATION RESPONDENT WAS MERELY INSTRUCTING MS. HYMES THAT EVEN IF SHE WAS IN NON-DUTY STATUS, SHE COULD NOT DISRUPT EMPLOYEES WHILE WORKING, AND THUS HAD TO LIMIT THE DISTRIBUTION TO THE PUBLIC AREAS.
/12/
HAVING FOUND AND CONCLUDED THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1) OF THE STATUTE, I RECOMMEND THE AUTHORITY ISSUE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ORDERS THAT GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION SHALL:
(1) CEASE AND DESIST FROM:
(A) INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING, OR COERCING EMPLOYEES IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHTS
ASSURED BY THE STATUTE BY REFUSING PERMISSION TO LOCAL 1705, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES OR ANY OTHER LABOR ORGANIZATION, TO DISTRIBUTE FLIERS IN THE EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT IN
GSA MAIN BUILDING AT 18TH 
(B) IN ANY LIKE OR RELATED MANNER INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING OR COERCING ITS EMPLOYEES
IN THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE.
(2) TAKE THE FOLLOWING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION:
(A) PERMIT LOCAL 1705, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TO DISTRIBUTE UNION FLIERS
IN THE EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT IN GSA MAIN BUILDING AT 18TH AND F STREETS, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C.
(B) POST AT ITS MAIN BUILDING, 18TH 
ATTACHED NOTICE MARKED "APPENDIX."

--------------- FOOTNOTES$ ---------------
/1/ SECTION 7131(D) READS AS FOLLOWS:
(D) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE PRECEDING SUBSECTIONS OF THIS SECTION--
(1) ANY EMPLOYEE REPRESENTING AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE, OR
(2) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER MATTER COVERED BY THIS CHAPTER, ANY EMPLOYEE IN AN
APPROPRIATE UNIT REPRESENTED BY AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE,
SHALL BE GRANTED OFFICIAL TIME IN ANY AMOUNT THE AGENCY AND THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE
INVOLVED AGREE TO BE REASONABLE, NECESSARY, AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
/2/ THE AUTHORITY FINDS IT UNNECESSARY TO PASS UPON THE JUDGE'S DISCUSSION AT P. 5 OF HIS DECISION REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF DISTRIBUTION, NOT THE CONTENTS OF THE MATERIALS.
/3/ INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, NORTH ATLANTIC SERVICE CENTER, ANDOVER, MASSACHUSETTS, 7 FLRA NO. 92(1982).
/4/ MOREOVER, THE UNION'S REQUEST DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A REQUEST TO NEGOTIATE TO EXPAND UPON ITS STATUTORY RIGHT.
/5/ COUNSEL FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL FILED A MOTION AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT ON DECEMBER 1, 1980 TO STRIKE CERTAIN PORTIONS OF RESPONDENTS BRIEF BECA0SE THEY ALLEGEDLY RAISED MATTERS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE RECORD.
RESPONDENT FILED AN OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION ON DECEMBER 5, 1980.
THE MATTERS RAISED IN THE MOTION ARE DEALT WITH IN THE DISPOSITION OF THIS CASE AND THEREFORE NEED NOT BE DEALT WITH SEPARATELY.
/6/ THE TRANSCRIPT OF HEARING IN THIS MATTER IS CORRECTED AS FOLLOWS: (TABLE OMITTED)
/7/ THE TWO PRIOR FLYERS DEALT WITH PICKETING INFORMATION CONCERNING A PROPOSED PAY CAP AND DEALT WITH MANAGEMENTS CONDUCT AT NEGOTIATIONS.
/8/ I NEED NOT REACH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE CONDUCT WOULD BE PROTECTED IF IT WERE AIMED SOLELY AT PERSONS WHOM THE UNION COULD NOT REPRESENT.
/9/ SECTION 7119 OF THE STATUTE.
/10/ IN ANY EVENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGED DISPARATE TREATMENT, THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH INSTANCES WHERE EMPLOYEES MADE DESK TO DESK DISTRIBUTION OF NON-AGENCY SPONSORED FLIERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE AGENCY DURING WORKING HOURS.
IN THIS REGARD IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MATTERS THAT WERE APPARENTLY DISTRIBUTED BUILDING WIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY THE INTERNAL MAIL SYSTEM.
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY LIMITS THE UNION'S ACCESS TO THE INTERNAL MAIL SYSTEM.
/11/ I REJECT RESPONDENT'S CONTENTION THAT BECAUSE THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES PARK THEIR CARS OR FREQUENT THE EMPLOYEES' PARKING LOT IT COULD LIMIT THE DISTRIBUTION IN THE PARKING LOT.
AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CONDUCT DERIVES THE PROTECTION FROM THE STATUTE NOT BECAUSE IT IS AIMED AT UNIT EMPLOYEES, BUT RATHER BECAUSE IT IS AIMED PRIMARILY AT EMPLOYEES.
/12/ THE RECORD DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THERE WAS ANYTIME DURING THE DAY THAT THERE WERE NOT SOME EMPLOYEES WORKING AND ON DUTY STATUS.
THUS I NEED NOT REACH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER RESPONDENT COULD HAVE RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION OF FLIERS DURING SUCH NON-WORK TIMES TO NON-WORK AREAS.
I NEED NOT DECIDE WHETHER THE STANDARD PRIVATE SECTOR LIMITATION ON DISTRIBUTION TO NON WORK AREAS IN FACTORIES AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES BECAUSE OF WORK DANGER, LITTER, HAZARD, ETC. E.G. STODDARD-QUIRK MFG. CO., 138 NLRB 75(1962) AND REPUBLIC AVIATION CORP. V. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793(1945) WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO AN OFFICE AND CLERICAL OPERATION WHERE PAPERS AND MEMORANDA ABOUND AND ONE MORE PIECE OF PAPER MIGHT NOT EVEN BE NOTICED CF. DEPARTMENT OF NAVY, NAVAL AIR REWORK FACILITY, A/SLMR NO. 513(1975).
