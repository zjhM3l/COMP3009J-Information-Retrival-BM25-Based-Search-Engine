Abstract: The effect of long-term (weeks to months) CO2 enhancement on (a) the gas-exchange characteristics, (b) the content and activation state of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco), and (c) leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll, and dry weight per area were studied in five C3 species (Chenopodium album, Phaseolus vulgaris, Solanum tuberosum, Solanum melongena, and Brassica oleracea) grown at CO2 partial pressures of 300 or 900 to 1000 microbars.
Long-term exposure to elevated CO2 affected the CO2 response of photosynthesis in one of three ways: (a) the initial slope of the CO2 response was unaffected, but the photosynthetic rate at high CO2 increased (S. tuberosum); (b) the initial slope decreased but the CO2-saturated rate of photosynthesis was little affected (C. album, P. vulgaris); (c) both the initial slopes and the CO2-saturated rate of photosynthesis decreased (B. oleracea, S. melongena).
In all five species, growth at high CO2 increased the extent to which photosynthesis was stimulated following a decrease in the partial pressure of O2 or an increase in measurement CO2 above 600 microbars.
This stimulation indicates that a limitation on photosynthesis by the capacity to regenerate orthophosphate was reduced or absent after acclimation to high CO2.
Leaf nitrogen per area either increased (S. tuberosum, S. melongena) or was little changed by CO2 enhancement.
The content of rubisco was lower in only two of the five species, yet its activation state was 19% to 48% lower in all five species following longterm exposure to high CO2.
These results indicate that during growth in CO2-enriched air, leaf rubisco content remains in excess of that required to support the observed photosynthetic rates.

Abstract: The effect of acute ozone exposure of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) on the survivorship, reproduction, and development of the aphid Chaitophorus populicola Thomas (Homoptera: Aphididae) was investigated.
Cottonwoods were exposed to 397 microgram/m3 (0.20 ppm) ozone or charcoal-filtered air and infested with aphids on leaf plastochron index 5, 40 h after fumigation.
Aphid performance was not significantly different on plants exposed to ozone compared with charcoal-filtered air-treated control plants.
These data do not support the notion that aphid performance will directly increase on air pollution-stressed plants.
We also examined settling and feeding preference of aphids for cottonwood leaves of different developmental ages.
Aphids significantly preferred leaf plastochron index 5 to all other leaf ages.
These data support hypotheses relating aphid leaf preference to stages of leaf development.
Reproduction of the cottonwood leaf rust fungus (Melampsora medusae Thum.) and the imported willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora Laicharting) are reduced on ozone-fumigated plants (reported elsewhere).
If aphid populations are affected by competition with these cottonwood pests for leaf resources, then aphid pest potential may actually increase in areas characterized by episodic ozone concentrations because of ozone-induced decreases in populations of M. medusae and P. versicolora.

Abstract: Relative yield losses from O3 have been estimated by the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) using a nonlinear Weibull response model.
The estimated losses were presented in terms of confidence interval estimates based on first-order linear approximations of variances and normality of estimates.
Such interval estimates (Wald estimates) from nonlinear models can be inadequate.
Nine Weibull response equations estimated from NCLAN studies were used to assess the adequacy of Wald confidence interval estimates by comparison with interval estimates based on the likelihood ratio test.
Three response equations from individual studies were used for illustration of second-order adjustments to the Wald estimates and the use of meaures of parameter-effects curvature as flags for cases where linear approximations may be inadequate.
The Wald interval estimates were clearly inadequate in two of the three individual studies, which had been chosen to represent cases most likely to show inadequacy because of limited coverage of the response curve and/or high variability.
In the third study, which had good coverage of the response curve and relatively low variability, the Wald confidence intervals were nearly identical to the likelihood ratio intervals.
Measures of parameter effects curvature identified the two cases where the linear approximation was inadequate and showed whether the second- order adjustments would result in acceptable confidence intervals.
Comparisons suggsted that Wald confidence interval estimates provided satisfactory approximations for NCLAN response curves that had been computed from data involving more than one experiment, and even for individual experiments where there was adequate coverage of the response curve and moderate variability.

Abstract: Polyamine metabolism was examined in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) exposed to a single ozone treatment (5 or 7 hours) and then postcultivated in pollutant-free air.
The levels of free and conjugated putrescine were rapidly increased in the ozone-tolerant cultivar Bel B and remained high for 3 days.
This accumulation was preceded by a transient rise of L-arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19) activity.
The ozone-sensitive cultivar Bel W3 showed a rapid production of ethylene and high levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid after 1 to 2 hours of exposure.
Induction of putrescine levels and ADC activity was weak in this cultivar and was observed when necrotic lesions developed.
Leaf injury occurred in both lines when the molar ratio of putrescine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or ethylene fell short of a certain threshold value.
Monocaffeoyl-putrescine, an effective scavenger for oxyradicals, was detected in the apoplastic fluid of the leaves of cv Bel B and increased upon exposure to ozone.
This extracellular localization could allow scavenging of ozone-derived oxyradicals at the first site of their generation.
Induction of either polyamine or ethylene pathways may represent a control mechanism for inhibition or promotion of lesion formation and thereby contribute to the disposition of plants for ozone tolerance.

Abstract: Chronic O3 stress can limit wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields and kernel quality.
Field studies were conducted at the USDA Beltsville Agric.
Res.
Center (BARC) during 1984 and 1985 to assess the effects of low-level chronic O3 stress during anthesis and kernel fill on soft red winter wheat.
Six O3 treatments, ambient air plot control, charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered air (NF), NF + 20, NF + 40, and NF + 80 nL O3 L(-1), were applied 4 h day-1, 5 day wk-1 beginning 10 d preanthesis through maturity.
Biomass, grain yield, kernel weight, kernels per spike, harvest index, flour protein, alkaline water retention capacity, particle size index, and baking quality of four wheat genotypes were examined at physiological maturity.
Ambient O3 concentrations were higher and environmental conditions were cool and wet in 1984 compared to 1985.
In 1984, NF + 80 nL 03 L-1 treatments significantly reduced all measured characteristics except kernels per spike.
In 1985, significant O3 effects were not observed.
Significant genotype effects were observed in each year with the exception of the harvest index and kernels per spike in 1984.
Polynomial regression analyses indicated a decrease in biomass, grain yield, and kernel weight at accumulative oxidant exposure (AOX) values above 5.1 micro liter L L-1 h.
The results indicate that brief 4-h exposure periods above 60 nL O3 L-1 during anthesis and grain fill can reduce yield and kernel quality.

Abstract: Factors governing long-term change in global temperature are reviewed.
The magnitude and rate of change in global temperature resulting from current increases in the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases are considered in relation to their impact on forests.
Movement in forest zone boundaries at a rate of 2.5 km year-1 are possible, which is nearly ten time the rate forests have been known to move by natural reproduction.
Climate models indicate that increased global temperature will affect rainfall distribution, lead to more frequent and more severe storms and increase climatic variability.
Consequences for the world's forests include increased frequencies of fire and blow-down, and widespread decline.
Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations may increase forest growth where the effect is not offset by reduced precipitation, but the overall effect of anticipated changes in global climate is likely to be widespread loss of forests.

Abstract: The assessment of air quality standards for forest ecosystems requires proper knowledge about concentration-effect relations of air pollutants for tree species.
In this study, 2-yr- old Douglas fir seedlings [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
Franco] were exposed to 23, 81, and 169 microgram O3/m3 during 8 h/d, 5 d/wk for a period of 4 wk.
After exposure, the trees were placed in in atmosphere containing 14CO2.
Release of 14CO2 in the root/soil compartment was analyzed once a day and was regarded as an index of transport and utilization of 14C photosynthates.
Respiratory release of 14C was temporarily inhibited by O3 during the first days following exposure to the air pollutant.
Within 2 wk after the O3 treatment, 14CO2 in the root/soil respiration was the same in all treatments, indicating that trees were recovering from 03 injury.

Abstract: Four-week-old bean plants (cultivar California Light Red Kidney) were spray inoculated with rifampin-resistant Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli to establish a leaf-surface population on one leaf and a lesion on another leaf of each plant.
In one experiment, plants were exposed to 0 or 1 microgram F m-3 (as hydrogen fluoride) continuously or 3 or 5 microgram F m-3 intermittently for 15 days.
In the other experiment, plants were exposed continuously to 0 or 1 microgram F m-3 for 15 days or 3 microgram F m-3 for 5 days or 5 microgram F m-3 for 3 days after inoculation.
Fluoride treatments in both experiments resulted in a total pollutant dose of 15 microgram F m-3 days.
Diameters of lesions were measured and leaves were sampled periodically to determine fluoride accumulation.
Intermittent exposure treatments had no effect on final lesion growth.
However, lesion size and expansion increased linearly with increasing fluoride in foliage.
Intermittent fluoride exposure had no effect on growth of epiphytic populations of the bacterium.
The development of lesions and leaf- surface populations of the pathogen exposed continuously were not affected by the exposure regime or the concentration of fluoride in air or foliage.

Abstract: The process of sexual reproduction in flowering plants oftern exposes pollen grains to the environment and the potential effects fo atmospheric deposition.
Experiments were designed to determine whether simulated acid rain treatments just before or after pollination could adversely influence reproductive processes and seed set in corn (Zea mays L.).
Container-grown corn with sexually mature tassels and ears were exposed once to simulated rain at four pH levels for 1 h, beginning 1 h after artificial pollination or ending 10 min before artificial pollination.
The single, artificial pollination deposited an average of 85 pollen grains per silk.
Simulated rain treatment at pH 4.5, 3.5, or 2.5 after pollination reduced the percentage seed set of treated ears 7, 29, and 34%, respectively, as compared with pH 5.5.
Simulated rain at pH 5.5 after pollination reduced seed set 24% as compared with no-rain controls.
The pH of simulated rain applied before pollination did not affect seed set, and pH 5.5 rain applied before pollination had no effects on seed set compared to no-rain controls.
Microscopic observations indicated that pollen germination and pollen tube penetration of the silk were completed by the time the rain treatments began 1 h after pollination.
This infers that simulated acid rain influenced pollen tubes after they entered the silks.
These results suggest that plant sexual reproduction could be adversely affected by acidic precipitation at pH levels observed for rain events in eastern North America.

Abstract: Nodulated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp. cv Vita 3:Bradyrhizobium CB 756) plants were cultured with their whole root system or crown root nodulation zone maintained for periods from 5 to 69 days after planting in atmospheres containing a range of pO2 (1-80%, v/v) while the rest of the plant grew in normal air.
Growth (dry matter yield) and N2 fixation were largely unaffected by pO2 from 10 to 40%.
Decrease in fixation at pO2 below 5% was due to lower nodulation and nodule mass and, at pO2 above 60%, to a fall in specific N2-fixing activity of nodules.
Root:shoot ratios were significantly lower at pO2 below 2.5%.
The effect of pO2 on nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction), both of whole nodulated root systems and crown root nodulation zones, varied with plant age but was generally lower at supra-and subambient extremes of O2.
H2 evolution showed a sharp optimum at 20% O2 but was at most 4% of total nitrogenase activity.
The ratio of CO2 evolved to substrate (C2H2+H+) reduced by crown root nodulation zones was constant (6 moles CO2 per mole substrate reduced) from 2.5 to 60% O2 but at levels below 2.5 and above 80% O2 reached values between 20 and 30 moles CO2 per mole substrate reduced.
Effects of long-term growth with nonambient pO2 on adaptation and efficiency of functioning of nodules are discussed.

Abstract: Nodulated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp. cv Vita 3: Bradyrhizobium strain CB756) and soybean (Glycine max [L.]
At the extremes of sub- and supra-ambient pO2, the levels of leghemoglobin (Lb) in nodules were reduced.
However, neither the proportional composition of Lb component proteins (eight in soybean, three in cowpea) nor their oxidation state was affected by pO2.
Short-term changes in pO2 (transferring plants grown with sub- or supra- ambient pO2 in the rhizosphere to air or vice versa) caused a significant decline in Lb content and, in cowpea but not soybean, where pO2 was increased, a higher percentage of oxidation of Lb.
Combining data on changes in Lb level of cowpea nodules grown in sub-ambient pO2 With those for their structural adaptation to an under supply of O2 indicated that, despite the nodules having a lower level of Lb, the amount per infected cell was increased by up to twofold and per bacteroid up to fivefold (in those from 1% O2) compared to those grown in air.
Progressive decline in pO2 resulted in a progressive increase on this basis, indicating a close relationship between Lb content and the adaptation of nodule functioning to external O2 level.

Abstract: Treatment of field soil with sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde in 1% concentrations showed that the nodule formation was inhibited on the upper parts of the roots of Peking soybeans.
Sulphorm, a combination of the two previously mentioned substances, applied in the same concentration, did not inhibit nodule formation to a like extent.
No beneficial effects were noticeable in the crops from any of the plats, except with Sulphorm which gave about 20% more seed than was the average of three controls.

Abstract: Mature, field-grown Vitis vinifera L. grapevines grown in opentop chambers were exposed to either charcoal-filtered air or ambient ozone partial pressures throughout the growing season.
individual leaves also were exposed to ozone partial pressures of 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 micropascals per pascal for 5 hours.
No visual ozone damage was found on leaves exposed to any of the treatments.
Chronic exposure to ambient O(3) partial pressures reduced net CO2 assimilation rate (A) between 5 and 13% at various times throughout the season when compared to the filtered treatment.
Exposure of leaves to 0.2 micropascals per pascal O(3) for 5 hours had no significant effect on A; however, A was reduced 84% for leaves exposed to 0.6 micropascals per pascal O(3) when compared to the controls after 5 hours.
Intercellular CO2 partial pressure (cl) was lower for leaves exposed to 0.2 micropascals per pascal O(3) when compared to the controls, while cl of the leaves treated with 0.6 micropascals per pascal of O(3) increased during the fumigation.
The long-term effects of ambient O(3) and short-term exposure to acute levels of O(3) reduced grape leaf photosynthesis due to a reduction in both stomatal and mesophyll conductances.

Abstract: Gas exchange characteristics of loblolly pine seedlings were measured in the third growing season of ozone fumigations to determine the effects of long-term ozone exposure on photosynthetic capacity.
Light and CO2 response curves indicated significant decreases of 21% and 27%, respectively, in light-saturated and CO2- saturated photosynthetic capacities at 2 X ambient ozone (92 ppb 12-hr seasonal mean) compared to charcoal-filtered (CF) air, approximately 0.5 X ambient ozone (29 ppb 12-hr seasonal mean).
Differences in the response curves suggest changes in light- harvesting and biochemical efficiencies as well as changes in the activity of RuBP Carboxylase and the regeneration rate of RuBP.
Chlorophyll and carotenoid conditions per unit leaf area were decreased at the high ozone treatment in older flushes.
Stomatal resistance limited photosynthesis by about 29% in both CF and 2 X ambient ozone treated plants, suggesting that chronic ozone exposure did not affect stomatal control in loblolly pine.

Abstract: Acute SO2 effects on vegetation are less likely because large point sources comply with ambient air quality standards and emission limits.
The remaining concern is for direct effects of SO2, which might occur from exposure to intermittent, subacute dosages.
Limited data exist for assessing chronic effects because experimental exposure regimes used in most effect studies on soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] are from field and laboratory exposure regimes consisting of SO2, NO2, and O3 dosages with a high degree of uncertainty.
Chronic exposure of 'Essex' soybean to 0.06 microliter L-1 (0.06 ppm) O3 for 8 h d-1, 5 d wk-1, for 18 wk in the greenhouse caused a 34% reduction in yield compared to charcoal-filtered air.
Sulfur dioxide in combination with O3 and NO2 caused no additional reduction in yield, but lower dosages of SO2 increased yields compared to The O3 treatment, apparently by retarding O3-induced premature senescence.
Emissions from a power plant had no adverse effect on yield on the cultivar Essex during a 3-yr field study (1981-1983).

Abstract: Glasshouse lettuce (cvs Pascal and Talent) was grown during late autumn and early winter in an atmosphere polluted with nitrogen oxides (NOx) generated from direct-fired natural gas burners used for CO2 enrichment and warm air heating (high CO2 + NOx treatment).
Concentrations of 0.3-0.4 vpm NOx were detected during the daytime when near 3-fold CO2 enrichment (1 000 vpm) was practised without heating.
In cold weather, the CO2 and NOx levels were dependent on the amount of heating required to maintain minimum temperatures of 5 degrees C (night) and 7 degrees C (day).
Concentrations of between 2000-5000 vpm CO2 and 1-2.5 vpm NOx were recorded at night during an intensely cold period in early January just prior to sampling for leaf enzymes.
The plants were compared with those grown in unpolluted atmospheres with either a natural (340 vpm) or an enriched level (1000 vpm) of CO2.
Pascal grown in elevated CO2 had less activity per g fresh weight of RuBPx (E.C. 4.1.1.39), 3PGA phosphokinase (E.C. 2.7.2.3) and NADP-G3P dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.13) than plants grown in a normal ambient CO2 atmosphere.
The cytoplasmic enzyme PEPc (E.C. 4.1.1.31) was not significantly affected by the pure CO2 enrichment.
With high CO2 + NOx the activities of the Calvin cycle enzymes were restored to values close to those present in non-enriched plants, while the activity of PEPc was increased.
The activity of nitrite reductase (NiR) (E.C. 1.7.7.1) was increased in Pascal and Talent by high CO2 + NOx. Immunoblotting techniques were used to show that the increase in activity of this enzyme was accompanied by an increase in the steady-state concentrations of the protein.
Only one molecular form of NiR was detected by immunoblotting, and it would appear that the 'induction' of NiR activity resulted from increased net enzyme synthesis rather than activation of pre-existing enzyme.
At the time of sampling no visible damage by high CO2 + NOx was evident and the lack of symptoms may have been assoc

Abstract: Most field studies relating seasonal ozone (O3) exposure to crop yield have been performed in the absence of plant moisture stress.
Loss estimates from such studies may be too large if moisture stress, which occurs during most growing seasons, decreases plant sensitivity to O3.
Thus, we examined the response of a mixture of ladino clover (Trifolium repens L. 'Regal') and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.
'Kentucky 31')to chronic doses of O3 at two soil-moisture levels over two growing seasons.
The mixture was seeded on 15 September 1983 and exposed to six levels of O3 in open-top chambers for 12-hr day-1 from 26 April to 18 October in 1984 and from 13 April to 22 October in 1985.
The six seasonal 12-hr day-1 mean O3 conce ntrations ranged from 0.025 to 0.092 microliter L-1.
The soil-moisture treatments, obtained by differential irrigation, were well-watered or water-stressed.
A soil-moisture deficit occurred intermittently in water-stressed plots during both season.
Shoots were harvested when plants reached a height of 20-25 cm.
Total forage (clover and fescue) yield in the water-stressed plots (O3 levels combined) was 12% less than that in the well-watered plots in 1984 and 14% less in 1985.
Clover was much more sensitive than fescue to O3.
Ozone-induced suppression of clover growth was accompanied by an increase in fescue growth, and these effects increased as the O3 level increased.
There was a statistically significant interaction between soil moisture and plant response to O3 only in 1985.
This effect probably occurred because clover growth exceeded fescue growth only in the charcoal- filtered air (CF) well-watered treatment.
There were no significant effects of soil moisture on response to O3 when CF was eliminated from the analysis of variance.
Over the two seasons, estimated effects of ambient levels of O3 (2-yr seasonal 12-hr day-1 mean of 0.046 microliter L-1) were a 10% decrease in total forage yield, a 19% decrease in clover yield, and a 19% incr

Abstract: Patterns of carbon allocation and mycorrhizal colonization were examined in loblolly pine seedlings from two half-sib families exposed to three ozone treatments (charcoal- filtered air, ambient air + 80 ppb O3, and ambient air + 160 ppb O3) and three rain pH levels (5.2, 4.5, and 3.3) for 12 week, in open-topped chambers in a field setting.
No statistically significant effects of ozone or rain pH were detected on biomass, root:shoot ratios, or carbon allocation; some consistent patterns were observed, however.
Coarse root starch concentrations and mycorrhizal infection varied significantly with ozone levels, No significant interactions of ozone, rain pH, or genotype were detected.

Abstract: Although red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) are important crops in the northeast, little is known about their responses to air pollution in the field.
A crop of red clover and timothy was exposed to O3 and SO2, both alone and in combination, in open-top chambers to evaluate effects on yield.
Ozone treatments were charcoal-filtered air, nonfiltered air, and nonfiltered air to which O3 was added to maintain concentrations 1.5 and 2.0 times ambient.
Sulfur dioxide treatments were ambient and three levels of addition that ?simulated the concentrations and dynamics of exposures near point sources of the pollutant.
Yield was based on the total biomass obtained in two harvests each year.
Two studies were conducted in consecutive years.
Sulfur dioxide had no effect on yield and there were no interactions between the pollutants in either study.
In the first year, O3 produced no effects on timothy but reduced the yield of clover and, consequently, the yield of the combined species.
Red clover was less prevalent in the stand in the second year and O3 had no detectable impact on the yield of clover or on total yield since the stand was dominated by the O3-resistant timothy.
The two studies indicated that effect of O3 on yield was a function of both the concentration of the pollutant and the relative O3-sensitivity and prevalence in the stand of the component species.

Abstract: Pitch pine seedlings (Pinus rigida Mill.) were fumigated with O3 or SO2 to determine their effects on growth and symptom expression.
Seedlings fumigated twice with 0.20 microliter O3L-1 for 4 hr at age 14 and 22 wk had significantly greater shoot weight than those fumigated with 0.30 microliter O3L-01; 0, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.15 microliter L-1 were intermediate and not significantly different.
Root starch content tended to decrease with increasing O3 with control seedlings being significantly higher than the 0.15, 0.20, and 0.30 microliter O3L-1 treatments.
Root starch of seedlings treated with 0.20, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, and 0.90 microliter SO2L-1 was significantly lower than the controls.
Seedlings from six families fumigated for 5 wk starting at age 6 wk differed in direction and degree of growth response when exposed to 0.08 and 0.30 microliter O3L-1.
Significant differences exited among families for needle weight, shoot weight, and total weight.
No differences were found among O3 treatments within a family, but patterns suggest some pitch pine individuals may be sensitive to low O3 while others are stimulated.
Visible injury consisted of light chlorotic mottle on oldest needles.
Discriminant function analysis indicated that growth responses were indistinguishable among families receiving no treatment; however, treated seedlings could be classified based on various height measurements and/or shoot weight.
Differences in visible injury were apparent among families of seedlings treated with 0.40 microliter O3L-1, indicating some pitch pine families are more sensitive to O3 than others.

Abstract: Nitrogen and phenolic concentrations and the in vitro digestibility were determined,for cell walls isolated from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. cv S23) exposed to SO2 under laboratory conditions or collected from farms located within each of four pollution zones distributed over England and Wales.
In laboratory-exposed herbage, cell wall digestibility increased with increasing exposure concentrations of SO2 and was apparently correlated with decreases in cell wall nitrogen content.
Cell wall digestibility was decreased in herbage collected from farms within the two higher pollution zones without any correlation with cell wall nitrogen concentrations.
In both laboratory-exposed and farm- collected herbage digestibility was unrelated to cell wall Phenolic concentrations, but this may be an artefact of sample preparation.
The cis,cis- and trans,trans- isomers of both diferulic and di-p- coumaric acids were detected.
Concentrations of these dimers generally increased with increasing exposure concentrations of SO2 under laboratory conditions, but decreased, showing a quadratic effect, with increasing levels of ambient pollution.
Treatment of cell walls with NaOH also released several compounds tentatively identified as cutin acid-like, whose concentrations increased in ryegrass exposed to SO2 in the laboratory but decreased in response to ambient pollution.

Abstract: Artificial augmentation of soybean leaves with reduced glutathione (GSH) elicited all of the same reponses from Mexican bean beetle (MBB), Epilachna varivestis Mulsant, as did fumigation with the air pollutant sulfur dioxide.
Larval growth, rate of development, and survivorship as well as adult fecundity and longevity were all significantly greater on excised leaves that had been allowed to imbile a solution of the tripeptide.
In addition, adults showed a strong preference for feeding on the treated leaves over nontreated leaves.
Increased fecundity after feeding on treated leaves was a consequence of the earlier and longer period of egg laying rather than a change in the rate of egg production.
The effects of GSH treatment were even more distinct than those produced by exposure of plants to the pollutant.
These results establish the very close correlation between changes in foliar glutathione and alteration of MBB success on this plant in response to air pollution.

Abstract: Deposition of atmospheric nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia, is postulated to have a variety of deleterious effects, including damage to soils, trees and other vegetation.
We report here that fumigation of coniferous trees in the open air with sulphur dioxide (13 and 22 p.p.b.-parts in 10(9) by volume) produced an increased deposition of atmospheric NH3 to foliage.
A mechanism for co-deposition of NH3 and SO2 to wet surfaces has been suggested.
As concentrations of NH3 at the site are not unusually high (annual mean, 4 p.p.b.), this mechanism may enhance nitrogen deposition over large areas of Europe.
It may also account for some results of experimental fumigations previously attributed to SO2 alone.

Abstract: Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] obtains required N from the soil via root uptake of mineralized organic matter and fertilizer, and from the air by symbiotic gaseous N2 fixation and ammonia (NH3) absorption.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate environmental and tillage effects on dynamic N transport under conservation (NT) and clean tillage (CT) management systems.
Soil, plant, and microclimate measurements were made concurrently with estimates of gaseous N2 (using 15N2 techniques) and NH3 uptake from the atmosphere.
Soybean growth and N uptake characteristics were similar in both tillage systems, except during a 14-d drought period, which caused water stress in the CT system, but not the NT system.
Nitrogen fixation decreased in the CT system, to less than half that of the NT system fixation rate, resulting in a seasonal reduction of 29% in the CT system.
Net NH3 transport varied from net absorption by the canopy during periods of adequate soil water to net evolution by the CT system during the drought-stress period.
Intergration of the net NH3 flux density curves indicated that approximately 3% of the NT system and less than 1% of the CT system plant N was derived from the atmosphere.
Also during the drought- stress period, there was a net loss of plant N to the soil in the CT system indicated by soil and plant mass balance.
Insect infestation was much greater in the NT system, reflecting insects' preference for a higher N crop, resulting in a significant N removal from the system.
This study showed that soybean in these systems decreased soil N by about the amount of harvested N yield.

Abstract: The effects of night-time temperature, leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and water stress on CO2 recycling in Bromelia humilis Jacq. grown under two light and nitrogen regimes were investigated.
At night-time temperatures above 30 degrees C, integrated net dark CO2 uptake was severely reduced and CO2 for malate synthesis was mainly derived from dark respiration.
At 35 degrees C, up to 84% of the CO2 liberated by dark respiration was refixed into malic acid.
Below 30 degrees C only nitrogen deficient plants showed significant recycling.
No significant differences were observed between high and low light grown plants in CO2 recycling.
A doubling of leaf-to-air VPD from 7.46 Pa kPa-1 to 15.49 Pa kPa-1 resulted in a 2- to 20-fold decrease in leaf conductance and about 50 to 65% reduction in integrated dark CO2 uptake.
However, about twice as much CO2 was recycled at the higher VPD as in the lower.
Ten days of water stress resulted in 80 to 100% recycling of respiratory CO2.
Under high VPD and water stress treatments, the amount of water potentially saved through recycling of CO2 reached 2- to 6-fold of the actual transpiration.
In general, nitrogen deficient plants had higher per cent recycling of respiratory CO2 in response to high night-time temperature, increased VPD or water stress.
The results emphasize the ecological relevance of carbon recycling in CAM plants.

Abstract: Literature data on nitrogen concentration of five fine roots (less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter) in forest communities were analyzed by multiple linear regression.
After appropriate transformations, root diameter, minimum monthly mean temperature, forest origin, and forest type together accounted for 93.2% of variation in N concentration.
We suggest the following possible ecological bases: fine-root N concentration (1) was negatively related to root diameter because of increased percent old tissue and structural material with root size, (2) was negatively related to minimum monthly mean temperature because of a combined effect of soil available N, root absorption capacity, and carbon production, and/or because of selection pressure of cold winter on the genetic trait of higher N in fine roots, (3) was lighter in plantations than in natural stands because of species and site selections and management history, and (4) was lighter in broad-leaved than needle-leaved forests because of different N cycling rates.

Abstract: The pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), was reared on the bolls of cotton plants grown in CO2-enriched (649 ul/liter) and ambient CO2 (371 ul/liter) chambers and in two open field plots, one with free-air CO2 enrichment (522 ul/liter) and one without enrichment (ambient CO2, 360 ul/liter).
The effects of increased CO2 levels on growth and development were examined.
There was no difference in pupal weights of pink bollworm raised on CO2- enriched cotton compared with those raised on ambient CO2 cotton (26.80 versus 26.64 mg, respectively).
Also, there was no difference in developmental time (21-27 d).
Analysis of percent seed damage by larvae showed no differences between CO2-enriched and ambient CO2 cotton.
These results were attributed to the nutritional qualities of the seed remaining the same (specifically the carbon/nitrogen ratio) despite CO2 and photosynthetic changes in the plant.

Abstract: Cultivars of crop plants can differ widely in their susceptibilities to yield losses induced by the air pollutant ozone (O3), but relatively little is known of the physiological mechanisms that account for these differences.
Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars differ in degree of determinance, which may affect cultivar responses to O3 through effects on rates of maturation of the cultivars.
Four cultivars of cotton grown in the field on a Hanford coarse sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, Thermic Xerorthents) were exposed to three levels of O3 in open-top chambers to determine their relative susceptibility to O3 and to relate differences in susceptibility to morphological and physiological characteristics of the cultivars.
Susceptibility to O3-induced yield losses in these cultivars was directly correlated with degree of determinance so that cultivar rank in order of both increasing determinance and susceptibility to O3 was: SJ-2 
Differences among the cultivars in susceptibility to O3 were not associated with differences in rates of stomatal conductance.
Instead, determinate cultivars appeared to be more susceptible to O3 because periods of peak flowering and boll set coincided with periods of high O3 concentration.
Also, indeterminate cultivars appeared to have greater flexibility in altering branching patterns in response to O3-induced leaf abscission than did determinate lines.
Since most high-yielding, short-season cotton cultivars have a determinate growth habit, these results suggest that production from short-season cotton cultivars may be limited by the prevalence of O3 air pollution in many cotton-growing regions of the USA.

Abstract: Recent field research has shown that ambient concentrations of ozone (O3) have the potential to reduce yield of a number of economically important crop species.
Soil water levels have been shown sometimes to modify the extent of the reduction.
The primary emphasis of most of these studies has been on the plant component that represents economic yield.
Less emphasis has been placed on characterization of the effects of O3 on growth of the total plant that ultimately determines yield.
In this study, we measured season-long growth of field-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. 'McNair-235') that was exposed to a range of O3 concentrations of two levels of soil moisture, well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS).
The cotton was exposed for 12 h d-1 throughout the growing season in open-top chambers to five O3 concentrations that ranged from 0.020 to 0.074 microliter L-1 (seasonal mean 12 h d-1 concentration).
Three cotton plants were sampled from each chamber at 2- to 3-wk intervals during the season, and biomass and growth measurements were made on all major plant parts.
Ozone stress reduced leaf and root biomass in particular, while stem tissues were less affected.
Partitioning of biomass among plant tissues was affected by O3 at certain times during the season.
Leaf area duration (LAD) was reduced by O3 in both WW and WS treatments, but changes in the yield/LAD ratio and net assimilation rate indicated that reduced efficiency of leaves also was responsible for yield reductions in the WW plots.
Water stress caused fewer significant effects overall than did O3 although it appeared to reduce the growth of most plant parts, especially at low O3 concentrations.
There were no significant O3 x water interactions for the growth variables measured.

Abstract: One-year-old seedlings of red spruce were exposed too O3 (less than or equal to 0.025 or 0.10 microliter l-1, 4 h d-1, 3 d wk-1) in combination with simulated rain (pH 5.6 or 3.0, 1 h d-1, 2 d wk-1, 0.75 cm h-1) for 10 weeks.
After pollutant treatments, seedlings were subjected to two successive drought cycles.
Whole- plant fresh weight increment (FWT) and dry weight were reduced after O3 exposure, whereas FWT and shoot height growth were increased after simulated rain exposure at pH 3.0 compared to pH 5.6.
No interaction between O3 and rain treatments was observed for any growth variable measured.
Foliar concentrations of K and S were greater in seedlings exposed to simulated rain at pH 3.0 compared with those at pH 5.6.
Root hydraulic conductivity was highest in seedlings exposed to 0.10 microliter l-1 O3 + pH 3.0 rain solution compared with all other treatments after the first drought cycle.
There were no significant O3 effects on net photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration or water-use efficiency prior to the drought cycles.
However, during the second drought cycle, Pn was more sensitive to branch water potential in seedlings exposed to 0.10 microliter l-1 O3 + pH 3.0 solution compared with seedlings exposed to low O3 + pH 5.6 solution.

Abstract: Nine-week-old green (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.)
and white (F. americana L.) ash were exposed to O3 and/or SO2 (control, 0.10 ppm O3, 0.08 ppm SO2, or 0.10 ppm O3 + 0.08 ppm SO2) for 4 h d-1, 5 d wk-1 in combination with simulated rain (pH 3.0, 4.3 or 5.6, 1 h d-1, 2 d wk-1 at 0.75 cm h-1) for 6 weeks, under controlled laboratory conditions, with rain applied either just before or after fumigation.
Across all rain treatments, white ash biomass was suppressed by the application of O3 and cumulative shoot elongation of green ash exposed to O3 and/or SO2 was less than controls.
The combination of O3 + SO2 did not affect the growth of either species more than the pollutants applied alone.
Leaf area ratio (LAR) and root to shoot ratio (RSR) exhibited quadratic responses to rain pH in green ash, across all pollutant treatments.
Significant pollutant X pH interactions occurred in leaf weight ratio (LWR) in green ash and LAR and RSR in white ash.
Significant linear increases in LAR and decreases in RSR, with decreasing pH, were observed for O3 and SO3-treated white ash.
These findings are discussed relative to implications of the effects of gaseous pollutants in combination with acid rain on green and white ash growth.

Abstract: Barley plants were grown in nutrient solution at two contrasting nitrate concentrations to produce plants of low or high nitrogen (N) status.
Leaves were then exposed continuously to either 0.3 mm3 dm-3 NO2 or clean air, with the roots and rooting medium isolated from the polluted air.
Uptake of NO2 was measured in two ways; as depletion from an air stream containing the gas and using 15N-labelled NO2.
Results from the two methods agreed well and demonstrated that the flux of NO2 into the leaves of N- deficient barley was lower than that of N-sufficient plants.
Nevertheless, the relative contribution of 15N derived from 15NO2 to the N status of the plant was greater in the plants supplied with low nitrate.
A major factor in regulating NO2 uptake by barley leaves appeared to be stomatal conductance, although internal conductance may also be involved.
The effects of NO2 exposure of barley on carbon dioxide exchange rates, transpiration and water vapour conductance were also influenced by the N status of the plant.

Abstract: Sensitive (Poinsett) and insensitive (Ashley) cultivars of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were grown for four weeks from planting in unshaded greenhouses at 0 or 12.2 KJ m-1 day-1 of biologically effective ultraviolet-B (UV-B(BE)) radiation.
The latter irradiance corresponded to a decrease in stratospheric ozone of ca 20% for clear sky conditions at Beltsville, MD on 21 June.
The diamine putrescine and the polyamine spermidine accumulated in cotyledon and leaf tissues in response to UV-B radiation in both cultivars, but levels were not correlated with sensitivity to UV-B. Lipid peroxidation, as quantified by measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), was increased by UV-B exposure.
Significant cultivar differences were observed, with increases in lipid peroxidation in both cotyledons and leaves being correlated with UV-B sensitivity.
Determination of membrane lipid composition indicated slight decreases in the unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios as a result of UV-B exposure.
In general, Poinsett had a lower unsaturated/saturated ratio of fatty acids than did Ashley.
These results indicate that membrane lipids may be a target of UV-B damage and that differences in the UV-B susceptibility of these two cultivars may involve differences in lipid metabolism.
Polyamine accumulation in response to UV-B radiation stress is consistent with similar responses to other environmental stressors.

Abstract: Exposure of leaves to SO2 or bisulfite is known to induce peroxidation of thylakoid lipids and to inhibit photosynthetic electron transport.
In the present study, we have examined the temporal relationship between bisulfite-induced thylakoid lipid peroxidation and inhibition of electron transport in an attempt to clarify the primary mechanism of SO2 phytotoxicity.
Primary leaves of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Kinghorn) were floated on a solution of NaHSO3, and the effects of this treatment on photosynthetic electron transport were determined in vivo by measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence induction and in vitro by biochemical measurements of the light reactions using isolated thylakoids.
Lipid peroxidation in treated leaves was followed by monitoring ethane emission from leaf segments and by measuring changes in fatty acid composition and lipid fluidity in isolated thylakoids.
A 1 hour treatment with bisulfite inhibited photosystem II (PSII) activity by 70% without modifying Photosystem I, and this inhibitory effect was not light-dependent.
By contrast, lipid peroxidation was not detectable until after the inhibition of PSII and was strongly light dependent.
This temporal separation of events together with the differential effect of light suggests that bisulfite-induced inhibition of PSII is not a secondary effect of lipid peroxidation and that bisulfite acts directly on one or more components of PSII.

Abstract: Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Bannock), rice (Oryza sativa L. cv IR-36), and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr cv Essex) were grown in a factorial greenhouse experiment to determine if CO2-induced increases in photosynthesis, biomass, and yield are modified by increases in ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation corresponding to stratospheric ozone depletion.
The experimental conditions simulated were: (a) an increase in CO2 concentration from 350 to 650 microliters per liter; (b) an increase in UV-B radiation corresponding to a 10% ozone depletion at the equator; and (c) a and b in combination.
Seed yield and total biomass increased significantly with elevated CO2 in all three species when compared to the control.
However, with concurrent increases in UV-B and CO2, no increase in either seed yield (wheat and rice) or total biomass (rice) was observed with respect to the control.
In contrast, CO2- induced increases in seed yield and total plant biomass were maintained or increased in soybean within the elevated CO2, UV-B environment.
Whole leaf gas exchange indicated a significant increase in photosynthesis, apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and water-use-efficiency (WUE) with elevated CO2 in all 3 species.
including elevated UV-B radiation with high CO2 eliminated the effect of high CO2 on photosynthesis and WUE in rice and the increase in AQE associated with high CO2 in all species.
Elevated CO2 did not change the apparent carboxylation efficiency (ACE) in the three species although the combination of elevated CO2 and UV-B reduced ACE in wheat and rice.
The results of this experiment illustrate that increased UV-B radiation may modify CO2-induced increases in biomass, seed yield and photosynthetic parameters and suggest that available data may not adequately characterize the potential effect of future, simultaneous changes in CO2 concentration and UV-B radiation.

Abstract: Leaf gas exchange was measured in maize (Zea mays L.) plants that had been exposed continuously for a period of 4 wk to a range of SO2 concentrations applied in fumigation chambers.
Exposure to a constant SO2 level of 43 and 71 nLL-1 induced a decrease in the apparent photosynthesis and quantum yield, and an increase in the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in comparison to the charcoal-air filtered controls.
This would suggest that the reduction in photosynthesis observed was mainly due to nonstomatal components, i.e., the direct effect of SO2 on the mesophyll.

Abstract: The benzoxazinones occur in hydroxamic acid and lactam forms in maize (Zea mays L.) tissue.
The hydroxamic acid forms which possess a N-hydroxyl group are found in the highest concentration while the lactam members which lack the N-hydroxyl group occur in lower concentrations.
The hydroxamic acid 2,4- dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIBOA) has as its lactam counterpart 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA).
An enzyme has been identified in maize microsomal preparations which catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of HBOA to form DIBOA.
The enzyme is initially observed in seedlings 2 days after imbibition which coincides with the onset of hydroxamic acid accumulation.
The enzyme requires NADPH and is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, NADP, cytochrome c, cations, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen gas.
The effect of nitrogen can be reversed by exposing the enzyme to air, while the effect of carbon monoxide can be reversed by exposing the enzyme to 450 nanometer light during the incubation period.
The apparent Km values for HBOA and NADPH are 13 and 5 micromolar, respectively.
The pH optimum is 7.5 and the temperature optimum for the enzyme is 35 degrees C.
A 450 nanometer absorbance peak is observed when reduced microsomal preparations are exposed to carbon monoxide which in combination with other data presented supports the hypothesis that the enzyme is a cytochrome P-450 dependent N- monooxygenase.

Abstract: Methane and nitrous oxide are long-lived, radiatively active trace gases that account for approximately 20% of the total anticipated atmospheric warming.
The atmospheric concentrations of both gases have increased dramatically over the past few decades, and continue to increase at a rate of approximately 1.1 and 0.25% yr-1 for CH4 (ref. 2) and N2O (ref. 3) respectively.
Increased biospheric production is generally suggested as the reason for the increases, but decreases in global sinks may also be important.
It has been suggested, for example, that nitrogen fertilization may decrease the rate at which tropical and temperate forest soil take up methane from the atmosphere.
Furthermore, the recent extensive changes in land management and cultivation could be contributing to the observed increases in both atmospheric CH4 and N2O as has been suggested for tropical soils.
Little information exists on CH4 uptake in temperate grasslands (which currently occupy approximately 8% of the Earth's surface), its relation to N2O production, or the effect of land management or cultivation.
Here we report measurements of CH4 uptake and N2O emissions in native, nitrogen-fertilized and wheat-growing prairie soils from spring to late autumn, 1990.
We found that nitrogen fertilization and cultivation can both decrease CH4 uptake and increase N2O production, thereby contributing to the increasing atmospheric concentrations of these gases.

Descriptors: Soil organic matter; Decomposition; Carbon dioxide; Air pollution
Abstract: One effect of global warming will be to accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, thereby releasing CO2 to the atmosphere, which will further enhance the warming trend.
Such a feedback mechanism could be quantitatively important, because CO2 is thought to be responsible for approximately 55% of the increase in radiative forcing arising from anthropogenic emissions of gases to the atmosphere, and there is about twice as much carbon in the top metre of soil as in the atmosphere.
Here we use the Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic matter in soil to calculate the amount of CO2 that would be released from the world stock of soil organic matter if temperatures increase as predicted, the annual return of plant debris to the soil being held constant.
If world temperatures rise by 0.03 degrees C yr-1 (the increase considered as most likely by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we estimate that the additional release of CO2 from soil organic matter over the next 60 years will be 61 X 10(15) gC.
This is approximately 19% of the CO2 that will be released by combustion of fossil fuel during the next 60 years if present use of fuel continues unabated.

Abstract: The mechanism of SO2-induced changes in stomatal conductance (g) of alder was examined to determine if SO2 affects guard cell function directly or indirectly through the SO2-induced changes in photosynthesis.
During experimental fumigations at SO2 concentrations of 3.3 micromole m-3 (0.08 microliter l-1), stomatal closure preceded declines in net photosynthetic rate (A), indicating that SO2 can directly affect guard cells.
From these and other studies it appears that the sequence of A and g responses may be influenced by SO2 concentration as well as by species.
Fumigation with SO2 did not cause increases in g, even when the intercellular substomatal CO2 concentration (ci) was reduced by 50 micromole mol-1.
Increases in g are not attributable to SO2 effects on the CO2-based stomatal control system.

Abstract: The National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) began in 1980 to coordinate research on the impact of ozone (O3) on agricultural crops.
During a 7-yr period, the program investigated 14 crops at sites across the country in a total of 41 studies.
A major objective was to develop dose-response relationships between yield of major agricultural crop species and ozone pollution in order to estimate the economic impact of ozone pollution.
This paper outlines the statistical methodologies used in combining the dose-response information for each species over all NCLAN studies, and summarizes the ozone dose-response relationships obtained.
Differences in experimental designs, treatment combinations, and levels of ozone across studies invalidated the conventional analysis of variance approach to combining information across studies.
Regression analyses, with weighted least squares and transformations as needed, were used.
Dose-response relationships between yield and ozone were quantified with the nonlinear Weibull response equation and with confidence interval estimates of percentage yield losses.
Significant yield losses from ozone were found for 13 of 14 crops studied.
The nature of the yield response to ozone differed among crops with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] being the most sensitive and showing a nearly linear response.
Losses from ozone at 0.06 microliters L-1 compared with 0.025 microliters L-1 were estimated as high as 20%.
The impact of ozone was shown to be affected by level of moisture stress but not by SO2.
