Principal Investigator: Dennis Fitz.
University of California, Riverside.
1996.
93-339.
Objectives: To evaluate an ARB two-week sampler for nitric and acetic acid interferences, stability of collected formic and acetic acid, and the feasibility of short-duration (24-hour) sampling.
The sampler is used to provide exposure data on acidic gases and fine particles for the Children's Health Study (A033-186, see the Health Effects section).
Findings: Overall, this study verified that the two-week sampler is operating as expected in complex atmospheres.
Laboratory tests confirmed that PAN and nitrous acid were capable of interfering with nitric acid measurements.
However, field tests performed in ambient air indicated that the sampler measured nitric acid in good agreement with nylon filters.
Laboratory tests also confirmed that PAN was capable of interfering with acetic acid.
Field tests showed that up to 20 percent of total acetate measured may be due to PAN. Formic and acetic acid were retained with good stability.
Laboratory and field tests indicated that the two-week sampler can be operated for periods as short as 24 hours.
Importance to ARBs Program: Understanding of the effects of nitrous acid on nitric acid monitoring and PAN on nitric and acetic acid monitoring can lead to improvements in the measurement of these acidic gases.
Confirmation of the stability of formic and acetic acids leads to increased confidence in related measurements.
Short-term (24-hour) sampling may be important for future health study needs in the area of microenvironmental sampling, especially for capturing transient events or determining indoor/outdoor ratios of acidic gases and fine particles.

STUDY TO EVALUATE THE CADMP SAMPLER.
University of California, Riverside.
1996.
93-333.
Objectives: To perform a comprehensive evaluation of nitric acid losses in the ARB's California Acid Deposition Monitoring Program (CADMP) sampler and quantify denuder and cyclone efficiency, so that the accuracy of the nitrate and nitric acid measurements could be assessed.
Findings: The results of this study show that the CADMP sampler, when reconditioned annually and cleaned somewhat more frequently, is useful in measuring nitric acid concentrations.
However, the values recorded will be 10 to 20 percent lower than actual values because nitric acid adheres to the walls and the denuders do not remove all the nitric acid or permit all the nitrate-containing particles to pass.
This project has provided an effective test of the CADMP sampler in a series of field and laboratory evaluations.
Importance to ARBs Program: At many locations, nitric acid is the largest component of total nitrogen deposition.
Therefore, accurate measurement of nitric acid is critical.
This project has provided an effective test of the CADMP sampler in a series of field and laboratory evaluations.
The results of this study have provided information regarding accurate measurement of nitric acid.

A REVIEW OF NITRIC ACID MEASUREMENTS BY TDLAS.
University of California, Riverside.
1995.
93-340.
Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements made during the ARB's 1993 Azusa nitric acid study.
Also, to determine, through analysis of existing data, whether there were systematic errors in the TDLAS sampling method that contributed to the discrepancies between its results and those of other nitric acid samplers.
Findings: The TDLAS nitric acid time profiles, based on data from 1993 and other years, showed no evidence of a nitric acid adsorption/desorption process occurring along the TDLAS sampling line or of nitric acid vaporization from particles on the TeflonÃ¢ front filter, when compared with concurrent ozone and PAN profiles.
Further, no errors in TDLAS calibration were found.
It may be that a satisfactory explanation of the large discrepancies among nitric acid measurements from various samplers will require controlled experimentation to directly measure differing losses that occur in the sampling lines.
Importance to ARBs Program: As part of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, concentrations of acidic pollutants are measured in ambient air.
TDLAS sampling has been considered as a reference method for evaluating these measurements.
Results from this study will ensure the accuracy of the TDLAS method if it is used as a reference method for monitoring nitric acid concentrations in the atmosphere.

MEASUREMENT OF NITRIC ACID BY TUNABLE DIODE LASER ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY.
Unisearch Associates, Incorporated.
1994.
93-300.
Objectives: To measure concentrations of nitric acid in Azusa continuously during October 1993.
Data was used to evaluate an ARB study of nitric acid measurements by the CADMP sampler and a new two-week sampler constructed for the Board's long-term epidemiology study (A033-186, see the Health Effects section).
The CADMP sampler has shown anomalous measurements of nitric acid.
Findings: Data were collected and the one-minute averages were compiled into hourly, daily (10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.), and 24-hour averages.
Importance to ARBs Program: The data were used by ARB to assess the performance of the Azusa CADMP sampler and the two-week sampler.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MODULAR SYSTEM FOR ACIDIC DEPOSITION MONITORING.
University of California, Davis.
1993.
A132-102.
Objectives: To develop and test a simple and inexpensive monitoring system for measuring concentrations of acidic gases and particles deposited in a dry state in remote field sites (e.g., forests).
Findings: A large part of this project involved establishing comparability between the UCD Modular System for Acid Deposition Monitoring (MSAM) and the existing California Acid Deposition Monitoring Program (CADMP) sampler before considering large-scale statewide deployment of MSAM.
Importance to ARBs Program: This long-term monitoring program will advance the ARB's understanding of the potential for long-term, cumulative damage to forest vegetation and soils due to dry deposition of acidic gases and particles.

DETERMINATION OF ACIDIC GAS AND PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS IN OPEN-TOP FIELD CHAMBERS.
U.S. Forest Service.
1993.
A132-174.
Objectives: To measure concentrations of gaseous and particulate air pollutants in open-top field chambers used to expose seedlings of ponderosa pine to acidic rain and ozone.
This was a companion study to a larger effort to evaluate the combined effects of acidic rain and ozone on water vapor and carbon dioxide uptake in ponderosa pine (A132-101 - 8,215K).
Findings: Daytime average concentrations of nitric and nitrous acid are typical of levels reported in other studies across the United States and Canada.
Importance to ARBs Program: The data will be used, as part of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, to calculate estimates of nitrogen deposition, which may be a factor contributing to the variability in plant responses to ozone.
These data have also provided an indication of acidic pollutant levels in urban areas in northern California.

1994.
A932-138.
Objectives: To estimate the number of fish populations in the Sierra Nevada that could be damaged by chemical pollution.
Also, to conduct field experiments on the acid sensitivity of golden trout.
Findings: About 900 of an estimated 1,400 high-elevation lakes were found to contain trout populations.
Golden trout embryos were in the stage of development most likely to encounter episodic acidification during snowmelt.
This study found that these embryos can tolerate pH levels to about 4.5 - about the same as for other species.
Importance to ARBs Program: The findings will be used to develop indicators capable of detecting changes in aquatic ecosystems and, as required by the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, to establish the economic value of the loss of fisheries and recreation.

AQUATIC AMPHIBIANS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA: CURRENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ACID DEPOSITION ON POPULATIONS.
University of California, Los Angeles.
1993.
A932-139.
Objectives: Several species of amphibians were studied as potential indicators of adverse ecological effects of acidic deposition in the Sierra Nevada.
Findings: In a survey of high-elevation sites, no relationships were detected between water characteristics during snowmelt and the distribution of declining and non-declining amphibian species.
Complementary laboratory toxicity tests indicated that amphibian species in the Sierra Nevada are at little risk from high acidity (pH 
However, sublethal effects observed in these tests may represent long-term threats to amphibian populations.
Importance to ARBs Program: Results were used to determine the role of atmospheric deposition on the decline of amphibians in the Sierra, in fulfillment of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program.

LONG-TERM STUDIES OF LAKES AND WATERSHEDS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA, PATTERNS AND PROCESSES OF SURFACE-WATER ACIDIFICATION.
University of California, Santa Barbara.
1993.
A932-060.
Objectives: To assess potential effects of atmospheric acidic deposition on the hydrology, hydrochemistry, and zooplankton of seven high-altitude Sierran catchments.
Findings: The snow in these catchments was slightly acidic.
The acidity is attributed to weak organic acids and strong acids of nitrate and sulfate.
Weathering and soil processes in the catchments are sufficient to buffer current acidic atmospheric deposition on an annual basis.
Zooplankton species known to be intolerant of acidification occur in all seven lakes, and their presence is evidence that Sierran lakes are not currently showing chronic biological effects of acidic deposition.
Importance to ARBs Program: These data will be compared with those obtained from future monitoring studies to determine trends in deposition, water quality, and biological populations in considering the need for a standard to protect aquatic ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada.

1992.
A932-076.
Objectives: To determine whether the Alpine Lake forecaster, developed to predict the alkalinity of Emerald Lake and its inlet streams during snowmelt, could be applied to other watersheds in the Sierra Nevada.
Findings: Of the four watersheds considered, the Forecaster was applicable to two.
The results indicate that an index composed of soil silica and other compounds can be used to predict alkalinity of watersheds that are hydrologically similar to Emerald Lake.
Importance to ARBs Program: The model was used to direct field experimentation and to predict the consequences of changes in the amount of acidic deposition and its chemical makeup on high-elevation watersheds and surface waters in California.

INTEGRATED SOIL PROCESSES STUDIES AT EMERALD LAKE WATERSHED.
University of California, Riverside.
1990.
A5-204-32.
Objectives: To characterize watershed soil processes at Emerald Lake.
This project was Part 2 of a three-year study.
Findings: Three major soil types were identified and changes in soil water chemistry were monitored during snowmelt.
In spring 1987, loss of acid-neutralizing capacity and elevated concentrations of nitrate were detected in soil water during snowmelt.
These indicate an episodic pulse of acidity.
Importance to ARBs Program: Results were used to estimate the fates of chemicals in the watershed and the influence of different soil types on soil-water and surface-water chemistry.
The results of this study will guide the board in considering a standard for sensitive ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada.

United States Geological Survey.
1989.
A732-034.
Objectives: To develop a watershed acidification model based on the hydrology of and the mineral weathering rates in the Emerald Lake watershed.
Findings: The investigators recommend that additional work be done to improve existing databases on rates of mineral weathering and soil processes, the timing and magnitude of snowmelt episodes, and the rates of sulfate adsorption by watershed soils.
The model identified the greatest acidic stress to Emerald Lake as that which occurs when acidic rainstorms coincide with snowmelt.
Importance to ARBs Program: The model was used to direct field experimentation and to predict the consequences of changes in the amount of acidic deposition and its chemical makeup on high-elevation watersheds and surface waters.

BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EMERALD LAKE AND STREAMS AND THEIR RESPONSES TO ACIDIC DEPOSITION.
University of California, Santa Barbara.
1989.
A6-184-32.
Objectives: To monitor water chemistry and aquatic populations in Emerald Lake in the Southern Sierra Nevada and its associated streams.
Special emphasis was placed on monitoring populations of brook trout and stream invertebrates.
Findings: Though no direct biological damage was recorded at this site, the effect of polluted rainstorms in May 1987, when the chemistry of Emerald Lake was dominated by dilute snowmelt, may have been to exacerbate the adverse impacts of episodic acidification that occur during snowmelt.
Importance to ARBs Program: The report for this study provided a compilation and synthesis of the biology and hydrochemistry of Emerald Lake to aid the Board in considering the need for a standard in the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program.

University of Iowa.
1989.
A732-036A and A732-036B.
Objectives: To determine the extent of acidic deposition-sensitive waters in the Sierra Nevada.
Findings: Using the models chosen during the evaluation, only a small number of Sierran lakes were projected to become chronically acidified if current rates of acidic deposition were to double, but the models suggested that the effects of episodic acidification may be of greater concern than those of chronic acidification.
Importance to ARBs Program: In partial fulfillment of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, models were developed to predict how change during snowmelt and summer rain would affect lake chemistry.

Objectives: To review the methods employed by the ARB for validating wet- and dry-deposition data from the California Acid Deposition Monitoring Program and update deposition flux estimates for that program.
Findings: For most years, wet nitrate deposition was estimated to be greater in the SoCAB and the southern Sierra Nevada than in other parts of California.
In some areas where wet sulfate deposition is highest, such as the northwestern California coast, much of the sulfate has its origin as sea salt.
At the urban sites, nitric acid deposition accounted for 30 to 80 percent of the dry deposition of oxidized nitrogen species and 20 to 70 percent of the total nitrogen dry deposition.
Importance to ARBs Program: This project produced updated estimates of wet- and dry-deposition fluxes in California.
These estimates improve our understanding of the magnitude of acidic deposition and provides information necessary to determine if an ambient air quality standard for atmospheric acidity and acidic deposition is needed in California.

WET DEPOSITION MONITORING IN THE ALPINE ZONE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.
University of California, Santa Barbara.
1995.
A932-081.
Objectives: To initiate a long-term, wet deposition monitoring program in the alpine zone (above 7,200 feet) of the Sierra Nevada to measure the loading of solutes that may acidify surface waters in high-elevation areas with sensitive lakes and streams.
Findings: Selected ranges of annual wet deposition of solutes in units of Eq/ha were: hydrogen 24.1 to 60.9, ammonium 21.6 to 58.4, nitrate 22.4 to 53.7, and sulfate 16.9 to 44.5.
The significance of these figures is not completely known, since our understanding of the watershed processes that act upon this deposition is still limited.
Importance to ARBs Program: Data from this study will help the ARB document trends for atmospheric acidity in aquatic ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada.

REGIONAL SOURCE-RECEPTOR RELATIONSHIPS FOR ATMOSPHERIC ACIDITY AND ACID DEPOSITION IN CALIFORNIA.
ENSR Consulting and Engineering.
1993.
A032-189.
Objectives: To evaluate semi-empirical source-receptor models and their capability of establishing relationships between sources and sensitive receptors of acidic species and acidic precursors.
The model used in this study is a nonlinear semi-empirical long-range transport model, referred to as STATMOD.
Findings: The source-receptor analysis showed that the contribution of local sources dominated the total sulfur dry deposition at receptors located in urban regions or close to large sources.
Long-range transport was found to be a factor in nitrogen dry deposition, even at receptors that were located close to high NOx sources.
Importance to ARBs Program: The results of this research project will be used in designing potential acid deposition management strategies and in evaluating the need for atmospheric acidity standards in California.

RECEPTOR MODELING OF TRANSPORT OF ACIDIC AIR POLLUTANTS AND OXIDANTS TO FORESTED REGIONS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.
Desert Research Institute.
1993.
A932-140.
Objectives: To model acidic air pollutants in the Sierra Nevada based upon source apportionment.
The first phase of the study involved field measurements of chemical and meteorological data.
The second involved use of a source-receptor model to determine the relationship between acidic species or precursors emitted in the San Joaquin Valley source region and their eventual deposition at susceptible forests in the Sierra Nevada: Blodgett (northern Sierra), Yosemite, Sequoia, and Tehachapi (southern Sierra).
Findings: The results of this study show that the major sources of particulates at Blodgett were of local origin (geological and motor vehicle).
Yosemite and Sequoia were dominated by burning of vegetable material.
Tehachapi was impacted by both regional and local (geological and motor vehicle) sources.
Importance to ARBs Program: In fulfillment of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, the results of this project provide information on sources and contributions to ambient concentrations of particulate matter.
It also provides insight into the level of organic acids in the forested regions of the Sierra Nevada.

TRANSPORT OF ACIDIC AIR POLLUTANTS TO FORESTS AND ALPINE REGIONS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA.
Tracer Technologies, Inc. 1992.
A932-141.
Objectives: To study the summer and fall transport of air pollutants from the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) into the Sierra Nevada range.
Findings: The results of this study show that transport mechanisms of air pollutants into the Sierra are not simple processes.
In most instances, the pollutants are trapped (by atmospheric inversion) along the foothills and slowly seep into the upper Sierra through major canyons and valleys.
This decreases the peak pollutant concentration levels that impact the upper Sierra, but can substantially prolong episodes of elevated concentrations.
Importance to ARBs Program: In partial fulfillment of the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program, this study provided some important findings concerning the transport of pollutants from the San Joaquin Valley.

ANALYSIS OF THE 1987 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AIR QUALITY STUDY (SCAQS) ATMOSPHERIC TRACER DATA.
California Institute of Technology.
1991.
A932-051.
Objectives: To use state-of-the art methods to better define source-receptor relationships for ozone and particulate pollutants (PM10) by analyzing the ARB's database of concentrations of sulfur hexafluoride gas released as an emissions tracer near source areas and captured in downwind areas during the 1987 Southern California Air Quality Study.
Findings: Wind models that can be run from personal computers were able to accurately predict the path traveled by tracer gases.
Importance to ARBs Program: The study refines the analysis of precursor air pollution transport using a tracer gas technique and introduced new ways to analyze such data.
This will be helpful in the planning of future field studies to monitor the relationship between precursor emissions and photochemical ozone.
Better understanding of air pollution transport is required by the California and Federal Clean Air Acts.

MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND CONTROL OF THE DRY DEPOSITION FLUX OF NITROGEN-CONTAINING AIR POLLUTANTS.
Carnegie-Mellon University.
1991.
A6-188-32.
Objectives: To determine the effects that alternative emission control strategies would have on the dry deposition of oxides of nitrogen, nitric acid, aerosol nitrate, and ammonia.
Findings: A dry deposition model was employed to examine the nature of the effects that would occur if emission controls were applied to the NOx and hydrocarbon sources in the South Coast Air Basin as they existed in 1982.
It was found that as emission controls are applied to reactive hydrocarbon and NOx, the dry deposition of acid gases declines while the dry deposition of ammonia increases.
This is due to the greater ammonia emissions and higher ammonia concentrations that result from lower aerosol nitrate formation.
Importance to ARBs Program: The result of this research project will be used in evaluating the need for designing potential acid deposition management strategies and in developing acid deposition and atmospheric acidity standards for California.

DERIVATION OF FORMIC ACID DATA FROM FTIR SPECTRA RECORDED DURING THE 1986 CARBONACEOUS SPECIES METHOD COMPARISON STUDY.
University of California, Riverside.
1989.
A733-167.
Objectives: To determine formic acid concentrations at Glendora, California, as part of the Carbonaceous Species Methods Comparison Study (CSMCS).
Formic acid and other organic acids are formed as part of the atmospheric photochemical process.
In some alpine lakes and water catchments in California with low tolerance for acidity, organic acids may have detrimental effects on the ecosystem.
Findings: Low to average concentrations of formic acid were observed.
For the first several days the formic acid concentrations were higher in the afternoon (consistent with photochemical activity, as expected).
However, during the last days of the study, the highest levels were in the early morning hours, presumably as a result of buildup from as-yet-undetermined primary sources.
Importance to ARBs Program: The CSMCS database is a unique and valuable air quality resource for modeling and emissions inventory assessment.

Objectives: To quantify the dry deposition velocities of five acidic species in order to determine each component's contribution to acid deposition processes in California.
Dry deposition is the major route of acid deposition in California.
The measurements were taken in late spring 1986.
Findings: The results agreed well with published values for the species studied, except that nitric acid deposition velocities were lower than expected.

Ecosystems
ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION TO AGRICULTURAL SOILS.
University of California, Riverside.
1995.
93-334.
Objectives: To determine the contribution of nitrogen, sulfur, and calcium in atmospheric acidity to the nutritional environment of certain commercial crops in California.
Findings: The findings indicate that, on a regional basis, atmospheric depositions of nitrogen could be an important nutrient source for crops, such as lettuce, that have low requirements for those elements.
For most commercially important crops, there is a limited possibility that atmospheric deposition would be the principal contributor to a buildup of soil nutrients to levels that could cause adverse effects on crop productivity.
Nutrient depositions of magnitudes determined in this study could have pronounced adverse effects on plants in natural, unmanaged ecosystems, such as grasslands or forests that are adapted to growing in nutrient-poor conditions.
Importance to ARBs Program: The results of this study will be used to evaluate the overall effects of acidic deposition on agricultural resources for the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program Assessment.
The GIS-compatible data can be used to evaluate the effects on agricultural resources of acidic deposition in combination with other air pollutants.

ASSESSMENT OF ACIDIC DEPOSITION AND OZONE EFFECTS ON CONIFER FORESTS IN THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS.
United States Forest Service.
1995.
A032-180.
Objectives: To establish and maintain a forest health-monitoring site at Barton Flats in the San Bernardino National Forest.
The main tasks were to: (1) monitor air quality and meteorological conditions; (2) assess tree health and characterize soil properties; and (3) estimate rates of ozone and nitrogen deposition to pine trees.
Findings: The findings indicate that the co-deposition of ozone and nitrogen to ponderosa pine occurs at levels that can cause long-term, adverse impacts on forest tree productivity and soil fertility.
Given the time frame of ecological effects (20 to 50 years) and data documenting higher levels of ozone exposure in the 1950s, it was proposed that conifer forest productivity in southern California may be at risk within the next 10 to 20 years.
Importance to ARBs Program: Findings from this project will be used to quantify rates of ozone and acidic deposition to forests in southern California and as a basis for determining the need to establish an acidic deposition standard.

ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL ALTERATIONS IN SOIL NUTRIENT CYCLING: AN INTEGRATED MEASURE OF CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACIDIC DEPOSITION ON A MIXED CONIFER FOREST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service.
1995.
92-335.
Objectives: To apply the Nutrient Cycling Model (NuCM) in the investigation of long-term effects of acidic deposition on soil biogeochemistry at a mixed conifer forest in southern California.
To support this effort, measurements were also made to: (1) quantify nutrient pools in vegetation and soil; (2) measure water vapor emissions, carbon dioxide uptake rates, and soil moisture availability; (3) monitor wet and dry acidic deposition; and (4) assess short-term variations in nitrogenous air pollutants.
Findings: Results from the 40-year NuCM simulations indicated that elevated levels of nitrogen deposition would eventually lead to the leaching of base cations and nitrate from forest soil, a change that would be similar to changes that have occurred in other forests.
Measurements of pine tree gas exchange rates indicated that up to 70 percent of annual ozone uptake occurs during the period from May through July.
In a two-week intensive study, levels of dry-deposited nitrogen-derived species were two times higher in the afternoon than in the morning or at night.
Importance to ARBs Program: Because of the long-term nature of acidic deposition-induced effects on forests, simulation models are needed to project the adverse impacts, if any, that may result from chronic exposure to nitrogenous air pollutants.
The NuCM will be used to assess the potential long-term combined effects of ozone and nitrogen deposition on soil properties and groundwater quality in forests in southern California.
The results of this study will guide the ARB when considering a standard for forest ecosystems in California.

Objectives: To conduct a pilot investigation to determine how ozone and nitric acid might interact with allergens to affect asthmatic response processes.
Findings: Trends (non-statistically significant changes) were found that indicate that ozone may influence the asthmatic response to allergens.
No influence of acid alone was detected and there appeared to be no augmentation of effects when acid was added to the ozone test atmosphere.
Importance to ARB's Program: The results of this and other studies will be combined to evaluate the health risk that ambient acidity poses to Californians and in considering the need for a health-based standard for this pollutant.

MONITORING FOR ACIDIC POLLUTANTS IN SUPPORT OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN OF CALIFORNIA.
Desert Research Institute.
1994.
92-336.
Objectives: In support of an epidemiological study being conducted by California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), ARB funded this study to measure concentration of several air pollutants and to identify periods of high concentration of acidic species.
The OEHHA/CDCP project is examining the short-term effects of air pollution on asthmatic African-American children in the Los Angeles area.
Findings: Desert Research Institute measured PM2.5 mass collected over a 12-hour daytime period and determined the concentrations of its constituents: sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and aerosol strong acidity.
Sulfate and total nitrate concentrations were within the range expected for the site.
Total nitrate consisted of approximately equal quantities of particulate nitrate and nitric acid.
Strong aerosol acidity was present in most samples, but in amounts that were small compared to those of nitric acid.
Importance to ARB's Program: The results of this research project will be used in evaluating the need to develop acid deposition and atmospheric acidity standards for California.

Objectives: To determine whether adverse effects resulting from exposures to low levels of nitric acid (comparable to ambient conditions in Los Angeles) are enhanced in the presence of particles and ozone.
Importance to ARB's Program: In order to evaluate the chronic effects resulting from ambient acidic exposures it is necessary to evaluate the co-pollutant effects of ozone and particles because they often co-exist with acids in urban ambient atmospheres.
The results of this and other studies will be used by ARB staff to evaluate the risk posed by ambient acidity as required by the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Act.

University of California, San Francisco.
1992.
A933-146.
Objectives: To determine whether simultaneous exposure to nitric acid vapor enhances the acute effects of ozone in healthy humans.
To develop a method for identifying sites of injury in the lungs after pollutant exposures.
Findings: The results of this study, along with those of other recently complete clinical and animal studies, indicate that ambient acidity by itself does not pose an acute health risk to healthy individuals.
The magnitude of the ozone response was slightly affected by the presence of nitric acid.
The combination effect is being evaluated further.
The method developed is useful in identifying the location of lung injury due to pollutant exposure.
Importance to ARB's Program: As required by the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Act, the information from this study will be used to evaluate the risk to humans posed by acidity.
CLINICAL PILOT STUDY TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE MARKERS FOR DETECTING THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF ACIDIC ATMOSPHERES.
Alliance Technology Corporation.
1991.

Objectives: To evaluate biomarkers of inflammation and of reduced defense in the lungs of human subjects after nitric acid exposures.
These markers were chosen because repeated or chronic inflammation may eventually lead to a chronic disease.
Disruption in macrophage function (the biomarker for reduced lung defense) may increase susceptibility of an individual to respiratory infection.
Findings: The results indicate that macrophage function was compromised after nitric acid exposures.
Importance to ARB's Program: This was one of a series of preliminary studies conducted to evaluate effects of ambient acidity for the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program.
The methods developed and evaluated in this study were included in other ongoing clinical and animal studies involving nitric acid exposures.

Findings: Biochemical changes indicative of cellular stress were observed when the liquid medium in which the cells were kept was even slightly acidified.
However, when cell surfaces were exposed to nitric acid vapor, even at high levels no changes were observed.
In contrast, ozone exposures even at very low concentrations resulted in cell death.
Importance to ARB's Program: This was one of a series of preliminary studies conducted to evaluate effects of ambient acidity for the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program.
The results were communicated to other investigators evaluating the effects of ambient acids.
Studies in progress are making efforts to relate these findings to responses in other animals and humans.
ACID AIR POLLUTANT MIXTURES: RESPIRATORY SYSTEM RESPONSES AND EFFECTS OF EXERCISE.
Principal Investigator: Dr. William J. Mautz.
University of California, Irvine.
1989.
A6-148-33.
Objectives: To determine whether inhalation of airborne organic acids influences the adverse effects of ozone and whether exercise enhances the magnitude of the responses observed.
Findings: Acute exposure to an organic acid (hydroxymethane sulfonic acid) did not have significant effect on any of the measured parameters either alone or in combination with ozone.
Exercise did increase the magnitude of ozone effects.
Importance to ARB's Program: This was one of a series of preliminary studies conducted to evaluate effects of ambient acidity for the Atmospheric Acidity Protection Program.
The results of this study were used in the design of a clinical study to evaluate the acute effects of hydroxymethane sulfonic acid.

RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF ACID CONTAINING MULTICOMPONENT POLLUTANT ATMOSPHERES.
Principal Investigator: Dr. William J. Mautz.
University of California Irvine.
1988.
A4-112-32.
Objectives: To assess the possible adverse effects on the respitarory system of acid air pollutants inhaled in mixtures with other pollutant compounds commonly present in California urban air.
A 7-component mixture of acid-forming oxidant pollutants representing the principal components of California urban air pollution was generated which was composed of 0.35 ppm ozone, 1.3 ppm nitrogen dioxide, 2.5 ppm sulfur dioxide, 1.1 mg/m^3 manganese, ferric and ammonium sulfite, and 0.5 mg/m^3 carbon soot at 85% relative humidity.
Importance to ARBs Program: These studies establish that differences in the techniques used for isolating pulmonary surfactant from lavage fluids can greatly influence the observed chemical composition with respect to the fatty acids as well as the presence of lipid oxidation products.

STUDIES TO DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM HEALTH EFFECTS OF ACIDIC ATMOSPHERES.
University of California, Irvine, and New York University.
A033-088 and A033-089.
Objectives: To assess for humans, using appropriate animal models, the potential for harmful chronic effects resulting from exposure to acidic atmospheres typical of California.
This was the first multi-species study to evaluate long-term noncancer effects of air pollution.
Importance to ARB's Program: The results from this project will be critical in evaluating the long-term effects of acidic exposures either alone or in combination with ozone.
Preliminary results indicate that extended exposure to low levels of acids in both situations poses a health risk, as evinced by decreased lung elasticity and airway reactivity and a breakdown in some lung defense mechanisms.

INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC ACIDITY UPON ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT MATERIALS.
Combustion Engineering.
1989.
A4-110-32 
Objectives: To determine the effects of acidic deposition on two types of paint, galvanized steel, nickel, concrete, aluminum, nylon fabric, and polyethylene in the South Coast Air Basin under controlled field conditions.
Findings: The relationships among material damage, air quality, and meteorological variables were developed for galvanized steel, nickel, and one type of paint.
Reliable exposure-response relationships could not be developed for the other materials, primarily due to insufficient amounts of exposure data.
Importance to ARB's Program: Data collected under this project were used in a subsequent research project (Contract No. A932-113, 1993).

EVALUATION OF A SAMPLING METHODOLOGY FOR ACIDIC SPECIES.
University of California, Riverside.
93-338.
Projects in Progress
Objectives: To design an innovative methodology that will allow comprehensive measurements of atmospheric acidic species and employs an easy-to-operate, reliable, durable, low-cost sampler.
The system will be designed to be very flexible: denuders and backfilters could be removed or added and sampling frequencies and duration could be adjusted to meet the specific monitoring objectives of future studies.
Denuder and substrate performance will be evaluated under laboratory and field conditions for accuracy, precision, and interferences.
Importance to ARBs Program: This study will provide a simple, reliable, and inexpensive sampler that can be used for monitoring atmospheric acidic species in California.
This monitoring is critical for maintaining reliable databases on acidic deposition that can be used to support ongoing research programs on atmospheric processes, forest ecosystems, and human health.
