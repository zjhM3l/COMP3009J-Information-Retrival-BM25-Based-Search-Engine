Size of Group and Distribution
Hispanic-Americans are an increasingly significant portion of the U.S. population, yet the group remains an enigma to many Americans.
This essay will attempt to deal with issues of nomenclature, group stereotypes and the origins of the major subgroups.
Hispanics overall exhibit a number of commonalities, but individual subgroups also reflect distinctive traits and cultural differences.
The Hispanic population in the U.S. has witnessed tremendous growth over the last thirty years, moving from roughly six percent of the population in 1960 to about ten percent in 1995.
About 27 million Americans are identified as Hispanic in the fifty states, and another 3.6 million reside in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Puerto Ricans have all had U.S. citizenship since the First World War by an act of Congress.
The rapid growth in the Hispanic component of the population nationwide has been fueled both by significant immigration, particularly since 1965, and high fertility rates.
Hispanics, on average, reflect larger families than either non-Hispanic Whites or African- Americans, although there are differences in family size among the major subgroups in the Hispanic population.
Mexican- Americans, generally, have the largest families within this grouping, particularly in rural areas or small towns, followed in order by Puerto Ricans, Central Americans and Cubans.
The latter population has the highest median age and smallest family size of any of the Hispanic groups.
Socioeconomically, Cuban-Americans have the highest educational and income levels, followed in order by Latin American immigrants, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.
Hispanics tend to remain heavily concentrated in certain regions of the United States, notably the Southwest (including, significantly, California), the Northeast, south Florida and several urban centers of the Midwest.
However, evidence exists that a diffusion of Hispanics to many "nontraditional" areas of the country is occurring.
The states with the largest absolute numbers of Hispanics are California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey.
In percentage terms as a part of the total population, the largest concentrations of Hispanics are found in New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida and New York.
Significant state-wide growth of this population is also occurring in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Washington, Nevada, and there are notable concentrations in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Oregon, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, the Washington, DC, area and Hawaii.
Several metropolitan areas account for a large percentage of the total Hispanic population.
Foremost among these is Los Angeles, and several other California urban areas (San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, the San Francisco Bay Area and Fresno), as well as New York City, Miami, Chicago, San Antonio, Phoenix, Denver, Houston, Dallas, El Paso, Albuquerque, Tampa, Kansas City, Tucson, Corpus Christi and Austin.
Many smaller and mid- size cities also evidence high Hispanic population percentages, notably Santa Fe (NM), Pueblo (CO), Yuma (AZ), Salinas, Modesto, Stockton (CA), Hialeah (FL), Brownsville, Laredo, Midland- Lubbock-Odessa (TX), Hartford, Bridgeport (CT), Newark, Trenton, Camden (NJ) Springfield (MA), Saginaw (MI), Gary (IN), Racine (WI) and Cheyenne (WY).

Ethnic Composition and Historical Settlement Patterns
Ethnic Composition and Historical Settlement Patterns: While the entire population is classified as hispanic," there are major ethnic subdivisions within the population.
The largest group, by far, is Mexican-American, accounting for about 60% of the total Hispanic population.
Most of this population originated in northern Mexico, know in Spanish as "nortenos," although much of the recent immigration from Mexico is coming from deep in the interior of that country.
There are many regional variations within the Mexican-American population, and Mexican-Americans in California, for example, often set themselves apart from "Tejanos,"Texans of Mexican ancestry, not to mention populations located in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.
Much of the Mexican-ancestry population preceded the English- speaking population of the Southwest, and length of settlement plays a major factor in issues of identity.
The fact that so many of our states have Spanish names is indicative of this historical item, and Spanish-speaking settlers tanned out of Mexico as early as the 1600s in New Mexico; the 1700s in Texas and southern Arizona; the late 1700s and early 1800s in California and Colorado.
In fact, the Hispanic people of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado refer to themselves as hispanos," and often reflect cultural patterns very distinct from other Southwestern Hispanic people.
Additionally, the Southwest experienced huge waves of Mexican immigration following the 1910 revolution in that country, and the majority of the well- established Hispanic population of the Southwest probably traces its origins to this group of settlers.
The diffusion of Mexican- ancestry population out of the Southwest into the Midwest and Prairie States occurred as early as the 1920s, and much of the Hispanic population of Chicago, for example, can trace its origins to this pattern.
Since the 1960s, Mexican immigration has grown, and, while most of that new population has settled in the traditional areas of the Southwest, many have also dispersed throughout the United States.
Puerto Ricans, who number about 15% of the total US Hispanic population, began settling in the mainland United States soon after Spain ceded that island as a result of the Spanish-American War of 1898.
The first major settlements occurred in New York City, notably Brooklyn, in the 1920s, but the very large migration of Puerto Ricans occurred with the end of the Second World War.
New York was the initial attraction, but by the 1950s, and accelerating in the 1960s, Puerto Ricans began moving in significant numbers to Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Allentown, Reading), Illinois (Chicago), Massachusetts (Boston, Springfield), Ohio (Lorrain), south Florida and the West Coast.
Interestingly, there was a significant Puerto Rican settlement in Hawaii in the first two decades of this century.
Cuban settlements occurred in the New York area and Tampa (Ybor City) late in the last century.
The great Cuban immigration, however, occurred after the accession of Fidel Castro to power, and there have been continuing waves of Cuban immigrants, mostly into south Florida, New York and northern New Jersey, since then.
Major Cuban communities can also be found in some other cities, notably Chicago, New Orleans, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
Cubans number somewhat less than ten percent of the total Hispanic population.
An interesting, often forgotten, Hispanic settlement occurred in southern Louisiana during the colonial period.
Settlers mostly from the Canary Islands established themselves in New Orleans (as they did around San Antonio) and the surrounding bayou parishes at the end of the 18th century.
Most of these individuals were eventually assimilated into the Creole culture of southern Louisiana and today often identify as "French."
Large-scale immigration from different parts of Latin America has been taking place since the 1960s.
The largest source of immigrants--often the result of political strife in the countries of origin--has been Central America.
About a tenth of the population of El Salvador (circa 500,000 people) is estimated to have entered the United States beginning in the 1970s, and large numbers of Salvadorenos now live in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City and Washington, DC.
Guatemaltecos, in lesser numbers, followed the Salvadorean pattern, as have Nicaraguenses, except that the latter have established a major presence in Miami.
Dominicanos now account for the largest single Hispanic source of immigrants to New York City, and Colombianos have also established a major presence in New York City and Miami.
Communities of Hispanics from other parts of Latin America are found scattered across the country.
_______________________________________________________________
Nomenclature
Nomenclature:The nomenclature for Hispanics remains problematic.
The term is meant to be all inclusive of anyone with linguistic or cultural antecedents in Latin America and Spain, but major differences, as well as commonalities, exist among these populations.
Additionally, it is clear that the level of Hispanic identity depends in large part on the level of acculturation, i.e., length of stay, within the country and whether a specific population lived in a relatively isolated geographic area, e.g., New Mexico or the rural Southwest.
For a long time, Hispanics were generically described as "Spanish-Speaking" people.
The problem with this descriptor is that many Hispanics do not speak Spanish, or at least cannot use it fluently.
Also, there are a good number of non-Hispanics who do speak Spanish, so, again, this categorization has not been helpful.
Similarly, Hispanics have often been described as "Spanish- Surnamed," and, again, the problem here is that a good number of Hispanics do not have Spanish surnames.
There were a large number of immigrants to various parts of Latin America who were not Iberian, yet they became Hispanicized and thus "Hispanic."
Furthermore, as a result of intermarriage in the United States, many people have been raised as Hispanic, yet do not reflect Spanish surnames.
There is also as subset of people who, by virtue of intermarriage or personal choice in changing their names in the process of assimilation, who were not brought up in a Hispanic cultural context and do not identify as such.
Sometimes Hispanics are simply referred to as "Spanish," but this name does not take into account the fact that the overwhelming part of our Hispanic population originated in Latin America and not in Spain.
Many Hispanics, especially Mexican-Americans, choose not to identify with Spain because of the often tragic colonial experience--and by virtue of the fact that most possess mixed racial antecedents, either native American or African, that are not of European origin.
Most Hispanics in the US, although not all, are, therefore, mestizo.
For lack of a better term, most Mexican-Americans and Central Americans are "Indo-Hispanic," i.e., a mixture of Spanish and native American genes, and many Caribbean-origin people are "Afro-Hispanic," i.e., a mixture of West African and Spanish mots.
It is only in the southern part of South America where one witnesses a predominance of European- based people in the general population, although many of the socioeconomic elites throughout Latin America reflect European origins.
Hispanics are increasingly referred to as "Latino(a)," and that term is gaining acceptance particularly on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
Generally, this term reflects the origin of the population in Latin America and exists most broadly where an ethnic diversification of the Hispanic population has occurred.
It should be noted that 'Latino" is an umbrella term.
When people are asked whether they are Latino, they often respond by say, 'Yes, I'm Latino.
I'm Puerto Rican (or Colombian, Salvadorean, etc.)."
In other words, they agree on the overall term, but then provide a more specific ethnic identification.
In this context, it's interesting to note that Latino is used more rarely by Mexican-Americans due to a specific historical occurrence.
The term "Latin America" was invented by the French at a time when they had imperial ambitions in Mexico, i.e., the Imposition of Maximilian as emperor of Mexico.
In essence, the French of that time argued that both France and Mexico were "latin" countries--and, therefore, had a kinship--and they used this connection to impose a regime that was universally unpopular in Mexico.
Thus, the term, latin," left a bad taste in Mexico's consciousness.
That memory, however, is fading, and a number of Mexican-Americans today feel comfortable with the generic term Latino.
Sometimes people use the term "raza" to refer to Hispanics, although it should be noted that this is a uniquely Mexican adaptation.
In the Mexican context, raza means someone of Mexican extraction, usually someone who is mestizo.
The term raza in the Spanish context, as originally coined in Spain, has a different connotation, as, for example, in the celebration in much of Latin America of "el dia de la raza," i.e, Columbus Day, It refers to the Spanish conquest of Latin America, and to people from Spain in particular, and, again, by virtue of a negative colonial experience does not have positive implications to many Latin Americans.
The term "Chicano" arose out of the Mexican-American political movement in the 1960s, although the term, itself, is probably several generations older.
Chicano, here, again, was/is used by a subset of the Mexican-American population to avoid the hyphenation implicit in the latter term and generally refers to mestizo people of Mexican extraction.
The term never gained acceptance with large numbers of Mexican-Americans.
because, in its older variation, it signified someone of lower socioeconomic status.
To some people, it also implied a certain political radicalism or separatism, The origins of the term Chicano are obscure, and no definite conclusions ran be reached about its provenance.
Some people in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas argue that the term came about, because so many people from there settled in Chicago, hence Chicano.
That theory is unlikely.
Another, more viable theory, stems from the fact that so much Mexican immigration into the US came from the state of Chihuahua, there the combination of the "chi" of Chihuahua with the "cano" of "Mexicano."
The most likely theory is the fact that the native languages of Mexico, prior to the Spanish arrival, e.g., Nahuatl, possessed a sound, "esh," that does not exist in Spanish.
Since the Spanish alphabet did not possess this sound, they wrote the symbol "x" when writing it down, as in "Mexico" (originally pronounced "Meshico" from the earlier "Meshica" for the people of the valley of today's Mexico City).
The shortening of "Meshicano" produced "Chicano."
The current, most widely-used term, is Hispanic, a descriptor that does not exist spontaneously in any Latino population.
This term was created by the US federal government in the early 1970s in an attempt to provide a common denominator to a large, but disparate, population.
The assumption behind the term was that the only thing that tied these differing populations together was some sort of connection to Spanish language or culture, ergo "Hispanic."
The sometimes tenuous connection to Spain does remain the major commonality linguistically and culturally for all Hispanic populations.
The term is not used in everyday parlance by Latinos, although most people understand its intent.
It seems to be most widespread among more acculturated, economically successful Latinos in the US and is often used by Latino professional or political organizations.
It is also the term used widely by the federal government and many state or local political jurisdictions when capturing data about populations.

Major Stereotypes About Hispanics in the U.S.
Major Stereotypes about Hispanics in the US: All groups that are seen as different, i.e. minorities, are viewed in stereotypical fashion by majority populations.
Hispanics, in this context, are no different, and there are five that come to mind readily.
The most significant stereotype that affects Hispanics is the presumption often by the majority population that Hispanics are "foreign."
People, for example, often consider Spanish surnames (and certainly given names) to be somehow "not American," even though such a large number of US geographic place names are indeed of Spanish origin.
There is the secondary presumption that all Hispanics are also recent immigrants, even though the settlement patterns described briefly above more than suggest a Spanish-speaking presence dating way back.
The oldest European- influenced settlements in the US are of Spanish origin and include St. Augustine, Florida (1565), and Santa Fe, New Mexico (1610), both established prior to any major English-speaking settlements on the continent.
The oldest city under the American flag remains San Juan, Puerto Rico (1521).
There are, thus, countless Hispanic families whose antecedents in this country go back in some instances to ten generations or more.
Why is the "foreign" stereotype an issue? When people are presumed to be foreign, it is also assumed that this population, therefore, has no stake in this system, much less made a major contribution to the building of the country.
Similarly, when a Hispanic on occasion is critical of this society or some of its politics, as is every citizen's right, that person is branded as "ungrateful," and people are often told to "go back to wherever they came from, if they don't like it here."
The second stereotype deals with definitions of race as it applies to Hispanics.
Hispanics are not a racial category and may, in fact, be of many--usually mixed--race backgrounds.
American society has attempted to be very neat about racial divisions and identifications, and a mixed-race people wreak havoc with this framework.
Additionally, and very important, definitions of race are culturally bound, i.e., different cultures may define the same race differently, and Hispanic definitions of race often vary from Anglo-American norms.
For example, Mexico defines someone as a native American (Indian) only if that person speaks a native language of Mexico as a first language.
Once that person speaks Spanish as a first language-- irrespective of genetic pool--that person is no longer considered an Indian.
In the US, we apply a genetic standard (one needs to be at least one-quarter Indian regardless of cultural affiliation), rather than a purely cultural one.
Similarly, a person in the US who has any African ancestry, regardless of appearance, is considered African-American (Black), while in the Hispanic Caribbean only a "pure" Black person is considered such.
Once people have mixed, they are assigned other categories.
This racial ambiguity within the Hispanic population confuses both White and Black Americans and can lead to social conflict between groups.
Issues relating to language frame another stereotype about Hispanics.
Many people assume implicitly that Hispanics either do not speak English, or have learned it rather recently.
Many Hispanics are asked regularly where they learned English, even though many people have never spoken anything other than English.
A significant percentage of the Hispanic population speaks no Spanish whatsoever, although many are bilingual and another segment monolingual in Spanish only.
Generally, it can be said that knowledge of Spanish, or fluency in that language, is less widespread regionally in the urban centers of the Southwest and Midwest than elsewhere among the Mexican-American population, or among people who have been here for several generations.
Spanish dominance is most common among older people, recent immigrants and along settlements along the Mexican border.
South Florida and the New York area evidence a high usage of Spanish, although, generationally, younger people are less fluent than older ones.
Clearly, Hispanics born in the US reflect less usage of Spanish than those who have immigrated.
This stereotype is potentially damaging, because, implicitly, it is believed that, due to absence of language skills, Hispanics are not suitable for occupations in the white collar area or professions.
Some people, by way of stereotype, believe that Hispanics are a rural phenomenon.
Ironically, other than Chinese Americans, there is no population in the United States more urban than Hispanics (almost 90% of the total--a percentage much higher than the population overall).
While Hispanics are disproportionately represented in the rural workforce, e.g., particularly migrant workers, the overwhelming number of Hispanics are based in urban areas.
The danger with this stereotype revolves around the assumption that rural people do not possess the skills to work in urban-based occupations, nor are they seen as the actual or potential consumers for products.
The final stereotype centers on the assumption that Hispanics are a regional phenomenon in the US.
While, as indicated above, the Hispanic population is heavily concentrated in a number of (significant) parts of the country, i.e., the Southwest, Pacific Coast, New York corridor and south Florida, the most interesting recent demographic trend is the diffusion of that population beyond its "traditional" settlements.
Chicago, case in point, is the third-largest Hispanic city in the country with about 750,000 Hispanic people, and the growth of the Hispanic population in a variety of other US urban centers has been spectacular.
The regional stereotype fails to see the Hispanic population as a national presence, and, under our system of federalism, ignoring its national dimension makes it a "local" question.
Hispanics have become too large a population nationally to relegate their issues, concerns and opportunities to local concerns.
This item has major implications politically, but also impacts how and why US corporations look at this phenomenon as a major market opportunity.
_______________________________________________________________
Cultural Commonalities Among All Hispanic Groups
Cultural Commonalities among All Hispanic Groups: While each of the Hispanic subgroups in the US has its own distinctiveness, there are a number of commonalities which serve to unite the larger group.
All the groups share a common colonial founding and experience with Spain, and all geographic areas of Latin America witnessed a subjugation, or virtual elimination, of a native population.
The native presence remains strong in many, though not all, parts of Latin America, and this characteristic is most prominent in Mexico, most of Central America and the Andean chain.
Many parts of Latin America also experienced the introduction of African slavery, although this phenomenon was most pronounced in the countries of the Caribbean basin.
Similarly, all countries of Latin America developed an uneasy relationship with the United States reaching back centuries, and the friction between an essentially Mediterranean culture with an Anglo-Saxon one continues to this day.
In the United States, few non-Hispanics make -- or are aware of -- significant distinctions among the different Hispanic groups, and it is not unusual for all groups to be seen as a unified, "Hispanic" category.
The universal connection throughout Latin America to a Spanish colonial experience is the key to the cultural commonalities among all the Hispanic subgroups.
While the Spanish influence is stronger in some regions than in others, the unifying theme regionally--whether linguistic or cultural--remains the connection back to Spain.
For example, local linguistic variations exist, but Latin Americans of all backgrounds can easily communicate with one another in basically the same language.
Language is a very important hallmark of culture, and this common language does provide a sense of unity, a factor, by the way, that has been enhanced with the rise of modern communications.
People throughout the Latin American region, and even Hispanics within the US, often watch the same television programs, listen to the same music and read the same authors.
Although harder to define, there are also many common cultural reflexes that originated in the Iberian peninsula.
The stress on the importance of a large, extended family, the cultivation of personal relationships and alliances, definitions of honor and respect, the distrust of government in general, stratifications based on class and occupation and the adherence, generally, to the same religious identification all stem from Spain.
Anyone who has spent any time in both Spain and any part of Latin America can readily sense and observe the commonalities.
_______________________________________________________________
Regional Cultural Distinctions
Regional Cultural Distinctions: Although Spain has provided the themes common to the Latin American experience, many, significant differences exist on a regional basis.
Many of these have to do with the strength and, where appropriate, the survival of native populations, as, for example, in Mexico, Central America and the Andean chain.
Others, notably the Caribbean basin, were influenced in a major way by the presence of an African population.
Still others, particularly in southern South America, were shaped by non- Hispanic immigrants.
Throughout Latin America it is also important to observe the specific nature of the original Spanish settlement, i.e., where the settlers came from in Spain.
Spain has strong regional variations of its own with unique cultural traits, and it is important to note whether the Spanish settlement patterns originated in Andalucia, the Canary Islands, Castilla, the north of Spain (Galicia, Asturias, the Basque country) or Cataluna, including the Balearic Islands (Mallorca).
Thus, the importance of the south of Spain and the Canary Islands is strongest in the Caribbean (witness the commonalities of dialect among these areas), whereas the provinces of Castilla and Extremadura influenced Mexico, Central America and northern South America and the Andean chain in a major way.
Hispanicized Basques were prominent in many parts of the region, and Catalan immigrations, as well as northern Spaniards, were important in the late nineteenth century.
The latter groups, in fact, as well as non-Hispanic immigrants, often became the new business elites of Latin America.
Having said all of the above, one can divide Latin America to some extent into three major cultural groupings.
These are, for lack of better terminology, (a) lndo-Hispanic, (b) Afro-Hispanic and (c) Euro-Hispanic.
_______________________________________________________________
Indo-Hispanic Cultural Areas
lndo-Hispanic Cultural Areas: The largest grouping of Hispanics in the US originates to a large extent in Mexico and, more recently, in Central America.
This geographic area, along with the Andean chain (Ecuador, the highlands of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia; Paraguay, while not Andean, also fits this description), possessed large and sophisticated native populations and civilizations at the time of the Spanish arrival.
While large numbers of these populations did not survive Spanish colonialism initially, a significant enough genetic and cultural pool did persevere in order to shape present-day cultural patterns.
In all of these areas, the native stock remains at the lower end of social stratification, but this group has, nevertheless, influenced the larger culture.
One example of this cultural influence is the survival in most of this region of native,i.e.,non-Spanish,languages.
About ten percent of Mexicans still speak an indigenous language, e.g., Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec and Maya; a larger percentage of Guatemala's population speaks one of the Maya languages; Quechua and Aymara often predominate in the Andean highlands of Peru and Bolivia; and Guarani is significant in Paraguay.
In this geographical area, indigenous people remain prominent in the genetic pool also.
Indigenous people, in this context, probably remain the majority of the population in Guatemala, Peru and Bolivia, and significant indigenous minorities remain in the rest of these countries.
Mixed-race people, i.e., Indian-White "mestizos,n form the bulk of the population in the remaining countries, and those of "pure" European extraction generally form small minorities in all.
The cultural influence of native populations has been major in all these countries and affects factors such as language, religion, music and food to this day.
In the Mexican context, for example, while the population fairly universally speaks a clear "Castilian" Spanish, many words and expressions were assimilated from the native populations.
Words like guajolote (from guajolotl, turkey), cacao, chocolate (from chocolatl), aguacate (from ahuacatl, avocado), and tomate (from tomatl, tomato), which describe foods indigenous to the Americas, were taken directly into the national language.
Similarly, other expressions, like cuate (from cuatl, literally, "twin," but meaning best friend), tecolote (from tecolotl, owl) and milpa (a farm patch) were also borrowed from Nahuatl.
There are many such words in Mexican and Central American usage, for example, the bird "turkey" in Guatemala and El Salvador is tzompipe, the Maya word.
The word, potato, originated in the Andean highlands, as did the food itself.
Catholicism, imposed by the Spanish on native populations and African slaves, remains the major religious orientation of most of the people, but in each instance there are native influences.
The Church often imposed Catholic observances on traditional native celebrations and days, as in the case of the Day of the Dead (el dia de los muertos) in Mexico.
A pre-Columbian religious festival was thus Christianized.
More significantly, the patron saint of Mexico is Our Lady of Guadalupe, also known as the "Virgen Morena," or Brown Virgin (her skin coloration).
The Virgin is said to have appeared very early in the Conquest to Juan Diego, a pure-blooded Indian and recent convert to Catholicism, at the site, perhaps coincidentally, on the same spot exactly where the ancient Aztecs used to venerate their chief female goddess, Tonantziuh.
Likewise, religious healers, or, "curanderos, remain prominent in Mexican society, and, in most cases, their practices precede the Christianization of the populace.
Very little indigenous music survived into modern times, although one can assume that some of the strains heard in rural areas originated in ancient times.
Mexican and Central American music, however, was influenced heavily in the nineteenth century by some of the court music of Europe, particularly with the importation of the waltz and polka during Maximilian's time.
This feature is most prominent in so-called norteno music, and, interestingly, later influenced American country and western music.
What most people consider quintessentially Mexican music, i.e., Mariachi, also originated during the time of the French occupation, and the word, itself, is a corruption of the French word, marriage.
It was music that was first played at weddings, and soon evolved into a uniquely Mexican musical adaptation found nowhere else.
The oldest Spanish-influenced music of Mexico, corridos (songs that are made up and improvised as a particular story develops), may have originated in the flamenco of southern Spain, which also depends on the guitar as a prime instrument and on improvisation lyrically.
The native cultural presence is felt most in the everyday food consumed by the people.
While the Spanish introduced rice, wheat, citrus fruits and a host of domestic livestock, what the average person eats today in Mexico (and what North Americans normally consider "Mexican food") is probably not too dissimilar from what people ate prior to the Conquest.
Corn (maize), tamales, tortillas (in Spain, a tortilla is an omelette), enchiladas, frijoles (beans) are all indigenous means of cooking, and drinks like pulque (a form of beer), mezcal and tequila all preceded the Spanish.
_______________________________________________________________
Afro-Hispanic Cultural Area (Caribbean)
Afro-Hispanic Cultural Area (Caribbean): Native people, of course, resided in the Caribbean littoral (Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico) at the time of the Spanish arrival.
Unfortunately, theirs was an extremely tragic encounter, and very little of the original genetic stock survived the Spanish Conquest.
The people living on the major Caribbean islands at the time of the Spanish arrival were known as Taino and were members of the Arawak ethnic group, originally from the Orinoco basin of northern South America.
These people were for all intent and purposes destroyed within about one generation.
They did leave their language in the form of geographical place names, e.g., numerous town and province names like Camaguey, Cuba, Haiti, Quisqueya (the original name of what is now the Dominican Republic), Borinquen ( a Spanish corruption of the original name for Puerto Rico, Borinquen), Mayaguez, Arecibo, Utuado, Cayey and so on.
They also left a number of other words, some of which were also incorporated into Spanish and other European languages, e.g., huracan (hurricane), jamaca (hammock), and tabaco (tobacco).
Other Taino words are also used in Caribbean Spanish, e.g., yuca (the manioc root) and bohio (a small country hut).
The earliest Spanish settlers of the Caribbean originated mostly in Andalucia and the Canary Islands.
The speech patterns of the Caribbean reflect this influence strongly, as in the case of very rapid speech, dropped endings, elimination of the letter "d" between vowels and the unaspirated letter us" at the endings of words.
Puerto Ricans, additionally, have the tendency to change the letter "r" to an "l" when followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, e.g, pol favol (por favor), talde (tarde), polque (porque).
The trilled "rr", common in Spanish, in Puerto Rico often sounds like a Germanic "r."
In Cuba, the letter "r" is often dropped altogether, as in poque, instead of porque.
Overall, however, the various Caribbean Spanish dialects, including the coastal areas of Venezuela, Colombia and Panama, have more in common with one another, than they do with the Spanish of the continent of America.
The most significant cultural difference in the Caribbean, especially when compared to the American continent itself, relates to the large-scale introduction of an African population, usually, but not always, through slavery.
While most of the original population of African ancestry has roots in slavery, there were at all times significant numbers of African or mixed- race people who were free citizens of Spain.
With the elimination of the native population, the Spanish began importing African slaves, mostly from West Africa.
These populations were heavily from certain African ethnic groups, notably the Yoruba, lbo, lbibio, Mandingo, Ife, Ewe and, later, from the Congo or Angola.
Although generally Hispanicized during slavery, many of the original African cultural characteristics persevered and influenced the larger culture.
The language of the Spanish Caribbean was heavily affected by African grammatical patterns and loan words.
It is fairly safe to say, for example, that virtually any word in the local dialects that contain combinations of "mb," "ng" or begin with "n" are originally of African origin.
Actual examples of these types of loan words would be: name (yams), quimbombo (okra), malanga (a root plant), rumba (the dance), conga (the drum), bomb
Additionally, although harder to measure, the tonal patterns and pitch of much Caribbean speech evidences strong West African influence.
The predominant religion of the Caribbean, as elsewhere in Latin America, was and remains Spanish Catholicism.
However, major African influences are also found in the everyday practices of the population.
This phenomenon is called santeria in Cuba and espiritismo in Puerto Rico, and similar variants occur in much of the Caribbean basin (including, of course, in non-Hispanic areas such as Haiti and Jamaica).
Again, as in the rest of Latin America, formal observance of Catholicism was mandated, and non- Catholic religious practices were often veiled in Catholic terms.
In most of the Caribbean, there are significant groups of people who use primarily Yoruba-origin religious rites supplicating water, fire and wind spirits.
Most of the original African deities have also assumed the names of Catholic saints, e.g., Chango, Babalu), who are also known as Santa Barbara and San Lazaro.
Cuban home altars often possess both a White and a Black Virgin, and it is not unusual to see the placement of the jimaguas, African spirit dolls in the same setting.
In the Puerto Rican countryside, it is not unusual to come across the ceremony of a Baquine on a Saturday night where, as in the Yoruba religion, prayers are made accompanied by drums to the air and water spirits.
These religious practices have historically been more pronounced in the lower socioeconomic strata of society, but, more recently, have gained wider acceptance in the larger population.
The African influence in Caribbean music is quite pronounced, and it is probably fair to say that Caribbean music without this influence would not exist as we know it today.
Although the original folk music of the Caribbean is in many ways derived from similar patterns in southern Spain, as in the improvisandos (originally related to the improvised nature of flamenco), and in the later danza (Puerto Rico) and danzon (Cuba), other musical styles such as the bomba, plena (Puerto Rico), guaguanco, sonmontuno, rumba, mambo (Cuba), and merengue (Dominican Republic) all have African roots.
This music clearly uses the rhythm patterns of West Africa emphasizing the drum, and the choral patterns, with a lead singer being answered with a group refrain, are also of African origin.
Modern salsa music derives from the same patterns, as does the cumbia, originally from coastal Colombia (and in its Portuguese version, the samba of Brazil).
Africans also influenced the food of the Caribbean, most importantly in the use of stews (Mondongo), root plants and cooking bananas.
Caribbean cuisine without the use of some form of banana, whether green or ripe, is virtually unthinkable, and bananas were brought to Caribbean from West Africa, as were okra, yams and peanuts.
The Puerto Rican word for a cooking banana, guineo, shows its origins in the name of the present-day West African country of Guinea.
_______________________________________________________________
Euro-Hispanic Cultural Area
Euro-Hispanic Cultural Area: The southern part of South America is culturally and genetically the most European part of the continent.
This area would encompass Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and, in its Portuguese version, southern Brazil.
Spanish language and cultural norms, of course, dominate the three listed Spanish-speaking countries, but each one of these saw significant immigration from places other than the Iberian peninsula.
Most of the indigenous population did not survive the Spanish conquest, and the African presence was quite minimal.
Immigration to the United States from this region is relatively low, probably a function of distance as well as a relatively higher standard of living.
Argentina and Uruguay, especially, experienced tremendous immigration from Italy, and some people say that up to half of their respective populations are of that origin.
The Spanish speech patterns of these countries often reflect Italian intonation patterns, and the use of the "soft" double "II" in the Spanish there, as well as the use of familiar address "che", probably stem from the Italian influence.
This speech characteristic is most pronounced among portenos, i.e., residents of Buenos Aires, and neighboring Uruguay.
Non-Hispanic immigration other than Italian has been significant in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
While the Spanish language is dominant, as well as Spanish cultural norms, major segments of the population derive from German, English, Welsh, Irish, Arabic and eastern European Jewish sources.
Argentina, for example, has the largest Jewish population in the hemisphere other than the US, and the overall mixture of immigrants approaches the US model somewhat more closely.
Polo and rugby -- brought by the English -- are a staple of Argentinean and Uruguayan society; German clubs abound; and variants on Italian food are common.
The educational system is also modeled much more on European patterns.
Indigenous influences do exist in all of these countries, notably in the ranch and farming societies of the interior.
The ubiquitous use of mate tea is native to the region, and the influence of the guarani harp music is growing.
The tango, a uniquely Argentinean musical form, has obscure origins in Buenos Aires itself, but may even have some African roots.
More recently, these countries are also experiencing increasing immigration and migration from Andean area bringing Indian and mestizo cultural patterns with them.
