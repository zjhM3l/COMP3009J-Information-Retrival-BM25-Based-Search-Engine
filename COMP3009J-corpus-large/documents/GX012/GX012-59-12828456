[t.jpg] he events of Sept. 11, 2001, have forever changed the American mind set.
No longer do Americans feel safe from attacks by terrorists.
Feelings of shock, anguish and anger combined with a real sense of violation have led to increased security measures throughout the United States in nearly every industry.
The agricultural industry has been especially affected as concerns about the use of crop dusters and agricultural chemicals have risen to a new high.
Two major cooperatives in the fertilizer industry, Farmland and CF Industries,have always been aware of potential security concerns, but both have increased their guard as security threats have become a heightened concern in a post-Sept. 11 world.
[hatches.jpg] Farmland redoubles security efforts Assessing risk, planning what-if scenarios and protecting products from illegal use have long been routine practices for Farmland Industries.
But the September 11 events, as well as the anthrax-tainted mail incidents, have generated an added security emphasis.
Before Sept. 11, Farmlands what-if scenarios may have dealt with a leak or accidental release of fuel or an agrichemical.
Now Farmland considers the threat of anthraxtainted mail or even someone flying an airplane into a fertilizer manufacturing facility to create an explosion.
Preparation will make or break the response to such an event.
Scott Ast, Farmland director of worldwide security,and his team look at big-picture processes and risks.
They also serve as a resource and consultant to Farmland business units and facilities.
We want to protect all the points in the process from securing raw materials to production, storage and distribution, Ast says.
Although imagining the most elaborate what-if scenarios is part of the job, it is important to balance that with the most likely security breaches.
According to Ast, the most prevalent illegal use of a Farmland product remains the theft of anhydrous ammonia to make methamphetamine.
Transportation is another vulnerable point in the production and distribution process.
Companies such as Farmland are taking necessary precautions against theft and misuse.
Farmland drivers are more aware of their surroundings and are encouraged to lock their units and park in secure areas.
Farmland has also eliminated preloading of trucks.
Farmland security officials have attended a number of meetings between farm organizations and government agencies to discuss the chances of agriculture becoming a terrorism target.
It recommends the following suggestions for local cooperatives.
* Know your customers and escort everyone while on your property.
* Report any suspicious attempts to purchase ammonium nitrate or urea to the FBI.
* Pay close attention to product inventories and shipments.
* Conduct a full security review of your facilities.
* Construct suitable barriers around your property, such as fencing and structures.
* Park vehicles and equipment where they can be easily seen by law enforcement during regular patrols.
* Use steel doors with deadbolt locks and bar windows where appropriate.
Use high-security chains and padlocks.
* Lock vessels, containers, hoppers, tanks and equipment containing hazardous products.
* Deter vehicle ingress by using gates or bollards and chain/cable with padlocks.
* Remove hoses and use tank locks and seals for anhydrous ammonia tanks.
* Ensure security and emergency plans and procedures are in compliance with local, state and federal requirements.
Conduct quarterly drills and training exercises.
* Post Private Property No Trespassing signs along fence lines/boundaries.
* Keep an undated list of all emergency contacts.
* Maintain effective information technology security, password protection and firewalls.
* Report all suspicious activities, vehicles or persons around your property.
* Report all threats on personnel and facilities.
* Report all thefts, inventory shortages or missing products that could pose a public health or safety risk.
Keep blank bills of lading and order forms secured.
Keep seals and labels secured.
* Dont allow loaded, unattended, unsecured trailers on your site.
* Create opening and closing security checklists for employees.
* Maintain close liaison with local law enforcement and emergency responders.
Ask for extra law enforcement patrols and give them tours of your property.
* Establish a process for including neighbors and the community as part of the property security and emergency procedures.
Awareness, vigilance and common sense are all part of ensuring that ag products are used in the intended manner.
CF Industries stresses around-the-clock security At CF Industries, new security enhancements were added to complement the companys existing list of security systems and activities after Sept. 11.
Frank Buzzanca, vice president of Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) and Engineering,is the companys top security officer.
We recognize a need for heightened awareness following Sept. 11, Buzzanca said.
Weve always had a strong commitment to safety and security.
Now our focus must be stronger.
The following list of safety and security precautions were in place at CF prior to September 11: * 24-hour site security at terminal and plant locations.
* Fenced perimeters around facilities.
* Emergency shutdown systems that can be activated at stations located throughout the plants and ammonia terminals.
* Dikes surrounding liquid fertilizer storage tanks to contain the product in the unlikely event of a rupture.
* Periodic inspections of all ammonia storage tanks.
* Periodic drills with local emergency responders so they are better prepared if a major incident occurred.
* Periodic EHS audits.
* Annual meetings with law enforcement to get them familiar with CF staff and facilities.
* Annual operator safety training and refresher courses.
CF has taken new steps since Sept. 11 to enhance security at its facilities.
The following list provides a number of important new activities: * Participation in a fertilizer industry security task force to share security measures being taken.
* Contacting local, state and federal agencies to discuss new security enhancements.
* Conducting security reviews and vulnerability studies at a number of facilities in 2002, in addition to the EHS audits CF already conducts.
* Anticipating unannounced visits from the U.S. Coast Guard and other government agencies that are checking to see if proper safety measures are in place.
In 2001, the Coast Guard visited three CF locations and determined employees took proper security precautions.
CFs corporate Web site has taken on a different look following Sept. 11 as well.
Anything CF felt was too revealing from a security standpoint was taken off of its Internet site.
Employee training remains a vital component of CFs security program.
CF Industries media relations training was tested during a television reporters surprise visit to the companys Louisiana plant.
The reporter was following up on a news lead regarding reports of a suspicious vehicle in the area.
While the reporter gathered information from the plant manager,the television photographer stood near a service road and prepared to set up a camera to videotape the plant.
CF security guards promptly asked the photographer for identification.
The reporter later noted on the newscast that the company was doing a good job maintaining its security.
A strong safety culture has existed at CF for a long time, said Buzzanca.
This employee mind set is deeply rooted as a result of years of training, drills, safety audits and learning from experience, Buzzanca said.
Our employees are trained to be alert at all times.
CF also communicates periodically with residents in the communities where it operates.
Information about shelter-in-place is circulated in an effort to educate people on the steps to take if a major incident were to occur.
The companys public affairs office has monitored anti-terrorism initiatives discussed in Washington and at state capitols.
CF will work with trade associations and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety of the fertilizer industrys infrastructure and products.
The company will continue to enhance security as required to protect employees, company assets and surrounding communities.
In spite of all the new measures,though, awareness of potential threats and continued communication with the industry, the government, the community, and employees remain at the core of these cooperatives new security programs.
