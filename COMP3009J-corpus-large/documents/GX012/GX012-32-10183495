he can still remember the peaches on the trees across the field, and the corn being knee high, and how hot it was the day they fought.

American Life Histories, 1936-1940
The Battle of Gettysburg began on July 1, 1863.
Emboldened by his victory at Chancellorsville, Confederate General Robert E. Lee had decided to invade the North.
In September of the previous year, he had ventured north into Maryland where, at Antietam, the bloodiest day of the war occurred.
Lee's soldiers had been turned back, but the next summer he made another foray northward.

These images of four of the key players in the Battle of Gettysburg are from the collection Civil War Photographs, 1861-1865.
On June 30, General John Buford of the Union's Army of the Potomac and his cavalry had taken possession of Seminary Ridge west of Gettysburg.
Union General George Reynolds arrived with the First Corps on July 1 to assist Buford.
Reynolds opened the battle but was struck by a bullet and killed before noon.
His death set the tone for the day.
Both armies suffered devastating losses on the first day of the battle, but Union losses proved much greater.
While the first day of the battle was counted a Confederate victory, the tide would turn on July 2.
The battle would come to be viewed as the turning point of the Civil War.
So it ends, this lesser battle of the first day, Starkly disputed and piecemeal won and lost By corps-commanders who carried no magic plans Stowed in their sleeves, but fought and held as they could.
It is past.
The board is staked for the greater game Which is to follow . . .

Taking the Long View, 1851-1991
This photo shows the fifty-year reunion of the soldiers who fought at the Battle of Gettysburg.
William Munroe Graves recalls the stories his fellow veterans told at the seventy-five-year reunion of the Battle of Gettysburg:
Maj.- Gen. O.R. Gillette who was in Davis Brigade, Heaths Division, the Army of Northern Virginia... told of how... the Army of Northern Virginia rolled northward... to strike at Harrisburg and Philadelphia to find shoes for the rebel soldiers bare feet, and food to fill the knapsacks which were almost empty of parched corn rations.
He remembered how Lee's war-tired men came out of the valley of the Shenandoah to meet Meade's army of the Potomac as it reached out along the roads that centered like the spokes of a wheel at Gettysburg, and how they met and fought and forgot they ever needed shoes...

This collection also includes a Time Line of the Civil War.
* Mathew Brady's and his colleague's photographs document the sites and the carnage of the battles of the war quite powerfully.
However, due to the long exposure times necessary to make readable images, capturing action on film was difficult if not impossible.
The public relied on images rendered by sketch artists, printed in the news publications of the day, to get a sense of the battles.
The American Treasures of the Library of Congress exhibition contains examples of the work of sketch artist Alfred Waud.
Waud ventured dangerously close to the fighting to eloquently capture on paper perhaps more information and emotion than would have been possible with photographs.
Among the images in the collection is a sketch entitled Attack of the Louisiana Tigers on a Battery of the 11th Corps at Gettysburg which depicts an attack from the first day of the battle.

The Rough Riders Storm San Juan Hill
Colonel Roosevelt and his Rough Riders Colonel Roosevelt and his Rough Riders at the Top of the Hill (detail), Battle of San Juan, William Dinwiddie, photographer, 1898.
Portraits of the Presidents and First Ladies, 1789-Present On July 1, 1898, Theodore Roosevelt and his volunteer cavalry, the Rough Riders, stormed Kettle Hill, then joined in the capture of the San Juan Hill complex.
Thus they helped to secure a U.S. victory in the Battle of Santiago, the decisive battle of the short-lived Spanish-American War.
Recent scholarship emphasizes the heretofore underplayed role of other individuals such as ex-Confederate hero Major General Joseph Wheeler and other groups such as the 9th and 10th U.S. Calvalry (Colored) regiments.
Two days after the battle, the Spanish fleet fled the harbor at Santiago, effectively surrendering control of Cuba.
The first U.S. Marines had landed on the island on June 10.
A flamboyant personality with a taste for adventure and an appetite for competition, Roosevelt argued vociferously for war against Spain while serving as President McKinley's assistant secretary of the navy.
When McKinley declared war in 1898, Roosevelt resigned his position, organized a volunteer cavalry unit, and took it to Cuba where he could be in the thick of action.
The Rough Riders generated widespread publicity and made a national hero of the future president.
Most soldiers found their experiences in the Spanish-American War considerably less glamorous than the widely-depicted exploits of the Rough Riders.
In an American Life Histories, 1936-1940 interview, a veteran recalls his very different experiences in the war:
We spent most of our time in Chickamauga Park [in Georgia] . . . and it was nothing but a . . . fever swamp.
They lost more men there than they did in Cuba, a hell of a lot more.
They died like flies at Chickamauga.
Just because it was a battle site and a park they made it into a military camp and it killed off their own troops by the thousand.
All the fighting we did was in rough-and-tumble street brawls with the southerners, still fighting the Civil War.
We had some tough battles with them all along the line.
They still hated Yankees, especially Yanks in uniform.

Washington as It Was, 1923-1959
Pre-paid postal stamps were first issued in England in 1840.
Their use spread rapidly throughout the world.
On July 1, 1847, the United States Post Office issued its first stamps, a five-cent stamp honoring Benjamin Franklin and a ten-cent stamp honoring George Washington.
The first U.S. airmail stamps were issued to the public in 1915.
Stamp collecting soon became a popular hobby.
In 1841, The Times of London printed the advertisement of "a young lady, being desirous of covering her dressing-room with cancelled postage stamps."^1 The first lists of stamps were published in 1861, and the first books for storing stamp collections were printed the following year.
An 1889 album designed for the collection of postage stamps is available through Emergence of Advertising in America, 1850-1920.
Search on the term Duke's Postage Stamp Album to see the album's front and back covers, introductory page, a page for storing stamps and six pages which contain " . . . all the characteristic types of postage sissued by every country with the exception of this, our own . .
.."
The Duke's Postage Stamp Album presented less than 150 postage stamps.
Today, the world's major stamp catalogs list over 200,000 varieties of stamps.

John Bakken was born in 1871 at Benson, Minnesota, of Norwegian immigrants.
In 1881, his family moved near Milton, N.D., where, in 1893, he married Marget Axvig, born in Norway.
