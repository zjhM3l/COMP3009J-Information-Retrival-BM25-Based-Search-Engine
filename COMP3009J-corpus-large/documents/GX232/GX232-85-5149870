Women as Leaders 
The event was held at the State House in March and a breakfast was held in honor of the female legislators that were currently serving in the Indiana General Assembly.
Women from various organizations, businesses, and clubs across the State attended the event to network and meet with their local members of the Indiana General Assembly to discuss policy initiatives and tour the State House.
