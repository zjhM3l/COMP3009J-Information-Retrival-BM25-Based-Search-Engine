Iraq Â­ Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance Fact Sheet #11, Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 April 14, 2003 Background Â· Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated in Iraq since the 1990 in vasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Government of Iraq (GOI) manipulation of international sanctions.
In 1996, the GOI accepted the U.N. Oil-forFood Program (OFF), after which humanitarian conditions improved.
Â· Between 1991 and 1996, the U.S. Government provided nearly $794 million in humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) in northern Iraq.
Â· Since 1996, revenues from OFF have provided food, medicine, and other civilian goods to assist vulnerable Iraqis.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan noted in a letter to the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), that the GOI has ordered and paid for food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies under OFF that have not yet been delivered.
Â· The World Food Program (WFP) estimates that 16 million Iraqis --approximately 60 percent of the total population--rely solely on food rations distributed through OFF in order to meet household needs.
Â· On March 20, 2003, coalition forces began military operations in Iraq.
As a result of the conflict, the U.N. Secretary General suspended the OFF food distribution system.
On March 28, the UNSC unanimously passed resolution 1472 that allows the U.N. to administer Iraq's OFF program for 45 days (until May 12).
As the U.N. takes over the OFF program, WFP's first priority is to contact recently active suppliers able to rapidly provide food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies.

Baghdad and Baghdad Governorate Â· Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported on April 11 that the two members of their six-person international person team in Baghdad who had been missing since April 2 have been found.
They remain in Baghdad where they will reunite with their fo ur other MSF colleagues.
The MSF representative in Kuwait City reported to the DART that MSF restarted its Baghdad operations on April 11, which had been suspended after the two members were discovered missing.
Â· During the overnight hours of April 11 - 12, t wo Kuwait Air Force C- 130s flew to Baghdad International Airport from Kuwait City to deliver 24 metric tons (MT) of medical supplies for hospitals and health clinics in the Baghdad area.
The medical supplies have been secured in an airport hanger until needs assessments can be conducted at local medical centers and security conditions in Baghdad improve.
The U.S. military's 1st Medical Corps will assume responsibility for the distribution of the medical supplies.
Â· According to an April 12 report from t he International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), the Medical City hospital complex and Al Kindi hospital in Baghdad have been looted, leaving completely disorganized triage and emergency room care.
At Medical City, ICRC staff observed only a few surgeons and nurses for more than 300 patients.
ICRC reports that increased security in Baghdad hospitals is most important need at this time.
Â· According to ICRC, looting throughout the city has negatively impacted the city's water supply system.
In the ICRC report, the Baghdad Water Authorities (BWA) reported the total loss of all their warehouse materials, including spare parts for maintaining the water supply system.
According to ICRC, water treatment plants are operational at only 40 to 50 percent of their capacity, but due to low industrial demand this may be enough to meet the basic needs of the population.

USAID encourages cash donations because they: allow aid professionals to procure the exact items needed (often in the affected region); reduce the burden on scarce resources (such staff time, wa rehouse space, etc); can be transferred very quickly and without transportation costs; support the economy of the disaster-stricken region; ensure culturally, dietary, and environmentally appropriate assistance.
