After an extensive assessment in December by members of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) Police Department was re-accredited at a ceremony in Greensboro, North Carolina, on March 24, 2001.

These standards cover operations of the Department in the areas of role, responsibilities, and relationships with other agencies, organizations, management and administration, personnel structure, personnel process, operations, operational support, traffic operations, prisoner and court-related activities, auxiliary, and technical services.
The Department received high marks for its work crime analysis, work force demographics, its Property and Evidence unit, and community oriented policing.
