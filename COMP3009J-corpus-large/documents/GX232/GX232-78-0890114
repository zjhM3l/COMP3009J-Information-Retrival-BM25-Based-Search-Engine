2002 Recycled Water Task Force FUNDING/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper November 12, 2002 Introduction The 2002 Recycled Water Task Force, established by Assembly Bill 331 (Goldberg), was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Davis on October 7, 2001 (Water Code Section 13578).
The Task Force is a cooperative effort of the California Department of Water Resources, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the Department of Health Services.
The Task Force is charged with evaluating the current regulatory framework and to identify the opportunities, obstacles and disincentives to the safe use of recycled water.
The recommendations of the Task Force must be reported to Legislature by July 1, 2003.
Organized and administered by the Department of Water Resources, the Task Force is chaired by Richard Katz, a member of the State Water Resources Control Board.
The Task Force is composed of water recycling policy makers, including experts on the safe and beneficial uses of recycled water.
Additional participants include federal, State and local government representatives, community participants, and environmental, industrial, and academic representatives.
The Task Force established the following six workgroups to perform in-depth evaluations of specified issues listed in Appendix A. Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Science 
This white paper is the product of the Funding/CALFED Coordination Workgroup charged with examining funding issues and making recommendations for improving funding opportunities for the public water recycling projects.
This is in accordance with Section 1 (b) (5) of AB 331 that states: The need to augment state water supplies using water use efficiency strategies identified in the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.
In its report pursuant to subdivision (a) the department shall identify ways to coordinate with CALFED to assist local communities in educating the public with regard to the statewide water supply benefits of local recycling projects and the level of public health protection ensured by compliance with uniform statewide water recycling criteria developed by the State Department of Health Services in accordance with Section 13521.
Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 1 of 9
Water recycling is a major part of the CALFED Programmatic Record of Decision, August 28, 2000.
CALFED implementation agencies that participate in the funding of water recycling projects currently forecast the amount of funding their programs receive from proposed legislation.
These agencies include the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR).
Thus, the Funding/CALFED Coordination workgroup in its deliberation and evaluation among other issues, considered the following items: i. ii. iii. iv. CALFED Programmatic Record of Decision Implementation Plan.
Recommendations of the Southern California Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse Study.
Recommendations of northern California water and wastewater agencies prepared by the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta area water recycling program.
Case studies and other efforts that have been or are being conducted to further advance the safe use of recycled water in California and elsewhere.
The Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup is distinct from the Economics Workgroup in that the former is focused on the process to provide funding for water recycling projects.
The later, meanwhile, addresses the economics issues related to performing cost and benefit analysis for water recycling projects.
It is anticipated that the cost/benefit information developed will be useful in refining the funding process recommendations.
The Role of CALFED in Statewide Water Recycling Efforts The CALFED Bay-Delta Program is a cooperative effort of the State and federal agencies with management or regulatory responsibilities for the Bay-Delta.
The Water Use Efficiency (WUE) Program is an integral part of the CALFED initiative.
The program is dedicated to accelerating the implementation of cost-effective actions to conserve and recycle water throughout the state.
A key strategy Â­ articulated in CALFED's, August 2000, Record of Decision (ROD) - is to implement an incentive-based program that provides grants for actions contributing to CALFED objectives but are not locally cost-effective.
Consistent with the Record of Decision, CALFED's strategy in coordinating water recycling grants and loans is to validate cost and performance of recycling projects, and to ensure that projects are selected in an open and scientifically credible process.
Local Role in Funding of Water Recycling Projects Local agencies are key in the funding and development of water recycling projects.
In addition to the operating agency's contribution, local funding provides Pay-for-Performance incentives.
Examples of successful Pay-for-Performance programs, that provide agencies a financial incentive to build projects, include the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's Local Resources Program and the San Diego County Water Authority's Reclaimed Water Development Fund.
In order for the Task Force to make recommendations for improvements to Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 2 of 9
funding and CALFED coordination, it will be necessary to understand the role local agencies play.
The Subcommittee agrees on the importance of acquiring data on the current status of local funding contributions to water recycling projects.
The attached matrix in, Appendix B, has been developed as an example of the way that information on local, state, and federal funding sources and their associated amounts can be identified and tracked.
The matrix, or a similar tracking tool, should be expanded to incorporate data on as many water recycling projects in California as possible.
Based on an analysis of the data contained in the tracking tool, general observations concerning current funding trends can then be developed to determine the State and federal financial support needed to further implement and encourage water recycling projects.
Recycled water marketing efforts to inform policy makers, constituents, and potential users of the benefits related to recycled water supplies are key to securing local funding and support for development of projects.
This effort should include consideration of all future sources of water (local, imported, recycled, desalinization, and conserved water), and the important role recycled water serves in the augmentation of the State's water supply.
It is recommended that an assessment of the current water recycling marketing efforts in the State be undertaken.
First, the California Division of the WateReuse Association would be asked to undertake a marketing status survey of its membership.
Additionally, the SWRCB and the DWR would survey their local agency contacts on the same topic.
Based on the information gathered, trends in marketing successes and difficulties encountered could be compiled and shared with other agencies.
Local agencies must also prioritize the funding and development of their water recycling projects.
A comprehensive review of factors included in this process must be undertaken.
Urban Water Management Plans, as well as Integrated Resource Plans, are tools commonly used by water agencies to set priorities for the identification of future water resource supply options.
These plans look at projected population growth and the need to serve new areas, as well as the types of water demand (i.e. irrigation, agricultural, commercial or industrial) to be met.
Finally, the plans evaluate the various water resource options against established planning objectives including, but not limited to, ensuring (1) supply reliability, (2) supply diversity, (3) acceptable water quality, (4) minimized cost impacts, (5) maximized supply adaptability, and (6) protection of the natural environment, while ensuring community benefits.
Wastewater agencies may consider water recycling projects as an alternative method of reducing wastewater effluent discharges, providing water for the natural habitat, or decreasing pollutant loading in a water body.
In conclusion, water recycling projects are prioritized locally based on a combination of water supply and wastewater diversion planning tools.
The Role of Regional Recycling Studies Regional recycling studies are one proven method of prioritizing funding for the identification and development of implementable water recycling projects in California.
Two very large scale regional recycling plans have been completed in the State, the Southern California Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 3 of 9
Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse Study and the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program.
These regional investigations are partnerships of local, State and federal agencies dedicated to building consensus regarding the feasible use of recycled water in their respective areas.
In addition to these very large scale plans, smaller regional plans such as the San Diego County Water Authority Regional Recycled Water System Study and the South Bay Water Recycling Long Term Master Plan have been developed.
The Southern California Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse Study and the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Programs were developed in partnership with the State and federal agencies and have already involved a significant amount of consensus in prioritizing projects.
All of these regional plans should be recognized as key information in obtaining State and federal funding.
Funding agencies should use these plans as guidance for allocating funds for water recycling projects throughout the State.
State and Federal Role in the Funding of Water Recycling Projects Various State and federal agencies within California administer funding programs to provide financial assistance for public water recycling projects.
Typically, local agencies apply for funding for such projects from programs administered by, the SWRCB, the DWR, and the USBR.
The SWRCB and DWR funding programs operate within the State CALFED funding umbrella.
The federal funds appropriated to the USBR are administered for projects throughout the state.
They are not federal appropriated funds from within the CALFED agency.
Currently, USBR recycling and reuse funds are appropriated under the authority of the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act of 1992 (Title XVI of Public Law 102575 as amended).
Additionally, funding from the United States, Corps of Engineers has been appropriated on a project basis for specific use in Southern California.
The Subcommittee has identified an absence of coordination among State and federal funding sources for water recycling efforts.
The Subcommittee examined the characteristics of the three major funding programs and recommends coordinating efforts among the programs to assist local agencies in acquiring State and federal funds for local projects.
Each State and federal funding programs has a different application process and no requirements exist for the agencies to coordinate their funding efforts.
Having such variation in funding is beneficial if the different processes results in more funding for water recycling, thereby serving the different water recycling projects statewide.
However, the varying processes can be cumbersome to local applicants seeking funding from multiple sources.
The following sections describe the State and federal funding programs available to local agencies.
I. State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Program Through its Office of Water Recycling, the SWRCB administers a continuous application process that commits funding to applicants for planning, design and construction of water recycling projects on a "first-ready, first-served" basis.
Funding is available for applicants with projects that increase (augment) the State and/or local water supply through the Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 4 of 9
increased use of water recycling.
A funding priority list including all potential recycled water projects is maintained.
A continuous funding application process is beneficial for water recycling projects that include a critical timing element.
Examples include: (1) Regional Water Quality Control Board and/or Department of Health Services mandated deadline (2) Established users currently in need of recycled water (3) Urgency to make additional potable water available by augmenting the water supply with recycled water (i.e. development, drought years, etc), and (4) Construction of facilities with other concurrent capital improvement projects Additionally, the SWRCB offers grant funding for facility planning studies.
The local agency must equally match planning grant funds with a local funding match.
Activities that are eligible for facility planning grant funds include planning efforts to determine: (1) (2) (3) (4) Preliminary project construction, operation and maintenance costs Proposed revenue program needed to support the estimated project costs Recycled water users and demands Preliminary agreements or mandatory use ordinances necessary to assure recycled water usage, and (5) Draft environmental documents in accordance with State and federal environmental laws.
Upon completion of a final project report including the information gathered during the planning stage of the project, the SWRCB offers design and construction funding to applicants ready to proceed with the development of construction contract documents, and then construction.
Funding is released to the funding recipient on a construction reimbursement basis.
II.
Department of Water Resources Program In contrast to the SWRCB's continuous application process, the DWR offers a competitive funding process.
Upon appropriation of funding, the DWR issues a Request-For-Proposal (RFP).
Applicants interested in funding must submit the required information by an announced deadline.
Proposals are evaluated and funding recipients identified.
Projects are rated based on four primary criteria: (1) (2) (3) (4) Costs and benefits Technical/scientific merit Qualifications of the applicants and cooperators, and Outreach, community involvement and acceptance.
Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 5 of 9
The benefits derived from a competitive process are not necessarily to the projects, but to the overall statewide recycling efforts.
The competition established in an RFP process improves the quality of projects funded.
By comparing various proposals, the process allows for projects with the greatest benefit to be selected (i.e. the lowest cost to the State per acrefeet/year of recycled water).
The DWR recognizes that water recycling is emerging as a major component of water resources management.
The DWR, through its Water Recycling and Desalination Branch, provides technical assistance through statewide coordination, partnerships, regional studies and planning, and data collection to include the following objectives: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Provide technical, biophysical and engineering-oriented knowledge on water recycling and desalination issues Support, promote, and provide outlets for scientific research on water recycling production and use Inform policy makers, legislators, and regulators of water recycling opportunities and impediments Increase the public awareness, image, and credibility of water recycling projects Play an integral part of CALFED's Water Use Efficiency Common Program, and Help locals with information in water recycling planning process.
III.
United States Bureau of Reclamation: Title XVI Designated Funding Program A USBR water recycling project is defined as a project that reclaims and reuses municipal, industrial, domestic, or agricultural wastewater, or naturally impaired groundwater and/or surface waters.
Project water can be used for a variety of purposes including environmental restoration, fish and wildlife, groundwater recharge, municipal, domestic, industrial, agricultural, power generation or recreation.
The USBR provides funding for both the planning and construction of recycling and reuse projects.
Planning funds may be made available for either appraisal or feasibility level study efforts.
The local sponsor can, by itself or in cooperation with USBR, initiate the planning of a Title XVI project.
The USBR may cost share in these efforts, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Federal construction funds are provided only for projects specifically authorized by Congress pursuant to the various sections of Title XVI of Public Law 102-575, as amended.
Typically, the USBR makes a funding recommendation on construction of authorized projects in the President's annual budget request to the Congress.
Projects not yet authorized for construction will require specific congressional authorization before USBR requests appropriated funds from Congress through the Title XVI program.
Projects funded by Title XVI must meet the following requirements prior to receiving federal funding from USBR: (1) A feasibility report that complies with the provisions of Title XVI must be completed by USBR or the non-federal project sponsor, (2) The Secretary has determined that the non-federal project sponsor is financially capable of funding its share of the project's costs; and Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 6 of 9
(3) The Secretary has approved a cost-sharing agreement with the non-Federal project sponsor which commits the non-Federal project sponsor to funding its proportionate share of the project's construction costs on an annual basis.
In addition, the project must be in compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws acquire construction funding.
After the requirements above have been met, both the USBR and the funding recipient sign an agreement.
Funds are typically disbursed during construction on a reimbursement basis.
Once funding is identified for a project in the Title XVI Program, the local agency project may also be eligible for funding from other federal sources including CALFED funding.
The example here is that if the Title XVI project is identified to receive $15.0 million and only $5.0 million has been appropriated through the Title XVI appropriation, the remaining $10.0 million could be made available through CALFED/Federal funding as long as the total federal share of the project does not exceed 25 per cent of the total project cost or $20.0 million which ever is lower as referenced in Section 1631(d).
However, non-Title XVI projects can not receive federal funding from appropriated Title XVI funds.
The procedures followed by the USBR in carrying out the provisions of the Title XVI program are provided for in the authorizing legislation.
Recommendations Greater water recycling benefits can be achieved with coordination among agencies that serve as funding sources for water recycling research, studies, and projects.
There are many direct and indirect benefits from water recycling projects.
To ascertain all the benefits, such as, monetary savings, yield (Ac-Ft), and potable water savings that result from each project, more information is required.
Proper coordination can assist local agency efforts in finding the correct balance of funding to meet specific project financial needs.
To achieve coordination among funding sources, the Subcommittee recommends the following: 1.
A revised funding procedure shall be developed to provide local agencies with assistance in potential State and federal funding opportunities.
The SWRCB will facilitate the establishment of a Committee to implement the recommendations of this report.
Assistance and guidance will be provided to such agencies as follows: A.
The SWRCB will facilitate a newly established Water Recycling Funding Coordination Committee (Committee) to coordinate applicant funding needs with the appropriate funding agencies.
The members of the Committee will include representatives from the SWRCB, DWR, USBR, CALFED, the California WateReuse Association and other stakeholders.
In reviewing and developing recommendations to provide the technical assistance/support and the funding solicitation process, the Committee will solicit input from local agencies that have received state and federal funding for recycled water projects.
The Committee will guide the local agency through the identification of: Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 7 of 9
(1) Correct funding source(s), (2) Accountability measures to be placed on the funding recipient to assure delivery of recycled water, and (3) Monitoring and assessment reporting requirements to be implemented after completion of the funded project.
B.
The Committee will establish quantifiable objectives to be used in the review of a proposed project.
Objectives shall include: 1) the local, regional, and state benefits, and; 2) non-water supply benefits, resulting from the project.
When reviewing proposed projects, the Committee will recommend modifications to maximize the benefit to the State's water supply.
C.
The Committee will work cooperatively with the SWRCB and USBR, streamlining project selection while ensuring an open and transparent process for setting selection criteria, peer review and public review of the project selection will also be provided.
The Committee will work to ensure that projects have an appropriate level of scientific review, and ongoing monitoring and data analysis.
D.
The Committee shall maintain a listing of State and federally funded projects.
This list should build upon the preliminary list provided in Appendix C.
The list of projects should include detailed project cost and water supply yield information including annual cost and yield, similar to the detail provided in Appendix B.
The list should also, to the extent possible, include locally funded projects.
2.
State funding agencies will use information from completed regional studies when determining the prioritization of funding requests.
3.
Public information to support education and outreach efforts will be provided by having funding agencies: A. Present public funding availability at statewide conferences, and B. Establishing an Annual Water Recycling Funding Information Workshop to assist participants in preparing funding application packages 4.
The SWRCB and USBR should be provided with the resources to perform comprehensive analysis of past recycling performance (costs and benefits) and projection of future performance.
The SWRCB and USBR should conduct these analyses jointly in an open and peer-reviewed process.
These analyses should quantify recycling water yield in acre-feet per year and delineate yield from potential or planned.
The analyses should list other benefits of recycling (such as water supply reliability), and where possible to quantify these benefits.
The analyses should provide costs in equivalent units such as equivalent annual cost.
The estimate of past performance should be based upon a database of recycling projects including projects that have received State and federal funding and attempt to list other projects as well.
The database should include the level of detail listed in Appendix B.
Funding/CALFED Coordination Subgroup White Paper Page 8 of 9
5.
Funding sources should be expanded to include sustainable State funding for the DWR's water recycling, technical assistance and research, including flexibility to work on local and regional planning process, on-going studies of emerging issues, and new technology.

Notes: Source of Information: This information was provided by the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA) and San Francisco Public Utility Commission (SFPUC).
This list of projects is not comprehensive or representative, but is a readily available sample used to demonstrate the level of project detail that could be collected.
This summary includes five projects in the San Diego County Water Authority and two projects in the San Francisco Public Utility Commission's jurisdiction.
Many of the local funding sources are not given.
Loans from state and federal agencies would be local costs and are not included in the data sheets provided.
Some of the projects may be considered treatment projects as opposed to recycling projects.
The verified demand includes only recycled water that SDCWA provides incentives for (or counts) and may be only for 2002.
The average verified demand is the quantity received from the local agency.
This number was calculated by the agency and not verified with SDCWA.
Capital costs are in dollars and could not be verified for total capital cost for the life of the project.
Other costs were included and not defined.

Notes: SWRCB Source: This information was obtained from Office of Water Recycling, Water Reclamation Loan and Construction Programs.
Included are the projects from the, 1984, 1988, 1996, and 2000 Bond Laws that were awarded state funding after 1991.
The Planned Yield (AF/Yr) provides an estimate of the amount of wastewater expected to be recycled.
In most cases, this amount has not been verified.
This information is considered preliminary and subject to change, since, agencies had limited time to review this tabulated information, some projects may be listed more than once.
USBR Source: The Southern California Area Office, USBR supplied information from the Southern California Water Recycling Projects Initiative (started in 2000).
These are planned projects solicited from the local agencies by USBR.
