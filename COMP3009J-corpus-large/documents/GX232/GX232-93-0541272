SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Fish and Wildlife Service's threatened and endangered species program.
To help guide the recovery effort, the Service prepares recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions that may be necessary for conservation of these species, establish criteria for the recovery levels for reclassification from endangered to threatened status or removal from the list, and estimate the time and cost for implementing the needed recovery measures.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. et seq.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species.
Section 4(f) of the Act requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during the recovery plan development.
The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan.
The Service and other Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
The Multi-Species Recovery Plan identifies the recovery and restoration needs of 68 threatened and endangered species and their habitats in the South Florida Ecosystem--an area

Some are endemic to this area, others range outside of South Florida, and some of the species included in this plan migrate through or winter in South Florida.
These species use every
vegetative, terrestrial, and aquatic community present in South Florida.
The status of these species varies, although very few show an increasing trend.

The Service has completed recovery plans for many of these species at various times between 1980 and 1996 to identify actions necessary to effect recovery.
The ivory-billed woodpecker, Bachman's warbler, silver rice rat, Key Largo woodrat, and Key Largo cotton mouse do not have approved recovery plans.
Since the approval of many of the recovery plans for South Florida species, identified tasks have been completed, and new information has become available on the biology, distribution, life history, and needs of these species.
In addition, some species with a South Florida population had no tasks identified for recovery in this area.
This plan updates some existing recovery plans, serves as the recovery plan for other species, or identifies South Florida's contribution to recovery.
The plan also addresses new threats and needs for all the species identified within it.
This plan is Volume I of a two volume effort to identify recovery needs of the species of South Florida and the ecosystems upon which they depend.
The focus of Volume I is the individual species, while Volume II integrates the species needs with those of the vegetative communities in which they reside.
