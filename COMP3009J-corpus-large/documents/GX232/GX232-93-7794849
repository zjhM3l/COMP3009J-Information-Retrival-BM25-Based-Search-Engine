Inspection of Process Cheese Operations.
(Form DA - 151 - 8)
Even though plants may have a USDA approved status, much of the equipment used in the manufacture of process cheese has not been subjected to detailed design review and acceptance procedures.
Many contacts with equipment manuf acturers have resulted in modification and improvements to equipment designs.
However, a great deal remains to be done, so it is important that any additional new or unreviewed equipment is documented on the survey report so that the progress can continu e.
Some eq uipment is covered b y a "grandfather" exemption.
Exemptions should be verified with the National Field Office.
Storage 
See the guidelines for Item B50--Room Construction - Tempering and Item B51--Room Construction - Cooler(s).
Cheese tempering shall be done in an area that is clean and properly maintained.
If the area is dirty or otherwise unfit for use as a tempering room, recommend the area be cleaned or the tempering be moved to an appropriate area.
Item K2--Lighting 
See the guidelines for Item B54--Lighting 
Item K3--Storage Temperature (58.126d, e, 58 .412).

Sanitary designs include; double seals (with 1-inch of clear space between them, provided the space between the seals is not in the product zone); doubling the length of the shaft so the part that enters the cylinder never extends over the product zone; and other options.
If you have any doubts or questions concerning the design, contact the National Field Office for assistance.
This deficiency does not have a "grandfather " exemption.
If the cylinder shaft is clean, assign this deficiency to Category D.
If the cylinder shaft is not clean, assign it to Categ ory C. Steel wires are often used in harps because of breakage problems with stainless steel wires.
Such nonstainless steel wires should not be criticized if maintained in a clean and rust free condition (a light coating of mineral oil after cleaning will prevent rust).
Dirty or rusty wires are unsatisfactory, recommend cleaning or replacement.
Item K22--Grinders or Extruders (58.128a , 58.708, 58.726).
Even though grinde rs may be la rge, heavy pieces of equipment, arrange for dismantling to the extent necessary to determine if it is clean and in good repair.

Item K28--Ground Cheese Blenders (58.128a , 58.727).
Dismantle and inspect the ribbon shaft seals for cleanup and condition.
The seals shall be accessible for cleaning.
This will usually require split seals that are removable for hand cleaning.
Adequate manual cleaning can sometimes be obtained with seals that are not split by pushing them along the shaft away from the blender to clean them.
Seals made of braided material are not acceptable (category C).
The ribbon flights and blender interior will sometimes rub together which leaves the interior of the blender scored and the ribbons with knurled or wire edges.
If this has happened, recommend these areas be polished.
Depending on the extent of the damage the deficiency can be assigned to category B, C, or D (use your judgement based on the potential contamination of the product by metal).
Also, recomm end chec king and, if necessa ry, replacing the bearings.
Blenders are oft en placed directly ab ove the cooker or a transfer hopper so that when the doors open the cheese flows by gravity out of the blender.
If this is the case, the doors and all areas directly above the exposed product areas shall meet product contact requirements (No. 4 finish, no rough welds, threads, or crevices, etc.) or be adequately shielded.
Older blenders that have Page K-9 September 1, 1999
DA INSTRUCTION NO. 918- PS a "grandfather" exemption may require some modifications to meet this requirement.
If the deficiencies are related to the obsolete design assign them to category D. However, if the deficiencies are related to a lax sanitation or maintenance routine, or const itute a possible public health hazard, assign them to category A, B, or C as appropriate.
