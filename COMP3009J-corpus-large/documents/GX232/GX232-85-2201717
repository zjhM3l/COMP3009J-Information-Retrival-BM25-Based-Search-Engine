Department of Aviation Has Local School Flying High on Aviation Community Outreach program a success The Virginia Department of Aviation embarked last year on a community outreach initiative.
This community initiative has been put in place to help strengthen the Department's partnerships in the community.
The community outreach initiative started by employees at the Department is the Adopt-A-School program.
This has allowed the Department to develop a relationship with Donahoe Elementary School's second through fifth grade by giving the staff a chance to mentor a class, raise awareness about aviation to youth and help boost academic performance.
Numerous Department employees have commitments to the program allowing all classes to have a designated Department employee throughout the school.
These visits are accomplished through lunch and classroom visits and various other school sponsored activities.
"The Department of Aviation has been wonderful to work with," said Donahoe Principal Dr. Henry (please see School cont. on pg. 8)

Middle Peninsula Regional Airport Hires New Manager At its monthly meeting recently, the Middle Peninsula Airport Authority announced the hiring of William T. Gaylord of Manteo, N.C. as the Middle Peninsula Regional Airport manager.
Gaylord, who retired from the Air Force in 1985, has served as director of the Dare County Regional Airport for more than a decade.
He is a board member of the North Carolina Airports Association.
He holds a bachelor's degree in business administration with a minor in education.
"As current airport manager, I'm absolutely thrilled to see him take over," said Anthony Romanello, West Point town manager who has been running the airport as well.
Gaylord was offered the job last month from a field of 56 applicants.
The new manager began his duties May 1.
West Point owns the airport, which actually is just outside the town limits in King and Queen County.
Its sale to the authority is in its final stages.
The authority consists of West Point and the counties of Gloucester, King and Queen and King William.
Each member will pay annual dues of about $19,000 in addition to a share of the $3 million estimated cost for airport improvements and operation over 15 years.
Federal and state funding totaling about $5 million is also expected to help get the airport off the ground.
Built in World War II to train pilots, the airport now serves private aircraft.
The authority hopes to attract corporate planes and charter services.
It's envisioned as a selling point for Middle Peninsula communities in their efforts to draw new industry to the area.
The Middle Peninsula Regional Airport is a public, general aviation airport located approximately two miles Southeast of the Town of West Point, off of Virginia Route 33.
Centrally located in the Middle Peninsula region, the airport lies within a 25 minute drive to the majority of businesses and population located on the Middle Peninsula.
The airport also has direct access to the site of the future Middle Peninsula Regional Industrial Park, which is to be developed on land adjacent to the airport.
The airport has a 3,700 foot runway and a full length parallel taxiway.
The airport averages about 21 flights a day, with 29 aircraft based there.
Other airport facilities include a terminal building, fueling station (100LL), corporate hangar, and five T-hangar units.
Future plans for the airport include extending the runway to 4,300 feet, expanding the terminal building, installing new fuel facilities, and installing additional navigation aids.
Other available services are agricultural spraying and skydiving.
