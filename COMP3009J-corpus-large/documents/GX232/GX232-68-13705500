Overview of Home Economics Careers and Technology Programs Preparing students for living in the twenty-first century and earning a living in careers representing California's key industries is the mission of Home Economics Careers and Technology (HECT) education.
HECT education prepares students to become positive, productive members of the workforce, families, and the community through two complementary instructional programs: Consumer and Family Studies (CFS) and Home Economics Related Occupations (HERO).
At the elementary school level, students begin developing an awareness of HECT education, including key topics in CFS and related careers.
In the middle grades, six through eight, courses provide an opportunity to explore personal life management skills and careers related to HECT.
At the high school level, CFS courses provide a foundation that enables students to pursue a career path option through a HERO program in one of eight areas.
These vocational and technical courses combine with academic courses to form a sequence of learning that supports rigorous, standards-driven instruction focusing on one or more career pathways.
Students apply classroom learning throughout the sequence in conjunction with work-based learning experiences in the home, community, and workplace.
HECT education uniquely links the application of science, technology, career-technical, and life management skills to prepare students for careers and for managing work and family roles.
Students who complete a HECT career pathway course sequence are well prepared to succeed in entry-level employment, career advancement, or advanced education in colleges or universities.
This document contains HECT content standards for grades nine through twelve for both CFS and HERO programs.
These standards reinforce, expand, and apply academic knowledge and skills.

Overview of Home Economics Careers and Technology Programs
Home Economics Careers and Technology Program Components HECT education includes three interlocking components: CFS, HERO, and FHA-HERO.
Instruction is designed to include the two complementary instructional programs that integrate FHA-HERO leadership and career development activities.
Chart 1.1, "Relationship of Content Areas to Career Pathways," illustrates the unique relationship between CFS content areas and HERO career path programs.
Consumer and Family Studies A Consumer and Family Studies (CFS) program equips students with life management, transferable, and employability skills through instruction and leadership development activities in seven content areas: child development and guidance; consumer education; family living and parenting education; fashion, textiles, and apparel; food and nutrition; housing and furnishings; and individual and family health.
This program focuses on preparing students to balance personal, family, and work responsibilities and provides beginning and specialized courses in the career pathways.
Home Economics Related Occupations Home Economics Related Occupations (HERO) programs are the capstone courses designed to prepare students for careers in eight pathways: child development and education; consumer services; family and human services; fashion design, manufacturing, and merchandising; food science, dietetics, and nutrition; food service and hospitality; hospitality, tourism, and recreation; and interior design, furnishings, and maintenance.
These career pathways reflect the labor market needs of California's major industries in the twenty-first century.
FHA-HERO FHA-HERO is the pre-professional organization for HECT students that is integral to both instructional programs.
FHA-HERO provides co-curricular leadership and career development opportunities based on classroom instruction.
Effective programs employ FHA-HERO as a teaching strategy for developing interpersonal, leadership, citizenship, and career skills.

* FHA-HERO leadership and career development are integral to the instructional program for grades six through twelve.
** This content area may be offered as a part of several career pathways.
Organization and Characteristics of the Content Standards Home Economics Careers and Technology standards are organized into nine sections.
The first section identifies content standards for the seven Consumer and Family Studies content areas and for transferable and employability skills.
The eight sections that follow address the Home Economics Related Occupations capstone courses that complete the career pathways.
A brief description of the curricular focus and format of the standards introduces each section.
Standards for both CFS and HERO programs contain the following components: Title of the standard: The title of each standard identifies the concept addressed in the content.
Statement of the standard: Each standard addresses broadly what a student should know.
Benchmarks: Statements listed below each standard describe what students should be able to do to meet the broad standard.

Overview of Home Economics Careers and Technology Programs
The HECT content standards were developed by representatives from business, industry, the community, and all levels of education to ensure rigor, to reflect current practices and trends, and to address current and projected labor market needs.
Use of the Content Standards Content standards provide direction for curriculum decisions about instructional goals, objectives, content, teaching strategies, learning experiences, and assessment.
The standards serve as a guide for developing and revising curriculum to ensure that it is current and relevant.
In addition, these standards serve as a tool for collaborating with instructors in other disciplines to design interdisciplinary projects that reflect the content of the standards for each of the disciplines that are involved.
Standards also guide the content of new courses and course sequences to avoid unnecessary duplication in the various levels of education.
They also may direct decisions about appropriate professional development activities designed to upgrade the skills and knowledge of current instructors and to prepare future instructors to become effective educators.
(See the appendix, "Overview of HECT Course Sequences, Grades Nine Through Twelve," for information about developing career pathway course sequences.)
Content standards form the foundation for assessing student achievement.
They identify the content to be assessed and suggest strategies for assessing student achievement.
Classroom-based assessment, such as tests, demonstrations, portfolios, and projects, should address the skills, attitudes, and behaviors defined in the standards.
These content standards will also be used in the development of statewide examinations for selected HECT programs through the Assessments in Career Education (ACE) program.
Students who achieve a high rating on this examination will receive a seal on their high school diplomas and transcripts to indicate outstanding achievement.
By basing curriculum and assessment on content standards that reflect current programs and all aspects of an industry, students will be effectively prepared with knowledge, skills, and behaviors to enter postsecondary education and a career related to Home Economics Careers and Technology and progress to technical-level or professional-level positions.
Technical assistance and resources for implementing standards-based course sequences and programs for Home Economics Careers and Technology education are available from the Home Economics Careers and Technology Unit, Standards and High School Development Division, California Department of Education.
Consumer and Family Studies

Over view of Consumer and Family Studies Programs
The Consumer and Family Studies (CFS) program in grades nine through twelve teaches skills for balancing personal, family, and work responsibilities and provides the foundation for entering Home Economics Related Occupations (HERO) programs or advanced education in related fields.
Students gain life management skills through leadership and career development and instruction in seven content areas: child development and guidance; consumer education; family living and parenting education; fashion, textiles, and apparel; food and nutrition; housing and furnishings; and individual and family health.
The highlighted portions of Chart 2.1, "Home Economics Careers and Technology Education Career Pathway Options," illustrate the consumer and family studies courses that may be included in HECT career pathways.
The CFS portion of a career pathway course sequence includes both the comprehensive core and specialized content area courses.
The CFS Comprehensive Core courses (Life Management I and II) provide an introduction to HECT and serve as a foundation for all the HECT career pathways.
The Comprehensive Core provides instruction in all seven content areas.
At minimum, a one-year introductory Comprehensive Core course (Life Management I) should be taught during grades nine or ten to build foundation skills for career pathway instruction.
The second yearlong advanced Comprehensive Core course (Life Management II) enables students to acquire an in-depth knowledge in each of the content areas.
The two courses combine to contribute the background necessary for students to master the identified standards in all seven content areas.
Specialized content area courses address only one CFS content area, expanding the knowledge, skills, and attitudes learned in the Comprehensive

Core.
For example, a nutritional science course augments learning in the food and nutrition unit of a Comprehensive Core course.
These courses enable students to gain depth in a content area of interest to them and enhance their preparation for entry into a HERO career pathway capstone program and a related postsecondary certificate or degree program in a school district or regional occupational center program (ROCP).
Effective programs incorporate FHA-HERO as a teaching strategy for developing interpersonal, leadership, citizenship, and career skills.
FHAHERO, the pre-professional organization for students, provides co-curricular leadership and career development opportunities that address content standards in all CFS instructional programs.
Organization and Characteristics of the Consumer and Family Studies Content Standards Representatives of the community and instructors of secondary and postsecondary education programs developed CFS standards for the seven content areas and for the transferable and employability skills.
Transferable skills, such as thinking and problem solving, are applied in all careers and personal life.
Employability skills support successful career entry and advancement in all careers.
Balancing personal, family, and work responsibilities and FHA-HERO leadership development activities is integral to the standards.
The content areas, along with the transferable and employability standards, are formatted into eight sections.
Each content area section contains standards for both the Comprehensive Core and specialized content area courses.
The transferable and employability skills standards are to be applied to and integrated with instruction of the content area standards.
They are to be assessed in conjunction with the content area standards, not in isolation.
Each standard contains the following components: Title of the standard: The title of each standard identifies the concept addressed in the content.
Statement of the standard: Each standard addresses broadly what a student should know.
Benchmarks: Statements listed below each standard describe what students should be able to do to meet the broad standard.
Benchmarks consist of two categories of statements: those that must be taught in the CFS Comprehensive Core courses and those that should be taught in specialized content courses.

The reader should note that statements in boldface type designate essential benchmarks that must be taught and assessed in the CFS Comprehensive Core.
Use of the Consumer and Family Studies Content Standards The content standards are intended for use by high school CFS instructors and administrators to plan and establish new programs or to strengthen and expand existing programs.
They provide the foundation for curriculum, instruction, and assessment.
See also the section "Use of the Content Standards," described in "Overview of Home Economics Careers and Technology Programs" at the beginning of this document.
CFS instructors and administrators will also use these standards in collaborating with instructors in the middle grades and in HERO and postsecondary education programs to articulate and sequence instruction, thereby eliminating unnecessary duplication of content in the various levels of education.
Implementing these standards at the secondary grade level will prepare students with the higher-level skills needed to enter HERO capstone or postsecondary education programs.
The appendix, "Overview of HECT Course Sequences, Grades Nine Through Twelve," contains more information about designing course sequences.
Individuals who can balance work, personal, and family responsibilities are more productive workers and can better manage all aspects of their lives.
Technical assistance and resources for implementing standards-based HECT career pathway course sequences and programs are available from the Home Economics Careers and Technology Unit, Standards and High School Development Division, California Department of Education.

Over view of Child Development and Education Career opportunities in Child Development and Education have never been greater.
Enrollment in formal preschool programs has increased by 44 percent over the past ten years, and employment of preschool workers and teachers' aides is projected to increase much faster than the average for all occupations through 2005.
Among the California occupations expected to undergo the largest growth are teachers in preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, and high school.
Those with expertise and training in meeting special needs will have an even greater employment advantage.
Some of the other job opportunities include preschool director, children's center supervisor, and child psychologist.
Teaching children and helping with their development offer unlimited opportunities for challenging and personally rewarding careers.
Child Development and Education Program A Child Development and Education program focuses on preparing students to work with children or to enter the teaching profession.
Students pursuing a career in this industry gain a solid foundation for any career that involves working with children.
Courses in a Home Economics Related Occupations (HERO) program, funded by a school district or regional occupational center program (ROCP), enable students to develop the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to interact with, guide, and instruct children of all ages.
The course of study includes awareness of the profession; professional standards; work site operational and organizational procedures; standards, licensing, regulations, and codes; safety, emergency, and disaster procedures; child growth and development; positive interaction, guidance, and discipline; developmentally appropriate practices and curriculum; nutrition and health practices; interaction with families and communities; instructional support; resources and materials; and recreational activities.
Child Development and Education students also learn employment and management skills for careers in child care and development and teaching.
FHA-HERO, a pre-professional organization for students, provides cocurricular leadership and career development opportunities in HERO instructional programs.
Effective programs incorporate FHA-HERO as a teaching strategy for developing interpersonal, leadership, citizenship, and career skills.
