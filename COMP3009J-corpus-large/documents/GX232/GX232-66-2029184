Notes for Scalable Vector Graphic Maps (SVG)
The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) map is an exciting new technology and makes panning and zooming possible without running a web server.
Size matters with these maps as they are useful for showing small areas or areas of low resolution and few features.
Users should be aware that upon opening this web page, the SVG map will be downloaded in it's entirety.
You can then interact with the map without concerning yourself with web connections.
