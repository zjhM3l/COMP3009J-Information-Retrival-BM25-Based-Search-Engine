BOARD OF PHARMACY
JANUARY 2000
President's Message by Richard Mazzoni, R.Ph. President, California Board of Pharmacy With the new millennium upon us, it is appropriate to reflect on some of the major forces that are poised to shape health care in the future.
Many of these influences are outside our traditional health care universe, but their potential impact on our practice cannot be ignored.
All concerned must consider these factors if we are to fulfill our obligations to the patients we serve.
Consider, for example, just a few: Â· THE INTERNET: This is, by far, the most significant change in the health care delivery system in history.
The online world has changed the way products and services are delivered.
Information that was previously virtually impossible to obtain is now available for anyone to access.
Your patients now are better informed about their own conditions and expect a higher level of expertise from the health care teams that treat them.
Patients are also aware that there are alternative methods of obtaining products, both over-thecounter and prescription.
This presents a challenge to both practitioners and regulators like the Board of Pharmacy.
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES: The herbal medicine explosion presents another challenge to the pharmacy profession.
We must educate ourselves on the products that our patients are using.
Some of these products have definite therapeutic uses, and, in some cases, significant drug interactions.
For example, a leading consumer magazine recently surveyed a number of pharmacies as to the safety of taking ginko biloba with warfarin.
Sadly, only a few pharmacists correctly identified the interaction.
Alternative therapies are pervasive in our society; it is vital that all of us in practice be knowledgeable about their potential benefits as well as potential harm.
Â· INCREASED PRESCRIPTION VOLUME: It is predicted that the number of prescriptions filled will almost double between 1998 and 2003.
This fact, coupled with pharmacy school enrollments that are not increasing at anywhere near the same rate, combine to create a difficult situation for practitioners and regulators.
It is imperative that boards of pharmacy consider regulations in light of these facts.
Pharmacists must take an active role in reengineering the dispensing process to add efficiency and reduce wasted time.
These are just a few of the forces at work in our profession.
Consider how they influence your practice and the patients with whom you interact every day.
Please accept my best wishes for a healthy, happy, and prosperous New Year!

Pharmacist Scope of Practice 4052 B
Â· Ordering drug therapy related laboratory tests.
Â· Administering drugs and biologicals by injection.
Â· Adjusting the drug regimen of a patient.
The bill also requires that patient records be made available to the pharmacist and that the procedures performed by the pharmacist relate to a condition for which the patient has seen a physician.
AB 924 (Committee on Public Safety), Chapter 975, 1999
Gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL) 11055, 11100 
Sections 11100 and 11377 have been amended to conform to the requirements of section 11055.
Posting Public Meeting Notices on the Internet 11125 of the Government Code--as of July 1, 2000, requires all state bodies to notice regularly scheduled public hearings at least 10 days in advance on the Internet.
This requirement will apply to the Board of Pharmacy.
[Note: the Board of Pharmacy is finalizing a new website, which will be in place before July 1, 2000.]
Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants 4076 B
In such cases, pharmacists must include the name of the nurse practitioner or physician assistant ordering the drug on the container label of any prescription.
2725.1 B
However, nurse practitioners are prohibited by their practice act from furnishing Schedule II drugs.
Other amendments of this bill permits nurse practitioners and physician assistants to: Â· Â· 4061 B

Authority to Require Pharmacy to Remain Open During RPh's Meal/Rest Breaks 4116 B
4115 B
Hospital Drug Purchases and Regulatory Mandate 4056 B
However, each hospital using this exemption must retain a pharmacist consultant to monitor and review dispensing activity in the hospital.

Law for 2000 Continued from Page 3 and the hospital is located in a rural area (as defined), and no pharmacy is available within 30 minutes or 30 miles.
The prescriber may dispense only enough to continue therapy--not to exceed a 72-hour supply-- until a community pharmacy is readily available.
SB 393 (Speier), Chapter 946, 1999 Prescription Drugs for Medicare Beneficiaries 4425 B
4426 B

SB 651 (Burton), Chapter 190, 1999 Pharmacist Wage Orders and Medi-Cal Reimbursement 1186 Labor Code--requires mandatory lunch and rest breaks for pharmacists.
However, pharmacists who qualify as administrative or executive staff are exempted from these requirements.
Prior to this bill, pharmacists were excluded from mandatory breaks because they were considered "professional" staff.
This change in law precipitated the provisions in SB 188 requiring the Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations (see Law Update, Page 10) establishing conditions under which a pharmacy may remain open while the pharmacist is on break.
Questions related to 1186 Labor Code should be directed to the California Labor Commission at (916) 323-4920.
14105.337 Welfare and Institutions Code--requires the Department of Health Services to increase the Medi-Cal dispensing fee by .25Â¢ per prescription beginning January 1, 2000, and by .15Â¢ per prescription effective July 1, 2002.

Section 11100 now limits the retail sale of over-the-counter (OTC) medication products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine to no more than three packages or no more than nine grams in a single transaction, except as discussed below.
Since, in accordance with the federal Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, most of these products are packaged in quantities of less than three grams per package, three packages of commercial products containing these substances will ordinarily not exceed the nine grams limit.
Note: a retail sale in violation of the three packages/ nine grams limit is punishable as a misdemeanor.
Reporting Requirements Section 11100 requires that manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers or other persons or business entities who sell, transfer, or

BOARD OF PHARMACY
JANUARY 2000
Ephedrine Q and A Continued from Page 7
A.
No, because the pharmacy is already licensed by the Board of Pharmacy and registered with the DEA.
Q.
Can my pharmacy sell more than three packages/nine grams OTC to the same customer in a single transaction? A.
No, unless there is a valid prescription for a greater amount/number of packages.
Q.
Is a pharmacist who dispenses more than the three packages/nine grams limit, pursuant to a prescription, required to report the transaction to the BNE? A. No.
Q.
Is a wholesaler licensed by the Board of Pharmacy required to report to the BNE transactions that exceed the limit? A.
No, if the sale is to an entity or business that is licensed by the Board of Pharmacy or by the DHS for drug products.
However, if the sale is to an individual or entity that is not licensed by the Board or DHS, the wholesaler would be required to report the sale.
In addition, any sale or transfer that is suspicious in nature must be reported to the DEA.
Q.
Where should I call to obtain information about or an application for a Precursor Business Permit and/or the reporting requirements? A. Contact the BNE at (916) 227-3955.
Q.
What do I do if I am suspicious that an individual is purchasing precursor products for the manufacture of methamphetamine? A. Report any suspicious inquiries or Â· transactions involving precursor products to your local law enforcement officials, and provide records of any suspicious transactions to the DEA.
Additionally, if you know that the purchase is for illegal purposes, to sell the product to that individual is a violation of both federal and state laws.
Q.
What does nine grams mean in a practical sense? A.
Since there are 1,000 milligrams to one gram, threshold quantities of pseudoephedrine, for example, would be: Â· Three packages of 50, 60mg. tablets equal 9,000mg.
or nine grams (3 X 50 X 60 =9,000mg.
( 1,000 = nine grams) Three packages of 100, 30mg. tablets equal 9,000mg.
or nine grams Three packages of 12, 240mg. tablets equal 8,640mg.--8.64 grams Q. Does the nine grams limit mean that the amount of ephedrine in the product being sold must not exceed that amount, or does the limit refer to the amount of the total product? A.
The limit of nine grams in a single transaction refers to the active amount of ephedrine in the product, not the product's total weight.
Q.
What should I tell my cashiers about the sales of such products? A. Because "retailer" includes anyone who represents the owner of, or operation of, a business enterprise dealing with the sale or transfer of ephedrine, etc., you should ensure that your cashiers are all aware of products containing such substances and amounts (or numbers of packages) that will exceed the limit or threshold.
Q. Am I required to post a sign limiting purchases of ephedrine products in the cough and cold section of the store, or anywhere in the store?
Â·
JANUARY 2000
BOARD OF PHARMACY
9
A. No.
A sign is not required by law; the individual business may post a sign if it so chooses.
Q.
Must I pull all OTC products containing ephedrine, etc. off the OTC shelves and keep them behind the pharmacy counter? A. No.
The law does not require that such products be placed behind the counter; however, the prudent pharmacy will obviously monitor their stock of these products for any significant theft or disappearance, and take appropriate precautions as warranted.
Q.
I work in a pharmacy within a large supermarket where OTC cough and cold medications are often, even usually, sold at the front check-out lanes, rather than at the pharmacy counter.
How can I control these sales? A.
The pharmacist is not responsible for those sales.
It is the responsibility of the retailer--the supermarket owner and operator--to ensure that the sales/reporting laws are followed, including restrictions on sales to minors, much as is required for and done with cigarette and alcohol sales.
Q. Who enforces the sales/reporting law, including the new provisions? A. Primary enforcement and administration of the law is still done by the BNE; however, any violation of the sales/reporting laws by a licensee of the Board of Pharmacy is subject to citation, disciplinary action, or other action by the Board (because the Pharmacy Law provides that Board licensees may be disciplined, etc. for violations of controlled substances laws.)

Pharmacy Manpower Forum held in Sacramento In September 1999, the Board of Pharmacy held a forum in Sacramento where more than 35 speakers expressed their opinions on whether there is a pharmacist shortage in California, and suggested ways to resolve pharmacystaffing issues.
To allow interested parties in southern California to also participate, another forum was held at the Mission Inn in Riverside on January 25, 2000.
This article summarizes only the comments made at the Sacramento meeting: the comments made at the Riverside meeting were not available in time to be included here, but will be detailed in the April issue of The Script.
All areas of the pharmacy profession were represented in Sacramento via written and/or oral comments: chain and individual pharmacies, pharmacist associations and unions, pharmacy schools and students, pharmacy attorneys, and individual pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.
There was a diversity of opinions expressed concerning the existence of a pharmacist shortage, and if such a shortage could be relieved through pharmacist licensure reciprocity with other states or by increasing the pharmacy technician/pharmacist ratio.
A frequent comment heard was that there is no actual shortage of pharmacists, but that the appearance of a shortage can be attributed to:
* a reluctance of pharmacists to work 12-14 hour shifts with no breaks, weekend and evening hours with no additional compensation; * heavy third-party payer responsibilities for the pharmacist without commensurate compensation; * the preponderance of female pharmacists, many of whom are unavailable for full-time duty; and * an inability to recruit pharmacists to work in rural area pharmacies.
Chain pharmacy representatives
encouraged the Board to consider reciprocity of pharmacist licensure between California and other states to help relieve pharmacy-staffing problems.
However, a large number of speakers were against reciprocity.
A suggestion was made that instead of lowering California testing standards by reciprocating with other states, the Board might consider increasing the number of pharmacist licensure examinations given per year.
Some speakers suggested increasing the ratio of pharmacy technicians to pharmacists in community pharmacy settings.
Others stated that although increas-
JANUARY 2000 ing the number of pharmacy technicians would appear to give the pharmacist more time to review patient medication profiles and perform patient consultation, it would actually add to their already supervisory-heavy responsibilities.
Additionally, the point was made that better-trained pharmacy technicians are needed, and the Board was encouraged to raise pharmacy technician registration standards and standardize training programs.
Another area of concern was the third-party payer responsibilities of the pharmacist and the lack of sufficient reimbursement for those activities.
To stay competitive, chain pharmacies often accept third-party payer contracts with reimbursement to the pharmacy so low that they often do not cover costs, much less provide a profit.
One speaker suggested that the Board to propose legislation regulating such contracts.
However, the Board has no jurisdiction over profit-making decisions by pharmacies unless laws are violated.
The Board wishes to express its gratitude to all those who participated in the Sacramento and Riverside forums.
Many took time off from work and some traveled across the state to participate.
Your ideas and opinions are important to the Board and are vital to any future regulations proposed by the Board.

(a) In any pharmacy that is staffed by a single pharmacist, the pharmacist may leave the pharmacy temporarily for breaks and meal periods pursuant to Section 512 of the Labor Code and the orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission without closing the pharmacy and removing ancillary staff from the pharmacy if the pharmacist reasonably believes that the security of the dangerous drugs and devices will be maintained in his or her absence.
If in the professional judgment of the pharmacist, for reasons of security or otherwise, the pharmacist determines that the pharmacy should close during his or her absence, then the pharmacist shall close the pharmacy and remove all ancillary staff from the pharmacy during his or her absence.
(b) During the pharmacist's temporary absence, no prescription medication may be provided to a patient or to a patient's agent unless the prescription medication is a refill medication that the pharmacist has checked, released for furnishing to the patient and was determined not to require the consultation of a pharmacist.
(c) During such times that the pharmacist is temporarily absent from the pharmacy, the ancillary staff may continue to perform the non-discretionary duties authorized to them by pharmacy law.

(f) The temporary absence authorized by this section shall be limited to the minimum period authorized for pharmacists by section 512 of Labor Code or orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission, and any meal shall be limited to 30 minutes.

(g) The pharmacy shall have written policies and procedures regarding the operations of the pharmacy during the temporary absence of the pharmacist for breaks and meal periods.
The policies and procedures shall include the authorized duties of ancillary staff, the pharmacist's responsibilities for checking all work performed by ancillary staff and the pharmacist's responsibility for maintaining the security of the pharmacy.

(c) Dangerous drugs or devices furnished by a manufacturer or wholesaler shall be delivered only to the premises listed on the permit; provided that a manufacturer or wholesaler may furnish drugs to an authorized person or an agent of that person at the premises of the manufacturer or wholesaler if (1) the identity and authorization of the recipient is properly established and (2) this method of receipt is employed only to meet the immediate needs of a particular patient of the authorized person.
Dangerous drugs or devices may be furnished to a hospital pharmacy receiving area provided that a pharmacist or authorized receiving personnel signs, at the time of delivery, a receipt showing the type and quantity of the dangerous drugs or devices so received.

California Counts Census 2000 Every 10 years the Census Bureau is required by the U.S. Constitution to count every person in the United States.
In midMarch, you will be mailed the official census questionnaire, and April 1, 2000 is Census Day.
The census is one of America's most significant historical events.
Thomas Jefferson was responsible for the first census conducted in 1790, so this coming March and April you will be participating in the 22nd census of the United States.
The census is important.
Census information about the population of your community and the State of California is used to make major decisions, including expenditures and services for businesses, shopping centers, roads, and schools.
In the previous census in 1990, California had the largest "undercount" (people missed by the census) compared to all other states in the nation.
As a result, we lost an estimated $2.2 billion in federal funds that rightfully should have been spent in California, primarily on health care for the elderly.
If Californians do not fully participate in the 2000 census, we could lose over $3 billion in federal funds during the next decade.
Because of the seriousness of the problem, Governor Davis signed legislation to promote the census throughout California.
In addition, Governor Davis appointed a task force, the California Complete Count Committee, to help maximize the number of Californians counted in the 2000 census.
The census is safe.
Your census information is absolutely 100% confidential.
The U.S. Census Bureau is strictly prohibited from sharing personal census information with any other individuals or organizations, public or private.
By law, your answers on the census questionnaire cannot be given to anyone, including the Internal Revenue Service, courts, police, welfare agencies or the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Confidentiality is guaranteed.
It's your future.
Don't leave it blank.
The 2000 census will involve the government's largest peacetime commitment of human resources in the history of America.
California and the U.S. Census Bureau are making unprecedented efforts to encourage everyone to participate in the census.
But these efforts will only make a difference if we respond.
So, please, when you receive your official census questionnaire in March, take a few minutes to complete the form and then mail it back promptly.
(Make sure to mail your questionnaire back to the U.S. Census Bureau so census takers won't need to come to your door.)
For additional information, call the California Complete Count Campaign in Los Angeles (323) 965-2943 or Sacramento (916) 323-3301, or visit California's web site at HYPERLINK http://www.census.ca.gov.

As a Schedule II controlled substance, Marinol prescriptions may not be refilled.
Legislation (Senate Bill 550, authored by Pat Johnston) to change Marinol to a Schedule III controlled substance is being held in the Senate for review when the legislative session begins again in January 2000.
Major law changes affecting pharmacy technicians An emergency regulation, section 1714.1 of the California Code of Regulations took effect January 1, 2000, and the Board is seeking permanent adoption.
This regulation ensures that pharmacists in single-pharmacist pharmacies will receive work free breaks and meal breaks without requiring the pharmacy to close.
The pharmacist will determine whether to close the pharmacy and remove all ancillary staff during his/her absence.
If the pharmacy remains open during the pharmacist's absence, only refill medication that the pharmacist has checked and that does not require pharmacist consultation may be handed to patients by ancillary staff.
Any duties performed by ancillary staff during the pharmacist's absence must be reviewed upon the pharmacist's return to the pharmacy.
Additionally, during the pharmacist's absence, no ancillary staff will be allowed to perform any discretionary duties or act as a pharmacist.
Beginning January 1, 2000, an applicant for pharmacy technician registration with the Board must be a high school graduate or possess a general education development equivalent pursuant to section 4202(a) Business 
Section 4115.5 B
This statute is also effective January 1, 2000.

And, in between the calls, among our other duties, we processed 48,841 pieces of incoming mail, mailed out 55,406 pieces, processed approximately 8,500 applications of all sorts, and provided approximately 152,000 newsletters, 12,000 pharmacy self-assessment forms, and 5,000 pharmacy law books.
Whew...! But help is here for the Board and for our callers.
We now have an automated answering telephone service.
The staff no longer has individual telephone numbers, so all calls to the Board must be directed to (916) 445-5014 and an extension number.
A directory with names and extension numbers will be provided by the automated system.
Because we know your calls are important, callers will not be cast adrift with only a recording to talk to-there will always be a live person available to help direct your call!
