Introduction The Louisiana Women's Policy and Research Commission, established by Executive Order No.
MJF 2000-6, issued on Februar y 16, 2000, as amended by Executive Order No.
MJF 2000-54, issued on December 1, 2000 and Executive Order No.
MJF 2001-6, issued on Februar y 9, 2001, consists of 27 women and men selected from the Louisiana Legislative Women's Caucus, state agencies, and academic and business professionals in law, education, health, and the social sciences.
The charge to the Commission is to document and monitor the status of women and girls in Louisiana; identify persistent gender-based disparities, especially in the areas of earnings potential and health care; and recommend policies that will significantly improve the quality of life for Louisiana women of all ages.
The first meeting of the Commission was held in August, 2000.
In its first year, the Commission sur veyed the state ser vices available to Louisiana women, conducted public hearings to learn about women's concerns and needs, and recommended a series of legislative and administrative actions based on these findings.
The tremendous efforts of the Louisiana Legislative Women's Caucus were critical to the enactment of legislation on many of the recommendations made by the Commission (please see page 7).
O verall, the Commission was ver y pleased with the progress made in its first year.
However, much remains to be accomplished.
The 2000 U.S. Census, along with several reports released by non-profit organizations in recent months, provide state-by-state rankings relating to many of the Commission's concerns.
According to the 2000 Census, women comprise over half (52 percent) of the population of Louisiana and head nearly 24 percent of all family households (up from 21 percent in 1990).
*
*A household includes a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.
All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family.
A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder's family in census tabulations....Not all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.

Louisiana women rank 50th in the ratio of women to men's earnings with Louisiana women earning just 64.8 cents to ever y dollar earned by a man in Louisiana.
51st for women living in poverty: 19.8 percent of Louisiana women live in poverty compared to 12.2 percent nationally; 50th in the ratio of women to men's earnings with Louisiana women earning just 64.8 cents to ever y dollar earned by a man in Louisiana; 48th in the high school completion rate: 79.4 percent of women over 24 years of age completed high school in Louisiana compared to 84 percent nationally; 51st in percent of women without health insurance: 26.5 percent of Louisiana women have no health insurance compared to 13.2 percent nationally; and 50th in life expectancy, women in Louisiana have a life expectancy nearly two years below the national average of 78.81 years.
In addition, the median income for women in Louisiana is $22,000 compared to $25,000 for women nationally.
Moreover, while births to teen mothers have declined or remained constant in the U.S., with a national average of 12.8 percent, the rate in Louisiana increased from 17.6 percent in 1990 to 18.6 percent in 1997, ranking Louisiana 3rd among the states in the rate of births to teen mothers.
The 2001 edition of Making the Grade on Women's Health: A National and State-by-State Report Card ( Women's National Law Center) ranked Louisiana women's overall health 51st in a stateby-state comparison that included Washington DC - down from 50th in 2000! Women's health is intimately tied to economics, poverty, education and access to health care.
More women in Louisiana live in rural areas, have no health insurance, earn lower wages, and obtain lower education levels than women nationally.
All these factors limit access to health care, especially preventive care, and result in greater health risks and lower longevity.
According to the Women's National Law Center report, out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Louisiana ranks:

The Louisiana Women's Policy and Research Commission is working to reverse the current status of women living and working in Louisiana.
Bringing women's strengths and views into the decision making process has helped to increase awareness of the concerns for women's health, education, employment, and economic well-being.
The Louisiana legislature currently counts 23 women legislators, 16 percent of the legislative body (up from just three, or 2.1 percent, in 1990), ranking us 39th nationally in representation by women (Center for American Women and Politics).
However, with respect to the number of women in appointed policy positions, only 17.4 percent of the policy making positions in Louisiana are held by women compared to 43.7 percent nationally, ranking Louisiana 50th (Center for Women in Government and Civil Society).
The Commission needs the help of ever yone in the state, especially policy makers.
In particular, the Commission implores all appointed and elected policy leaders, at both state and local levels, to ask themselves each time they make a decision affecting their constituents: "How does this decision or piece of legislation affect women in the state? Will it benefit the education, health and economic well-being of women, and the education, health and economic well-being of the people who are in their care?"

The Commission in Januar y, 2001, sought to obtain first-hand accounts of how individual Louisiana women experience and address obstacles to their economic and educational advancement and health care needs.
Hearings were held at seven locations throughout the state.
O ver 350 people attended these hearings and some 250 provided testimony.
The details of these hearings and testimonies were included in the Commission's 2001 "Report to the Governor."
The first report by the Commission was delivered to the Governor on March 15, 2001.
Recommendations were made in the areas of: pay equity, job training, child care, transportation, teenage pregnancy, women entrepreneurs, public assistance, health education, relationship violence, breast and cer vical cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases.
An Executive Summar y of this report is available through the Louisiana librar y system.
A full copy of this report is available for inspection through the Governor's Office or the Louisiana Legislative Women's Caucus, State Capitol Building, Baton Rouge.
Outcomes from 2001 Report The Louisiana Women's Commission gained significant support and action from the Louisiana Legislative Women's Caucus and other legislators in advancing the 41 recommendations contained in its first report.
Chair Winston said the greatest progress was made in the areas of domestic violence, improvements to child care, educational and financial supports for working women, and access to health care.
Several bills filed brought about much discussion and attention to the concerns of women, such as improving insurance coverage for prescription drugs, but were defeated.
"Our greatest success however came from raising the debate in both Houses about issues of critical importance to women and their families," said Rep. Winston.
