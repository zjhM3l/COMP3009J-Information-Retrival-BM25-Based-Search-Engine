International Art Contest Virginia Winners Announced "100 Years of Powered Flight" was this year's theme The 2003 Virginia winners of the International Aviation Art Contest were chosen in early February by members of the American Society of Aviation Artists.
This year's contest theme, "100 Years of Powered Flight," asked children to illustrate their fantasies and visions of the first 100-years of flight.
In keeping with the theme, entries for the contest contained imaginative depictions of planes, space shuttles, jets, rockets and the Wright Flyer.
Each illustration was unique in perspective.
Winners of the contest were: In Category I (ages 6-9), First place, Robert F. Burke of Annandale; Second place, John Tyler Forrest of Mineral; and Third place, Drew Douglas of Montclair.
In Category II (ages 10-13), First place, Heather Burke of Annandale; Second place, Na'Quesha Mason of Smithfield; and Third place, Quaneisha Baily also from Smithfield.
In Category III (ages 14-17), First place, Russell Perkins of Norfolk; Second place, Emilie Stump of Virginia Beach; and Third place, Nathan Charles A. Ecarma of Quantico.
All winners received a plaque and an aviation related gift.

General Assembly Passes Aviation Centennial Year Resolution Designating 2003 aviation centennial year in Virginia The year 2003 has a significant place in history, for the United States and the world.
Nearly 100 years ago, great men of vision changed the course of history forever.
The 100th anniversary of man's first powered flight by the Wright Brothers in 1903 will be commemorated all year long with many exhibitions that will be held throughout the United States.
In helping to recognize the 100th anniversary, the Virginia General Assembly recently enacted a resolution that 2003 is designated as Aviation Centennial Year in the Commonwealth.
The resolution was offered by Senator Charles J. Colgan of Manassas.
To indicate the widespread support for aviation, Senator Colgan was able to get every senator and 96 out of 100 delegates to sign-on the resolution as copatrons.
This number of co-patrons is not often coming from the General Assembly.
"Virginia is excited to be honoring the Wright Brothers with this resolution," said Senator Colgan.
"The Commonwealth is committed to preserving their legacy of flight."
Virginia has a stake in the history of the Wright Brothers.
For it was at Fort Myer, Virginia, that the first military flight took place by Orville Wright in September of 1908.
Virginia is home to numerous aviation and aerospace research and development facilities and organizations, including NASA Langley Research Center.
Since 1917, NASA Langley has been the site of much aviation research and development in the United States, and thus is the birthplace of many aeronautical advances enjoyed throughout the world.
Virginia is home to many aviation and aerospace museums.
To help commemorate the Wright Brothers 100year-old achievement, the Smithsonian Institution's Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport will observe its grand opening on December 15, 2003.
"Virginia's aviation community is very proud to have such a celebrated year be recognized by the lawmakers of the Commonwealth," said Department of Aviation Director Charles Macfarlane.
"The Wright Brothers have given us one of the most treasured advancements of our time."
In the resolution, the General Assembly encourages all citizens and organizations in the Commonwealth to join together in celebration of the great achievements and cultural improvements to mankind brought about by the advancement and utilization of aviation during the past 100 years.
A copy of General Assembly 2003 Aviation Year Resolution is on the back page of Virginia Aviation and can also be viewed on the DOAV website at www.doav.state.va.us .

Lynchburg Regional And Delta Prepare For Take-Off Lynchburg Regional Airport and Delta Airlines recently announced that they've worked out an agreement that will bring regional jet service to Lynchburg.
The agreement was made possible by a $500,000 Small Community Air Service Development grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
"It is what we were hoping for and what we've been negotiating," Airport Manager Mark Courtney said of the deal.
"We're still working out the final details of the agreement."
He said the upgrade in service could give Lynchburg a leg up in attracting further upgrades or new service from other carriers.
"That has certainly been the case in many instances at other airports in other counties," he said.
"This is the first step in the long road back."
The Lynchburg Regional Chamber of Commerce's Air Service Partnership -- which represents the airport's biggest corporate air travelers -- applied for the air services grant, which required a local match of $100,000 that was collected from various localities in the region.
The grant money allows smaller airports to prove their market to airlines that typically would not take a chance on starting or upgrading service with them by working out a revenue agreement.

AOPA Announces Airport Watch Program To Protect Nation's General Aviation Airports The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association recently formally unveiled AOPA's Airport Watch, a program to enhance security at general aviation (GA) airports across the country.
Airport Watch is patterned after the highly successful neighborhood watch anticrime programs, which call on community members to note and report suspicious activity.
Some 700,000 pilots and airport workers are being asked to participate in Airport Watch programs at 5,000 GA airports.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and AOPA have partnered to deploy this national security-enhancement program.
"General aviation pilots are eager to do their part for national security," said AOPA President Phil Boyer.
"One of the best things we can do is be the eyes and ears for law enforcement in our own neighborhood -- the GA airport.
Who is going to know better than a pilot what looks like normal activity and what doesn't, who belongs and who doesn't?" Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge has called Airport Watch "... a great example of government and the private sector working together to secure the homeland."
"Keeping our airports safe in this free and welcoming nation is an enormous challenge," he said.
"We all must watch out for one another.
Airport Watch can help."
AOPA's Airport Watch was developed in consultation with the Transportation Security Administration and other law enforcement agencies.
And TSA is providing a key element for the success of the program -- a national, toll-free security hotline and centralized reporting system for collecting information from pilots and quickly dispersing it to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
"We appreciate AOPA's proactive approach to enhance security for the general aviation community," said Transportation Security Administrator Adm. James M. Loy.
"It makes sense that the world's largest civil aviation organization would offer their expertise for the collective effort in the war on terrorism."
Airport Watch is an integrated program to educate and involve pilots in security AOPA's Airport Watch is an integrated program to educate and involve pilots in enhancing general aviation security.
Since the 9/11 attacks, AOPA has used its media outlets to educate pilots about security issues and to encourage pilot vigilance at airports.
AOPA media (AOPA Pilot and AOPA Flight Training magazines, AOPA ePilot email newsletter, and the AOPA Web site, www.aopa.org) reach the vast majority of the nation's pilots.
AOPA is building on that communication base with a series of Airport Watch materials.
To date, AOPA has committed almost half a million dollars to the production and distribution of Airport Watch materials.
Airport Watch brochure sent to every U.S. pilot In December, AOPA sent the Airport Watch brochure to each of its more than 393,000 members.
TSA will send copies to the remaining pilots who are not members of AOPA, while the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association will send it to aviation mechanics and technicians.
Other aviation organizations will be distributing the brochure as well.
The brochure points out some of the things pilots should be on the lookout for at airports.
Among them: pilots who appear to be under the control of others; anyone trying to access an aircraft through force; anyone who seems unfamiliar with aviation procedures trying to rent an aircraft; aircraft with unusual or obviously unauthorized modifications.
It cautions pilots to follow their gut instincts but use common sense.
None of the items listed necessarily indicate terrorist activities.
The brochure includes a tear-out checklist of what pilots should watch for and report.
"The goal here is to raise awareness," said Boyer.
"It's not to spread paranoia."
With the brochure, pilots also received a window decal to display on their planes declaring that this aircraft is part of AOPA's Airport Watch.
Airport Watch video offers examples of what to look for AOPA has produced a videotape to help pilot organizations and other airport groups learn what to watch and listen for.
Phil Boyer introduces a number of scenarios that depict suspicious activities that may warrant a call to authorities.
"The September 11 terrorists were from the Middle East, but the next terrorists could be from anywhere and look like your next-door neighbor," Boyer says on the tape.
"And that's the point.
There is no terrorist `type.'
Terrorists won't always speak with an accent or look a certain way.
It's what they're doing and how they're acting that should make you suspicious."
The videotape was produced in consultation with TSA and with local law enforcement agencies.
To add realism to the training tape, in one of the scenarios police officers and dispatchers enacted their roles as they would in responding to a real call reporting possible terrorist or criminal activity.
Scenarios range from obvious situations like pilots being waylaid and coerced aboard corporate jets, to shady characters trying to force their way into aircraft or hangars, to more subtle situ(see AOPA cont. on pg. 5)
Mar/Apr 2003 ations like someone asking questions that are almost, but not quite, right.
There's even one scenario that appears to be suspicious but is in fact benign.
The video is free upon request and can also be viewed on the AOPA Web site at www.aopa.org/airportwatch/.
It will be distributed to pilot and airport groups across the country, including the 800 local chapters of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA).
The video will be shown at the hundreds of FAA and AOPA Air Safety Foundation safety seminars conducted nationwide.
It will also be incorporated into the Air Safety Foundation's Flight Instructor Refresher Clinics, ensuring that flight instructors are spreading the word to the pilot community.
TSA provides 1-866-GA-SECURE: Airport Watch hotline One of the keys to making Airport (AOPA cont. from pg. 4)
VIRGINIA AVIATION Watch work is having an easy way for pilots to report their suspicions, no matter where they may be flying.
At AOPA's request, TSA has provided an easy-toremember nationwide toll-free hotline (866-GA-SECURE or 866-427-3287) for pilots to use.
TSA activated the hotline in earlyDecember.
It is staffed 24/7 by U.S Coast Guard personnel at the National Response Center.
Based on the information a pilot gives them about a possible threat, they are able to contact all the appropriate authorities in that airport's community.
The toll-free hotline number will be displayed prominently on warning signs and posters at thousands of GA airports.
AOPA has distributed kits including the signs, posters, videos, and brochures to AOPA Airport Support Network volunteers at 1,400 airports, to airport managers and directors at an-
Page 5 other 3,500 airports, and to 150 TSA federal security directors, as well as aviation directors in all 50 states.
"The Transportation Security Administration has rightly been focused on the air carrier airports, where large passenger aircraft like the ones used in the September 11 attacks operate," said Boyer.
"We, the general aviation pilots in this country, have an obligation to help secure our airports and our skies.
By keeping our eyes and ears open, we can play a vital role in our national security."
The 393,000 members of AOPA make up the world's largest civil aviation organization.
AOPA is committed to ensuring the continued security, viability, growth, and development of aviation and airports in the United States.
These airports are a vital and critical component of our national transportation system.
Colgan Air Lands At Shenandoah Valley Regional Colgan Air Inc., a regional airline headquartered in Manassas and partially owned by state senator Charles Colgan, D-Manassas, will begin serving Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD) next month.
He founded the company in 1991.
Colgan Air will replace Air Midwest, a division of Phoenix-based Mesa Air Group (Nasdaq: MESA), as the carrier providing US Airways Express service to Pittsburgh.
But the switch could lead to direct service from SHD to other major hubs.
"This is going to be a good thing for the community," said Dennis Burnett, the airport's deputy executive director.
"In reality, we've landed a new carrier."
The change ended a yearlong campaign by airport officials to land Colgan Air.
They courted the company to bid on the market, then lobbied the U.S. Department of Transportation to approve the change.
In addition to Pittsburgh, Colgan Air flies to airports in Washington, Boston and New York.
It serves New York's LaGuardia International Airport from Charlottesville, Roanoke and Norfolk.
Colgan Air, which takes over service on April 20, will fly the same threeflight schedule as Air Midwest through May 1.
But after that, flight times could change and another daily flight might be added.
Mary Colgan-Finnigan, the company's vice president of administration, says Colgan Air wants to improve the timing of flights to Pittsburgh and intends to add a fourth flight.
But she wouldn't commit to offering service to any other hub.
Burnett believes that proper scheduling, frequency and pricing can make the market profitable again.
"It's getting that schedule that we know is right and working through some pricing issues to make sure we have competitive pricing again," he said.
"We've got to show them that if they give us the right schedules, more people will [use the service]."
He went on to say the switch to Colgan Air increases the chance that service options will improve at SHD.
While Colgan Air serves four hubs from various locations, Pittsburgh is the only East Coast hub Air Midwest serves.
Also, Air Midwest was unlikely to offer service in anything but 19-seat planes because its next smallest aircraft is a 70-seat regional jet.
Colgan Air's fleet includes 30-seat planes, a more likely next step.
Colgan-Finnigan anticipates adding staff at SHD.
Unlike Air Midwest, Colgan Air staffs its counter all day.
The change will mark a return to the Valley for a Charles Colgan company.
Colgan Airways Corp., which was sold in 1986, served SHD in the 1960s and 1970s.

BWI Airport Considering Shuttle Service To Richmond Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) is considering starting a shuttle service to Richmond in an effort to lure more Virginia passengers.
BWI officials said the Maryland airport is seeking bids from transit companies interested in running the bus service south to Richmond, where about 6 percent of its passengers originate, according to a recent survey.
BWI estimates that as many as 16 percent of its annual 19 million passengers will come from Virginia this year.
The service could start as soon as June 1.
While this is good news for travelers, Richmond airport officials are not sure it will be reliable or profitable.
Airport spokesman Troy Bell said fares out of Richmond have gotten more competitive recently, and the traffic to and from Baltimore may be too much for travelers to bear.
