Box 330 Trenton, NJ 08625 Phone: 1(800)328-0179 Fax: 1(800)625-7581 www.nass.usda.gov/nj/ Date: August 9, 2002 Winter damage was minimal, but spring frosts did some damage to New Jersey peach blossoms, especially in later varieties.
Some of the orchards in low lying areas may have no significant production this year.
Forecasted production, at 65 million pounds, is 10 million pounds, or 13 percent less than last year.
Peaches, Total Production by State, 2000-2001 and Forecasted July 1, 2002 Total Production 2000 2001 2002 - Million Pounds 1,855.0 1,727.0 1,880.0 150.0 100.0 160.0 115.0 140.0 115.0 65.0 75.0 65.0 60.0 75.0 60.0 65.0 55.0 50.0 14.0 23.0 21.0 32.0 12.0 20.0 23.0 17.8 17.5 19.0 18.0 17.0 2,599.9 2,441.4 2,547.7 New Jersey 2001 Peach Production Final Total peach production in 2001 totaled 75 million pounds, up 10.0 million pounds from 2000.
Utilized production was estimated at 70 million pounds, 5 million pounds less than total production.
This was because smaller peaches were not in demand.
Season average price was 40 cents per pound compared with 42 cents per pound in 2000.
Increased utilized production more than offset the decrease in the season average price as value of production increased from $24.8 million to $28.4 million, an increase of $3.6 million.
New Jersey 2001 Apple Production Final Apple production in New Jersey totaled 55 million pounds in 2001, 5 million pounds higher than in 2000.
Utilized production, at 50 million pounds, was four million pounds more than a year ago.
Value of utilized production totaled $8.1 million, up $1.9 million from 2000.
Fresh sales accounted for 23 million pounds, while processing use was 27 million pounds.

Area for harvest, at 32,600 acres, is up 7 percent for comparable states from last year.
Vegetable processors have contracted 1.26 million acres to be planted to the 5 major vegetable crops (snap beans, sweet corn, cucumbers for pickles, green peas, and tomatoes).
This acreage is up 3 percent from last year for comparable states.
All major processing vegetables, except sweet corn, show increases in contracted planted acreage from last year's comparable states.
Green pea production, at 380,680 tons, is down 1 percent for comparable states from 2001.
Contracted tomato production is forecast at 11.1 million tons, up 21 percent from 2001 for comparable states.
Bell Peppers: New Jersey's acreage for summer harvest is forecast at 3,700 acres, unchanged from 2001.
Growing conditions are generally favorable.
Prospects are good for this season and harvest is expected to begin in mid-July.
Cucumbers: Acreage for summer harvest is forecast at 4,900 acres, up 2 percent from 2001.
New Jersey' early plantings are in good condition, but later seeded fields showed slow growth due to cooler temperatures.
Garden State acreage for harvest is forecasted at 3,000 acres, up 300 acres from 2001.
On Virginia's eastern shore and northern neck, conditions were cooler than normal which slowed crop development.
However, hot and dry conditions during the last few weeks have allowed the crop to mature on time.
Harvest is just beginning and will be in full swing in the next couple of weeks.
The crop looks good.
Sweet Corn: Fresh market acreage for harvest is forecast at 113,500 acres, down 2 percent from last year.
California growing conditions have been good with no pest or disease problems reported.
Quality and yields of the early harvest in the San Joaquin Valley are reported to be excellent.
The Michigan sweet corn crop is starting to improve following cool temperatures in May.
In New Jersey, acreage estimated for harvest is 9,000 acres, down 100 acres from previous year.
The crop was planted on schedule and development is ahead of schedule.
Light harvest began the last week of June.
Planting of the New York crop is behind due to wet weather.
Planting is expected to continue into early July.
North Carolina growers had drier than normal conditions from mid-April until mid-May, then again in mid-June causing harvest to begin later than normal.
Ohio growers were not able to plant as much as intended due to very wet conditions in the spring and some report losing part of their crop to freezing temperatures in mid-May.
Although more recent warm temperatures have helped the crop to recover, the earlier cold, wet weather will push harvest back for many growers.
Pennsylvania growers were forced to replant a large part of their crop due to a late-May frost.
Despite the delay, growers are still expecting a good crop.
Wisconsin sweet corn was emerging in the central area by the last week of June.
Planting and crop progress have been delayed by wet weather.

California reports optimal weather conditions in recent weeks, and the tomato crop has exhibited good growth and color.
No pest or disease problems have been noted.
Michigan fresh market tomatoes suffered frost damage in late-May.
During June, planting and replanting continued and transplanting activity increased with warmer weather.
In New Jersey, the season started normally and plant development is excellent at this time.
Harvest began in June.
New Jersey's 2002 acreage intended for harvest is forecasted at 3,400 acreage, unchanged from previous year.
In New York, wet weather has delayed or halted planting activities.
Pennsylvania's crop has experienced cool temperatures and wet weather.
Some growers reported frost damage.
In Virginia, a cool spring, followed by hot and dry conditions, has allowed the tomato crop to be in mostly good condition.
Early harvest will begin the first week of July.
U.S. Crop Condition Corn was 98 percent planted on June 9, slightly less than the 5-year average.
Planting remained active in the eastern Corn Belt early in the month, despite additional rain delays.
Most of the acreage remaining to be planted on June 9 was in Indiana and Ohio.
Warm weather and adequate soil moisture supported quick emergence in the eastern Corn Belt and promoted rapid vegetative growth in the western Corn Belt.
By June 16, the crop was 97 percent emerged.
On June 23, crop development ranged from barely emerged in many areas of the eastern Corn Belt to chest-high in some western Corn Belt fields.
Five percent of the crop was at or beyond the silking stage at the end of the month.
However, silking in the Corn Belt was mostly confined to the lower Missouri and lower Ohio River Valleys, where 30 percent of the Kentucky acreage and 21 percent of the Missouri crop was silking.
Hot winds and dry soils stressed many fields in the western Corn Belt and Great Plains near the end of the month, while rain improved crop conditions in Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
Soybean planting progressed behind normal during the first half of the month, but neared completion slightly ahead of normal, advancing to 97 percent complete on June 23.
Planting neared completion by June 9 across the northern and western Corn Belt.
Meanwhile, planting remained active across the central and eastern Corn Belt, interior Mississippi Delta, and central Great Plains, even though some areas received additional, unneeded precipitation.
After midmonth, planting was most active along the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, but planting also remained active in parts of the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Corn Belt.
Above-normal temperatures and adequate topsoil moisture aided emergence and growth in most areas of the Corn Belt, northern Great Plains, and lower Mississippi Valley during the month.
By June 23, most fields were emerged in the western Corn Belt and northern Great Plains.
Near the end of the month, fields rapidly emerged in the eastern Corn Belt and interior Mississippi Delta.
On June 30, emergence was 96 percent complete, 1 percentage point ahead of the average for this date.
In addition, 6 percent of the acreage was blooming at the end of June, as fields rapidly entered the loom stage in the lower Mississippi Valley.
In the Corn Belt, Iowa led progress with 16 percent blooming.
Conditions deteriorated in the western Corn Belt and Great Plains, where soil moisture reserves quickly diminished.
