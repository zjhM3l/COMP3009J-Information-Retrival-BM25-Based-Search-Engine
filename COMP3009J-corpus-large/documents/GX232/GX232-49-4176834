Background and Explanation of Provisions On January 17, 2001, the IRS and Treasury published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG 126100Â­00) in the Federal Register (66 FR 3925, corrected by 66 FR 15820 and 66 FR 16019) under section 6049 (the 2001 proposed regulations), which would provide that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien individual must be reported annually to the IRS.
Under regulations currently in effect, reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest is required only if the interest is paid to a U.S. person or a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Canada.
The IRS and Treasury requested comments on the 2001 proposed regulations, and a public hearing regarding the 2001 proposed regulations was held on June 21, 2001.
The IRS and Treasury received numerous comments on the proposed regulations, and several

Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 149 / Friday, August 2, 2002 / Proposed Rules commentators spoke at the public hearing on the 2001 proposed regulations.
After careful consideration of all the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations should be withdrawn and a new notice of proposed rulemaking should be issued on this subject.
Accordingly, this document withdraws the 2001 proposed regulations and provides new proposed regulations (the 2002 proposed regulations).
Most of the comments received on the 2001 proposed regulations were highly critical of the regulations.
In particular, many commentators expressed the view that the administrative burden imposed by the 2001 proposed regulations would significantly outweigh any benefits obtained by the IRS from the additional information collected.
Some commentators also stated that the 2001 proposed regulations could have a severe negative impact on U.S. banks, particularly U.S. banks with a deposit base that included a significant number of nonresident alien individuals, some of whom had expressed concerns that the information collected under the 2001 proposed regulations might be misused.
Other commentators raised certain technical concerns regarding the 2001 proposed regulations, particularly with respect to the reporting requirements for bank deposit interest paid to joint account holders.
After consideration of the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations were overly broad in requiring annual information reporting with respect to U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien.
The IRS and Treasury have decided instead that reporting should be required only for nonresident alien individuals that are residents of certain designated countries.
The IRS and Treasury believe that limiting reporting to residents of these countries will facilitate the goals of improving compliance with U.S. tax laws and permitting appropriate information exchange without imposing an undue administrative burden on U.S. banks.
Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations would modify the current regulations (which require reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest only if paid to Canadian residents) by requiring in addition reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest paid to residents of Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Payors may, however, at their option, choose to report bank deposit interest paid to all nonresident aliens or to any nonresident alien who is a resident of a country other than the countries listed above.
If the IRS and Treasury determine that this list of countries should be modified in the future, regulations providing such a modification will be proposed and comments will be requested on those proposed regulations.
In other respects, the 2002 proposed regulations generally follow the approach set forth in the 2001 proposed regulations.
Thus, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that, if a nonresident alien who is a recipient of U.S. bank deposit interest is a resident of a country for which reporting of such interest is required, a copy of Form 1042Â­S, ``Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding'', must be furnished to the nonresident alien.
Like the 2001 proposed regulations, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that the payor or middleman can satisfy this requirement by furnishing a copy of Form 1042Â­S either in person or to the last known address of the nonresident alien.
In addition, to conform to the changes made in the 2002 proposed regulations, the Form 1042Â­S requirements have been modified with respect to joint accounts.
For example, the 2001 proposed regulations provide that, if a joint account holder is a U.S. nonexempt recipient, the payor or middleman must report the entire payment to that person.
If all joint account holders are foreign persons, the 2001 proposed regulations require the payor or middleman to report the payment to the nonresident alien individual that is a resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).
The 2002 proposed regulations retain the requirement that the entire payment be reported to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if there is a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a joint account holder.
However, the 2002 proposed regulations modify the 2001 proposed regulations by providing that, if all joint account holders are foreign persons, reporting is required to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the listed countries.
Section 1.6049Â­8(a) currently provides, for purposes of the requirement that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to individuals who are Canadian residents must be reported, that the payor or middleman may rely on the permanent address found on an applicable withholding certificate described in Â§ 1.1441Â­1(c)(16) (Form WÂ­ 8) to make the determination of whether
50387
the nonresident alien individual resides in Canada.
However, the regulation also provides that a payor or middleman may rely on its actual knowledge of the individual's residence address in Canada, even if a valid Form WÂ­8 has not been provided, to make such a determination.
The 2002 proposed regulations, like the 2001 proposed regulations, eliminate this ``actual knowledge of the individual's residence address'' rule because it creates a result that is contrary to the presumption rules contained in Â§ 1.1441Â­1(b)(3)(iii) (and made applicable to reportable payments by Â§ 1.6049Â­5(d)(2)).
In this regard, the presumption rules generally provide that interest on a U.S. bank deposit that cannot be reliably associated with a valid Form WÂ­8 or Form WÂ­9, ``Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification'', must be presumed to be paid to an undocumented U.S. nonexempt recipient.
Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations clarify that a payor of interest on such a deposit must report the payment on a Form 1099 as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in accordance with the presumption rules.
Further, such payment is subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to payments made after December 31 of the year in which they are published as final regulations in the Federal Register.
Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.
It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and, because the regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply.
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.
Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely (in the manner described in the ADDRESSES portion of this preamble) to the IRS.

In the case of amounts described in Â§ 1.6049Â­ 8(a) (relating to certain payments of deposit interest to nonresident alien individuals) paid after December 31 of the year in which the final regulations are published in the Federal Register, any person who files a Form 1042Â­S, ``Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding'', under section 6049(a) and Â§ 1.6049Â­4(b)(5) shall furnish a statement to the recipient of the interest either in person or by firstclass mail to the recipient's last known address.

(ii) Joint account holders.

DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 3, 2002.
ADDRESSES: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CECWÂ­OR, 441 G Street, NW., Washington DC, 20314Â­ 1000.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Frank Torbett, Headquarters Regulatory Branch at (202) 761Â­4618 or Mr. Jack Kennedy, Corps Seattle District, at (206) 764Â­6907.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to its authorities in section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 266; 33 U.S.C. 1) and Chapter XIX of the Army Appropriation Act of 1919 (40 Stat.892; 33 U.S.C. 3) the Corps proposes to amend the regulations in 33 CFR part 334 by amending Section 334.1220 to enlarge the presently established naval restricted Area 1, in Hood Canal, adjacent to the submarine base.
The present boundaries of Area 1 provide a minimum 150-yard restriction from the shoreline of the submarine base and 300-yard restriction from submarine moorage facilities.
The amendment would extend the restricted area an average 300 yards further out into Hood Canal, and provide a 500yard restriction adjacent to the submarine moorage.
At its narrowest point along the length of Area 1, Hood Canal is over a mile wide.
With the enlarged naval restricted area implemented, over 1400 yards of deep water would remain in the center and western thirds of Hood Canal, sufficient for the unimpeded passage of recreational and fishing vessels typically using the area, and equally sufficient for larger commercial vessels that occasionally transit the area.

(a) Interest subject to reporting requirement.
For purposes of Â§Â§ 1.6049Â­ 4, 1.6049Â­6, and this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term interest means interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) with respect to a deposit maintained at an office within the United States by a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of any of the following countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
For purposes of the regulations under section 6049, a nonresident alien individual is a person described in section 7701(b)(1)(B).
The payor or middleman may rely upon an applicable withholding certificate described in Â§ 1.1441Â­1(c)(16) (Form WÂ­8) that is valid to determine whether the payment is made to a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of one of the countries for which reporting is required.
Generally, amounts described in this paragraph (a) are not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
See Â§ 31.3406(g)Â­1(d) of this chapter.
However, if the payor or middleman does not have either a valid Form WÂ­ 8 or valid Form WÂ­9, ``Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification'', the payor or middleman must report the payment as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if it must so treat the payee under the presumption rules of Â§Â§ 1.6049Â­5(d)(2) and 1.1441Â­ 1(b)(3)(iii) and must also backup withhold under section 3406.
