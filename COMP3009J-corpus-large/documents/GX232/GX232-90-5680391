Jefferson Lab EE CAD Group Business Plan Prepared by The EE CAD Group staff with help from Bruce Ullman, Training 
The responsibility for designing and documenting electrical and electronic wiring diagrams, chassis, layouts, circuit boards, etc. for the Accelerator, the Free Electron Laser (FEL), and other major systems for which Jefferson Lab is responsible, rests with the EE CAD Group in the Accelerator Engineering Department.
This plan is designed to identify the framework for improved group operations, continuous process improvement, and quality customer service.
It will be reviewed in six months (Jan 2004) by the Group to evaluate its implementation and make any necessary revisions.
It will thereafter be reviewed annually.

Maintain useful work metrics 7.1 Designers estimate work in hours for every job 7.2 Designers log their work (contract manager logs time, cost for contracted jobs) by customer, project type, name Â­ not for external consumption 7.2.1 log time expended on - research (ME 
- date check print(s) out - date check print(s) back - date out for internal check - date back from internal check - date vellum out - date vellum back - date docs to Document Control and job logged out 7.3 Job Control compile weekly and monthly summaries of all work--in-house or outsourced 7.3.1 by customer for external distribution to customers' managers 7.3.2 by designer (including original estimates) for internal use
ASSETS Management Structure: Management is considered an asset as it provides the operational framework for the Group, its resources, and its leadership.
Lab Director: Christopher Leemann Accelerator Division Director: Swapan Chattopadhyay Accelerator Engineering Group Leader: Will Oren Electrical Systems Manager: Bill Merz Electrical Systems Deputy: Ron Lauze' EE Computer Assisted Design (CAD) Group Leader: Roger Flood Equipment: The Group's equipment consists almost completely of computer hardware and software.
See Appendix F for a current inventory.
The Group's designers should never be limited by the capabilities of their hardware.
The hardware replacement plan attempts to provide every designer with hardware capable of using the full capabilities of the software.
The CPUs and RAM on at least three machines a year should be upgraded.
The priority is that the two oldest and/or least capable machines are upgraded first.
Machines that are replaced are considered as server replacements before they are declared excess.
Staff: The staff is currently composed of five regular employees, a term employee, a student, a full-time contractor, and a part-time casual employee.
Designers: Roger Flood Lori Zukerman Ismael (Mel) Gonzales David Williams Kim Ryan Gordon Baker Â­ on loan from Mechanical Engineering (Term) Miriam Angello Â­ Student Intern Kevin Arenius Â­ Contractor Bob Vignato Â­ Retired (Part time Casual)

METHOD OF OPERATION Work Flow: The general operation of the EE CAD Group consists of customers bringing work, either electronically using our Web-based work request form, or in hard copy.
We accept work in any form as long as it meets all of our acceptance criteria.
Generally, customers bring either a design that they want us to refine, alter, etc. or an idea that they want us to turn into a design.
See Appendix B.
All work is logged in by one of our "work coordinators" who must first ensure it meets all of our acceptance criteria (Appendix E).
The request must provide a clear statement of what is needed as the end product as well as if (and how) it will fit into a larger system.
The customer may include a request that a particular designer work on the project if, for example, the customer and designer have worked on a similar project together previously.
The customer must also indicate if he/she is willing to have the job outsourced if the EE CAD staff cannot handle it.
Most importantly, all acceptable jobs must include a usable schematic with mounting/installation information if applicable, a good bill of materials, and a library.
Once a job is accepted, the work coordinator assigns it a priority and a project designer, and enters that information into the log.
Priorities are based on what program/department category the job is for.
The categories are: Â· EE AC Systems Â· EE DC Systems Â· EE I
Selection of a project designer is based on three things.
First, which designers have the technical expertise to carry out the job; second, which qualified designers have workloads that can support it; and third, is the designer requested by the customer one of these? If there is no designer who fits the first two criteria and the customer has not ruled it out in the work request, the job will be outsourced.
Roles and Responsibilities: The roles of the EE CAD stakeholders, as well as their associated responsibilities, are listed in Appendix D.
All but one of the Group's current staff is a designer, and most of these either are, or aspire to be, qualified for both electrical/electronic work and for the more mechanical work that is involved with electrical system design.
Therefore, with the exception of Job Control, the staff's responsibilities, and the skills associated with them, are cumulative--from basic skills that apply to all, to skills that are unique to one person.
General Design Responsibilities: All designers have certain basic responsibilities in common: Â· Possess basic drafting skills Â· Familiarity with computer-assisted design Â· Understand and follow group work practices per business plan Â· Proficient in basic use of Windows MS Office suite Â· Ability to plan and estimate work Â· Ability to communicate effectively for successful results Designers who do mechanical work have additional responsibilities: Â· Understand mechanical concepts of tolerance, loading, and dimensioning Â· Recognize mechanical symbology Â· Understand the mechanical fabrication process Â· Proficiency in AutoCAD Designers who do electrical/electronic work (PC boards) have similar (but not identical) responsibilities: 5
Â· Â· Â· Â·
Understand electrical/electronic concepts of tolerance, loading, and dimensioning Recognize electrical/electronic symbology Understand the electrical/electronic fabrication process Proficiency in PCAD
Position-specific Responsibilities: In addition to being a Work Coordinator, the Group Leader Â· Communicates group needs to Management on training, space, manpower, budget Â· Assesses customer satisfaction Â· Makes sound outsourcing decisions Â· Manages group budget Â· Exercises supervisory 
Additional Duty Responsibilities: In addition to being a qualified EE and/or ME designer, the Work Coordinators also: Â· Are proficient in planning and estimating work Â· Understand changing Lab priorities Â· Set internal priorities to match Lab priorities Â· Know other designers' capabilities 
A designer who does only mechanical or only electrical/electronic work has these six common responsibilities plus the four that are unique to their specialty; totaling ten.
Designers who do both mechanical and electrical/electronic work will have the common 6 plus all 8 of the specialized responsibilities; a total of 14.
The 5 work coordinator responsibilities fall on qualified designers who already have either 10 or 14 responsibilities as designers.
The Group Leader, who is one of the work coordinators, has an additional set of unique responsibilities that brings his total into the twenties.
Additional functions like Library Manager and Software Manager add unique responsibilities to the totals of the designers assigned to perform them.
Since Job Control is not run by a designer, the responsibilities of this function are both unique and complete unto 6
themselves.
We recognize that customers too have their part to play in how well we can serve them.
We serve our customers and the Lab best when customers adhere to their responsibilities: Â· Provide work requests that meet the Group's published acceptance criteria Â· Indicate designer preference 
These are listed in Appendix C along with the proficiency level required for the position.
Annually, the Group Leader will assess the actual proficiency of the employees filling each position against what is required.
Any "gaps" that are identified are documented in the employee's performance appraisal as expectations for the coming year.
Training: The individual group member and the Group Leader work with the Training and Performance Office to identify ways to close the skill gap and help the employee meet the related performance objective.
Formal short courses, both on and off site, may be supplemented by online training, mentoring, OJT, reading published materials, conferences, etc. and are funded by the Group.
Standards of Performance Product Quality: Our highest priority is to produce designs that meet or exceed customer expectations, that work when they are fabricated and installed, and that are well-documented so they can be reproduced or modified with as little effort and as much accuracy as possible.
satisfy Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Customer Service: Customer service is essential and is our highest priority after product quality.
Efforts to our customers include but are not limited to: Timeliness Adherence to specifications Flexibility within guidelines of Business Plan Keeping customer informed Requesting feedback on completed work
Metrics: "If it doesn't get measured, it doesn't get done."
That quote may be a little extreme, but it often isn't far from the truth.
We measure our own performance in a variety of ways and track our customers' interactions with us as well.
Job Control takes the data provided by the designers, turns it into reports that can improve performance, and ensures it gets into the right hands.
We log two kinds of internal data and produce two regular reports.
Logs: Jobs are logged in when they are received by a work coordinator and logged out by the designer (or contract manager for outsourced work).
However, we also log several milestones in between.
The work coordinator logs the date the job is assigned to a designer or is outsourced.
The designer logs the date that check print(s) go out and when they come back; when the job goes out for internal checking and when the check is complete; and when the vellum is taken to the customer and when it is signed.
Designers also track the hours that go into each step in a job: Â· research (ME

Communication: Communication is essential to maintaining a pleasant and productive workplace.
The most important goal when communicating is for both parties to ensure the receiver understands the message the way the sender intended
1.
Concerns about safety, environment, health, work processes, or other work related issues should be brought to the attention of a Work Coordinator.
2.
Concerns or questions about difficult customer interactions, personnel issues, office rules 
unresolved except with the agreement of all parties involved.
3.
Concerns will be resolved and questions answered in a timely fashion.
Issues will not be left 4.
No idea will be dismissed out of hand.
Decisions that affect others will be made only after those affected are consulted (except when restricted by statute or policy).
However, once a decision is made and those affected are informed, everyone will both follow it and support it.
5.
Disagreements between group members should first be discussed between the principals, and only elevated if unresolved.
In most cases, personal information regarding group members and their interaction should be kept within the group.
6.
The most important consideration in any decision is its effect on the group's ability to perform its mission.
Group members must always ask themselves if what they want to do will improve their ability to accomplish the mission.
For example, if it will help them personally but reduce service to the customer, it is not likely to be supported..
Office Rules: These mutually agreed upon rules apply to everyone in the EE CAD Group; however, non-exempt (hourly) employees may not work more than 40 hours per week without approval of overtime by the Group Leader.
1.
Work Hours: Start: 7:00 am Break: 10 minutes any time Lunch 1 hour between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm Break 10 minutes any time Quit 4:00 pm 2.
Staff member absences during the day In cases of prolonged absence, computers must be locked while unattended 3.
Staff member vacation planning Requests for time off are required as far in advance as the total vacation time requested.
For example one week notice for one week of vacation, unless an unexpected circumstance or emergency arises.
4.
End of day close-down All files will be saved, applications closed, and computers either shut down, rebooted, or locked before a Group member departs for the day.
5.
Logging Â· All work will be logged in the Group Electronic Log 8
Â· Â· Â· Â·
No work will be performed on Lab time that is not logged Log entries for work estimates will be made no later than one day after the job is assigned Log entries for actual hours worked may be collected in any form but, to keep Group-wide data current, hours must be entered into the Group Electronic Log no later than one day after a project milestone (e.g. Research, Preparation, Preparing Schematic) has been completed You are not expected to account for all your work hours in the Log (i.e. Log totals for any designer are not realistically expected to add up to eight hours each day).
6.
Telephones and email Â· Â· Â· We are a customer service organization.
Calls should be answered when they are first received.
If some work-related activity precludes answering the phone when it rings, check voicemail and return calls within one hour after becoming available.
Do not let the day end with a voicemail from a customer unanswered, or an email from a customer unacknowledged.
Even if you don't have the answer, let them know you're aware of their question.
7.
Steps for Group Leader to follow to resolve issues Â· Â· Â· Â· Review the issue Investigate all aspects of the situation Try to resolve as soon as possible Make appropriate decisions, communicate what needs to be done with all parities involved, and ask if they understand and will comply
8.
Steps for noncompliance * Â· Â· Â· Â· Verbal Warning Written Warning Written Notice Disciplinary Suspension
* It depends upon the nature of the non-compliance: e.g. safety violations, physical assault, etc., would result in immediate disciplinary suspension
