TITLE 40.SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE Part 1.
TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES
Chapter 71.
PUBLIC INFORMATION
The Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) adopts the repeal of Â§Â§71.1-71.4, 71.11-71.17, 71.21-71.28, 71.31, and 71.40; and adopts new Â§Â§71.101-71.103, 71.201- 71.206, 71.301-71.310, and 71.401-71.405 without changes to the proposed text published in the November 22, 2002, issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 10902).
DHS undertook the repeals and new sections to update the chapter, to put most of the agency-wide rules regarding the handling of information in the same rule chapter, and to adopt rules regarding the privacy of health information.
These repeals and new sections also provided DHS the opportunity to rewrite its rules in plain language to make them easier for the public to understand.
Justification for the repeals and new sections is to make sure the rules are accurate, enforceable, and easy for the public to locate and understand.
Justification for the new sections regarding individually identifiable health information is to implement the requirements of the Health and Safety Code, Chapter 181, and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (45 Code of Federal Regulations Â§Â§164.500-164.534)(the HIPAA privacy rule).
Most of the adopted new sections in Subchapter C, along with Â§71.206(c) and Â§71.405, did not require DHS to make any policy decisions, but rather simply adopted the requirements stated in Health and Safety Code, Chapter 181, and the HIPAA privacy rule.
However, in Â§Â§71.302(c) and (d), 71.304(c), 71.305, 71.307(b), and 71.310, which indicate who at DHS a person should contact to exercise his or her rights under the rules, DHS made the contact people the same as or similar to those under its current procedures.
Section 71.303 lists the sets of records from which individuals can access their own health information.
The HIPAA privacy rule requires DHS to maintain a list of all these records sets.
Thus, DHS identified all the records sets it maintains that meet the definition of "designated records set" in the HIPAA privacy rule.
The HIPAA privacy rule requires DHS to verify the identity and authority of people asking for certain health information either about themselves or others.
Therefore, Â§71.308 was proposed to tell people what kind of proof of identity and authority DHS may require under the HIPAA privacy rule.
Because what is necessary to verify identity or authority may vary considerably from one situation to another, DHS decided to provide maximum flexibility by indicating that the agency may ask for one or more of the listed forms of proof.
Because the HIPAA privacy rule requires DHS to limit its disclosures of certain health information to what is necessary, DHS proposed guidelines in Â§71.309(d) that provide for flexible criteria to decide how much information to release for nonroutine, nonrecurring disclosures.
DHS received no comments regarding adoption of either the repeals or the new sections.
