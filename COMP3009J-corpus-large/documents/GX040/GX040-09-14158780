Over the years, many Idahoans have contacted me regarding rules on the proper display of the American flag.
In addition, following the recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, concerns have also been raised regarding how U.S. law and the Constitution apply to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. [flag1-1.jpg]
History of the Pledge of Allegiance:
1892- The Pledge of Allegiance first appears on September 8 in the periodical, "The Youth's Companion".
It was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister in Boston for use in a school flag raising ceremony to mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in America.
The original words were: "I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
1924- The words "the flag of the United States of America" are substituted for "my Flag".
1942- The government officially recognizes the Pledge of Allegiance.
1954- The government adds the words "under God" after "nation".
Title 4 Section 4 of the United States Code currently reads:
The pledge of allegiance to the Flag, "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.", should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart.
When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.
Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.
Proper Flag Display and Use:
Display of the Flag 24 hours a day-
The Flag Code states:
Use of the Flag in jewelry, commercial products, apparel, and advertising- The Flag Code states:
[furlflag.jpg] Displaying the Flag during inclement weather- The Flag Code states:
The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all weather flag is displayed.
Flying the Flag at half-staff-
The flag code sets out detailed instructions on flying the flag at half-staff on Memorial Day and as a mark of respect to the memory of certain recently-deceased public officials.
Destruction of worn flags- The Flag Code states:
The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.
Display of United States Flag with flags of other nations or of states-
The Flag Code states that the flag of the United States should always be displayed with utmost dignity and respect and in the position of highest honor.
Use of the Flag in jewelry, commercial products, apparel, and advertising- The Flag Code states:
The Flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.
It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.
The Flag Code officially recognizes the wearing of a flag patch or pin on the left side (near the heart) of uniforms of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations.
The Flag Code also states that the flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.
