Figure out a way to balance one's appetite in proportion to one's metabolism.
5 For one thing, the FDA should make it a point to figure out how to get Olestra on grocery shelves.
One of the biggest food problems is our love of fried foods.
Can't you find a way to allow the marketing of Olestra to the general public????? 4 I am sure there are, but I can't specifically offer any suggestions on this particular topic.
1 Obesity is not just a eating disorder.
There are so many factors that make up the obesity problem.
They include everything from what is consumed, to how much activity is participated in, to environment and emotional issues, to heredity.
No one approach is going to suffice for every case of obesity.
6 There are many ways to approach the obesity epidemic.
One such way is to figure out how to force the health insurance industry to cover the cost of obesity surgery.
For some of us, this surgery is the only viable, permanent option.
GENERAL GENERAL As an overweight adult, I know that there are worse things to suffer from than obesity.
However, in the case of overweight
