Increased Enforcement Boosts Illegal-Immigrant Arrests Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Denver, February 28, 2003 More vigilant law enforcement in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah is proving effective in nabbing illegal immigrants -- the number of illegal immigrants arrested in those three states has jumped 32 percent since 2001.
Of the 12,183 arrests of illegal immigrants, most were the result of special law enforcement teams established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service; others came through routine traffic stops by State Patrol officers.
Most of the illegal immigrants arrested were from Mexico and Central America heading for farm jobs in the southeastern United States or service work in the northeast.
11 in Freight Container from China Arrested at Tokyo Port Kyodo News, February 27, 2003 Japanese police arrested 11 people found in a container unloaded from a ship docked at a Tokyo port.
They are believed to be illegal immigrants from Fujian Province in China.
The illegal immigrants were traveling on the 9,400-ton Panamanian-registered freighter called the SITC Shanghai.
They were discovered and reported to customs officials when an employee of a berth-management company noticed that the tag attached to the container did not match the one on the list submitted to the company.
More Border Checks, So Number of Illegals Caught Down Again Straits Times, February 25, 2003 Tougher security measures to keep terrorists out of Singapore have also kept out illegal immigrants.

91 Illegal Immigrants Found Hiding in Squalid El Centro Home Associated Press Newswires, Dateline El Centro, California, February 25, 2003 Law enforcement officials found 91 illegal immigrants hiding in a filthy "drop home" in El Centro, located some 100 miles east of San Diego.
All were Mexican, with the exception of two Guatemalans.
They were packed into the house so tightly that there was only room to stand, according to this report.
The illegal immigrants were probably waiting for transportation to their final destinations.
With the exception of 12 -- including the Guatemalans -- who were detained as material witnesses, all were returned to Mexico.
Asylum Seekers Called to Trial by Jill Jolliffe, The Sydney Morning Herald, February 25, 2003 and Thais Send Accused to Australia Courier-Mail, February 24, 2003 and Iraqi Extradited Over People Smuggling By Sue Dunlevy, Daily Telegraph, February 24, 2003 and Australia to Try Alleged Iraqi People Smuggler Reuters News, Dateline Sydney, February 23, 2003 An alleged people smuggler has been extradited from Thailand to stand trial in Australia -- the first such successful extradition.
Iraqi citizen Achmad Hassan Jwad (also reported in the press by the name Ali Hassan Abdolamir Al Jenabi) faces prosecution for 22 people smuggling offenses under Australia's 1958 Migration Act.
Most of the offenses are related to Jwad's alleged involvement in smuggling some 359 illegal immigrants to Australia aboard four boats in 2000 and 2001.
Under tough Australian laws against people smuggling introduced in 1999, Jwad could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
Thai officials arrested Jwad at Australia's request in June last year after he flew from Indonesia to Bangkok carrying a fake Moroccan passport.
He served two months in a Bangkok detention center for that offense.
Australia lodged an extradition request in June 2002, which a Thai court approved in December.
Illegal immigrants who were transported to Australia on Jwad's ships are expected to testify against Jwad.
Indiana Sees Big Jump in Illegal Immigration The Associated Press, February 24, 2003 Illegal immigrants in the state of Indiana have increased by more than 300 percent in the 1990s -- three times faster than the national average.
Federal officials say the increase is driven mostly by Hispanics looking for agricultural jobs.
Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky have shown similar increases in illegal immigrants.
Nationally, the number of illegal immigrants is estimated to be some 7 million.
Trial of Fourteen Suspected Smugglers Begins in Jindrichuv Hradec CTK Business News, Dateline Jindrichuv Hradec, South Bohemia, February 24, 2003 Prosecutors in Jindrichuv Hradec are charging 14 suspects of assisting in illegal border crossings from the Czech Republic into Germany and Austria.
The group, directed by Libor Istok, allegedly smuggled 500 people -- mostly Armenians, but also Chinese and citizens of the former Soviet Union.
The defendants face a maximum of three years in prison if charged with assisting illegal border crossings; 10 years in prison if charged with criminal conspiracy.
TV Report Describes People Trafficking Through Ukraine BBC Monitoring International Reports, February 22, 2003 Human smugglers are increasingly using Ukraine as a transit country for moving illegal migrants to Western Europe, according to a report aired by Ukrainian STB TV on January 17.
Illegal migrants first became a problem in the early 1990s, after the breakdown of the Soviet Union and the rise of the concept of "transparent borders" between former Soviet republics.
What started as a trickle of illegal migrants is now becoming a steady stream facilitated by international crime groups.
Most of the illegal migrants are Afghan, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Kurdish, and Vietnamese, and most are bound for Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands or Sweden.
Because Ukraine already has "fairly well-developed" communities of Vietnamese, Chinese and Afghan nationals in several cities, the suspicion is that ethnically based organized groups are facilitating the human-smuggling business.
Ukraine officials fear that human-smuggling transit routes can be easily employed by narcotics and weapons smugglers as well as terrorists.
Troopers, INS To Work Together on Illegal Aliens Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Montgomery, Alabama, February 20, 2003 Alabama state troopers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service will join forces in stemming the flow of illegal aliens into the state.
The troopers will receive federal training that will allow them to arrest illegal aliens on immigration charges.
Federal law has provided for the training for several years, but so far only Alabama and Florida have shown interest.
Immigration Epiphany By Georgie Anne Geyer, The Washington Times, February 20, 2003 James Ziglar, who served as the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from August 2001 to November 2002, has had an "epiphany" about U.S. attitudes on immigration, according to columnist Geyer.
He is quoted as saying that "Americans can't make up their minds on immigrations....
For now, the public dialogue is being driven by the extremes of right and left.
We've got the xenophobes vs. the open door."
Ziglar is now a resident fellow at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics, where he plans to focus on immigration issues.
One of his concerns is the lack of citizenship training, both in the public schools and in immigration preparation, which, he said, has led to "isolated communities and isolated ethnic enclaves, and nobody breaks out into the larger community."
"But if you devalue citizenship, then assimilation does not happen," he said, "and that is not going to change until there's a value placed upon citizenship and until we get to the place where there is democratic assimilation and people know our history, our civics, our language."
Another of his concerns is the increasing number of illegal immigrants entering the United States -- some 800,000 each year, according to figures compiled by the San Diego Union-Tribune.
Congolese Pop Star Papa Wemba Under Investigation in France in Illegal Immigration Ring By Verena Von Derschau, Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Paris, February 20, 2003 Congolese pop star Papa Wemba has been arrested by Paris police for his suspected involvement in a human-smuggling network.
Wemba, known for his danceable "rumba rock," allegedly was involved in a network that charged Congolese $3,500 each to obtain European visas and represent the illegal immigrants as musicians on international tours.
Pakistan Gears Up To Tackle People Smugglers Agence France Presse, Dateline Islamabad, February 20, 2003 Pakistan's government is hoping to catch more illegal immigrants through the use of machine-readable passports, harsher penalties for passport forgers and new systems to register illegal immigrants and border traffic.
Under new laws, passport forgers face 14-year jail sentences, while human smugglers could get 10-year prison terms.
During Pakistan's first seminar on people smuggling, Saiyed Mohib Asad, head of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency, acknowledged that Pakistan's weak border controls make it an attractive base for hundreds of people-smuggling rackets that use the country as a transit point for some 15 south or central Asian countries.
Pakistani authorities estimate that some seven million illegal aliens live within the country.
Stop Pushing, Says Jakarta By Tim Dodd, Australian Financial Review, Dateline Jakarta, February 20, 2003 and Indonesia To Send Suspected People Smuggler to Egypt By Muklis Ali, Reuters News, Dateline Jakarta, February 15, 2003 and Indonesia Says It is Unlikely to Extradite Suspected People Smuggler to Australia Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Jakarta, February 14, 2003 Yusril Izha Mahendra, Indonesia's minister of justice, has criticized Australia for its continuing efforts to extradite alleged people smuggler Abu Quassey.
Quassey is accused of organizing the 2001 ship voyage in which 353 asylum seekers drowned trying to reach Australia.
Indonesian officials are planning to deport Quassey to his native Egypt.
Indonesia lacks laws against people smuggling.
Indonesian authorities detained Quassey for overstaying his visa.
With more than 17,000 islands and a porous border, Indonesia is being used as a transit country for Middle Eastern and Afghan asylum seekers trying to reach Australia.
Australia, on the other hand, has cracked down hard on illegal immigration.
Boats of asylum seekers are intercepted and diverted to Pacific islands.
Czechs, Germans Begin Joint Border Patrols Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Prague, Czech Republic, February 17, 2003 In an effort to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into Germany, German and Czech police began joint border patrols on February 17.
The patrols are a result of a cross-border cooperation treaty both countries signed in 2000.
The Czech Republic has been tightening its border in preparation for joining the European Union next year.
Companies With Immigrant Labor Thriving Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Denver, Colorado, February 16, 2003 "Labor brokers" -- companies that provide illegal immigrant labor to contractors responsible for building sites across the United States -- are thriving, despite a poor economy and federal labor laws.
Contractors, according to this report, are dropping full-time employees to cut costs and are using illegal aliens instead.
Mike Nobles, who runs a $6-million-per-year Tennessee-based "labor broker" company, says contractors like illegal immigrants because they are cheap, union-free labor.
Nobles is quoted as saying: "You don't have to worry about workman's comp payments with Mexicans because they are afraid to go to the hospital.
They're not going to file a big claim and sue you like the Americans are.
That's what this boils down to.
We have these people intimidated."
Will Collette studied labor brokers for the AFL-CIO in Washington.
(The AFL-CIO -- American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations -- is a federation of 65 American labor unions and includes more that 13 million members.)
He estimates that "labor brokers" for both commercial and residential construction may provide 1 million workers, or a sixth of the industry's labor force.
Insurance Scam Targets Illegal Immigrants Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Colorado Springs, February 13, 2003 Illegal immigrants may be the victims of a scam operation selling them fake insurance papers for up to $230.
Authorities are investigating at least 18 cases -- all but two involving Mexicans -- of forged insurance papers submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
So far, three people have been arrested and charged with attempting to influence a public servant and forgery.
These felonies carry penalties of up to six years in prison and fines up to $500,000.
Immigration Taking Toll on Parks, Refuges Near U.S.-Mexico Border By April Reese, Land Letter, Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC, Public Lands, Vol. 10, No. 9, February 13, 2003 Waves of illegal immigrants are taking a heavy toll on U.S. public lands along the Mexican border, federal officials say.
Some 900,000 people are caught each year trying to sneak into the United States.
Their efforts to reach the United States drive them into protected desert lands, where they crowd out wildlife at watering holes and destroy and trash habitat.
Mike Coffeen, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Tucson, Arizona, is quoted as saying, while surveying the area by airplane: "the level of impact is just shocking."
The National Park Service is looking at a proposal that would put up vehicle barriers to help stem illegal immigrant traffic into Arizona's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.
See: executive summary for Report to the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations on Impacts Caused by Undocumented Aliens Crossing Federal Lands in Southeast Arizona.
Asylum a Key Issue for Britons -- Poll Reuters News, Dateline London, February 12, 2003 A poll conducted by Populus for the Times newspaper shows that 39 percent of Britons polled say that asylum seekers are the most serious problem facing the nation; another 49 percent say the problem is serious but not paramount.
Australia "Has No Right" to Smuggler By Matthew Moore, The Age, Dateline Jakarta, February 11, 2003 and Egypt Wants People Smuggler Daily Telegraph, Dateline Jakarta, February 7, 2003 Egypt, Australia Demand Extradition of Alleged People Smuggler Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Jakarta, February 6, 2003 Ezzat Saad, Egypt's ambassador to Indonesia, says Australia has no legal right to prosecute an Egyptian citizen accused of people smuggling.
Mootaz Attia Mohammad Hasan, also known as Abu Quassey, is wanted by Australian authorities for organizing an October 2001 voyage that led to the drowning deaths of some 350 illegal immigrants seeking asylum in Australia.
If found guilty in Australian courts, he could face a 20-year prison sentence.
It is unclear what punishment he might face in Egypt.
Indonesia has no law against people smuggling, but is currently holding Abu Quassey at an immigration detention center after he completed serving a six-month prison sentence for violating Indonesian visa laws.
Indonesia has yet to decide whether to deport Quassey to Australia or Egypt.
Seoul Urged To Protect Alien Workers By Kim Ji-Ho, The Korea Herald, February 11, 2003 The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the state human rights watchdog, is urging the South Korean government to improve working conditions for foreigners inside its borders and grant them full labor rights.
There are an estimated 289,000 illegal migrant workers in the Republic of Korea.
Many come legally under the government's "industrial trainee" system but leave their designated work sites for higher-paid jobs.
The move changes their status to that of illegal migrant workers.
A recent NHRC poll revealed that three out of every 10 foreign workers were threatened by their employers to report their illegal status to government authorities.
Snakehead Sentenced For Role in Dover Tragedy By Peter Michael, South China Morning Post, February 8, 2003 A Hong Kong court handed down a four-year prison sentence to Lam Hei-kit.
Lam was a key financial figure in a failed human-smuggling incident that claimed the lives of 58 illegal immigrants in England.
The court learned that just hours after the discovery of the bodies in a cargo container on June 30, 2000, about US$348,000 was deposited into Lam's bank accounts.
Authorities also discovered a significant number of false travel documents in his home.
The immigrants suffocated in the back of a truck during the five-hour ferry crossing from Holland.
Perry Wacker, the driver, was jailed for 14 years in April, 2001 for his role.
Smugglers Use Suitcases To Transport Humans By Li Kui, South China Morning Post, February 5, 2003 Called the "Mukha Airlines," Indians and Pakistanis are being smuggled to Hong Kong inside suitcases.
The "passengers," an average of 15 people a month, fly themselves to mainland China with a tourist visa.
They then meet a "pilot" near the Hong Kong border who stuffs them into a large suitcase.
The "pilot" wheels the illegal immigrant through customs and then, to the shock of passersby, the "passenger" emerges and disappears into the crowd.
Undocumented Immigrant Tally Hits 7 Million By Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Chicago Tribune, Dateline Washington, February 1, 2003 The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in the United States reached 7 million in 2000.
