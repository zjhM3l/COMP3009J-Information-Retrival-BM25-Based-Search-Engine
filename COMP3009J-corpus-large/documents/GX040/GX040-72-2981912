The Audio Division, within the FCC's Media Bureau (USA), regulates AM and FM broadcast radio services, as well as FM Translator and Booster stations.
The Division receives and evaluates thousands of applications per year from the nation's approximately 14,000 AM, FM commercial, FM noncommercial educational, FM Low Power, and FM translator and booster stations as well as applicants for new radio stations.
These applications include station modification applications, applications for new stations, assignment or transfer applications, license applications, and renewal applications.
The FCC's Search Tools may also be used to help locate information on the FCC site.
