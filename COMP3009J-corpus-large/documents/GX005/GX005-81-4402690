Artificial Intelligence _________________________________________________________________ SCOPE AND SIGNIFICANCE:
The term artificial intelligence or AI denotes the concept of machines capable of intelligent thought.
Since the beginning of the computer science field researchers have been working on developing machines capable of performing higher intellectual processes which are characteristically human.
Such tasks include; the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience
Within the AI field are a multitude of interwoven subfields which include: expert systems, genetic algorithms or evolutionary computation, image understanding, information navigation and retrieval, intelligent agents, intelligent assistance, knowledge sciences, logic, natural language recognition, neural networks, planning and scheduling, reasoning, robotics, and rule-based systems.
BOOKS on the subject can be found in the Library's online catalog Goddard GALAXIE.
Select one of the following subject terms for immediate results:
artificial intelligence , knowledge engineering , machine learning , expert systems , fuzzy logic , neural nets , neural networks , genetic algorithms , evolutionary computation , cognitive science , robotics.
