Two consumer groups called on California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to conduct an ethics probe into a state contract with an Oklahoma-based energy company.
The Consumers Union and The Utility Reform Network want Lockyer to investigate whether a 10-year contract with Williams Cos. was tainted because it was negotiated by one of Gov. Gray Davis' top energy advisers, whose company earned consulting fees from the deal.
If there was a conflict of interest, the agreement should have been voided or re-negotiated, the groups allege.

California power regulators announced an agreement Tuesday with Southern California Edison Co. that the state says will allow the utility to pay some $3 billion in debt and help it avoid following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy.
The settlement was reached by the Public Utilities Commission over a suit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC in November 2000, in which Edison said the commission's refusal to raise electric rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.
Under the settlement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims.
The plan intends to ``restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers,'' said a release issued by the PUC.
October 3, 2001 - Officials with Edison International and Southern California Edison Co. say the settlement they've negotiated in secret with the Public Utilities Commission will allow it to retire more than $3 billion of the utility's nearly $4 billion of debt, allowing it to pay hundreds of creditors.

October 4, 2001 - Secretary of State Bill Jones unveils an ethics reform plan that he said will prevent conflict of interests by government officials.
The plan, which Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, plans to sponsor as legislation next year, would require public officials to file a statement of economic interest the first day on the job.
Paychecks would be withheld until they are filed.
Jones said the proposed rules are necessary to avoid conflicts of interests such as those revealed among some of the governor's energy advisers.
October 5, 2001 - A federal judge approves a settlement designed to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy.
U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew calls the settlement "fair, adequate and reasonable to the parties, the shareholders and to the public and is not a bailout by any means.''
The approval came after lawyers for the state's second largest utility and the state Public Utilities Commission filed papers Thursday urging Lew to allow the deal to stand.
The agreement is designed to allow Edison to pay off an estimated $3.3 billion of its more than $6 billion debt by forcing its customers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for at least two more years.
It also would require Edison's shareholders to forego $1.2 billion worth of dividends over three years.

By delaying by three months a vote to ban direct access for utility customers, utility regulators have shifted $8 billion in energy costs from big businesses to residential and small business customers, state Treasurer Phil Angelides said today.

The Board has asked the Legislature to consider this issue next year.
October 29, 2001 - U.S. Supreme Court justices decline to review an appellate court decision that could potentially expose the state to a limited lawsuit by Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

The stay is sought by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a San Francisco-based consumer organization.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has directed TURN to go back to District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew -- who approved the settlement earlier this month -- to ask for an injunction until an appeal can be heard.
If Judge Lew decides against the stay, the Court of Appeals says it may consider one.

November 1, 2001 - Californians begin paying a higher interest rate on a $4.3 billion loan that was used to repay the state treasury for energy purchases.
The state received the loan to tide it over until the $12.5 billion bond was issued.

November 6, 2001 - Department of Water Resources officials announce a $3 billion reduction in the estimated cost the state will pay for power through the next year.
The reduction is partly due to a number of commercial customers fleeing the utilities while the PUC delayed a vote to stop letting customers choose alternate providers.
A special Senate committee questions Terry Winter, president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator, regarding his decision to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee to lift the $250-per-megawatt price cap on power last winter.
He testifies that he had defied his bosses and the governor when he asked federal regulators last December to lift caps on energy prices because he had made up his mind and didn't want any interference.
