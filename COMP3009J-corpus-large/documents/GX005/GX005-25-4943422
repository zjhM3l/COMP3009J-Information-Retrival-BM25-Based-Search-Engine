STATEMENT BY FHWA ACTING DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR WALTER SUTTON CHAIR, FEDERAL TASK FORCE ON THE BOSTON CENTRAL ARTERY/TUNNEL PROJECT
The Federal Task Force for the Central Artery, which included engineers, lawyers, accountants and contracting specialists, has completed its report and has delivered it to the Federal Highway Administrator, Kenneth R. Wykle.
Our mission was to investigate the potential $1.4 billion cost overrun of the "Big Dig" project, to evaluate the state's plan for addressing the overrun costs, and to examine the overall management and oversight processes.
To complete its mission, the Federal Task Force: * assessed the FHWA oversight process and reviewed the FHWA management structure; * determined the effectiveness of the project's financial reporting system; * investigated the $1.4 billion potential cost overrun and examined the state's plan to cover the overrun; * assessed potential indicators for better predicting costs increases; and * assessed potential cost saving measures.
While the report discusses in brief the state's March 15 finance plan, a comprehensive analysis of this plan is being conducted by FHWA independent of the Task Force.
This analysis will be completed shortly.
