ARRESTED: SCAMMER JAMES WILSON !!
James Eugene Wilson, well-known to SCAM-NET viewers since 1999 as a long-time criminal operating in San Antonio (as well as in Florida), was arrested on August 1, 2002, on four felony warrants (three for Felony-Theft and one for Organized Crime).
The arrest took place during the SAPD/BCSO Felony Warrant Drive conducted during the last week of July/first week of August.
Wilson is currently in the Bexas County Jail.
For more information on Wilson, please go to our Scam-Net postings below: PARKING LOT SCAM AFRICAN CHARITY SWITCH 
MORE LATIN LOTTO SCAMS!! Recently, in the East part of San Antonio, two Hispanic females conned a 57-year-old Hispanic female out of approximately $15,000.00 in jewelry in a Latin Lotto Scam.
One of the suspects approached the victim in the parking lot of an HEB on S.WW White, claimed to have a $150,000 winning lotto ticket, but said she could not cash it because she was from Costa Rica.
Suspect #2 arrived and convinced the victim that if they all chipped in $15,000 they could split the winnings.
The victim took both suspects to her house and gave them the jewelry.
The victim then drove the suspects to an office, where the suspects disappeared (with the victim's jewelry).
One suspect is described as a Hispanic female, 40-60 years old, 5'5"-5'6", 130 lbs, wearing a dark-colored cap and blue blouse.
The second suspect was described as a Hispanic female, 33-36 years, 5'4", 140 lbs, wearing a white knitted top with brown pants.
Her hair was in a bun.
Both suspects had accents.
Anyone with information about this crime or the suspects, please contact East Property Crimes at (210)207-8854.

"PIGEON DROP SCAM" ALERT Please go to: "Pigeon Drop Scam" Alert (PDF format).
An ALERT from Newell, TX, Police Department about a group of travelling scam artists who are doing the "Pigeon Drop" scam in parking lots.
See PARKING LOT SCAM for info on previous similar scams in San Antonio.
[getacro.gif] __________________________________________________________________
ELGORDO : SPANISH LOTTO SCAM Letters are again being sent, by e-mail and snail mail, notifying San Antonio residents that they have "won the ElGordo Spanish Lottery."
The notices provide an amount of winnings (usually US$ millions), and a phone number to contact to make the arrangements to have the winnings transferred to the US, to the "winners'" bank account.
This is a SCAM, similar to the Canadian Lotto Scam also listed on this page.
It is such a widespread scam that the actual (legitimate) ElGordo Spanish Lottery has posted an ALERT on their web page, titled : "Advice About Scams".
Do not reply to this letter if you receive one.
Replying will only notify the scammers that your e-mail address is "good", and you will most likely receive additional scam solicitations.
__________________________________________________________________
IRS CONSUMER ALERT: ADVANCE CHILD TAX CREDIT SCAM The Internal Revenue Service issued a SCAM ALERT on June 18, 2003, warning taxpayers about a new scam targeting potential recipients of the Advance Child Tax Credit.
The IRS has seen isolated instances of this new scheme.
HOW DOES IT WORK ? A taxpayer receives a telephone call from a person who promises to speed up the payment of the Advance Child Tax Credit checks.
The catch is the taxpayer must agree to a $39.99 charge to a credit card.
The IRS reminds taxpayers that no person or organization can "speed up" the payment of tax benefits.
IN REALITY: Taxpayers do not have to take any action to get the new benefit, which features an advance payment for up to $400 per qualifying child.
The Treasury Department and IRS will perform all the calculations and automatically mail a notice and a check to each eligible taxpayer, beginning the week of July 25, 2003.
SIMILAR SCAMS: Under the new scam, the IRS is seeing a continuation of a trend that emerged earlier this year when the families of those serving in the Armed Forces were targeted.
In both of these schemes, scam artists use current events to prey on unsuspecting victims.
The scams also feature callers seeking credit card information to get taxpayers to pay for special benefits.
If the taxpayer agrees to the charge and provides a credit card number or other sensitive personal information, she could find a much larger charge to her account.
By the time the taxpayer realizes something is wrong, the scam operator is long gone, possibly victimizing another taxpayer.
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? If you encounter this latest tax scam or suspect tax fraud or abuse in some other situation, report it to your nearest IRS office.
When in doubt, seek help from the IRS or a tax professional.
You can also call the IRS TAX FRAUD HOTLINE at 1-800-829-0433.

OLD SCAM RETURNS: BOGUS NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION SCAM Recently, there have been several reported cases on the Southside of San Antonio involving an individual who goes door-to-door selling bogus subscriptions to the Express-News.
The individual approaches the homeowner and offers them a newspaper subscription for the incredibly low price of $20 for six months.
After the money is paid, the homeowner never receives a paper.
In some instances, the individual has offered to accept credit cards, in an attempt to get the credit card number.
A suspect has been identified in this scam: a Hispanic male, 24 years old, 5'10", 135 lbs, sometimes using the false name "Oscar Ortiz."
If someone approaches you offering an unusually cheap newspaper subscription, please contact the police, or verify the salesman's credentials with the Express-News before paying the salesman any money or providing him access to your credit card number.
__________________________________________________________________
SPECIAL ALERT: CASHIER'S CHECK/INTERNET SALES SCAM PLUS RELATED INVESTMENT SCAMS !! Alerts have been issued by Frost National Bank, the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and other agencies concerning COUNTERFEIT CASHIER'S CHECKS that are currently being used in various scams originating in internet commerce or e-mail solicitations.
All the scams have in common the payment to the victim of a Cashier's Check for an amount much greater than what the victim is due (for the sale of an item, etc.).
The "buyer" usually tells the victim/seller that "someone owes him money", and the victim can take the check in payment, deposit it, and refund the extra funds back to the "buyer" (who is generally in Nigeria or another African country).
However, the Cashier's Check is later found to be counterfeit, and the victim is out not only the balance, but also the item sold (if it has been shipped).
One of the more popular Cashier's Checks used in this scam so far during 2003 is a counterfeit Frost National Bank Cashier's Check.
98% have surfaced with the name of Joshua Acosta as the "remitter".
(Acosta was a victim of this scam chain.)
More than 300 victims have been identified from every state in the U.S. so far, with potential losses amounting to over $3 million.
This scam of providing a large amount Cashier's Check and agreeing to a refund of the balance is also used in variations of the very popular "Nigerian Investment Scam", in the newer variation the "Iraq Investment Scam" ("...desperate to get money out of Iraq..."), as well as purchase offers from African and Middle Eastern countries for items advertised for sale over the internet (vehicles are very popular targets), for "signing bonus" fees paid to victims who were offered non-existent jobs, plus a large variety of similar scams.
HOW TO AVOID THIS SCAM: Cashier's Checks from Frost Bank and other banks are generally safe and secure payment methods.
HOWEVER: * If you are offered a "deal" that sounds too good to be true, and * it involves you agreeing to accept a Cashier's Check for more money than you are owed, and * you are asked to remit ANYTHING to the "buyer" (or to the foreign investor), * YOU SHOULD NOT BE FOOLED!! IT IS A SCAM.
For more information on this scam, please see on this page: Nigerian Investment Scam Nigerian Investment Scam AGAIN An Earlier Cashier's Check Scam (10/2002) Also see these pages: OCC Alert on Frost Cashier's Checks Check Alerts from the FDIC Vehicle Purchase Scam Info
If you are the victim of this scam, please contact your local law enforcement agency.

ALERT: DOG SCAM BECOMES MONEY SCAM !! We previously alerted viewers to the "Registered Pet Scam", where a latin female would take money for a registered dog, then fail to deliver the pet.
Now it appears that the same latin female, Veronica Lozano Lopez (DOB 01-29-1969, pictured right) has also targeted elderly San Antonio residents who have expressed interest in dogs.
In one recent case she targeted an 83-year-old lady who placed an ad in the paper concerning finding a lost dog.
Lozano went to the lady's house to claim the dog, then later returned to socialize with the lady.
Lozano arrived at the lady's house unexpectedly, spent the day talking with her, then finally told the lady that she (Lozano) had inherited a large sum of money in what she called a "Merrill Lynch account."
Lozano told the lady she needed to transfer the money to a third party bank account so she would not be penalized for early withdrawal.
Lozano even staged a telephone call to "Merrill Lynch", which was really a call to Lozano's accomplice. [lopezveronica.gif] Lozano finally convinced the lady to withdraw $3,000 from her own bank account and give it to Lozano, to help her until she could cash out of her mutual funds.
The lady then realized she had been scammed, and called the police.
Victoria Lozano Lopez was arrested and charged with Theft $1,500-20,000, and was then transferred to Karnes County, where she had 3 Forgery probation violation warrants.
Case submitted by South Investigations.

SPECIAL ALERT : FLOOD SCAMS !! Be aware that the recent flood disaster in the San Antonio area will become a magnet for various con-men and scam artists.
[We originally posted this SCAM ALERT after the 1998 flood; it is still relevant after the 2002 flood.]
The two major scams to BE ON THE LOOKOUT for include the following: __________________________________________________________________
HOME REPAIR SCAMS CHARITY SCAMS * Use only LOCAL home repair companies.
* DO NOT use out-of state repair people (unless friends or relatives).
* Ask repair people for REFERENCES.
Check the references.
* Carefully control purchase of repair materials.
Ask for receipts.
* Be wary if repair people ask for large payment in advance.
* Be Alert and report if a contractor states he will assist you in obtaining a FEMA construction loan.
FEMA does not give loans.
They give grants in varying amounts.
The SBA assists flood victims in obtaining low interest loans.
* False "flood victim donations" scams may begin in this area.
* We encourage you to support actual flood victims, BUT PLEASE donate only to reputable charities.
* If someone calls asking for donations, DO NOT give your CREDIT CARD number over the phone!! * When in doubt, ask if you can donate clothes, cleaning supplies, etc. instead of cash.

AUDIO SPEAKERS SCAMS
This scam, which was recently reported in Leon Valley, is a scam that is pulled throughout the US, using various brand names of audio speakers.
In this scam, a motorist is flagged down (at a stopsign, parking lot, etc.) by individuals in a van or car who say they have some really expensive audio speakers they need to sell (cheaply), because their "boss" (or their company) ordered too many.
After a great deal of bargaining and talking, the motorist finally purchases the speakers for a price that he/she believes is "cheap", only to find out later that the speakers are worthless.
For a lengthy discussion of this scam, go to the CRIMES-OF-PERSUASION.COM web page, and enter "speakers" in their SEARCH box.
__________________________________________________________________
REGISTERED PET SALE SCAMS
Two scams involving the sale of registered pets are currently being practiced in the San Antonio area.
Both start with advertisements in the newspaper, and end up with the victim losing their money or their pet.
PET SCAM #1: In this scam, a young latin female answers a newspaper ad for a registered pet for sale.
She goes to the residence of the seller, and while observing the pets she asks to see a parent of the pet that is for sale.
While the owner/seller is fetching the parent animal, the female scam artist leaves with the pet that was for sale.
This thief is described as a petite latin female, 22 years old, 5'03", 100 lbs.
PET SCAM #2: In this second scam, a 30-year-old latin female is the seller.
She is running ads for registered dogs for sale, and taking deposits of up to $300 a pet, but not producing the pet when it comes time to finish the sale.
The scam artist takes the deposit money from prospective the buyer and promises a delivery date for the dog(s), but is never seen again.
This thief is described as a latin female, 30 years old, 5'07", 150, with red hair.
The Texas Attorney General's Office reports about 40 complaints on this case.
If you have any information on either of these scams or suspects, please contact Det. G. Cass at East Property Crimes, 207-8854.

LATIN LOTTO SCAM ARREST !!
SUSPECT ARRESTED IN APRIL LATIN LOTTO SCAM:
On April 16, two persons approached an elderly San Antonio resident on the south side of town and presented him with what was the usual "Latin Lotto Scam": they said they had won the lottery, but could not collect their winnings as they were not US citizens, but if the SA resident would assist them (and put up some good faith money!!), he could share in their lotto winnings.
After withdrawing $5,000 from his bank account and handing it to the scammers, the victim realized his mistake, struggled with the pair to reclaim his money, and called the police.
South Patrol, working on the victim's description, located and arrested one of the scammers, who was driving a rental car with Florida plates.
The two suspects, (left) Clodoveo Martinez, LM, 08-27-55, of Miami Beach, FL, who was arrested, and (right) Astrid Tovar, LF, 09-27-70, also of Miami Beach, and the renter of the vehicle, are pictured below.
Tovar is still at large.

__________________________________________________________________
SCAM ALERT FROM POSTAL INSPECTOR !!
THE SAN ANTONIO POSTAL INSPECTOR HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING ALERT:
"FRAUDULENT BONUS CHECKS FOR NON-EXISTENT JOBS"
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has learned that some individuals and banks are being victimized by a scheme involving on-line job applications.
SCAM DETAILS: The individuals have applied for and accepted jobs through an on-line job search service advertising "signing bonuses" of approximately $2,500 to new hires.
Each prospective employee has received a check ranging from $19,000 to $50,000 by mail from the prospective employer, with instructions to deposit the check, preferably at an ATM.
The recipient is further instructed to keep $2,000 to $4,000, depending upon the amount of the signing bonus, and return the balance of the money by wire to a location in Europe.
THE CHECKS ARE FRAUDULENT; therefore, the depositor is ultimately responsible for any amounts charged back to his or her account by the bank resulting from the dishonor of the checks.
In some cases, banks have suffered losses when a customer has been unable to cover the overdrafts resulting from the dishonor and return of the fraudulent checks.
Checks recovered in the San Antonio area so far bear names of banks in Florida; however, the routing numbers go to banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Ohio.
ANY INFORMATION you may have about these checks or this scheme should be immediatly reported to the nearest office of the FBI.
Check your local phone book, or go to the FBI web page for a list of local offices and numbers.

SPECIAL ALERT!!: LOTTERY SCAM
Early this month (January) a local elderly resident received a letter in the mail from the "Canadian National Lotteries (TransNational Trade Consortium)" notifying her that she was one of the winners in a lottery pool.
She was then contacted by phone by a person who instructed her to wire $1,800.00 to a (named) person in Quebec, Canada.
Alert bank employees learned of this scam when the elderly customer requested the $1,800 withdrawal, and rightfully convinced her it was a scam.
A police report has been filed on this attempted crime.

__________________________________________________________________
AFRICAN CHARITY SWITCH:
sketch sketch The two individuals pictured here have already swindled two elderly San Antonio residents out of a total of $14,000 in a "South African Charity Switch."
The suspects approach an elderly person and ask for help in finding a motel, a church or other location, so they can get the elderly person to give them a ride.
During the ride, the suspect(s) tells the driver a story concerning collecting money, and asks the elderly person to put up "good faith money" to assist in the collection or donation.
The suspect then finds an excuse to leave the car, with the money, and is not seen again.
WARNING: Beware if someone asks you to put up "good faith money"!!! __________________________________________________________________
SOUTH AFRICAN CHARITY SWITCH : Wilson photo
Location of Scam: San Antonio (Most recently, Alamo Heights) Target of Scam: Anyone Description of Scam: The South African Charity Switch is an old scam that recently appeared in Alamo Heights.
In this version, the actor, Jimmy Eugene Wilson (pictured at right), approaches a victim and claims he is a recent arrival from South Africa.
He says he has a large amount of money and needs help to get to a location.
During this conversation, another stranger enters the scene and offers to assist the South African (Wilson).
Wilson shows them both a large sum of money and explains he cannot take it back to S. Africa.
He offers them both a portion and then asks that they contribute the remainder to charity.
He asks that they first put up "good faith money".
The stranger (who is part of the scam) will encourage the victim to go with him.
The victim will put up the "good faith money", and it is usually put into a bandana that is then tied up.
Sometime during the scheme the bandana bundle is switched, and the victim later learns that he is left with a bandana full of cut up newspaper.
The stranger and the South African will have created a ruse to go into a nearby building or around a corner, and will have disappeared with the victim's cash.
The actor in this scam at this time is Jimmy Wilson, described as a black male, h: 6'02", w: 170lbs, black hair, brown eyes, DOB: 09-10-50.
Message: If you hear the key words "good faith money" be alert that these are common words used by con artists.
Never give money to someone you know nothing about, no matter how innocent they may appear.
Con and bunco artists are very convincing and are clever at countering your suspicions.
This scam was submitted by Alamo Heights PD 10/26/99 __________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________
SHORT CHANGE ARTIST
This subject will approach employees in a Department store with a small item (usually under $5.00) and ask to pay for it.
The suspect will produce a $100.00 bill for payment of the sale, but as the employee finishes the sale and gives the suspect his change back, he asks for the $100.00 bill back and offers to pay with a smaller bill.
The employee in most cases will give the change back along with the $100.00 bill, without realizing they have been taken.

Later, the dealer meets the buyer at a major dealership, tells them he won the bid for the car, and takes their money.
However, he never delivers the car.
The prospective buyers have been scammed.

londono photo alvarez photo The individual pictured at left, Luz Mery Londono, is wanted on felony warrants from San Antonio, Houston and Los Angeles, CA. Londono, together with her brother Henry Alvarez (pictured right), is wanted as part of a Lotto Scam that she and Alvarez worked together.
Henry Alvarez was recently arrested in Miami, FL, but Londono is still at large.
The individuals working this scam convince their victim that one of them has the winning Lotto ticket, but since he (or she) is here illegally, he/she cannot cash it.
One of the pair plays the part of a stranger who befriends the victim and pretends to assist the victim and the suspect in holding the winning Lotto ticket.
The suspects convince the victim to put up some money to buy the "winning" ticket from the suspects, but detract the victim with a faked illness or other "emergency" long enough to disappear with both the ticket and the money.
These individuals are very convincing.
However, do not trust strangers with your money.
Please contact the police if you know of individuals working such a scam.

NEW CREDIT CARD SCAM:
ATTENTION SAN ANTONIO BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS :
Recently in the San Antonio area, a number of residents have received telephone calls with lucrative offers to switch credit card companies.
Once the caller gains the information from the account holder to switch, he makes a number of charges with that person's personal/credit card information.
This has caused large losses to businesses and credit card companies.
WARNING : Do not give your personal account information over the telephone unless you know the caller.

HAIL DAMAGE REPAIR SCAM:
The San Antonio area has recently experienced hail damage.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous bogus contractors are aware of this situation and offer lucrative "deals" to residents whose homes have been hail damaged.
Upon receiving repair money up-front, the "contractors" never return to complete the repair jobs.
WARNING : Make sure you check to see if a contractor has a DBA, have a verifiable address, and are listed with the Better Business Bureau.
DO NOT PAY UPFRONT!! A good roofer with established credentials should have an account with a supplier.

[bullet5.gif] ACTIVE ONCE AGAIN: UTILITY IMPOSTER SCAM IS BACK!
Individuals are once again going to the homes of elderly San Antonio residents, telling the resident they are CPS workers or SAWS workers, and then gaining entry to the house.
Their purpose is to either steal the resident's valuables while the resident is distracted and/or demand money to perform unnecessary repairs.
Most recently (October 2002), two individuals posing as CPS workers gained entry to a house on Mason Street, and tried to get the elderly homeowner to pay for having a faucet fixed.
The pair left when the homeowner told them she did not have any money.
Nothing was stolen.
Police later located and identified the individuals, two white males who were driving a white 2002 GMC Sierra pickup truck with Missouri paper license plates.
BE ALERT! These, or other similar individuals may try to gain access to another house and be successful at theft and/or scamming the homeowner.

SPECIAL SCAM ALERTS
NEW : TOLL FRAUD SCAM In this scam an individual calls the victim and identifies himself as an AT
(These calls have been made to both businesses/government offices and residences.)
The "Technician" states that to complete the test on the lines you should press a series of numbers on the phone key pad, and then hang up.
According to the phone company, by pressing those numbers you give the requesting individual full access to your telephone line, which allows them to place long distance calls billed to your system.
This scam has been originating from many local jails and prisons.
NEW : AREA CODE 809 SCAM: In this scam someone sends the target an emergency message or page with the call-back number in the 809 area code.
The message (which is false) may concern a sick or injured relative, a family emergency, a prize won, or any enticement to call that 809 number.
What the target of the scam does not know is that the 809 area code is the same as a 900 area code number (the caller will be charged a large per/minute fee), but 809 is based in an area outside of US legal jurisdiction.
MESSAGE: Do not return unsolicited calls to an 809 area code number.
You will not receive any benefit yourself from returning these calls.
(The only ones to benefit are the foreign -- area code 809 -- phone companies.)
UTILITY WORKERS SCAM: This scam happens over and over, with different variations and different con artists.
It has recently popped up again in San Antonio.
Men posing as employees of a public utility (most recently in San Antonio as employees of SAWS, or San Antonio Water System) gain entrance to an elderly person's house to check the water pipes, but while in the house they distract the resident and steal money, jewelry, or other valuables.
(From: SAPD) MESSAGE: Never let anyone into your house unless they provide full and proper identification.
All public utility employees carry identification and wear uniforms.
Call the utility or agency office (YOU look up the number; don't use a number the employee provides) if you are suspicious.
ALSO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THESE SCAMS:
TITLE 1 FHA HOME IMPROVEMENT SCAM: Residents of poorer sections in San Antonio are offered Title 1 FHA loan money for home improvements, but later find large liens on their homes and may face foreclosure.
(From: SAPD)
COUPON SCAM: In Tucson, Arizona and recently in San Antonio a man has been going door to door selling Goodyear Tire Stores coupons "worth" $500 for $54.95.
In reality, the coupons are bogus; Goodyear has no such coupons.
The con artist is described as a clean-cut white male, sometimes wearing a Goodyear hat.(From: SAPD)
