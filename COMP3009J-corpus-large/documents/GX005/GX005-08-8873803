General Tips
Resolving Air Travel Problems
Delayed and Cancelled Flights
Airline delays caused by bad weather, air-traffic problems, and mechanical repairs are hard to predict or beyond the airlines' control.
If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you on their first available flight to your destination, at no additional charge.
If you are able to find a flight on another airline, ask the first airline to endorse your ticket to the new carrier.
This could save you a fare increase but there is no rule requiring them to do this.
Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements.
If you are delayed, ask the airline if they will pay for meals or a phone call.
Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled.
Overbooked Flights
Overbooking is not illegal, and most airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain extent in order to compensate for "no-shows."
Passengers are sometimes left behind or "bumped" as a result.
When seats are oversold, the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation.
Airlines set guidelines for what to offer passengers - money, a free trip, food, or lodging.
Federal rules protect you if you have been bumped against your will on most domestic flights or outbound international flights.
The airline must give you a statement describing your rights.If the airline is not able to get you to your final destination within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time, you are entitled to an on-the-spot payment as compensation.The amount depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay.
An airline may offer you free transportation on a future flight in place of a check for denied boarding compensation, but you have the right to insist on a check.
However, to be eligible for compensation, you must have a confirmed reservation - an "OK" in the status box of your ticket.
You must also meet the airline's deadlines for ticketing and check-in.
Delayed or Damaged Bags
If your bags don't come off the conveyor belt, report this to the airline before you leave the airport.
Insist that they fill out a form and give you a copy, even if they say the bag will be in on the next flight.
Also make sure you know:
o the name of the person who filled out the form;
o a phone number for follow up.
Confirm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without charge when it is found; ask them about this as well.
Some airlines will give you money to purchase a few necessities.
If they don't provide you with cash, ask what types of articles would be reimbursable, and keep all receipts.
If a suitcase arrives damaged - the airline will usually pay for repairs.
If an item can't be fixed, they will negotiate a settlement to pay you its depreciated value.
The same holds true for belongings packed inside.
Of course, airlines may decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or inadequate packing, rather than the airline's handling.
Lost Bags
If your bag is declared officially lost, you will have to submit a second, more detailed form within a set time period established by the airline.
The information you submit is used to estimate the value of your lost belongings.
Airlines consider the depreciated value of your possessions, not their original price or the replacement costs.
They can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per passenger on the amount of money they'll pay.
When your luggage and its contents are worth more than that, you may want to purchase "excess valuation," if available, from the airline when you check in.
The airline may refuse to sell excess valuation on some items that are especially valuable or breakable, such as antiques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts, negotiable securities and cash.
On international trips, the airline's liability limit is $9.07 per pound.
Keep in mind that these limits are maximums.
If the depreciated value of your property is worth less than the liability limit, the airline will offer this lower amount.
If the airline's settlement doesn't fully cover your loss, check your homeowner's or renter's insurance to see if it covers losses away from home.
Some credit card companies and travel agencies offer optional or even automatic supplemental baggage coverage.
