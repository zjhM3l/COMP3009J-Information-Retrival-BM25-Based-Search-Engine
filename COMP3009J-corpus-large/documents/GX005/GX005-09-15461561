The survey was conducted to collect data on the extent to which retailers prevent children from purchasing entertainment products that have been rated or labeled by entertainment industry self-regulatory associations or entertainment producers as potentially inappropriate for children.
Commission staff, through a contractor, recruited 13 to 16-year-olds unaccompanied by a parent to attempt to purchase movie tickets, movies on DVD, music recordings, and electronic games at 899 theaters and stores in 39 states.
The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice funded the survey.
The 2003 survey shows that 69 percent of the teenage shoppers were able to buy M-rated games; 83 percent were able to buy explicit-labeled recordings; and 36 percent were successful in purchasing tickets for admission to an R-rated film at movie theaters (see Table 1 below).
For the first time, the Commission also surveyed DVD retailers, where 81% of the teen shoppers were successful in purchasing R-rated movies on DVD.

The teen shoppers also noted: 1) whether the store or theater had signs, posters, or other information to inform customers about the rating system or the seller's policy on rating enforcement; and 2) whether the cashier or clerk asked the shopper his or her age before purchase (see Table 2 below).

This survey is the third in a series conducted in connection with the Commission's reports on the marketing of entertainment violence to children.
The survey results will be discussed at the Commission's day-long workshop to be held on October 29, 2003.
The goal of the workshop is to address the state of self-regulation in the entertainment industry, including children's access to products that have been rated or labeled as potentially inappropriate for them.
The workshop panels will feature members of entertainment industry groups, rating and labeling organizations, retailers and retailer trade associations, parent and consumer advocacy groups, and other interested parties.
There also will be an overview of the research on the effects of violent media on children.
The workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to engage in dialogue about working together to ensure that the rating and labeling systems are accurate and useful, that parents are informed about these systems, and that limits on children's access to entertainment that may be inappropriate for them are effective.
The workshop will be held from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on October 29, 2003 at the FTC Conference Center located at 601 New Jersey Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
It is open to the public, and there is no attendance fee.
