California Employment Development Department 
Occupations in this section are organized as follows: supervision; inspection; repair; construction; precision production; machine setting, operating, and tending; assembling and hand working; plant and system operation; transportation and material-moving equipment operation; and helpers, laborers, and manual material moving.
Because of the differing levels of experience and training required, production workers performing precision tasks (whether hand or machine) are reported separately.
In addition, the remaining production worker groups are divided between machine and manual operations.
The use of hand-held power tools is considered a manual operation.
