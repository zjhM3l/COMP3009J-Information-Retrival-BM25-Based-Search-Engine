PRESS RELEASE September 12, 2003
Tour of duty extended for all Michigan Guardsmen currently serving in Iraq
Lansing--
The Michigan National Guard Joint Headquarters has received verification that all Michigan Army National Guard members currently serving under Operation Iraqi Freedom orders will remain in Iraq for one year.
The year starts the day they arrive in theatre
.
The Joint Headquarters announced on Wednesday that only two Michigan Army National Guard units had received confirmation, when, in fact, the announcement affects four deployed units and five individual soldiers (attached to non-Michigan units).
"This gives our soldiers and their families some predictability to plan for the time when their lives should return to normal," said Brig. Gen. Robert V. Taylor, assistant adjutant general for the Michigan Army National Guard.
"This is a long deployment...a long time to be away from personal obligations like civilian employment, up-keep on homes or caring for an elderly parent; but, the men and women of the Michigan Army National Guard should be proud that they are following through with the military obligation they signed up for, especially now, when their country needs them the most."
Taylor, a member of the Army Reserve Forces Policy Committee at the Pentagon, had just returned from a committee meeting.
He said one of the main topics was about Guard and Reserve troop rotations and explained the Army needs continuity to effectively continue its work in Iraq.
"If the Guard and Reserve leave now, it will unravel the team in place."
He further added that there will be future rotations and the Michigan National Guard should expect to see more deployments.
The new departure date for the Midland-based 1460th Transportation Company is April 1, 2004; the Grayling-based 1438th Engineer Detachment, June 13, 2004; the Pontiac-based 1775th Military Police Company, May 11, 2004; and Company A, 156th Signal Battalion, June 14, 2004.
The 745th Ordnance Company, Grayling, Mich., has also received confirmation that their tour of duty has been extended; however, they are currently serving at Fort Hood, Texas, replacing an active duty unit that was sent to Iraq.
The 745th was activated December 1, 2002.
This extension means the Grayling unit may not return home until Thanksgiving 2004.
Currently, a little more that 900 Michigan Army and Air National Guard members are serving on active duty in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.
Approximately 430 of those are serving in Iraq; a little more than 300 are serving at Michigan Air National Guard Bases in Mount Clemens and Battle Creek; and 70 soldiers from the 177th Military Police Brigade, Taylor, Mich., are serving at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
