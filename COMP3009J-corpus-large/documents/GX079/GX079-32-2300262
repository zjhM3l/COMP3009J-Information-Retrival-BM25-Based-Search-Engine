Researchers at Hartwick College working with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) have discovered what is causing deformed frogs in at least some ponds in New York State.
Deformed Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens) with malformed limbs, including extra limbs, and missing limbs, were analyzed by Eric Paul, Fish and Wildlife Ecologist for the DEC, in collaboration with Dr. Stanley K. Sessions, a developmental biologist, and his students at Hartwick College.
The researchers experimentally demonstrated that malformed limbs and extra limbs were caused in some frogs by cysts of a parasitic flatworm called a trematode.
This is the same parasite that has recently been shown to cause the same kinds of abnormalities in California treefrogs.
This particular parasite, a trematode of the genus Ribeiroia, is spread by birds and has a wide geographic distribution.
To test whether the parasite cysts infecting the frogs were actually causing the deformities, Sessions and his students examined lab-raised Leopard Frog tadpoles that were infected with the same trematode.
Their research showed that the parasite can cause the same kinds of deformities as seen in the frogs obtained from the wild.
This is the first experimental confirmation of parasites as a cause of amphibian limb malformations in eastern North America.
But parasites are not the only cause of deformed frogs in New York! The researchers also analyzed samples of frogs with missing limbs, and instead of finding parasites they found young tadpoles with their limbs obviously bitten off.
Raising tadpoles in the lab, the researchers found that the tadpoles will chew each others' limbs off under crowded conditions, resulting in frogs with missing limbs just like those found in the wild.Thus the research points to two different kinds of deformities with two different causes: frogs with malformed limbs including extra limbs, caused by parasites, and frogs with missing limbs caused by attempted predation.
Eric Paul is coordinating reports of deformed amphibians in New York State.
