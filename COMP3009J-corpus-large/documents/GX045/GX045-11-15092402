Administrative Information
Provenance
Since November 1997, Joel Martin Halpern has donated a substantial amount of materials related to his and his wife's ethnographic fieldwork to the American Folklife Center.
Prior to arriving at the Library of Congress, a portion of this collection (33 audio recordings) was stored at The Amherst College Library.
Upon Professor Halpern's request, these materials were deaccessioned in 1997, and he donated them to the American Folklife Center.
Furthermore, 126 black-and-white photographs (see Box 13) were given to Joel Martin Halpern by the Ethnographic Museum in Sofia in exchange for anthropology textbooks.
Although AFC1998/001 is closed, Halpern will continue to donate materials that will become part of other collections.
Processing History
Processing of the collection and preparation of a collection guide commenced in the spring of 2000 and was closed on July 31, 2001.
Lydia Heretz, Erica Haskell, Theresa Sotto, and Amanda Cawley processed; Milisa Petronijevic and Predrag Pajic were consulted; Alexander F. Sheriff and Nancy-Jean Seigel finalized the guide.
The collection guide has undergone a number of revisions, including editing contributions made by Professor Halpern.
Location of Materials
Transferred to Other Divisions: 486 commercial recordings, as well as a Yugoslavian record label catalog and its supplement, were transferred to the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division at the Library of Congress.
Photocopies of three conference papers on Vietnamese themes, not authored by the Halperns, were added to the Folklife Reading Room's subject file.
558 published works, primarily on ethnographic themes relating to the Balkans, were transferred to the Acquisitions or the Selection Officer of the East European Division for addition to the general collection.
Copies of the title pages of these volumes are on file in this collection.

The Collectors
Joel Martin Halpern was born April 8, 1929, in New York City.
Halpern received a B.A. in History from the University of Michigan in 1950, and in 1956 earned his Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University.
He started his teaching career in 1955 as a lecturer in anthropology at Columbia; he then served as assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1958 to 1963, and as associate professor of anthropology at Brandeis University from 1963 to 1965.
From 1965 to 1967 Halpern was an associate at the Harvard University Russian Research Center.
From 1967 until his retirement in 1992, he was first associate professor and then professor of anthropology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
His ethnographic research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Canadian Government, the National Academy of Sciences, the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as by the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
Throughout his career, Halpern has traveled widely and conducted extensive field research.
In the summer of 1950, he studied Eskimo settlements on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska.
In 1953-54 and during several other times throughout his career (1961-62, 1964, 1978, 1986), Halpern, and his wife traveled to and resided in various parts of the former Yugoslavia, where they studied Serbian village folklife.
In the mid-1950s, the Halperns also conducted fieldwork in Laos, while visiting Thailand and Vietnam.
At that time, Halpern was employed as a Field Service Officer with the Community Development Division of USOM (the American aid mission).
He returned on research trips to Laos in 1959 and 1969.
Other research trips took him to Sweden, the Soviet Union, Greece, Israel, India, Bulgaria, and Canada.
Although he conducted research in various global locations, the majority of the primary source materials in this collection was gathered in Yugoslavia, Laos, and Canada.
Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern was born in 1931.
She received her B.A. in geography-geology from Barnard College in 1953, her M.A. in linguistics, and her Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1979.
Initially, her career focused on socio-linguistics, though she later specialized in medical anthropology.
During her career, Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern has served a research associate and adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts.
She has traveled and lectured in Australia, India, Pakistan, and Hungary among other areas.
In 1974, she conducted fieldwork among South Slavic Canadians in Ontario under the auspices of the Canadian Museum of Civilization.
Her research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Scope and Content Note
The Joel Martin Halpern Collection consists of photographs, slides, photocopies of photographs, photocopies of articles, audiotapes, videocassettes, published book materials, texts in native languages, manuscripts, reproductions of visual images, and ephemera related to his ethnographic field documentation undertaken from 1949 to 2000 in Asia, Europe, and North America.
The materials were assembled by Joel Martin Halpern, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and by his wife and colleague Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern.
The Halperns conducted their fieldwork primarily from the 1950s to the 1990s, principally in the area of the former Yugoslavia, as well as in other areas of the Balkans.
Their most intensive fieldwork was among the Serbs.
In addition to this work, Joel Halpern conducted his own ethnographic research among Laotian, Vietnamese, and Inuit ethnic groups.
The research materials in this collection emphasize historic aspects of folk culture.
This includes documentation of material culture, such as architecture, agricultural implements, household utensils, and costume, as well as intellectual culture, such as music within the context of peasant tradition and village folk beliefs, and oral tradition in the setting of kinship structures and the structure of community social organization.
Much of the primary source material of this collection consists of photographs of Balkan areas, especially Serbian and Bulgarian villages.
There is also a series of sound recordings of music and interviews with Serbians and Bulgarians (see tape logs), as well as a collection of folklore programs recorded from Sofia radio, plus videocassettes of Bosnian and Serbian rural life.
In addition there are interviews with Canadian Inuit people and tapes from the Inuit broadcasting Coorporation recorded from broadcasts in the Baffin Island area.
