NECESSITY, FUNCTION, AND CONFORMITY: To regulate conditions under which thoroughbred racing shall be conducted in Kentucky.
The function of this administrative regulation is to outline the requirements for assigning weights for the horse to race.
Section 1.
(1) Weight penalties shall be obligatory.
Weight allowance shall be claimed at time of entry and shall not be waived after the posting of entries, except by consent of the stewards.
(2) A horse shall start with only the allowance of weight to which it is entitled at time of starting, regardless of its allowance at time of entry.
(3) Horses incurring weight penalties for a race shall not be entitled to any weight allowance for that race.
Horses not entitled to the first weight allowance in a race shall not be entitled to any subsequent allowance specified in the conditions.
(4) Claim of weight allowance to which a horse is not entitled shall not disqualify, unless protest is made in writing and lodged with the stewards at least one (1) hour before post time.
(5) No horse shall incur a weight penalty or be barred from any race for having been placed second or lower in any race.
No horse shall be given a weight allowance for failure to finish second or lower in any race.
(6) No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved of extra weight for having been beaten in one (1) or more races, however, this subsection shall not prohibit maiden allowances or allowances to horse that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of a specified value.
(7) Penalties incurred and allowances due in steeplechase or hurdle races shall not apply to races on the flat, and vice versa.
(8) In determining eligibility, allowances and penalties, the reports, records, and statistics as published in the Daily Racing Form and the monthly chart books, or corresponding official publications of any foreign country, shall be considered official, but may be corrected until forty-five (45) minutes prior to post time of the race.
(9) Horses winning races at unrecognized meetings shall not be penalized for such winnings in races run thereafter under the jurisdiction of the commission.
The maiden allowance, however, shall be lost by the winning of a race at any unrecognized meeting.
(10) Excepting in handicaps, fillies two (2) years old shall be allowed three (3) pounds, and fillies and mares three (3) years old and upward shall be allowed five (5) pounds before September 1, and three (3) pounds thereafter in races where competing against horses of the opposite sex.
(11) In all races of one (1) mile or over, other than maiden races, races for nonwinners at a mile or over, stakes races or handicaps, any horse which has never won at a distance of one (1) mile or over, shall be allowed three (3) pounds weight allowance in addition to any other allowances to which it may be entitled in the race; such allowance shall be claimed at time of entry.
(12) The following is the scale of weights for age, and shall be carried when not otherwise specified in the condition of the race:
