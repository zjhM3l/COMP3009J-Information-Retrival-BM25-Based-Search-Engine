THE MINERAL INDUSTRY OF ANGOLA By George J. Coakley The Republic of Angola had a population of more than 12 million in a 1,246,700-square-kilometer (km2) area.
The area includes Cabinda, a coastal strip 100 kilometers (km) wide and 150 km long, located between the Republic of the Congo [Congo (Brazzaville)] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo [Congo (Kinshasa)]
The mineral economy of Angola was dominated by petroleum with diamond being another important source of revenues.
According to the Banco Nacional de Angola (2002aÂ§1, bÂ§), the country had a favorable merchandise trade balance of payments in 2001 of $3.35 billion, which was based on export values of $6.53 billion, of which crude and refined petroleum product exports accounted for $5.80 billion and merchandise imports, $3.18 billion.
By comparison, in 2000, Angola exported $6.95 billion of crude petroleum, $132 million of refined petroleum products, $37 million of natural gas, and $739 million of diamonds.
The drop in export value of crude petroleum was attributed primarily to the lower average price per barrel of oil as Angola exported 256.1 million barrels of oil in 2000 at an average price of $27.10 compared with 250.73 million barrels in 2001 at an average price of $22.69 per barrel.
Events in early 2002 suggested a major turning point in the political and economic future for Angola.
In January 2002, the leader of the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebel movement was killed, and in April 2002, a cease-fire agreement was signed between the Government and UNITA, which apparently brought an end to the nation's long civil war.
During the 27-year conflict, about 1 million people were killed; tens of thousands were maimed, chiefly from land mines; more than 4 million people were displaced; and the country was left with a massive debt.
The country was spending approximately one-third of its annual GDP to service its foreign debt estimated in 2000 to be around $11 billion, which was one of the highest in Africa (African Forum 
Inflation also remained a problem, although inflation decreased to 116% in 2001 from 268% in 2000.
The redevelopment of Angola will be based on development of its rich offshore petroleum endowment and to a lesser extent by reopening access to its land-based diamond resources to new foreign investment.
The highlight of the mineral industry in Angola for 2001 continued to be the success of offshore deepwater petroleum exploration programs.
Protected from the onshore civil war actions, the major consortiums holding oilproduction-sharing agreements with the State-owned Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola (Sonangol), which were led by BPAmoco, ChevronTexaco Corp., ExxonMobil Angola Ltd., and TotalFinaElf, reported 34 significant new deepwater 1 References that include a section twist (Â§) are found in the Internet References section.
oil discoveries, which included 4 during 2001, between 1996 and 2001 (table 2).
Historically, nearly two-thirds of oil production came from ChevronTexaco's block 0, new deepwater discoveries in blocks 14, 15, 17, and 18 however, will significantly expand production.
During 2001, ChevronTexaco's Kuito Field in Block 14 and TotalFinaElf's large Girassol Field in block 17 came onstream, which will add about 285,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of new production.
This successful exploration has increased national reserves to an estimated 12 billion barrels of oil and 270 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Between 2002 and 2007, an estimated $20 billion is scheduled for investment in developing these petroleum resources; Angola has been projected to surpass Libya as the second largest oil producer in Africa after Nigeria.
Petroleum production was expected to increase from 730,000 bbl/d in 2001 to 1.5 million bbl/d by 2005 to 1.7 million bbl/d by 2007 and from 1.9 million to 2.0 million bbl/d by 2010.
Investment plans include construction of a new $2 billion liquified natural gas (LNG) plant in Luanda by 2006; the plant was expected to process 4 million metric tons (5.5 billion cubic meters) per year (Mt/yr) of captured natural gas (Aremu, 2001Â§; Embassy of Angola, Washington, DC, 2002Â§).
Despite the ongoing civil war and United Nations sanctions against illegally mined diamonds, officially reported diamond production in 2001 increased by 19% to 5.17 million carats of diamond.
According to the United Nations Security Council (2001Â§), 69% of diamond under Government control in 2000 came from nine official mines, and 31% was attributed to artisanal miners.
The value of production was reported to be $398.5 million for the official sector and $347.6 million for the unofficial diamond sector.
Diamond smuggling by UNITA and other sources was estimated to have increased to $250 million in 2000.
The United Nations estimated that the total value of diamond mining, which included production from UNITAcontrolled mines, was a minimum of $1.1 billion.
The April 2001 United Nations report also concluded "that the increase in non-UNITA smuggling during 2000 meant that illicit Angolan diamonds are still reaching diamond markets regardless of the certificate of origin system and which makes the tracing of UNITA smuggling more problematic."
The United Nations report explained the operations of the Angola Selling Corp.
(ASCorp), which was a governmental single-channel marketing system designed to regulate diamond buying; the efforts to train and regulate the estimated 100,000 artisanal miners working in Angola; the operations of the Guichet Unico, which was established to investigate applicants for diamond credentials and to issue credentials; and the illicit diamond trading and smuggling operations.
In 2001, Sociedade Miniera de Catoca Ltda.
(SMC) remained the largest producer with output of around 1.5 million carats from its Catoca kimberlite pipe, which is located 35 km south of 3.1

Saurimo.
SMC was a joint venture of Empresa Nacional de Diamantes de Angola (Endiama) (32.8%), Russia's Almazy Rossii-Sakha (32.8%), Brazil's Odebrecht Mining Services Inc. (18.4%), and Israel's Lev Leviev (16%).
Between the beginning of exploration in 1997 and the end of 2001, SMC mined 9.7 million metric tons (Mt) of ore and recovered 7.5 million carats of diamonds.
Diamond sales during this period totaled 7.3 million carats at an average value of $72 per carat.
SMC planned to invest more than $50 million between 2002 and 2005 to increase production capacity to 7 Mt/yr of ore that would yield 4,826,000 carats per year (Sociedade Miniera de Catoca Ltda., 2002aÂ§).
Estimates of reserves in the Catoca kimberlite were reported to be 271 Mt of ore that contains 189.3 million carats of diamond (Sociedade Miniera de Catoca Ltda., 2002bÂ§).
Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Mineiro de Angola, S.A.R.L.
(SDM), which was a joint venture of Ashton Mining Ltd. of Australia, Endiama, and Odebrecht, was formed in 1995 to mine alluvial diamond in the 85,600-km2 Cuango River Valley concession, which is centered near the town of Luzamba in northeastern Angola.
The operations included the TÃ¡zua alluvial mine and a final recovery plant at Luzamba.
Despite ongoing security problems and related intermittent work suspensions during the past 2 years, SDM was able to produce 419,000 carats of high-quality diamonds in 2001.
Bulk sampling of river terrace gravels in the vicinity of the Ganzo, the Ginge, and the TÃ¡zua River diversions have revealed economic diamond grades (Mbendi Information Services, 2002Â§).
DiamondWorks Ltd. of Canada held a majority interest in the Luo and the Yetwene alluvial diamond projects, which have been on care and maintenance since November 1999.
DiamondWorks also held mining rights to five kimberlite pipes, which included the large Camatchia Pipe and the Camagico pipe.
DiamondWorks underwent a financial and management restructuring in 2001 and was positioned to consider reopening its operations during 2002.
By yearend 2001, negotiations on finalizing the terms of the proposed Camafuca kimberlite joint venture and obtaining approval of the mining permit from the Government were ongoing between SouthernEra Resources Ltd. of Canada and its Angolan joint-venture stakeholders.
The joint venture will be incorporated as the Sociedade Mineira do Camafuca, Lda.; ownership will be split among Welox Limited, which was a member of the Leviev Group of Companies (33%), SouthernEra (32%), and Endiama (20%), and Sociedade Mineira do Lucapa Limitada (SML), which was an affiliate of Endiama (15%).
Welox had agreed to provide $20 million of the financing for the first phase of the dredge-mining project.
The Phase I feasibility study on the Camafuca-Camazamba kimberlite facies, which was completed by SouthernEra in 2001, reported total resources at Camafuca to a depth of 145 meters estimated to be 209.5 million cubic meters at an average grade of 0.111 carats per cubic meter and to contain 23.24 million carats of diamond valued at $109 per carat.
The initial 5-year-long Phase I project will remove 6.13 million cubic meters of dredged material that contains an average grade of 0.18 carat per cubic meter, which would yield 220,000 carats per year valued at $117 per carat.
Dredged material will move by a slurry pipeline to a land-based conventional dense-media separation plant.
Estimated capital 3.2
cost of the project was $25 million (SouthernEra Resources Ltd., 2002Â§).
The joint venture between SML (51%) and Sociedade Portuguese de Empreendimentos (49%) operated several alluvial projects in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sud Provinces in 2001 and held exploration rights over a 35,000-km2 area.
Diamond production during 2001 included 244,000 carats from the Mufuto project, 199,000 carats from the Calonda project, and 69,000 carats from the Lucapa project.
Associacao Chitotolo, which was an alluvial diamond company owned by Sociedade Miniera de Lumanhe (50%), ITM Mining Ltd. (35%), and Endiama (15%), produced 232,000 carats of alluvial diamond in 2000 (Mbendi Information Services, 2002Â§).
During 2000, the joint venture between De Beers Angola Prospecting Ltd., which was a wholly owned subsidiary of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and Endiama announced the discovery of 17 new kimberlites in its concession areas in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul Provinces.
Exploration was suspended in May 2001 pending negotiations between De Beers and the Angolan Ministry of Mines and Geology on the terms applicable to mining and marketing of diamond from mines discovered as a result of prospecting by De Beers (De Beers S.A., 2002Â§).
International Defense and Security Forces Resources NV (IDAS) of the Netherlands Antille (a wholly owned subsidiary of American Mineral Fields, Inc., of Canada) held the Cuango International area prospecting license and the Luremo Mining license in the Cuango Valley.
IDAS had only limited access to the UNITA-controlled areas during 2000.
During 2001, the company significantly reduced its operating presence in Angola and concentrated on negotiating the security of its license areas and on a new operating agreement or model final contract with Endiama, which governed the management, ownership, and expenditure commitments for the licences.
In October 2001, IDAS was awarded two new licenses in Lunda Norte and Malange Provinces that covered a 2,690-km2 area along the Cuanga River flood plain up to the border between Angola and Congo (Kinshasa) and an adjoining license to the south that covered 246 km2 situated to the north of Cafunfo (American Mineral Fields, Inc., 2001).
Other companies involved with diamond exploration included Botswana Diamondfields Inc. (a subsidiary of Crew Development of Canada) AmCan Minerals Ltd. of Canada, Randsburg International Gold Corp. of Canada, Trans Atlantic Enterprises Inc. of Canada, Majestic Resources of Australia, and Petra Diamonds Ltd. of South Africa.
