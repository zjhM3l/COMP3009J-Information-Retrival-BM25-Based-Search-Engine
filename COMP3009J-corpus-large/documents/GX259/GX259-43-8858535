LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

e-mail advertising.
Privacy: unsolicited commercial

SB 186
--2--
Existing law prohibits a person or entity conducting business in the state from e-mailing or causing to be e-mailed documents consisting of unsolicited advertising material, as specified, unless that person or entity establishes a toll-free telephone number or valid sender operated return e-mail address that a recipient may contact to notify the sender not to e-mail any further unsolicited documents.
Existing law requires that notification of the toll-free telephone number, and a valid address that a recipient may write to, be included on these unsolicited e-mailed documents, and prohibits the e-mailing of these unsolicited advertising documents to a person who has requested not to receive them.
Existing law requires certain unsolicited e-mail advertisements to contain a heading of ``ADV:'' or ``ADV:ADLT.''
Existing law prohibits the registered user of an e-mail service provider or any individual, corporation, or other entity from using or causing to be used the provider 's equipment located in this state in violation of the provider 's policies with regard to unsolicited e-mail advertisements, as specified.
Existing law authorizes an e-mail service provider whose policy is violated to bring a civil action to recover specified damages.
A violation of the provisions governing advertising is a misdemeanor.
This bill would delete these provisions.
The bill would instead prohibit a person or entity located in California from initiating, sending, or advertising in, unsolicited commercial e-mail advertisements.
The bill would prohibit a person or entity not located in California from initiating, sending, or advertising in, unsolicited commercial e-mail advertisements sent to a California e-mail address.
The bill would also prohibit a person or entity from collecting e-mail addresses or registering multiple e-mail addresses for the purpose of initiating or sending advertising in an unsolicited commercial e-mail advertisement from California or to a California e-mail address.
The bill would prohibit a person or entity from sending using a commercial e-mail advertisement containing certain falsified, misrepresented, obscured, or misleading information.
This bill would authorize the recipient of a commercial e-mail advertisement transmitted in violation of these prohibitions, the electronic mail service provider, or the Attorney General to bring an action to recover actual damages and would authorize these parties to recover liquidated damages of $1,000 per transmitted message up to $1,000,000 per incident, as defined, subject to reduction by a court for specified reasons.
The bill would also provide for an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs to a prevailing plaintiff.
The bill 90

would provide that a cause of action in existence prior to its enactment would be governed by the law in effect at the time it arose.
The bill would enact other related provisions.
Existing law prohibits the registered user of an e-mail service provider, or any individual, corporation, or other entity, from using or causing to be used the provider's equipment located in this state in violation of the provider's policies with regard to unsolicited e-mail advertisements.
Existing law authorizes an e-mail service provider whose policy is violated to bring a civil action to recover specified damages.
This bill would prohibit an e-mail service provider from bringing an action under both this provision and other provisions being added by the bill for the same unsolicited e-mail advertisement.
This bill would provide that if any part of these provisions or their applications is deemed invalid, the invalidity would not affect other provisions.
Because a violation of the bill would be a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Vote: majority.
Appropriation: no.
Fiscal committee: yes.
State-mandated local program: yes.
The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 SECTION 1.
Article 1.8 (commencing with Section 17529) is added to Chapter 1 of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code, to read: Article 1.8.
Restrictions On Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Advertisers
17529.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following: (a) Roughly 40 percent of all e-mail traffic in the United States is comprised of unsolicited commercial e-mail advertisements 90
SB 186 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
--4--
(hereafter spam) and industry experts predict that by the end of 2003 half of all e-mail traffic will be comprised of spam. (b) The increase in spam is not only an annoyance but is also an increasing drain on corporate budgets and possibly a threat to the continued usefulness of the most successful tool of the computer age.
(c) Complaints from irate business and home-computer users regarding spam have skyrocketed, and polls have reported that 74 percent of respondents favor making mass spamming illegal and only 12 percent are opposed, and that 80 percent of respondents consider spam very annoying.
(d) According to Ferris Research Inc., a San Francisco consulting group, spam will cost United States organizations more than ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000) this year, including lost productivity and the additional equipment, software, and manpower needed to combat the problem.
California is 12 percent of the United States population with an emphasis on technology business, and it is therefore estimated that spam costs California organizations well over 1.2 billion dollars ($1,200,000,000). (e) Like junk faxes, spam imposes a cost on users, using up valuable storage space in e-mail inboxes, as well as costly computer band width, and on networks and the computer servers that power them, and discourages people from using e-mail.
(f) Spam filters have not proven effective.
(g) Like traditional paper ``junk'' mail, spam can be annoying and waste time, but it also causes many additional problems because it is easy and inexpensive to create, but difficult and costly to eliminate.
(h) The ``cost shifting'' from senders of deceptive spam deceptive spammers to Internet business and e-mail users has been likened to sending junk mail with postage due or making telemarketing calls to someone's pay-per-minute cellular phone.
(i) Many spammers have become so adept at masking their tracks that they are rarely found, and are so technologically sophisticated that they can adjust their systems to counter special filters and other barriers against spam and can even electronically commandeer unprotected computers, turning them into spam-launching weapons of mass production.
(j) There is a need to regulate the advertisers who use spam, as well as the actual senders of the spam, because the actual senders 90
--5-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
SB 186
spammers, because the actual spammers can be difficult to track down due to some return addresses that show up on the display as ``unknown'' and many others being obvious fakes and they are often located offshore.
(k) The true beneficiaries of spam are the advertisers who benefit from the marketing derived from the advertisements.
(l) In addition, spam is responsible for virus proliferation that can cause tremendous damage both to individual computers and to business systems.
(m) Because of the above problems, it is necessary that spam be prohibited and that commercial advertising e-mails be regulated as set forth in this article.
17529.1.

element of its cause of action that prior to the alleged violation, the defendant had actual notice of both of the following: (i) The electronic mail service provider 's policy on unsolicited electronic mail advertising.
(ii) The fact that the defendant's unsolicited electronic mail advertisements would use or cause to be used the electronic mail service provider 's equipment located in this state.
