FY 2000 Mass Media Regulatory Fees The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in FY 2000.
If you are a licensee or permittee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review this Public Notice.
WHO MUST PAY REGULATORY FEES IN FY 2000 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in FY 2000.
This Public Notice concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM 
Noncommercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations, remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly owned non-commercial educational stations.
Emergency alert system (EAS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees.
Governments and nonprofit entities (exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code) are not required to pay regulatory fees and should not submit payment.
The Commission requires that each exempt entity submit, or have on file with the Commission, a current IRS Determination Letter documenting its nonprofit status, a certification of governmental authority, or certification from a governmental authority attesting to its exempt status.
The regulatory fee to be assessed is based upon the nature of the authorization (e.g. construction permit or license) held as of October 1, 1999.
Responsibility for payment of that fee rests with the current holder of the permit or license at the time payment is due.
A regulatee is responsible for summing all of its services in order to determine if a fee is due.
If the sum of all services owed is less than $10, then the regulatee is exempt from paying the fee.
WHY THE COMMISSION MUST COLLECT REGULATORY FEES The requirement to collect annual regulatory fees is contained in Public Law 103-66, "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993."
These regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, are used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public information, international and policy and rulemaking activities.
These fees are in addition to any application processing fees
1
associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission.
WHEN FEES WILL BE DUE Fee payments must be received by the Commission during the period beginning September 11, 2000, and ending September 20, 2000.
Any payment not received at Mellon Bank by 11:59 p.m., September 20, 2000 will be assessed a 25% late payment fee.
IMPORTANT FY 2000 CHANGES FOR REGULATORY FEE FILERS The Remittance Advice 159 has been revised to accept payer and applicant FCC Registration Numbers (FRN).
We recommend that you begin using the registration number with all payments to the Commission.
The Commission will continue to accept Remittance Advice 159 dated July 1997 without an FRN.
To obtain Â· Â· Â· Â· a revised Remittance Advice 159: A revised Remittance Advice 159 is included in this package Go to http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html.
Call the FCC's Form Distribution Center at 1-800-418-FORM [3676].
Pick up the form at the Commission in Room TWB200
The Commission began accepting Registration Numbers (FRN) after July 19, 2000, on the Remittance Advice 159 to assure proper credit of fee payments.
Currently, the use of the Registration Number is voluntary, however, we strongly recommend that you begin using the registration number with all payments to the Commission.
The Commission may consider making it mandatory in the future.
If you were registered in the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau's Universal Licensing System (ULS) and your registration included all the information we needed to issue a Registration Number, we preregistered you and mailed you your FRN in a letter in late July 2000.
You may check CORES to determine if you were automatically pre-registered.
To obtain a Registration Number: Â· Register at www.fcc.gov and click on the CORES Registration link.
Â· Check your pre-assigned number www.fcc.gov and click on the CORES Registration link.
Â· File FCC Form 160, (CORES Registration) which is included in this package.
You may obtain the form at http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html or by calling the FCC's Form Distribution Center at 1-800-418-FORM [3676].
You may also pick up the form at the Commission in Room TWB200.
Mailing instructions are found on the form.
After July 19, 2000, if you do not register electronically, you may submit your manual application for a Registration Number (FCC Form 160) directly to Mellon Bank with your filing and payment.
Mellon will register you and you will receive a confirmation letter from the FCC through the U.S. Postal Service mail.
Please also note that Regulatory Fee Payment Type Codes have changed for the FY 2000 filing.
These new codes
2
are listed in the back of this notice under the section, Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 and 159C.
To assure proper credit for your regulatory fees, please be sure to use these new codes.
IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR LICENSEES OF CLASS A TELEVISION SERVICE In a recent rulemaking proceeding, (Establishment of a Class A TV Service, 65 FR 29985, MM Docket No. 00-10 (May 10, 2000), a new regulatory fee category named "Class A TV" was established with a corresponding regulatory fee of $290.
Since this action did not become effective until July 10, 2000, new Class A TV stations will not be required to pay this new fee for FY 2000.
However, whether an FY 2000 regulatory fee is due depends upon the status of the station as of October 1, 1999.
Existing Low Power TV (LPTV) stations, whether re-classified as Class A TV or not, should pay the LPTV fee of $280 for FY 2000.
FCC FORM 159 Regulatory fee payments must be accompanied by FCC Form 159 ("FCC Remittance Advice"), dated February 2000.

Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.
Any data omission, erroneous or incomplete data submission, or payment deficiency may result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation of any authorization.
You are strongly urged to submit your payments on time and accurately in order to avoid a penalty.
Additionally, the Commission will invoke any lawful authority it may possess under the Debt Collection Act to collect any fees due or outstanding against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.
WAIVERS, REDUCTIONS AND DEFERMENTS OF REGULATORY FEES The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory costs.
Your regulatory fee must be paid by the due date even if a request is made for a waiver or reduction.
This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied.
The regulatory fee will be refunded later if the request is granted.
Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver or reduction request.
All requests for deferments must be received before September 20, 2000, to avoid the 25% late-payment penalty.
Please submit your written waiver or reduction request to the following address: Office of the Managing Director Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street, S.W., Room 1-A625 Washington, D.C. 20554 attn: Regulatory Fee Waiver/Reduction Request However, submit your regulatory fee payment to the address on page 3 of this Public Notice.
