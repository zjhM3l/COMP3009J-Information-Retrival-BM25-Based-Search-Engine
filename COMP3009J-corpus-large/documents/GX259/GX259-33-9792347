X-XII OST Docket 99-5129 Significant/Priority Rulemakings Explanation of Information on the Agenda Request for Comments Purpose Appendix A - Instructions for Obtaining Copies of Regulatory Documents Appendix B - General Rulemaking Contact Persons Appendix C - Public Rulemaking Dockets Appendix D - Review Plans for Section 610 and Other Requirements Agenda SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Department Regulatory Agenda; Semiannual Summary AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DOT.
ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda.
SUMMARY: The regulatory agenda is a semiannual summary of all current and projected rulemakings, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department.
The agenda provides the public with information about the Department of Transportation's regulatory activity.
It is expected that this information will enable the public to be more aware of and allow it to more effectively participate in the Department's regulatory activity.
The public is also invited to submit comments on any aspect of this agenda.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General You should direct all comments and inquiries on the agenda in general to Neil R. Eisner, Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4723.
Specific You should direct all comments and inquiries on particular items in the agenda to the individual listed for the regulation or the general rulemaking contact person for the operating administration in Appendix B. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call (202) 755-7687.
Table of Contents Supplementary Information: Background Background Improvement of our regulations is a prime goal of the Department of Transportation (Department or DOT).
There should be no more regulations than necessary and those that are issued should be simpler, more comprehensible, and less burdensome.
Regulations should not be issued without appropriate involvement of the public; once issued, they should be periodically reviewed and revised, as needed, to assure that they continue to meet the needs for which they originally were designed.
To help the Department achieve these goals and in accordance with Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), the Department prepares a semiannual regulatory agenda.
It summarizes all current and projected rulemaking, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department.
These are matters on which action has begun or is projected during the succeeding 12 months or such longer period as may be anticipated or for which action has been completed since the last agenda.
The agendas are based on reports submitted by the offices initiating the rulemaking and are reviewed by the Department Regulations Council.
The Department's last agenda was published in the Federal Register on May 13, 2002 (67 FR 33368).
The next one is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register in April 2003.
The Department has created an Internet site that provides general information about its rulemaking responsibilities and activities.
It includes hypertext links to numerous other departmental sites providing helpful information about DOT regulation.
The web address for this site is http://regs.dot.gov.
Significant/Priority Rulemakings The agenda covers all rules and regulations of the Department.
We have classified rules as a DOT agency priority in the agenda if they are, essentially, very costly, controversial, or of substantial public interest under our Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
All DOT agency priority rulemaking documents are subject to review by the Secretary of Transportation.
If the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) decides a rule is subject to its review under Executive Order 12866, we have classified it as significant in the agenda.
Explanation of Information on the Agenda The format for this agenda is required by Office of Management and Budget memorandum of July 15, 2002.
First, the agenda is divided by initiating offices.
Then, the agenda is divided into five categories: (1) prerule stage, (2) proposed rule stage, (3) final rule stage, (4) long-term actions, and (5) completed actions.
For each entry, the agenda provides the following information: (1) its ``significance''; (2) a short descriptive title; (3) its legal basis; (4) the related regulatory citation in the Code of Federal Regulations; (5) any legal deadline and, if so, for what action (e.g., NPRM, final rule); (6) an abstract; (7) a timetable, including the earliest expected date for a decision on whether to take the action; (8) whether the rulemaking will affect small entities and/or levels of government and, if so, which categories; (9) whether a Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) analysis is required (for rules that would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities); (10) a listing of any analyses an office will prepare or has prepared for the action (With minor exceptions, DOT requires an economic analysis for all its rulemakings.); (11) an agency contact office or official who can provide further information; (12) a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) assigned to identify an individual rulemaking in the agenda and facilitate tracing further action on the issue; (13) whether the action is subject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; (14) whether the action is subject to the Energy Act; and (15) whether the action is major under VerDate Nov
If there is information that does not fit in the other categories, it will be included under a separate heading entitled ``Additional Information.''
For nonsignificant regulations issued routinely and frequently as a part of an established body of technical requirements (such as the Federal Aviation Administration's Airspace Rules), to keep those requirements operationally current, we only include the general category of the regulations, the identity of a contact office or official, and an indication of the expected number of regulations; we do not list individual regulations.
In the ``Timetable'' column, we use abbreviations to indicate the particular documents being considered.
ANPRM stands for Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, SNPRM for Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and NPRM for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
Listing a future date in this column does not mean we have made a decision to issue a document; it is the earliest date on which we expect to make a decision on whether to issue it.
In addition, these dates are based on current schedules.
Information received subsequent to the issuance of this agenda could result in a decision not to take regulatory action or in changes to proposed publication dates.
For example, the need for further evaluation could result in a later publication date; evidence of a greater need for the regulation could result in an earlier publication date.
Finally, a dot (Ã¯Â¿Â½) preceding an entry indicates that the entry appears in the agenda for the first time.
Request for Comments General Our agenda is intended primarily for the use of the public.
Since its inception, we have made modifications and refinements that we believe provide the public with more helpful information, as well as make the agenda easier to use.
We would like you, the public, to make suggestions or comments on how the agenda could be further improved.
Reviews We also seek your suggestions on which of our existing regulations you believe need to be reviewed to determine whether they should be revised or revoked.
We particularly draw your attention to the Department's review plan in Appendix D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department is especially interested in obtaining information on requirements that have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities'' and, therefore, must be reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
If you have any suggested regulations, please submit them to us, along with your explanation of why they should be reviewed.
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, comments are specifically invited on regulations that we have targeted for review under section 610 of the Act.
The phrase (Section 610 Review) appears at the end of the title for these reviews.
Please see Appendix D for the Department's section 610 review plans.
Federalism Executive Order 13132 requires us to develop an accountable process to ensure ``meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.''
``Policies that have federalism implications'' are defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, we encourage State and local governments to provide us with information about how the Department's rulemakings impact them.
Purpose The Department is publishing this regulatory agenda in the Federal Register to share with interested members of the public the Department's preliminary expectations regarding its future regulatory actions.
This should enable the public to be more aware of the Department's regulatory activity and should result in more effective public participation.
This publication in the Federal Register does not impose any binding obligation on the Department or any of the offices within the Department with regard to any specific item on the agenda.
Regulatory action, in addition to the items listed, is not precluded.
Issued in Washington, DC, on October 15, 2002.

Appendix D - Review Plans for Section 610 and Other Requirements Part I - The Plan General The Department of Transportation has long recognized the importance of regularly reviewing its existing regulations to determine whether they need to be revised or revoked.
Our 1979 Regulatory Policies and Procedures require such reviews.
We also have responsibilities under E.O. 12866 (``Regulatory Planning and Review'') and section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to conduct such reviews.
This will include the use of plain language techniques in new rules and to consider rewriting existing rules when we have the opportunity and resources permit.
The Department is currently conducting a number of reviews of existing rules and is engaged in rulemaking actions resulting from these reviews.
Section 610 Review Plan Section 610 requires that we conduct reviews of rules that (1) have been published within the last ten years and (2) have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities'' (SEIOSNOSE).
It also requires that we publish in the Federal Register each year a list of any such rules that we will review during the next year.
To better comply with section 610, the Department has updated its regulatory review plan published on June 29, 1981, to accomplish a more systematic review of all of its regulations.
The Office of the Secretary and each of the Department's Operating Administrations (except for FMCSA) have a 10-year review plan.
These reviews are in accordance with section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
Other Review Plans All elements of the Department, except for the FMCSA and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have also elected to use this 10-year plan process to comply with the review requirements of the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, and Executive Order 12866.
FMCSA and FAA are using different approaches, which are described in Part II to this Appendix.
VerDate Nov
For example, to the extent resources permit, the plain language reviews will be conducted more quickly.
Other events, such as accidents, may result in the need to conduct earlier reviews of some rules.
Other factors may also result in the need to make changes; for example, we may make changes in response to public comment on this plan or in response to a Presidentially mandated review.
If there is any change to the review plan, we will note the change in the following Unified Agenda.
For any section 610 review, we will provide the required notice prior to the review.
Part II - The Review Process The Analysis Generally, the agencies have divided their rules into 10 different groups and plan to analyze one group each year.
For purposes of these reviews, a year will coincide with the fall-to-fall schedule for publication of the Agenda.
Thus, Year 1 (1998) began in the fall of 1998 and ends in the fall of 1999; Year 2 (1999) begins in the fall of 1999 and ends in the fall of 2000; and so on.
We request public comment on the timing of the reviews.
For example, is there a reason for scheduling an analysis and review for a particular rule earlier than we have? Any comments concerning the plan or particular analyses can be submitted to the regulatory contacts listed in Appendix B, General Rulemaking Contact Persons.
Section 610 Review The agency will analyze each of the rules in a given year's group to determine whether any rule has a SEIOSNOSE and, thus, requires review in accordance with section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
The level of analysis will, of course, depend on the nature of the rule and its applicability.
Publication of agencies' section 610 analyses list each fall in this Agenda provides the public with notice and an opportunity to comment consistent with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
We request that public comments be submitted to us early in the analysis year concerning the small entity impact of the rules to help us in making our determinations.
In each Fall Agenda, the agency will publish the results of the analyses it has completed during the previous year.
For rules that had a negative finding on SEIOSNOSE, we will give a short explanation (e.g., ``these rules only establish petition processes that have no cost impact'' or ``these rules do not apply to any small entities'').
For parts, subparts or other discrete sections of rules that do have a SEIOSNOSE, we will announce that we will be conducting a formal section 610 review during the following 12 months.
At this stage, we will add an entry to the Agenda in the prerulemaking section describing the review in more detail.
We also will seek public comment on how best to lessen the impact of these rules and provide a name or docket to which public comments can be submitted.
In some cases, the section 610 review may be part of another unrelated review of the rule.
In such a case, we plan to clearly indicate which parts of the review are being conducted under section 610.
Other Reviews The agency will also examine the specified rules to determine whether any other reasons exist for revising or revoking the rule or for rewriting the rule in plain language.
In each Fall Agenda, the agency will also publish information on the results of the examinations completed during the previous year.
FAA The Federal Aviation Administration, in addition to reviewing its rules in accordance with the schedule below, has established a process by which the public is asked for its comments on which rules need review the most.
Any information that the FAA receives in connection with its annual section 610 analyses would, of course, also be reviewed in the spirit of E.O. 12866.
In addition, in response to a recommendation of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, the FAA has completed a review of all its existing regulations to identify those in need of rewriting as performance-based or plain language regulations.
The agency also reviewed ongoing regulatory projects and proposals to identify additional candidates for revision.
In all, the agency reviewed 68 parts of the CFR, containing 3,884 sections, appendices, and Special Federal Aviation Regulations.
In addition to using plain language in its current and future regulations, the FAA intends to revise those regulations identified in its study when it has the opportunity and resources to do so.
FMCSA Because of resources needed to conduct a zero-based review of its regulations, the FMCSA has decided to revisit its method of review.
The FMCSA will identify their new regulatory review process in the Spring 2003 Semiannual Regulatory Agenda.
Part III- List of Pending Section 610 Reviews The Agenda identifies the pending DOT Section 610 Reviews by inserting ``(Section 610 Review)'' after the title for the specific entry.
Also, a Governmentwide list of section 610 reviews can be located in an index at the end of the Agenda.
For further information on the pending reviews, see the Agenda entries.

While the FAA's 10-year plan called for completion of these analyses before the Fall 2002, lack of available resources prevented this.
In addition, the 10-year plan calls for analysis of 14 CFR parts 91-105 in this coming year; resources are not available, however, to analyze these parts.
Should resources become available during the year, the FAA will announce its intention to analyze some or all of these parts in the Federal Register.

Year 5 (Fall 2002) List of rules to be analyzed during the next year 23 CFR part 420 -- Planning and research program administration 23 CFR part 460 -- Public road mileage for apportionment of highway safety funds 23 CFR part 470 -- Highway systems 23 CFR part 476 -- Interstate highway system VerDate Nov
These regulations implement and carry out the provisions of Federal law relating to the administration of Federal aid for highways.
The primary law authorizing Federal aid for highways is chapter 1 of title 23 of the USC.
Section 145 of title 23 expressly provides that chapter 1 provides for a federally assisted State program.
For this reason, the regulations adopted by the FHWA in title 23 of the CFR primarily relate to requirements that States must meet to receive Federal funds for the construction and other work related to highways.
Because the regulations in title 23 primarily relate to States, which are not defined as small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA believes that its regulations in title 23 do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The FHWA solicits public comment on this preliminary conclusion.

The requirements apply to ocean-going vessels and to coastal and inland water transportation.
Most operators of ocean-going vessels are not small entities.
Further, the requirements are consistent with international standards applicable to vessel transportation and, therefore, impose few additional costs of doing business on ocean-going vessels.
Vessels operating in domestic transportation are also permitted to utilize international standards in place of these requirements; domestic vessel operators incur only minimal costs incurred as a result of normal business practices.
Finally, the requirements have little or no impact on entry to or exit from the industry.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Plain language: As resources permit, RSPA will rewrite regulations using plain language techniques.

OEAVIATION DATA REQUIREMENTS REVIEW AND MODERNIZATION PROGRAM Priority: Other Significant Legal Authority: 49 USC 40101; 49 USC 41101; 49 USC 41708; 49 USC 41709; 49 USC 41301; 49 USC 41501; 49 USC 41701 CFR Citation: 14 CFR 241; 14 CFR 250; 14 CFR 298; 14 CFR 374a; 14 CFR 234 Legal Deadline: None Abstract: The Department is undertaking an aviation data requirements review and modernization program.
The review is designed to harmonize the Department's aviation data systems with current regulatory and statutory needs; improve the quality of the Department's aviation data bases; and eliminate obsolete data reporting and processing systems.
The ANPRM was the first step in an outreach program to review aviation data collected by the Department and the measures that should be taken to modernize and improve aviation data reporting and processing systems.
The Department solicited public comments from aviation data users on the nature, scope, source, and means for collecting, processing, and distributing airline traffic, fare, and financial data.
Specifically, the Department invited comments to determine whether existing aviation data should be amended, supplemented, or replaced; whether selected forms and reports should be retained, modified, or eliminated; whether the Department should require all aviation data to be filed electronically; and how the aviation data system should be reengineered to enhance efficiency and to reduce costs for both the Department and airline industry.
The Department has reviewed the comments and reply comments and is in the process of redefining the data elements and restructuring the data reporting requirements to be included in a NPRM.
This action is significant due to substantial public and industry interest.

CFR Citation: 49 CFR 2a, subpart G Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, June 30, 1993.
Abstract: In May 1997, the Department issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to revise its disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) regulation.
The SNPRM included proposals for revising the airport concessions portion of the DBE program.
When the Department, in February 1999, issued a final rule based on the SNPRM, we did not publish a final version of the airport concessions proposal.
This SNPRM seeks comments on an airport concessions subpart to part 26 that takes into account comments on the May 1997 SNPRM, adapts provisions of the rest of part 26 to the concessions context, and proposes options for provisions affecting car rental operations at airports.
These options are based in part on a recent memorandum of understanding between the American Car Rental Association and the Airport Minority Advisory Council making recommendations to the Department on this aspect of the rulemaking.
This SNPRM was inadvertently published under RIN 2105-AB92.

Together, these statutes prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, and age in programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance.
In 1988, the Civil Rights Restoration Act (CRRA) added definitions of ``program or activity'' and ``program'' to Title VI and added a definition of ``program or activity'' to Section 504 and the Age Discrimination Act.
The added definitions were designed to clarify the broad scope of coverage of recipients' programs or activities under these statutes.
The promulgation of this proposed regulation incorporates the CRRA's definition of ``program or activity'' and ``program'' into Title VI, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act regulations.

However, in view of current airline practices with respect to travel by the elderly, and the absence of complaints of discrimination based on age, there no longer appears to be a need for further rulemaking action, and the NPRM has been withdrawn.

Alternatively, the Board proposed to declare it to be an unfair and deceptive practice to divert a passenger without arranging and paying for alternate transportation to the destination airport named on the passenger's ticket.
The Board considered a final rule but did not decide what action to take.
DOT is withdrawing the NPRM as unnecessary since it appears that carriers no longer have the policies that promoted the CAB's concern.

The NPRM proposed to eliminate the disclaimer of liability for fragile and perishable items because that notice is false and misleading.
Because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the proposal was issued, the Department is withdrawing it.

They proposed replacing the four notices with one simplified counter sign.
A CAB NPRM proposed a number of alternatives, such as a long and/or short notice, where the notices would be required to be posted, and whether a smoking notice should be included.
DOT decided not to act on these counter signs separately, but rather to consider whether there should be a comprehensive reexamination of all forms of notice to passengers, including notices on tickets.
This NPRM has been withdrawn.
