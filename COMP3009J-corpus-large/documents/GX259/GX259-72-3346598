Map Literacy A HISTORY OF THE CENSUS Grades 5-6 Skills and Objectives: q Students will compare historical maps. q Students will draw conclusions from maps.
Suggested Groupings: Small groups, individuals q Why might the government
Getting Started: q Hand out copies of the
Chalkboard Definitions census: an official count of all the people living in the country.
historical map: a map that provides information about the past.
reproducible on page 4.
Have students read and compare the 1790 and 1890 census maps with each other, and with the We Count! wall map. q Explain that the first U.S. cen-
need to know about population changes? (Possible answers: to know how many representatives each state gets; to provide the right services to everyone.)
sus, in 1790, yielded a population count of approximately 4 million; but by 1890, that number had grown to approximately 63 million; and by 1990, that number had reached approximately 248 million.
Contributing factors include high levels of immigration, high birth rates, and longer life spans.
q What do you know about the United States in the 1790s? (Possible answers: it had many fewer states; the Revolutionary War had just ended; slavery still existed.)
In the 1890s? (The SpanishAmerican War took place; slavery had been abolished.)
In the 1990s? (The Cold War ended; the U.S. fought the Gulf War; many new technologies, including the Internet, were developed.)
q Explain that while the overall population may have increased between 1790 and 1890, the American Indian population declined.
Have students connect the information on the American Indian Reservation map (on the We Count! wall map) with what they know about the history of American Indians.
For instance, students can research changes among the American Indian population during those years.
What are some of the factors that contributed to these changes?
q Students might enjoy finding out about censuses
in other countries or cultures.
For activities using quipus, knotted strings the Inca (an ancient South American people) used to record censusstyle data, see Multicultural Math: Hands-on Activities from Around the World by Claudia Zaslavsky (Scholastic, 1994).
Using the Activity Worksheet: Distribute copies of the Lesson 1 Activity Worksheet (page 5) to your class and introduce them to the activity.
Inform them that they will need to refer to the 1790 and 1890 census maps (page 4) and the We Count! wall map to complete this activity.
Answers: Page 5: 1.

Students should realize immigration played a large part in the U.S. population increase.
Wrapping Up: q Review students' completed charts and their

A History of the Census
(continued)
Look at the two historical maps on the previous page and the We Count! wall map.
The top map shows information taken from the 1790 Census.
(That's the first year a census was taken.)
The bottom map shows information from the 1890 Census.
The We Count! wall map shows information from the 1990 Census.
By comparing these three maps, you can get some ideas about how the United States changed during these 200 years.
Use the three maps to fill in the chart below.
1790 TOTAL U.S. POPULATION NUMBER OF STATES included in census AREAS INCLUDED IN CENSUS that had not yet become states (use abbreviations)
1890
1990
Now use the maps to answer these questions:
1.
List the states that appear on both the 1790 and 1890 maps.
2.
How many people lived in New York in 1790? In 1890? In 1990?
3.
What might be some causes of the growth in U.S. population between 1790 and 1990?
