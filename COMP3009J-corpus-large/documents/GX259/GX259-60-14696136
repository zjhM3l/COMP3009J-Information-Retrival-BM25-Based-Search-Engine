9.2 Secant Method, False Position Method, and Ridders' Method For functions that are smooth near a root, the methods known respectively as false position (or regula falsi) and secant method generally converge faster than bisection.
In both of these methods the function is assumed to be approximately linear in the local region of interest, and the next improvement in the root is taken as the point where the approximating line crosses the axis.
After each iteration one of the previous boundary points is discarded in favor of the latest estimate of the root.
The only difference between the methods is that secant retains the most recent of the prior estimates (Figure 9.2.1; this requires an arbitrary choice on the first iteration), while false position retains that prior estimate for which the function value has opposite sign from the function value at the current best estimate of the root, so that the two points continue to bracket the root (Figure 9.2.2).
Mathematically, the secant method converges more rapidly near a root of a sufficiently continuous function.
Its order of convergence can be shown to be the "golden ratio" 1.618 ... , so that k

(9.2.1)
The secant method has, however, the disadvantage that the root does not necessarily remain bracketed.
For functions that are not sufficiently continuous, the algorithm can therefore not be guaranteed to converge: Local behavior might send it off towards infinity.

Extrapolation or interpolation lines (dashed) are drawn through the two most recently evaluated points, whether or not they bracket the function.
The points are numbered in the order that they are used.

False position method.
Interpolation lines (dashed) are drawn through the most recent points that bracket the root.
In this example, point 1 thus remains "active" for many steps.
False position converges less rapidly than the secant method, but it is more certain.

Example where both the secant and false position methods will take many iterations to arrive at the true root.
This function would be difficult for many other root-finding methods.
False position, since it sometimes keeps an older rather than newer function evaluation, has a lower order of convergence.
Since the newer function value will sometimes be kept, the method is often superlinear, but estimation of its exact order is not so easy.
Here are sample implementations of these two related methods.
While these methods are standard textbook fare, Ridders' method, described below, or Brent's method, in the next section, are almost always better choices.
Figure 9.2.3 shows the behavior of secant and false-position methods in a difficult situation.

Ridders' Method A powerful variant on false position is due to Ridders [1 ].
When a root is bracketed between x 1 and x2 , Ridders' method first evaluates the function at the midpoint x3 = (x1 + x2 )/2.
It then factors out that unique exponential function which turns the residual function into a straight line.
Specifically, it solves for a factor eQ that gives f (x1 ) - 2f (x3 )eQ + f (x2 )e 2Q

(9.2.2)
This is a quadratic equation in e Q , which can be solved to give eQ = f (x3 )+ sign[f (x2 )] f (x3 )2 - f (x1 )f (x2 ) f (x2 ) (9.2.3)
Now the false position method is applied, not to the values f (x 1 ),f (x3 ),f (x2 ), but to the values f (x1 ),f (x3 )eQ ,f (x2 )e2Q , yielding a new guess for the root, x 4 .
The overall updating formula (incorporating the solution 9.2.3) is x4 = x3 +(x3 - x1 ) sign[f (x1 ) - f (x2 )]f (x3 ) f (x3 )2 - f (x1 )f (x2 ) (9.2.4)
Equation (9.2.4) has some very nice properties.
First, x 4 is guaranteed to lie in the interval (x1 ,x2 ), so the method never jumps out of its brackets.
Second, the convergence of successive applications of equation (9.2.4) is quadratic, that is, m = 2 in equation (9.1.4).
Since each application of (9.2.4) requires two function evaluations, the actual order of the method is 2, not 2; but this is still quite respectably superlinear: the number of significant digits in the answer approximately doubles with each two function evaluations.
Third, taking out the function's "bend" via exponential (that is, ratio) factors, rather than via a polynomial technique (e.g., fitting a parabola), turns out to give an extraordinarily robust algorithm.
In both reliability and speed, Ridders' method is generally competitive with the more highly developed and better established (but more complicated) method of Van Wijngaarden, Dekker, and Brent, which we next discuss.

9.3 Van WijngaardenÂ­DekkerÂ­Brent Method While secant and false position formally converge faster than bisection, one finds in practice pathological functions for which bisection converges more rapidly.
These can be choppy, discontinuous functions, or even smooth functions if the second derivative changes sharply near the root.
Bisection always halves the interval, while secant and false position can sometimes spend many cycles slowly pulling distant bounds closer to a root.
Ridders' method does a much better job, but it too can sometimes be fooled.
Is there a way to combine superlinear convergence with the sureness of bisection?
