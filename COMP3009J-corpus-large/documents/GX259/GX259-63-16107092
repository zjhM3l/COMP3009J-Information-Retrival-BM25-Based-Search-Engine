1 Arizona Wing Civil Air Patrol Operations Training Program Paper Wars Series The CAP FORM 104 Ver 1.0 23 Oct 1997 CBB AZ WING Operation Training Instructor Notes The CAP Form 104 PAPER WARS Arizona Wing Civil Air Patrol Operations Training Program Paper Wars Series The CAP FORM 104 Ver 1.0 23 Oct 1997 CBB Paper Wars is a series of training programs to educate CAP members on CAP forms.
It was developed to help reduce the number of paper work errors.
Paper work errors has cost CAP a significant amount of time and money.
At each closing day of a mission, additional hours are spent on auditing the day's paper work.
Unfortunately, it is very typical of having over 50% of the time spent on correcting information and filling in the missing information.
It is very easy to say, that a mission auditors will spend at less 5 to 7 hours after the day's end on this problem.
And this is just catching the first 70% of the errors for that day.
Now multiply this by the end of the mission.
Who catches the other 30%? Multiply the time by the Air Force Auditors and by the Air Force Finance Community.
An estimated 112 man hours per mission is spent on finding and correcting errors.
The delays are sometimes in the months, and rarely sometime over a year, before reimbursement is given.

The CAPF 104 is one of the most important forms, if not the most important in the Civil Air Patrol arsenal.

As a rule of thumb, always make two or more copies.
One is always with you in the aircraft, while the other is always on the ground.
That means, when flying to the mission base, You should have a front filled copy with you on the aircraft while the other is at your base of operation.
When flying sorties, the mission base must a copy of your 104! If you wish to retain a 104 for your records, make a third copy.
Even if just for practicing, a CAPF 104 should be filled out for every flight.
At the conclusion of each flight, the Accounting portion of the flight should be completed.

Grid 374 A and D, this was your assignment.
An other aircraft was assigned 374 B and C.
The only other worst condition would be, to have another aircraft in the same grid at the same time.
Where corner assignment tend to minimize the risk, adjacent grids tend to maximized the risk of collision.
Just think of it; two planes, same search altitude, and all eyes looking down.
One wanders into the other's airspace.
All that have tried to disproving Newton's law have failed.
You know, the law of what happens when you try to occupy the same space at the same time.

Taking the information from above, Your looking for the Search visibility, Search Altitude, Trackspacing and terrain coverage.
Find the column that best fits the terrain coverage.
In this case it's moderate cover.
In the same colunm, go down until you find the group that best fits your altitude above ground.
In that group, look for the track spacing row.
Now all that is left is to find the search visibility in that group.
Where the two intersects is the search coverage factor.
It this case, it is 30%.
