Truman Doctrine -- On March 12, 1947 President Harry Truman sent a message to Congress requesting money to aid Greece and Turkey.
In this request he also stated that it should be the policy of the United States "to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."
(Read: "communism").
This policy came to be known as the "Truman Doctrine" and provided the basis for the concept of containment.
It was successful in terms of keeping communism out of most western countries and allowing U.S. presidents to become involved in foreign conflicts from Vietnam to Nicaragua.
Marshall Plan -- a.k.a. the European Recovery Program.
The United States made large financial contributions after World War II to help rebuild the devastated economies of Europe.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall proposed the plan in 1947.
One objective of this plan was to contain the growing influence of the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries opposed the plan.
It successfully contributed to the economic recovery of Western Europe.

NATO -- North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
This organization, established in 1949, was an important part of containment policy.
The member nations of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.S., Greece, Spain, Turkey, West Germany (now Germany), and France organized to provide collective self-defense against the threat of aggression by the Soviet Union.
It was largely successful in maintaining a cohesive group of nations opposed to the policies of the Soviet Union and caused a Soviet response in the form of the Warsaw Pact (1955).
Korean War -- A war fought between the UN, supported by the United States, and the Communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) from 1950 to 1953.
After World War II Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into Soviet (N. Korea) and U.S. (S. Korea) zones of occupation.
This was a test of the Truman Doctrine to stop the spread of Soviet influence.
The war dragged on for three years before it became apparent that neither side would win.
A truce was signed in 1953.
Korea remains divided.
It was successful in terms of stopping a North Korean takeover of South Korea, although thousands of lives (54,000 American and perhaps half a million North and South Koreans) were lost.
Vietnam War -- Conflict fought between South Vietnam and North Vietnam between 1954 and 1975.
The United States fought on the South Vietnamese side from 1965-1973 (American advisors and troops entered Vietnam in the late 1950s and early 1960s).
The United States fought against communist North Vietnam's attempts to take over South Vietnam.
The conflict was highly controversial among Americans.
Some wholeheartedly supported the war while others protested in mass demonstrations.
The U.S. withdrew in 1973 and South Vietnam was completely taken over by communist North Vietnam in 1975.
Some argue that this war successfully stopped the spread of communism to other neighboring countries; others consider the Vietnam War a failure and an example of the tragedies of containment policy.
Cuban Missile Crisis -- A cold war confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1962 over the presence of ballistic missiles in Cuba.
After the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion the Soviet Union increased its support of Fidel Castro's Cuban regime.
In 1962 Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev secretly installed ballistic missiles in Cuba.
U.S. reconnaissance flights revealed the sites.
President John F. Kennedy denounced the Soviet and Cuban actions, imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, and announced that any missile launched from Cuba would warrant a full-scale military attack against the Soviet Union.
Khrushchev removed the missiles and war was avoided.
This crisis was one of the most dangerous events of the cold war.

ANNOTATED STUDENT RESPONSE Grade 11 Social Studies
Sample 4-Point Response of Student Work Student Response a) The containment of communism was one of the highest priorities of the United States during the time period from the end of World War II to the fall of the Soviet Union.
All of the items listed were critical in the fight against the spread of communism.
The two that I have chosen are the Marshall Plan and the Korean War.
b) Following the fall of the Third Reich, Europe was a mass of war-torn countries.
Its cities were in ruin, its economies were in shambles and an entire generation of men had been killed, as well as millions of innocent civilians.
The United States realized that this situation was a breeding ground for communist infestation, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had no qualms with telling the West that he would take over Eastern Europe and eventually the rest of it.
The United States responded with the Marshall Plan.
This plan sent billions of U.S. dollars to, in effect, rebuild Europe and thus thwart Stalin's plans.
The planning behind it was that if the countries were in good condition, they wouldn't turn communist.
The Korean War was fought to stop communist aggression in Southeast Asia.
The belief was that if one country fell, many more would follow.
This was called "the Domino Theory," and the United States fought in Korea to keep the communist North from overrunning the South.
Student chooses two of the listed examples of postWorld War II "containment" (i.e., Marshall Plan and Korean War).
Student clearly describes how the Marshall Plan resulted from America's desire to contain communism (e.g., "[Europe's] cities were in ruin, its economies were in shambles...The United States realized that this situation was a breeding ground for communist infestation"; "This plan sent billions of U.S. dollars to, in effect, rebuild Europe and thus thwart Stalin's plans").
Student clearly describes how the Korean War resulted from America's desire to contain communism (e.g., "The belief was that if one country fell, many more would follow"; "the United States fought in Korea to keep the communist North from overrunning the South").

c) America was successful in its goal to contain communism.
In Europe, Stalin was never able to expand into Western Germany, and, in Asia, North Korea and Vietnam were the only countries besides China to turn communist.
Today, the Soviet Union is no more and China is beginning to open its doors a little more to the United States.
Student clearly explains whether America was successful in its efforts to contain communism (e.g., "Stalin was never able to expand into Western Germany, and, in Asia, North Korea and Vietnam were the only countries besides China to turn communist").
Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the United States policy of containment and some of the events, conditions, and issues that were a part of Cold War politics.
The student clearly describes how the Marshall Plan and the Korean War resulted from America's desire to contain communism, and clearly explains whether America was successful in achieving its goal.

Sample 4-Point Response of Student Work Student Response a.
NATO and the Korean War b. NATO, which is an acronym for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is currently a peacekeeping organization.
However, its role just after World War II ended was to prevent the spread of communism around the world.
After WWII, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted from the differences in their governments.
The U.S., having a democratic government, disliked communism, and the U.S.S.R., having a communist government, disliked democracy.
The U.S.S.R. attempted to spread communism around the world, especially to states under its control, like the Eastern European states.
The U.S. wanted to practice her policy of containment then, and NATO was immediately formed to make sure the U.S.S.R. would not succeed in spreading communism to Western Europe, and eventually around the world.
When Korea was one country, not divided as it is today, the U.S.S.R. took control of North Korea, attempting to turn the whole country into a communist state eventually.
However, the U.S., again recognizing the attempt to spread communism, decided to practice its containment policy in Korea.
The U.S. sent troops into South Korea to help S. Korea Student chooses two of the listed examples of postWorld War II "containment" (i.e., NATO and Korean War).
Student clearly describes how NATO resulted from America's desire to contain communism (e.g., "[America's] role just after World War II ended was to prevent the spread of communism around the world"; "NATO was immediately formed to make sure the U.S.S.R. would not succeed in spreading communism to Western Europe").
Student clearly describes how the Korean War resulted from America's desire to contain communism (e.g., "the U.S., again recognizing the attempt to spread communism, decided to practice its containment policy in Korea"; "The U.S. sent troops into South Korea to help S. Korea resist U.S.S.R. troops that wanted to obtain control of the southern part").

resist U.S.S.R. troops that wanted to obtain control of the southern part.
The Korean War started, with N. Korea fighting S. Korea (the Soviets against the U.S.), and this war is an example of a situation that stemmed from America's desire to contain communism.
c. America was successful in the case of NATO, because the Eastern European countries were eventually freed of communism when the U.S.S.R. fell apart, and Russia, the biggest state of the former Soviet Union, turned to democracy under Mikhail Gorbachev.
In Korea, the U.S. was partially successful, because Korea was divided into N. Korea, currently communist, and S. Korea, doing well under democratic government.
Student clearly explains whether America was successful in its efforts to contain communism (e.g., "America was successful in the case of NATO, because the Eastern European countries were eventually freed of communism when the U.S.S.R. fell apart"; "In Korea, the U.S. was partially successful, because Korea was divided into N. Korea, currently communist, and S. Korea, doing well under democratic government").

ANNOTATED STUDENT RESPONSE Grade 11 Social Studies
Sample 3-Point Response of Student Work Student Response A) Vietnam War Cuban Missile Crisis B) The Vietnam War obviously resulted from America's intention of containing communism.
This happened because we knew that North Vietnam was communist, and we, for some reason, tried to prevent their political philosophy from spreading south to South Vietnam.
We later figured out that the South Vietnamese, for the most part, didn't even want to there.
C) This war did nothing but kill our men and hurt our integrity.
B) The Cuban Missile Crisis was also a result of our containment philosophy.
We had been trying to run communism out of Cuba for years, so they automatically hated us for it.
Because of this contempt, Cuba allowed Russia to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, and aim them at us.
Obviously this was a very bad situation.
C) In a manner of speaking, we were successful in that we narrowly avoided ending the world as we know it by means of nuclear warfare.
In my opinion, this was a very unrespectable period for the U.S. Student chooses two of the listed examples of postWorld War II "containment" (i.e., Vietnam War and Cuban Missile Crisis).
