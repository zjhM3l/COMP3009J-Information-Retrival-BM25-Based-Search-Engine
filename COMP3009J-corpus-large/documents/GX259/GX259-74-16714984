In order for you to succeed in school, at work, and in the community, you will need more skills and knowledge than ever before.
Getting in shape academically is the single most important thing you can do to prepare for a successful future.
This booklet of Academic Standards clearly spells out what you should know and be able to do in United States History.
Examples are given to help you understand what is required to meet the Standards.
Please review this guide with your teachers and share it with your parents and family.
Whether you go on to be a surgeon, computer technician, teacher, or airplane mechanic, learning never stops.
There will always be a more demanding computer application, a new invention, or a more complex project awaiting you.
To be ready for tomorrow -- get in top academic shape today.
Use this guide year round to check your progress.
Dear Parent, Education is the building block of every student's future.
To ensure all students have every opportunity to succeed, Indiana adopted world-class Academic Standards in English/language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies and put an assessment system in place to measure student progress toward the Standards.
These Standards clearly outline what students should know and be able to do in each subject, at each grade level.
Teachers are dedicated to helping all students meet these expectations.
How can you help your student meet these challenges? Learning does not take place only in the classroom.
Students spend far more time at home than they do in school.
How they spend their time can make a real difference.
Nothing will have a bigger impact on your student's success than your involvement in his or her education.
On the next page is a list of 10 things you can do to help ensure your student has the best education possible.
We hope you use this guide as a tool to help your child succeed today and in the future.
Sincerely,
Governor Frank O'Bannon
Dr. Suellen Reed, Superintendent of Public Instruction

10 things parents can do to help students succeed 1.
Build relationships with your child's teachers.
Find out what each teacher expects of your teenager and how you can help him or her prepare to meet those expectations.
2.
Read.
Reading is the foundation for all learning.
Expose your teen to a wide variety of reading materials (newspapers, magazines, books, Internet Web sites) and be ready to discuss what he or she has learned.
Helping your child develop strong reading habits and skills is one of the most important contributions you can make to your child's education.
3.
Practice writing at home.
Letters, journal entries, e-mail messages, and grocery lists are all writing opportunities.
Show that writing is an effective form of communication and that you write for a variety of purposes.
4. Make math part of everyday life.
Cooking, gardening, paying bills, balancing a checkbook, and even shopping are all good ways to help your child understand and use mathematics skills.
Show that there may be many ways to get to the right answer and encourage your child to explain his or her method.
5.
Ask your child to explain his or her thinking.
Ask lots of "why" questions.
Teenagers should be able to explain their reasoning, how they came up with the right answer, and why they chose one answer over another.
6.
Expect that homework will be done.
Keep track of your teen's homework assignments and regularly look at his or her completed work.
Some teachers now give parents a number to call for a recorded message of that day's homework assignments; others put the information on the Internet.
If your school doesn't offer these features, talk to the teacher about how you can get this important information.
Even if there aren't specific assignments, find out how you can stay informed about what your child is working on so that you can help at home.
7. Use the community as a classroom.
Feed your child's curiosity about the world 365 days a year.
Take your child to museums, local government buildings, state parks, and workplaces.
Encourage your young adult to volunteer in a field or area of interest in order to show how learning connects to the real world.
These activities will reinforce what is learned in the classroom and may help your teen decide what to do with his or her future.
8.
Encourage group study.
Open your home to your child's friends for informal study sessions.
Promote outside formal study groups through church or school organizations or other groups.
Study groups will be especially important as your child becomes older and more independent.
The study habits your teen learns now will carry over into college and beyond.
9.
Help other parents understand academic expectations.
Use your school and employee newsletters, athletic associations, booster clubs, a PTA or PTO meeting, or just a casual conversation to help other parents understand what academic standards mean for them, their children, and their school and how they can help their children learn at home.
10.
Spend time at school.
The best way to know what goes on in your child's school is to spend time there.
If you're a working parent, this isn't easy, and you may not be able to do it very often.
But "once in awhile" is better than "never."
Remember: You are the most important influence on your child.
Indiana's Academic Standards give you an important tool to ensure that your child gets the best education possible.

Measuring Student Learning Children develop at different rates.
Some take longer and need more help to learn certain skills.
Assessments, like ISTEP+, help teachers understand how students are progressing and assist in identifying academic areas where students may need additional attention.
Assessments also provide a measure of school accountability Â­ assisting schools in their efforts to align curriculum and instruction with the state's Academic Standards and reporting progress to parents and the public.
Students in designated grades take ISTEP+ in the fall of each school year Â­ with the assessment based on what the child should have learned and retained from the previous year.
Core 40 End-of-Course Assessments are given at the end of specific high school classes and are a cumulative assessment of what students should have learned during that course.
End-of-Course Assessments also provide a means to ensure the quality and rigor of high school courses across the state.
Voluntary for schools at this time, a selection of these assessments will be phased in over the next few years.

What's the Goal? By Grade 12, can students read well enough to pass a driver's exam, understand an appliance manual, or compare two opposing newspaper editorials? Could students write an effective job application letter? By testing skills like these in Grade 10, teachers know whether Â­ and in which skill area Â­ students need more attention before it's time to graduate.
