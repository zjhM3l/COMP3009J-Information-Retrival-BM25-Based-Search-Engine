This appropriation finances research activities and studies concerned with planning, analysis, and information development needed to support the Secretary's responsibilities in the formulation of national transportation policies.
The program is carried out primarily through contracts with other Federal agencies, educational institutions, non-profit research organizations, and private firms.
Activities support the development of transportation policy, coordination of national level transportation planning, and such issues as regulatory modernization, energy conservation, and environmental and safety impacts of transportation.
These also support departmental leadership on aviation economic policy and international transportation issues.
This account also includes $5 million for the development of a government-wide, online rulemaking docket management system.

The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 (P.L. 104Â­264) authorized the collection of user fees for services provided by the FAA to aircraft that neither take off nor land in the United States, commonly known as overflight fees.
The Act permanently appropriated the first $50 million of such fees for the Essential Air Service program and rural airport improvements.
To the extent that fee collections fall below $50 million, current law requires the difference to be covered by Federal Aviation Administration funds.
The 2003 budget assumes the collection of $30 million in overflight fees, with the balance of $83 million to be paid from the FAA Airport improvement program (AIP).
The budget proposes to increase the authorized funding level to $113 million for 2003, of which $63 million would be provided from AIP to cover anticipated shortfalls above the $50 million minimum funding level.
The budget proposes general provision language that will enable the Department to manage taxpayer resources dedicated to this purpose more effectively.

Through 1997, this program was funded from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.
Starting in 1998 the FAA reauthorization funded it as a mandatory program supported by overflight fees under the Essential Air Service and Rural Airport Improvement Fund.
In 2002, in addition to mandatory funding supported by overflight fees, direct appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to the Payments to Air Carriers program were enacted to meet the needs of the essential air service program.
No direct appropriations for this account are being requested in 2003.

As part of the Administration's initiative to reflect full accrual of retirement costs, legislation is proposed to establish a new retirement fund to be known as the ``Coast Guard Military Retirement Fund.''
Budget year data is reported in that new account for payments to retirees.
The request for this account includes funding for the unfunded liabilities associated with current retirees.
Object Classification (in millions of dollars) Identification code 69Â­0241Â­0Â­1Â­403 2001 actual 2002 est. 2003 est.
The Administration proposed legislation in October 2001 to accrue fully the retirement costs of Coast Guard military personnel.
This general fund account would make mandatory payments to fund the unfunded liability accruing prior to this change (amortized over 40 years).
The benefit payments to retirees will be made through the new Coast Guard military retirement fund.

The Administration proposed legislation in October 2001 to accrue fully the retirement costs of Coast Guard military personnel (as well as the Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps).
The account will make payments to current retirees, receive the accrual payments from Coast Guard accounts for current active duty members, and receive a payment for unfunded liabilities of Coast Guard personnel.
This program provides for retired pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve, members of the former Lighthouse Service, and for annuities payable to beneficiaries of retired military personnel under the retired serviceman's family protection plan (10 U.S.C. 1431Â­46) and survivor benefits plans (10 U.S.C. 1447Â­55); payments for career status bonuses under the National Defense Authorization Act; and for payments for medical care of retired personnel and their dependents under the Dependents Medical Care Act (10 U.S.C., ch. 55).

The Oil spill liability trust fund is used to finance oil pollution prevention and cleanup activities by various Federal agencies.
In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Fund may finance annually up to $50 million of emergency resources and all valid claims from injured parties resulting from oil spills.
For Coast Guard, this funds the following accounts: Trust fund share of expenses, Oil spill recovery, and Payment of claims.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101Â­239, triggered collection of a 5 cent tax on each barrel of oil produced domestically or imported to be deposited into the Oil spill liability trust fund.
The authority to collect the oil barrel tax expired on December 31, 1994.

The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 (P.L. 104Â­264) authorized the collection of user fees for services provided by the FAA to aircraft that neither takeoff nor land in the United States, commonly known as overflight fees.
In addition, the Act permanently appropriated the first $50 million of such fees, or other FAA resources in the event collections are lower than $50 million, to be used for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program and rural airport improvements.
Amounts collected in excess of $50 million are permanently appropriated for authorized expenses of the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:21 Jan 23, 2002 Jkt 189685 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 3616
The fund provides direct support for the aviation insurance program (chapter 443 of title 49, U.S. Code).
Income to the fund is derived from premium collections for premium insurance coverage issued, income from authorized investments, and binder fees for nonpremium coverage issued.
The binders provide aviation insurance coverage for U.S. air carrier aircraft used in connection with certain Government contract operations by the Department of Defense and the Department of State.
The Air Transportation System Safety and Stabilization Act (P.L. 107Â­42) expanded the aviation insurance program to all U.S. air carriers for world-wide operations.

FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEAÂ­ 21) reauthorized surface transportation programs through 2003.
TEAÂ­21 provides for increased transportation infrastructure investment, strengthens transportation safety programs and environmental programs, and continues core research activities.
TEAÂ­21, along with title 23, U.S.C.
(``Highways'') and other supporting legislation, provides authority for the various programs of the Federal Highway Administration designed to improve highways throughout the Nation.
In 2002, the Federal Highway Administration continues major programs, including the Surface Transportation Program, the National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation, and the National Corridor Planning and Border Infrastructure Programs.
In summary, the 2003 budget consists of $31,111 million in new budget authority and $28,496 million in outlays.
The following table reflects program levels (obligations).
Because project selection is determined by the States, the 2002 and 2003 program levels are estimates.

The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 authorized the establishment of a right-of-way revolving fund.
This fund was used to make cash advances to States for the purpose of purchasing right-of-way parcels in advance of highway construction and thereby preventing the inflation of land prices from significantly increasing construction costs.
This program was terminated by TEAÂ­21 but will continue to be shown for reporting purposes as loan balances remain outstanding.
The purchase of right-of-way is an eligible expense of the Federal-aid program and therefore a separate program is unnecessary.
No further obligations are proposed in 2003.

The Highway Revenue Act of 1956, as amended, provides for the transfer from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund of revenue from the motor fuel tax and certain other taxes paid by highway users.
The Secretary of the Treasury estimates the amounts to be transferred.
In turn, appropriations are authorized from this fund to meet expenditures for Federal-aid highways and other programs as specified by law.
This table shows the status of the resources of the Highway Trust Fund relative to the obligational authority that has been made available for programs financed by the trust fund.
The encumbered balance indicates the degree to which the outstanding obligational authority exceeds the estimated cash balances of the fund each year.
Under the laws governing the Highway Trust Fund, the amount of obligational authority available at any time cannot exceed the actual cash balances plus the amount of receipts estimated to be collected during the following two years; for most other trust funds obligational authority is limited to the actual receipts of the fund.
The status of the fund is as follows: Status of Funds (in millions of dollars) Identification code 20Â­8102Â­0Â­7Â­401 2001 actual 2002 est. 2003 est.
Note.--The invested balances shown above include both appropriated and unavailable balances.
