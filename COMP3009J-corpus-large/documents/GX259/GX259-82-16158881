T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF O REGON In 1996, Oregon moved up one place in rank from 38th to 37th among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value,1 according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The estimated value for 1996 was about $251 million, an almost 5% increase compared with that of 1995.
This followed a 1.5% decrease from 1994 to 1995 (based on final 1995 data).
The State accounted for a little less than 1% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
Industrial minerals accounted for all of Oregon's raw nonfuel mineral production value.
Crushed stone and construction sand and gravel, by value, are Oregon's two leading nonfuel mineral commodities, accounting for nearly 77% of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value.
The combined value increases of these two commodities represented nearly all of Oregon's total net increase in nonfuel mineral production in 1996.
Compared with 1995, other nonfuel mineral values that increased in 1996 were those of portland cement, diatomite, pumice and pumicite, and bentonite clays.
Decreases occurred in lime (down slightly), gemstones, common clays, emery, and nickel ore.
Based on USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States during 1996, Oregon remained first in the production of pumice and pumicite, and it continued as the Nation's only State to produce emery.
Oregon dropped in rank from third to fourth in diatomite and from fourth to fifth in gemstones (by value).
Additionally, significant quantities of crushed stone and construction sand and gravel were produced in the State.
Glenbrook's Nickel Mountain Mine, was on a care and maintenance basis in 1996.
The Glenbrook Nickel Co. is a joint venture of Cominco American Inc. and Cominco Resources International Ltd.
Nickel Mountain has been the sole domestic producer of primary nickel in the United States in recent years, operating on an intermittent basis--mine production depending on the price of nickel.
The mine did not produce in 1996 owing to a decrease in nickel prices.
According to the company, the mine was shut down in the latter half of 1993 because of market disruptions and low nickel prices caused, in part, by a surge in nickel exports from Russia.
With better prices during 1995, mining resumed but ceased again by the end of the year.
In 1996, the company's Riddle nickel smelter used only lateritic ore imported from New Caledonia to produce ferronickel containing 48% to 52% nickel.
The ore was supplied by SociÃ¯Â¿Â½tÃ¯Â¿Â½ MiniÃ¯Â¿Â½re du Sud Pacifique and has a higher nickel content than the ore from Nickel Mountain.
In 1995, Glenbrook restarted its ferrosilicon furnace.
The ferrosilicon is used to make the ferronickel and had been brought on the open market until domestic ferrosilicon prices strengthened.
Production of other metals, especially primary aluminum and raw steel, resulted from the processing of materials acquired from other domestic and foreign sources.
Oregon remained 13th in the Nation in the production of primary aluminum.
---------- The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1996 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are estimates as of February 1997.
For some commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.
