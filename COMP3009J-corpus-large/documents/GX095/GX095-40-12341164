[Copy%20of%20newsheeptitlebanner.jpg] Mount Wrangell Geology of the Wrangell Volcanoes
The Wrangell Mountains, which form much of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, are made up largely of thousands of lava flows that have been erupted mostly from large broad volcanoes during the past 26 million years.
This extensive volcanic terrain, which is called the Wrangell volcanic field, covers about 4,000 mile square (10,400 km2)-an area a little smaller than the State of Connecticut-and extends eastward from the Copper River Basin through the Wrangell Mountains, into the St. Elias Mountains of Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada.
Wrangell Volcanoes The principal basement rocks on which the Wrangell volcanoes erupted their great outpourings of lava are much older rocks and have had a complex geologic history.
These rocks belong to what is referred to in the geologic literature as the Wrangellia terrane, which is part of an even larger group of exotic terranes-the Wrangellia composite terrane-that have been accreted to Alaska and the North American Continent during the past few hundred million years.
On the basis of geophysical and fossil evidence, rocks of the Wrangellia terrane were formed in a tropical environment thousands of miles south of its present position.
The Wrangellia terrane began as a volcanic arc about 300 million years ago, probably along the margin of an ancient North American Continent.
As arc-related volcanic activity waned, a rift developed between the arc and continent, allowing the eruption of thousands of cubic miles of basalt lava flows that flooded and filled the rift-formed basin.
Subsequently, shallow warm seas inundated the land, depositing layers of marine limestone and other sediment on the volcanic rocks.
During the next 200 million years, the Wrangellia terrane was gradually transported northward, where it was welded to other terranes and eventually docked against western North America about 100 million years ago.
It now forms a belt extending from southern Alaska to southern British Columbia.
Subsequently, other terranes, such as those composing the Southern Margin composite terrane, have been carried northward and accreted to continental Alaska.
The last terrane to arrive-the Yakutat terrane-docked about 26 million years ago, concurrent with and partly responsible for the development of the Wrangell volcanic field.
Inception:
The basement rocks upon which the Wrangell volcanoes are built were not formed where they are found today, but were transported a great distance from their place of geologic origin.
These rocks, known as the Wrangellia composite terrane, were formed at a considerably lower, warmer latitude (17Ã¯Â¿Â½) thousands of miles south of its present position and about 300 million years ago.
Essentially, the mountain ranges of interior Alaska are the result of the collision and accretion of smaller, moving tectonic plates with the North American continent.
The forces capable of moving terranes and even continents are the result of the motion and interaction of the many semi rigid plates that compose the Earth's crust.
The speeds at which these crustal plates move across the surface of the Earth range from less than 1 to as much as 5 inches per year.
Seemingly slow, these rates, over the course of millions of years, however, can move crustal plates hundreds, even thousands, of miles.
The driving force to this movement is magma welling up along rift zones.
Most of these rift zones occur in the Earth's mid-ocean areas, where they mark the boundaries between oceanic crustal plates.
As new magma is erupted along an oceanic rift, it forces older crust outward.
At the same time as new crust if being formed at the rift zone, old crust may be consumed through subduction, where one plate (usually the heavier ocean plate) plunges under a continental plate, in a process called subduction.
At depth, the subducted plate melts again.
Rising magma streams up from the slab and may eventually be erupted at the surface as a lava flow, dome, or as volcanic ash in a volcano.

If two crustal plates are traveling in different but parallel directions and at different speeds, they slip past each other in a strike-slip fault line.
These boundaries are the site of the world's largest earthquakes, such as along the San Andreas Fault.
In Alaska, the Denali-Totschunda fault system, north of the Wrangell Mountains, and the Fairweather fault, south of the Wrangell Mountains, are strike-slip faults that presently form a principal boundary between the Pacific and North American crustal plates.
Type:
Wrangell mountains are shield volcanoes The first Wrangell volcanoes formed about 26 million years ago, when the northwestern-moving Pacific Plate with its piggyback load of the Yakutat terrane, began to be subducted beneath the North American Plate.
Strong subduction and high volumes of magma production, which have continued until relatively recently, have been responsible for the growth of the volcanoes and the development of the Wrangell volcanic field.
Since about 200,000 years ago, strike slip movement along the Fairweather and Denali-Totschunda faults has relieved much of the stress from the northwestward motion of the Pacific plate.
The amount of subduction and the production of magma under the Wrangell volcanoes has decreased.
Although some eruptive activity will undoubtedly continue into the future, large outpourings of lava, like those that built Mount Wrangell and Mount Sanford, seem unlikely.
The volcanoes of the Western Wrangell mountains are unlike other volcanoes located around the Pacific rim.
Rather than erupting explosive lavas forming steep-sided cones, they have been built by the accumulation of hundreds of relatively fluid lava flows to form broad mountains with gentle slopes, typical of shield volcanoes.
Now only youthful Mount Wrangell still displays a shield-like form; the other, generally older volcanoes have had much of their superstructure removed by glacial and other erosional processes.
In addition to the large shield volcanoes, many smaller cinder cones are scattered throughout the Wrangell volcanic field.
More than 12 volcanic centers are known and mapped.
Mts.
Drum and Churchill have had explosive phases during their geologic changes.
Age:
All the volcanoes of the western Wrangell Mts. are less than 5 million years old with the youngest lava flows are possibly as recent as 50,000 years ago.
Their ages record a progression in volcanic activity from Mount Blackburn in the southeast to Mount Drum in the northwest.
Mount Wrangell, has fumaroles on its summit and is considered an active volcano.

Most Recent Eruptions:
Eruptive activity has been noted in Mt. Wrangell in 1784, 1884-5, and 1900.
On clear, cold, and calm days, steam plumes are often visible.
Large volumes of ash were deposited 1250 and 1890 years ago from the eruption of Mt. Churchill (the White River Ash).
size comparison of world volcanoes Comparison with other mountains:
The Wrangell volcanoes are among the highest mountains in North America and some of the largest (by volume) in the world.
They range in elevation from only a few thousand feet above sea level (Mount Boomerang, 3,949 ft.) to a maximum of 16,390 feet (Mount Blackburn).
Many have impressive summits, higher than 10,000 feet, while others have had large parts of their structures worn down by erosion.
In comparison to most stratovolcanoes associated with convergent plate margins, such as along the Pacific "rim of fire", the Wrangell shield volcanoes are much more voluminous.
Compare that to about 8 cubic miles for Mt. St. Helens and 47 cubic miles for Mt. Rainier, or even Mt. Fujiyama with 184 cubic miles.
Individual Volcano Facts: MOUNT WRANGELL Wrangell, the youngest of the volcanoes, is a large, broad, ice covered shield of tremendous bulk.
Although it has not emitted lava in historic times, it is still considered active.
The ice filled summit caldera is 3.5 miles long by 2.5 miles wide and contains active fumaroles (steam vents).
On calm days a steam plume can sometimes be seen rising from the summit.
Mount Wrangell from Willow Lake
Height: 14,163 feet
Last Eruption: Since the late 1700's there have been at least three reports of violent eruptions, including the sightings of active lava flows on the mountain.
Glaciers: Perennial ice and snow cover more than 90% of the mountain.
This giant is the source of many glaciers that feed into the Copper and Yukon River drainages.
Nabesna Glacier, the largest and longest of these, begins on the southeast slope and flows more than 50 miles to where it forms the source of the Nabesna River, a major tributary of the Tanana River.
Best Viewing: Mount Wrangell is readily visible along the Richardson Hwy from Tonsina to Glennallen, and along the Edgerton Hwy. to Chitina.
Two excellent viewpoints are at Willow Lake along the Richardson Hwy. and at mile 20 along the Tok Cutoff of the Glenn Highway.
MOUNT DRUM
Drum is the westernmost Wrangell volcano.
Though more than 4,000 feet lower than nearby Mount Sanford, this volcano dominates the view as it rises above the Copper River lowlands.
Mount Drum from the Tok Cutoff
Height: 12,010 feet
Last Eruption: Violently explosive activity destroyed the top and much of the south face between 150 and 250 thousand years ago.
Massive mudflows from Drum and Wrangell surged through the Copper River Basin for over 50 miles.
Many of these thick deposits can be seen today in roadcuts and river banks.
Glaciers: At least 11 glaciers extend outward from the icefield on top of this mountain.
The largest is the 9-mile long Nadina Glacier.
Best Viewing: This is the first volcano to come into view when driving east from Anchorage toward Glennallen on the Glenn Highway.
Excellent viewpoints are at mile 1 on the Tok Cutoff of the Glenn Hwy. and at Willow Lake on the Richardson Highway.
MOUNT SANFORD
Sanford is the highest in the western Wrangell Mountains.
Imposing height may make it the first seen when driving from Tok to Anchorage and the Alaska Highway.
The south face rises 8,000 feet in 1 mile...one of the steepest gradients in North America!
Mount Sanford from Gulkana Airport
Height: 16,237 feet
Last Eruption: Some of the mountain's bulk may be the result of bulging and doming from underground magma activity as recently as 100,000 years ago.
Most of the lava flows have been dated to about 320,000 years old.
Glaciers: Above 8,000 feet, most of the mountain is year-round ice and snow.
The Sanford Glacier carries a tremendous load of debris from almost constant rockfall and avalanching off the 8,000 foot face.
Best Viewing: Driving south from Tok, Sanford is first visible at about mile 70, and remains in view to Gakona and Glennallen.
One of the best views is from the Gulkana Airport near Glennallen.
