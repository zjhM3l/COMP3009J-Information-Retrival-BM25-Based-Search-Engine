Holt Man Wins Michigan Lottery's $250,000 Keno Prize! _________________________________________________________________
Lansing, December 31, 1997 - A Holt man thought he was dreaming, but it was no dream - he won the top prize in the Michigan Lottery's Keno game! After matching 10 of the Keno numbers drawn Monday, Nov. 24 - 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78 and 79 
"I didn't believe it," he said.
"I taped the drawing and played it over and over.
I had to pinch myself because I thought it might be a dream!" The winner, who requested anonymity, picked his own Keno numbers.
The winning ticket was purchased at 7-Eleven 028E, 1997 Aurelius Road, in Holt.
A regular Michigan Lottery player for 25 years, the winner is a State of Michigan employee.
He is the director of a ScrabbleÃ¯Â¿Â½ club which competes in tournament play.
The winner said he plans to use his Keno winnings to pay bills, upgrade his computer, make home repairs and invest for his retirement.
The Keno game is designed to appeal to players wanting better odds of winning a prize.
To play Keno, a player selects 10 numbers between 1 and 80.
The Lottery draws 22 numbers from the field of 1 to 80.
Players win prizes if they match six, seven, eight, nine or all ten of their numbers to the 22 drawn by the Lottery, or even if they match no numbers at all.
A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000; nine numbers wins $2,500; eight wins $250; seven wins $25; six wins $7; and matching zero numbers wins a free $1 instant game ticket.
Keno drawings are held every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 7:29 p.m.
