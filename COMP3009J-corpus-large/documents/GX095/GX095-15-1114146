WASHINGTON Ã¯Â¿Â½
U.S. Representative John W. Olver (D-1st District) announced today that the US Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, has approved a new official Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) action plan to deal with the escalating concerns of the Big Dig.
Among the most important items is the Department of Transportations commitment to protecting statewide funding for the local bridge and road program.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I am thrilled that the Secretary took seriously the concerns about the state-wide programs suffering at the expense of the Big Dig,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Olver said.
The Secretary announced that the FHWA action plan will accept all of the Inspector Generals recommendations and meet all due dates specified in the report.
He also committed to withhold further advance construction for the project until the Department has received, evaluated and approved a new finance plan from the state that includes the higher costs and revenue sources for completing the project.
There will be a task force established to conduct a complete review of the projects oversight process, as well as a review of the organizational structure to determine whether changes in the projects management are necessary.
And finally, Secretary Slater announced that the Department will use its project approval authority to ensure that Massachusetts meets its agreed-upon split of federal funds for the Big Dig and the state-wide bridge and road program.
This involves upholding the current 71 percent Big Dig, 29 percent state-wide program split until 2002, and a 50/50 Big Dig, state-wide road and bridge program split thereafter.
"The Department's decision to withhold Big Dig reimbursement costs from the state until the state submits for reimbursements from the FHWA for the state-wide program ensures that projects that have been put out to bid but have never been started, will finally go to construction,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Olver explained.
Olver cautioned that the State would still have to work very hard to come up with an acceptable plan to deal with the project's cost overruns.
Because of the reimbursable nature of the Federal-aid Highway program, the federal governments decision to withhold Big Dig reimbursements from the state until Massachusetts spends money on the state-wide program would significantly slow down the Central Artery project unless additional funding sources are found to keep the project on track.
The federal government has spent $5.7 billion to date on the Big Dig project, and has committed to a grand total of $8.5 billion based on a project completion date of 2004
