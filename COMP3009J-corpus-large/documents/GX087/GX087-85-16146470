TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ BIOLOGY AND SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF PARASITOIDS OF THE BANDED SUNFLOWER MOTH (LEPIDOPTERA: TORTRICIDAE) IN SUNFLOWER (TITLE CHANGE) Author(s): CHARLET LAURENCE D Interpretive Summary:
A number of insect herbivores that coevolved with native sunflower species have successfully exploited cultivated sunflower.
Among the species attacking the sunflower head, the banded sunflower moth has caused economic loss to producers.
Integrated pest management, including the use of biological control, is needed to reduce insect infestations below economic levels without the reliance on pesticides.
The purpose of this study was to examine both cultivated and native sunflowers in the major production region of North and South Dakota and Minnesota to determine the species of parasites attacking the banded sunflower moth, investigate the seasonal occurrence, development, and overwintering of the major parasites recovered, evaluate their impact on banded sunflower moth larvae, and determine the effect of altered planting dates on parasitism.
A number of species of banded sunflower moth parasites have moved from native sunflowers and attack the moth in commercial sunflower fields.
Two different parasite species attacking banded sunflower moth larvae in cultivated sunflower appear to have adapted well, overwintering in the host in the soil and searching successfully for larvae even at low pest densities.
Parasites effectively attacked the banded sunflower moth in sunflower planted at three different dates.
Conservation of these parasites in the sunflower agroecosystem is therefore needed, because they play an important role in the control of the banded sunflower moth.
The ability of these natural enemies to fit into management strategies, like the altering of planting date, emphasizes that successful integration of IPM practices to include biological control is feasible.
