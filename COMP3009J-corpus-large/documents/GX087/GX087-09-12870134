HISTORICAL CENSUS STATISTICS ON POPULATION TOTALS BY RACE, 1790 TO 1990, AND BY HISPANIC ORIGIN, 1970 TO 1990, FOR THE UNITED STATES, REGIONS, DIVISIONS, AND STATES
INTRODUCTION
Information on the race of the U.S. population has been collected in every decennial census beginning with the first census in 1790.
The racial categories included on census questionnaires, as well as the wording of questions, have changed over time reflecting changes in social attitudes and political considerations; however, in general, these categories have reflected social usage and not an attempt to define race biologically or genetically.
For a comprehensive discussion of racial categories in the decennial census and of changes in these categories over the past two centuries, see Bennett, 2000b and 2000c.
The population of Hispanic origin (of any race) was first identified comprehensively in the decennial census in 1970.
Previously, data on other topics, such as country of birth, country of birth of parents, and mother tongue, were used to identify portions of the Hispanic population.
Information on Hispanic origin was obtained again in 1980 and 1990; however, as with information on race, there were changes in question wording.
For a comprehensive discussion of the identification of the Hispanic origin population in the decennial census, see Chapa, 2000.
Information on race was obtained primarily by enumerator observation through 1950, by a combination of direct interview and self-identification in 1960 and 1970, and by self- identification in 1980 and 1990.
Information on Hispanic origin was obtained using various criteria in 1970, including self-identification (as discussed later), and was obtained using only self-identification in 1980 and 1990.
With enumerator observation, a person of mixed White and other parentage was usually classified with the other race.
A person of mixed race other than White was usually classified by the race of the person's father through 1970 and by the race of the person's mother in 1980 and 1990.
The major categories used to classify the population by race since 1790 in this report are those used in 1990 census reports: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut; Asian and Pacific Islander; and Other race (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992, pp. B-7, B-8, and B-11 to B- 13).
In addition, data are shown for the White non-Hispanic (i.e., White, not of Hispanic origin) population in those years for which data are available on the Hispanic population.
The terms White, Black, Hispanic origin, and White, not of Hispanic origin are used in time series tables for all census years for consistency of presentation, even though, as discussed in the sources cited earlier, there have been changes in terminology in census reports, including from Negro to Black between 1970 and 1980 and from Spanish origin to Hispanic origin between 1980 and 1990.
The term American Indian is used prior to 1960, the first year in which data for Eskimo and Aleut were identified in tabulations (other than in Alaska prior to statehood).
The term Asian is used prior to 1910 and for 1950 when no Pacific Islander categories were identified in tabulations (other than in Hawaii prior to statehood).
As a result of changes in census questions, data on race and Hispanic origin are not totally comparable over time.
Limitations to comparability are discussed in detail in decennial census publications (see Decennial Census Data References) and are discussed also in articles cited in General References.
See Bennett, 2000b and 2000c, and with regard to specific categories, see McDermott, 2000 (White), Bennett 2000a (Black), Snipp 2000 (American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut), Lee, 2000 (Asian and Pacific Islander), and Chapa, 2000 (Hispanic).
The limitations to comparability of race data between 1990 and 2000 are substantial because for the first time in a decennial census, respondents in the 2000 census could report more than one race (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1997; Bennett, 2000a and 2000b; Grieco and Cassidy, 2001).
As a result, data for 2000 are not included in this report, and a full comparison of 1990 and 2000 census data on race will require extensive research.^1
The Census Bureau last published data on the population by race (White, Black, and Other races) for states since 1790 in Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970.
Data on the population by race (White, Black, American Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, and Other Races) for states back to 1900 were last published by the Census Bureau in reports from the 1980 census of population.
No historical data on the population by race or Hispanic origin were included in reports from the 1990 census.
The purpose of this report is to provide under one cover decennial census data on population totals by race and Hispanic origin for the United States, for regions and divisions of the United States as defined for statistical purposes by the Census Bureau, and for states.
Tables 1 - 65 show historical data by geographic area, with one table per area, from the earliest census year for which data are available to 1990.
Appendix tables, which are the source of the data in Tables 1 - 65, show cross-sectional data from each census for the United States, regions, divisions, and states.
The appendix tables show data separately for the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut populations and for detailed categories of Asian and Pacific Islander population and of the Hispanic origin population.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
Race and Hispanic origin categories, 1790 to 1990
This section provides general background on data on race and Hispanic origin in the decennial census of population from 1790 to 1990 as well as on related topics concerning the census, including geographic coverage and sampling.
For more detailed information, see the sources cited in the Introduction and see also other publications listed in General References and Decennial Census Data References.
The latter list of references includes all census reports from which the data in this report were obtained, and these reports include more detailed discussions of data on race and Hispanic origin in specific censuses.
As noted earlier, the racial categories used in the decennial census have reflected social usage rather than an attempt to define race biologically or genetically.
From 1790 to 1850, the only categories recorded were White and Black (Negro), with Black designated as free and slave.
American Indians not taxed (i.e., living in tribal society) were not included in the enumeration.
It is not clear how individuals who were not White or Black were classified by race; however, their number was extremely small.^2
In the censuses of 1850 to 1870, 1890, 1910, and 1920, enumerators were instructed to identify Mulattoes (and Quadroons and Octoroons in 1890) among the Black population (Bennett, 2000c).
These data are not included in this report because of dubious accuracy and usefulness (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1922a, pp.16-17); however, some of these data were published in census volumes.
In 1860, with much of the West region of the United States being enumerated for the first time in the decennial census, American Indians (excluding those not taxed) and Chinese (in California only) were identified separately.
Japanese were identified separately starting in 1870.
The attempt to enumerate all American Indians started in 1890; however, the "general enumeration" with the standard census questionnaire included only American Indians who were taxed.
Census data on race in this report for 1890 are shown two ways: for the population in the general enumeration (62,622,000), which excluded the Indian Territory and American Indians on reservations, and for the total population (62,947,000).
Starting with the 1910 census, Asian and Pacific Islander categories other than Chinese and Japanese were identified for the first time in decennial census reports, including, for example, Filipino, Hindu, and Korean.
The explicit identification of the entire population by race, without a residual "Other races" category, continued through 1940.
In the 1930 census only, there was a separate race category for Mexican.
This population corresponded closely to the population of Mexican ancestry who were born in Mexico or to parents born in Mexico.
The 1930 census reports included estimates of the Mexican population for 1910 and 1920 based largely on data on place of birth.
The race category of Mexican was eliminated in 1940, and 1930 race data were revised to include the Mexican population with the White population.
The 1940 census was the first to include tabulations on the White population of Spanish mother tongue.
In previous censuses, published data on mother tongue had been limited to the White population of foreign stock (i.e., individuals who were foreign born or who were native of foreign or mixed parentage).
There were relatively few individuals of Spanish mother tongue who were races other than White,^3 and thus to the extent that Spanish mother tongue was a good indicator of the Hispanic population, 1940 census data provide a rough indicator of the size of the Hispanic origin population in 1940.^4 Based on the relative sizes of the population of Spanish mother tongue and of Hispanic origin in 1970, 1940 census data on Spanish mother tongue appear to represent a somewhat low estimate of the population of Hispanic origin,^5 but are included in this report in the absence of any other census data on the size of the total Hispanic origin population until 1970.
In 1950, an attempt was made for the first time (and with limited success) to identify individuals of mixed American Indian, Black, and White ancestry living in certain communities in the eastern United States.
At the same time, the only Asian and Pacific Islander categories identified separately in 1950 census reports were Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino.
Other individuals who were Asian and Pacific Islanders and individuals of mixed American Indian, Black, and White ancestry were grouped together as "Other race."
In both 1950 and 1960, the population in the Other race category was less than 0.1 percent of the total population.
Unfortunately, 1950 census data on the Filipino population were not published in general census volumes, but were limited to a subject report on characteristics that showed the Filipino population for the United States, the four regions, and states with Filipino populations of 2,500 or more: California, Washington, and New York (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953b).
The Filipino population in the other states in 1950 was estimated for purposes of this report.^6
The populations of Alaska (1880-1950) and Hawaii (1900-1950) were enumerated as territories prior to 1960, and their census questionnaires did not have the same race categories as for the conterminous United States.
Data prior to 1960 for Alaska and Hawaii are included in tables for Alaska and Hawaii.
In the 1960 census, the race categories were more similar to those for the conterminous United States, but were still different in that Eskimos and Aleuts were identified in Alaska, and Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians were identified in Hawaii.
The race categories differed slightly also in 1970.
Koreans were identified in tabulations for the conterminous United States and Hawaii, and Eskimos and Aleut were again identified only in Alaska.
In 1970, individuals who did not report their race as White but who entered a race response suggesting Indo-European stock were classified as White.
In 1980 and 1990 census reports, a standard set of expanded race categories was used for all states.
The Asian and Pacific Islander race category was used for the first time in tabulations, reflecting the release of Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1977).
In addition to Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino, the categories of Korean, Eskimo, Aleut, and Hawaiian were included in tabulations for all states, and four additional categories of Asian and Pacific Islander were included on the census questionnaire and in tabulations: Vietnamese, Asian Indian, Guamanian, and Samoan.^7
The history of census data on Hispanic origin (which is identified as an ethnic origin rather than as a race in federal statistics) is quite different from the history of census data on race.
While there were various indicators of portions of the Hispanic origin population, including data on mother tongue, data on the population with Spanish surname, and the designation of Mexican as a race in the 1930 census, the first attempt to identify the entire Hispanic origin population was in 1970.
The Hispanic origin population of the United States was defined three different ways in 1970 census reports, the first and second based on 15-percent sample data and the third based on 5-percent sample data: (1) as the Spanish language population (the population of Spanish mother tongue plus all other individuals in families in which the head or wife reported Spanish mother tongue); (2) as the Spanish heritage population (the population of Spanish language and/or Spanish surname in the five Southwestern states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, the population of Puerto Rican birth or parentage in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and the population of Spanish language elsewhere; and (3) as the population of Spanish origin or descent based on self-identification.
The Spanish origin population in 1970 was overstated in some states, especially in the Midwest and South, because some respondents interpreted the questionnaire category of "Central or South American" to mean central or southern United States.
Data on Hispanic origin were collected on a 100-percent basis in 1980 and 1990, reflecting the release of Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1977).
For the major categories of race and for the Hispanic origin population used in this report, the most important limitations on comparability are probably for the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut population, for the Asian and Pacific Islander population, and for the Other race population.
Some of the fluctuations in the size of the American Indian population prior to 1960 reflect inconsistencies in reporting related to mixed racial background and to enrollment on an Indian Reservation or agency roll.
Self-identification starting with the 1960 census and a changing social environment that fostered ethnic pride and awareness led to an increasing proportion of individuals with American Indian ancestry reporting as American Indian.
Between 1960 and 1980, there was an increase in the number of Asian and Pacific Islander categories for which data were tabulated, as shown in tables in Appendix C.
In addition, there were changes in editing procedures, especially with regard to 1980 sample data to tabulate write- in data in the Other race category for Asian and Pacific Islander groups not shown separately on the census questionnaire.
In the case of Other race, there was a dramatic population increase from 1970 to 1980.
This reflected the addition of a question on Hispanic origin to the 100-percent questionnaire, an increased propensity for Hispanics not to identify themselves as White, and a change in editing procedures to accept reports of "Other race" for respondents who wrote in Hispanic entries such as Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican.
In 1970, such responses in the Other race category were reclassified and tabulated as White.
Other general information about the decennial census
The data in this report are for the United States as shown in census reports, which means the area of the conterminous United States, including territories before statehood, prior to 1960.
Data for 1890 are shown two ways: for the general enumeration (excluding the Indian Territory and American Indians on reservations) and for the total population, as discussed earlier.
Data for 1960 are also shown two ways: for the conterminous United States and including Alaska and Hawaii.
Data are shown for states and for territories preceding statehood in their 1990 boundaries, to the extent possible (Forstall, 1996).
In cases where boundaries have changed significantly and data are available, data are shown also for states and territories as defined at each census.
For example, data are shown for Virginia as defined at each census from 1790 to 1860, including the present area of West Virginia from 1790 to 1860 (before West Virginia was made a separate state in 1863) and excluding the portion of Virginia in the District of Columbia from 1800 to 1840 (before the area taken from Virginia in 1791 to create part of the District of Columbia was retroceded in 1846).
Since 1940, some data in the decennial census of population have been collected on a sample basis (including all 1970 census data on Hispanic origin, as discussed earlier), or in some cases, tabulations were produced only on a sample basis.
Because there was some additional editing of race data for sample tabulations in 1970, 1980, and 1990 census reports and of Hispanic data for sample tabulations in 1980 and 1990 census reports, both 100-percent and sample data on race and Hispanic origin from these censuses are included in this report where available.
In 1990, the sample estimate of the Hispanic origin population at the national level is 2 percent lower than the 100-percent count, reflecting the use of sample data on ancestry and place of birth in allocating for nonresponse to the Hispanic origin question.
Sample data are identified in the detailed tables.
General information on census data, including area classifications, definitions of topics, accuracy of the data, and collection and processing procedures is provided in decennial census publications.
The decennial census has been taken on a de jure (usual place of residence) basis rather than on a de facto (location at the time of the census) basis.

DESCRIPTION OF DATA IN THE DETAILED TABLES
Time series data are shown in Tables 1-65, and the underlying cross-sectional data from each census are shown in tables in Appendixes A through E. Appendix F shows data by race and Hispanic origin for historical sections and subsections of the United States (Dahmann, 1992), which for some purposes are more useful than regions and divisions currently used for statistical purposes.
The census reports from which data in the detailed tables were obtained are listed in Decennial Census Data References.
The specific tables and pages in these reports are listed in Sources for Data in Detailed Tables.
Tables 1 - 65, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1790 to 1990
These tables show historical population totals for the major race categories, for Hispanic origin, and for White non-Hispanic, for the United States (Table 1), regions (Tables 2-5), divisions (Tables 6-14), and states (including the District of Columbia) in alphabetical order (Tables 15-65).
The tables in Appendix A are the primary source of these data.
The tables for Alaska (Table 16) and for Hawaii (Table 26) include data on the population by race from territorial censuses prior to statehood.
Appendix Tables A-1 to A-26, Race and Hispanic Origin
These tables show population totals at each census for the major race categories, for Hispanic origin, and for White non-Hispanic, for the United States, regions, divisions, and states.
Except for data for White and Black, the tables in Appendixes B, C, D, and E are the primary source of these data.
Appendix Tables B-1 to B-3, American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut
These tables show population totals separately for the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut populations starting in 1960.
Appendix Tables C-1 to C-11, Asian and Pacific Islander by Category
These tables show population totals for the Asian and Pacific Islander population by category starting in 1870, the first census in which more than one Asian and Pacific Islander category was identified.
Appendix Tables D-1 to D-4, Hispanic Origin by Type
These tables show population totals for the Hispanic origin population by type starting in 1970.
These data include three different definitions of Hispanic origin for 1970: Spanish language, Spanish heritage, and Spanish origin.
Appendix Tables E-1 to E-7, Race by Hispanic Origin
These tables show population totals for the Hispanic origin population by race starting in 1970.
In addition, data are shown for the White population of Mexican origin from 1910 to 1930 and for the White population of Spanish mother tongue in 1940.
Appendix Table F-1, Race and Hispanic Origin, for Historical Sections and Subsections of the United States
These tables show population totals at each census for the major race categories, for Hispanic origin, and for White non-Hispanic, for the United States and its historical sections and subsections.
The four regions Northeast, North Central (subsequently renamed Midwest), South, and West were introduced in the 1940s and replaced the three sections introduced in the 1910 census: North, South, and West.
For the presentation of historical data, the three sections are in some ways preferable because they permit direct comparison of North and South.
The North is divided into two subsections (Northeast and North Central), and the South is divided into two subsections (Southeast and South Central).
These subsections recognize the westward expansion of settlement from the Atlantic seaboard and facilitate comparison of the eastern and central portions of the United States.

For 2000 census data on the population by race and Hispanic origin, see U.S. Census Bureau, 2001b.
For data on the detailed categories of race and Hispanic origin, see U.S. Census Bureau, 2001c.
^2In 1860, when categories other than White or Black were first identified, the enumerated population other than White or Black was about 79,000, or only 0.25 percent of the total U.S. population (Table 1).
^3Data on the foreign-born population by country of birth and race were published in the 1940 census only for the White population.
The foreign-born population from Spain and Latin America (shown as Cuba, other West Indies, Central America, and South America) of races other than White was about 28,000 in 1910 and about 83,000 in 1930, not all of whom were from countries where Spanish was the predominant language (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1913a, 1933a, 1943a).
^4The 1940 census data on the White population of Spanish mother tongue were based on a 5-percent sample.
The resulting estimate of White population was slightly larger than the 100-percent count of the White population for the United States and for many states.
In one state with a very small White population of Spanish mother tongue (New Hampshire), the sample population of the White population not of Spanish mother tongue was slightly larger than the 100-percent count of the White population.
In Table E-6, estimates for 1940 are shown both as published and as prorated to the 100-percent count of the White population.
^5In the 1970 census, the Spanish language population (9,589,000) was defined to include individuals of Spanish mother tongue (7,824,000) and all other individuals in families in which the head or wife reported Spanish mother tongue (1,766,000).
The population of Spanish mother tongue thus was about 86 percent as large as the population of Hispanic origin (9,073,000), as shown in Table D-4.
^6The estimates were developed using 1940 and 1960 census counts of the Filipino population by state, interpolation, and controls to 1950 counts by region, excluding the 3 states noted.
Of the Filipino population of 62,000 in 1950, 49,000 were in these 3 states, leaving 13,000 who were distributed by estimation (Table C-7).
^7As an extreme example of inconsistency in the classification by race over time, a person who was included in the Asian Indian category in 1980 and 1990 census tabulations might have been included in different categories previously: Hindu in 1920-1940, Other race in 1950-1960, and White in 1970.
