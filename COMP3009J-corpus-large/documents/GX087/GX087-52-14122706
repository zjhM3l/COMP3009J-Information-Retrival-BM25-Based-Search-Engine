Seventy construction machines being used on the central artery/tunnel project in Boston will be retrofitted with pollution control devices in the first phase of the project.
* The project goal is to transfer emission control technologies used in trucks and buses to the construction industry.
In order to demonstrate that the technologies would be effective in construction vehicles, a pilot program was conducted in coordination with the U.S. Generating Company at the Salem Harbor power plant last year to assess the operational feasibility of using control devices and measure environmental results.
* The central artery/tunnel machines will have either oxidation catalysts or particulate filters installed to reduce emissions.
The equipment works by oxidizing particulates (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) to less harmful emissions such as H[2]O and CO[2]
The equipment is also anticipated to reduce toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene by as much as 70 percent.
* The Clean Air Construction project at the central artery/tunnel is being spearheaded jointly by the Massachusetts Highway Department, EPA Region I - New England, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, and the Manufacturers of Emission Control Association.
* The seventy machines being retrofitted will include front end loaders, backhoes, excavators, cranes, and air compressors.
The machines represent 25 percent of all central artery/tunnel equipment being operated on a long-term basis on the project.
* Participating contractors include J.F. White Contracting Co., Jay Cashman Inc., and Walsh Construction Company.
Other contractors are expected to join the project.
* In order to quality assure the emission control devices,. emissions testing will be conducted in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that PM, HC, CO and toxic emissions are being reduced as expected.
* The project will reduce emissions by 33 tons per year and over 203 tons during the six years that the construction equipment will work on the central artery/tunnel project (see environmental fact sheet).
*
Massachusetts Highway Department will provide funding to contractors to purchase the emission control devices.
The devices cost approximately $2,000 for oxidation catalysts and $9,000 for particulate filters
