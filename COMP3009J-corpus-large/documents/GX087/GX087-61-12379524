SCHUMER: FALSE ANTHRAX ALARMS STRETCH 911 EMERGENCY RESOURCES TO THE LIMIT
Schumer unveils new legislation in Buffalo to make terrorist hoaxes a federal crime, impose a five year jail sentence and fines
Terrorist hoaxes overburden law enforcement, take away from investigating real threats, scare an already anxious public
Standing with FBI and police officials from Western New York, US Senator CHARLES E. SCHUMER today unveiled new, bipartisan legislation in Buffalo that will make terrorist hoaxes a federal crime.
The bill imposes prison sentences for anyone who threatens or falsely reports a terrorist attack, stiff fines, and liability for all expenses resulting from the disruption caused by the terrorist hoax.
Currently, there is no federal law dedicated to punishing terrorist hoaxes.
"Terrorist hoaxes are no laughing matter," Schumer said.
"By undermining the police's ability to investigate real terrorist threats, these pranks puts us all at risk.
Law enforcement is already working around the clock to bring those responsible for September 11 and the anthrax attacks to justice.
Wasting their valuable time and resources by committing pranks is essentially an extension of terrorism itself."
In just the first three weeks of October, the FBI responded to more than 3,300 cases relating to weapons of mass destruction nationally, 2,500 of which involved suspected anthrax incidents - a huge increase in the 250 assessments and responses the FBI normally handles in an average year.
These cases typically fall into three categories: (1) False alarms, which are being reported across the country by people who have come across powdery substances in public places, airplanes, and in their mail; (2) Deliberate hoaxes, pranks and practical jokes; and (3) Actual cases of anthrax exposure.
Western New York in particular has been hit with a number of false anthrax alarms over the last few weeks.
Since September 11, the FBI's Buffalo office has gotten 240 anthrax-related complaints, 38 of which required in-depth investigations.
Of these more in-depth investigations, 11 were found to be pranks.
The FBI has also sent 14 substances to state labs for testing.
The Buffalo Police Department reports 155 anthrax-related calls since September 11.
While white powder was recovered in 15 of these cases, none have tested positive as anthrax.
In Chautauqua County, the Hazardous Materials Team has responded to 70 incidents since October 12.
Officials estimate that 40% of those incidents have been hoaxes and say that each call requires between four and eight team members for two to eight hours at a cost of $300 in equipment and personnel.
Schumer said that his bill would require perpetrators of terrorist hoaxes to reimburse the municipalities where they occur for the costs associated with investigating them.
Schumer also said that he is working to make sure that a provision likely to be included in an emergency spending bill that would reimburse local governments for homeland defense efforts sends federal funds to Western New York law enforcement agencies.
Recent examples include: 1.
According to school officials, approximately 3,000 students and staff were held in lock-down for 90 minutes while some 50 local police, fire and emergency response personnel assessed the situation.
"Beyond the incredible waste of time and money caused by terrorist hoaxes, they scare people at the worst possible time," Schumer said.
"New Yorkers are tough and New Yorkers are stoic, but most New Yorkers are also a little on edge.
That's only natural.
Exploiting our anxiety by committing a terrorist hoax or prank isn't just bad taste.
It's sick.
It mocks the loss of thousands of lives in the September 11 attacks and the people who have died from anthrax.
But my guess is that scaring people through terrorist hoaxes won't seem so funny after spending five years in jail."
Schumer's bill, the Anti-Hoax Terrorism Act of 2001, would: 1.
Impose sentences of up to five years in prison for those convicted of sending a hoax concerning a weapon of mass destruction or falsely reporting a weapon of mass destruction.
This applies to bioterrorism, chemical or nuclear weapons, and incendiary explosives.
2.
Hold offenders responsible for reimbursement for all expenses incurring resulting from the hoax.
In many cases, these expenses can easily top $1 million.
3.
Fine offenders .
While the penalties would be determined by the judge in each individual case, fines of at least $10,000 would be common under this legislation.

On November 8, a family planning clinic in West Seneca received a Fed Ex package containing a powdery substance.
The package was similar to 131 other letters sent across the country.
Along with the Southtowns HazMat team and the West Seneca police department, the Buffalo FBI assigned four agents to the case.
The facility is closed until test results of the substance come back.

The Chautauqua County Haz Mat Team responded with five personnel.
