BACKGROUND NARRATIVES
Project Summary: Proposed modified water deliveries to Indian Tribal Lands, Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A require that flow at critical points in the interior be measured.
This task provides flow data to supplement the current gaging station network in the area south of Lake Okeechobee and is an integral component of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD)/Seminole Indian Tribal Agreement.
The accurate determination of flow through the interior canal networks south of Lake Okeechobee and the C-139 basin is necessary for water budgets and regional model calibrations.
Project Objectives and Strategy: Three sites are are currently located at critical water delivery points to Tribal Lands for which information was previously lacking.
A unique experiment, being conducted with much success, has provided three separate data components at each site with responsibilities allocated between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes, and SFWMD.
All sites are instrumented with USGS acoustic velocity meters (AVMÃ¯Â¿Â½s), stage shaft encoders, data loggers with real-time flow-weighted algorithms, and radio frequency (RF) telemetry instrumentation provided by the SFWMD.
RF telemetry, maintained and operated by SFWMD, is currently used to record and transmit all data from the field into data bases of the USGS Miami Subdistrict office through SFWMD data bases.
The USGS mean-channel-velocity/AVM index-calibration refinement continues by performing a series of periodic streamgaging measurements utilizing the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) when appropriate stream flow velocities are available.
Continuous records of discharge are computed by the USGS and published in SFWMD/Seminole Indian Tribe data reports on a semi-annual basis.
Autosamplers have been installed by SFWMD at each USGS AVM site and are maintained and operated by the Seminole Tribe (two sites) and the Miccosukee Indian Tribe (one site) for sampling real-time flow-weighted nitrates and phosphates based on USGS/SFWMD AVM algorithm triggers.
All autosampler data have been processed and quality assured by the respective Tribe with direction and training to the Seminoles provided by the SFWMD and with nutrient loads computed by a separate agreement between the Tribes and SFWMD.
Potential Impacts and Major Products: The implementation of strategically located streamflow gaging points and associated data collection for nutrients are helping to define future surface-water flow requirements and to provide valuable baseline data before the establishment of new northern Storm Treatment Areas (STAÃ¯Â¿Â½s 5 and 6), which currently are under construction.
Generating continuous flow data at selected impact points for interior basins has complimented the existing eastern canal discharge network, which will allow for more accurately timed surface-water releases and provide flow and nutrient monitoring after STA implementation.
One of the primary benefits of this USGS collaboration effort has been the technology transfer that has occurred through contact with Tribe and state entities.
This intimate association has allowed USGS technical staff exposure to new techniques involving acoustic flow-weighted nutrient load protocols with relatively minimal funding and manpower investment.
The expenditures made by the State are much larger in scope than would be possible for the Interior Flows program.
The USGS, as members of the Seminole Working Group, has gained exposure to problems encountered upstream of Internal Flows stations at SFWMD sites.
This exposure has aided in comprehending velocity circulation patterns previously ill defined by velocity indexes at the downstream USGS sites on the L-28 Intecepter Canal.
Solving this low flow problem along with instrument experimentation by the SFWMD has allowed USGS personnel the benefits of oversight without cost expenditures.
Implementation of information learned in this effort for the existing 30 station cooperative velocity index network, which is currently operated by the USGS and other cooperators, may occur in the future.
Data products include daily value stage and discharge for three velocity index discharge sites and provisional daily value data produced biannually for the Seminole Working Group Report.
Collaborators and Clients: The primary entities interested in monitoring these flow ways are the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes, who have the greatest concern over water allocation and nutrient loads provided by future upstream STAÃ¯Â¿Â½s.
The SFWMD implements previously defined water-regulation schedules and also operates similar data- collection stations upstream where the primary flow ways enter the Reservations.
Big Cypress National Preserve and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection are secondary concerned parties with interests in both water budgets and nutrient loads leaving Tribal Lands.
These numbers will be instrumental in the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers Restudy Plan, which proposes breaches (among several other alternatives) in the L-28 Intercepter Canal.

The USGS will facilitate coordination of instrumentation troubleshooting and streamflow quality assurance at the multiagency sites.
The USGS will also assist both Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes to verify data-logger totalized flows, which will be used in quality assuring flow-weighted autosampler load totals.
The USGS will also help train the two Tribes to access telemetric data through either ADAPS or the World Wide Web.
Logistical support for pump and gate operations will be provided by the SFWMD.
Progress and data dissemination will be communicated in monthly technical meetings and summarized for members of the monthly Seminole Working Group meetings.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, OUTCOMES, PRODUCTS, OUTREACH
FY 1998 Accomplishments and Outcomes, Including Outreach: Three RF/AVM/autosampler (flow-weighted nutrients) sites have been operated and monitored with daily value stage and discharge computations performed for the period October 1 to February 28, 1998.
Analysis for low flow computations have revealed conditions previously misunderstood which have caused inaccuracies at the low end of the velocity rating regression.
Thermal stratification and wind vectors have been revealed as the causes for coarse index- velocity rating curve definition during common winter flows in the 0.00 to 0.30 ft/s (foot per second) ranges.
Monthly technical mutiagency meetings have suggested similar conditions at upstream canal sites, and new documentation will be included in the SFWMD/Seminole Semiannual Progress Report to illuminate data collected during these less accurately calibrated flow conditions.
New electromagnetic point-velocity equipment has been installed at one site to allow further delineation and documentation of these special conditions.
FY 1997 Deliverables, Products Completed: Daily value stage and discharges for three sites have been analyzed, processed, reviewed, and forwarded to SFWMD personnel for inclusion in the SFWMD/Seminole Semiannual Progress Report.
