Figures compiled by the Office of Court Administration confirm these perceptions about women in the judiciar y.
In 2001, women comprised 25% of New York's state-paid judges, up from 11% in 1986.
However, only 17 % of New York's Supreme Cour t Justices were women and in the counties outside New York City only 11% of Supreme Court Justices were women.
See Appendix A. 33.
A sample of the letter and the questionnaire, which varied slightly according to the group to which it was addressed, are attached to this report as Appendix B. 34.
This response rate of about 3.6% is close to the 3.5% response rate for the original Task Force's sur vey. 35.
