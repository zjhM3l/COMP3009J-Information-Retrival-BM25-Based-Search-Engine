Local Transportation Needs and Funding Report Executive Summary This LBO Local Transportation Needs and Funding Report is in response to the mandate in Section 10 of Am.
Sub. H.B. 163 of the 123rd General Assembly.
That section instructed the Legislative Budget Office of the Legislat ive Service Commission to conduct a study to 1) determine the need for additional resources to meet local construction and maintenance needs for highways, bridges, and mass transit; 2) identify possible alternative sources of revenue that could be imposed by local governments, or imposed by the state and distributed to local governments; and 3) consider whether and how the state's allocation of funds to local projects could be done in ways more responsive to local needs and local variations in the condition of highways, bridges, and mass transit systems.
This report does the following: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Examines local government "needs" by presenting various measures of transportation needs and resources Identifies possible alternative sources of revenue and describes othe r ways for improving local transportation finance Analyzes the amount and distribution of revenues received by local governments from local, state and federal sources for roads and bridges Addresses the question of whether the current allocation of state funds is responsive to local highway and bridge needs Discusses funding and needs for mass transit in Ohio Provides a brief review of Ohio law, both constitutional and statutory, as it relates to state and local transportation responsibilities and funding
Study Conditions To address the issue of local construction and maintenance needs, LBO sought information from state- level sources with an identifiable connection to Ohio's transportation infrastructure network.
These sources, viewed as most likely t have o useful information, included the Ohio Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Safety, the Public Works Commission, and the County Engineers Association of Ohio.
LBO also sought information directly from local- level sources.
LBO distributed over 1,000 Local Government Surveys to officials in Ohio, including: 88 counties, 242 cities,
1
200 villages, and 482 townships.
Due to a low initial response, the survey deadline was extended to accommodate additional responses.
A total of 376 loca l government responses were received over a 12- week period.
However, only 359 local governments responded to all four parts of the survey.
To address the issue of transportation finance, LBO again sought information from statelevel sources, including the aforementioned state agencies, the departments of Taxation and Development, and the Ohio Rail Commission.
Meetings were held with members of the Federal Highway Administration, County Engineers Association of Ohio, Franklin County Engineer's Office, Ohio Association of Regional Councils, Ohio Municipal League, Ohio Public Transit Association, and the Ohio Township Association.
In addition to the Local Government Survey, LBO developed two other survey instruments, one to gather information from regiona l planners and mass transit providers, and one to gather comparative information from other states.
Sixteen metropolitan planning organizations, ten transit authorities, and seven mid- west states were contacted and all responded with financial and program information.
Findings Transportation systems are by nature complex in terms of structure and operation.
The topic becomes more complicated when over 2,300 local governments are involved.
The following discussion describes some general findings essent ial to the understanding of Ohio's local transportation infrastructure, the financing of those public works, and the parameters of this report.
These findings are presented in the categories of transportation need and transportation finance.
Transportation Need 1.
As LBO began to compile and analyze information from numerous sources, certain research obstacles surfaced which eventually limited the ability of this report to definitively answer the Legislature's mandate.
A continual problem was the lack of consistent and comparable data among local government sources.
In the absence of statewide reporting guidelines of need, local governments have developed their own reporting standards.
Because much of the information was obtained from selfreported stateme nts of need, the need may be overstated to enhance the case for receiving funding and is certainly not comparable across specific local government units.
Local transportation needs vary considerably among governmental jurisdictions due to differences in legal responsibility, LBO estimates the one-time cost factors of urbanization, topography, of restoring local transportation climate, and maintenance schedules.

restoring local transportation infrastructure in critical condition to be approximately $527 million.
It is possible that, if critical infrastructure were restored to excellent condition at state expense, current funding levels might be adequate to meet local government's ongoing maintenance n eeds.
However, existing data is inadequate to determine whether current on- going funding amounts would be actually sufficient.
Transportation Finance Ohio's largest sources of transportation revenue are the following: Â· The state motor vehicle fuel tax, or gas tax, generating approximately $1.4 billion in FY 1999.
Of this amount, $329 million was distributed to local governments for road and bridge purposes.
The state motor vehicle license tax, or license plate fee, generating $323 million in FY 1999.
Of this amount, $304 was distributed to local governments for roads and bridges.
Local permissive motor vehicle license taxes, which are collected by the state on behalf of local governments for roads and bridges.
Revenues totaled $138 million in FY 1999 for all local governments, but vary widely across local governments depending on the tax rate and the number of registered vehicles in each jurisdiction.
Many local governments assess no local license tax.
Ohio Public Works bond proceeds and gas tax revenue , distributing about $141 million to local governments for transportation projects in FY 1999.
Â·
Â·
Â·
Local governments also use their own local revenues, including general fund moneys, bond proceeds, and other sources for infrastructure purposes, but these funds are not tracked at the state level.
Using response data Combining all local, state, and from the LBO Local Government Survey and federal FY 1999 resources, the other sources, LBO estimates total local total amount of revenue government revenues at $807 million.
received by Ohio local Combining all local, state and federal FY 1999 governments for roads and resources, the total amount of revenue received bridges is estimated at by Ohio local governments for roads and approximately $1.8 billion.
bridges is estimated at approximately $1.8 billion.
1.
Most state- level funding is distributed using a formula allocation, which is based on type of political jurisdiction and not directly related to local infrastructure need.
Of the $787 million distributed to local governments in FY 1999, counties received $390 million (or about 50 percent), cities received $246 million (31 percent), townships received $93 million (12 percent), and villages received $46 million (about 6 percent).
The total amount of state funding also includes $13 million in grants

awarded by the Department of Development, for which local government type was unspecified.
2.
Through the course of this analysis, several viable optio ns to raise additional revenue emerged.
These options, summarized in a context of potential advantages and disadvantages, are detailed in Part One of this report.
Also, LBO found that some local governments have not fully utilized existing legal authorit y for generating additional local revenue.
3.
Mass transit has not received a large amount of state- level funding relative to other transportation needs in Ohio or when compared to some other states' funding levels.
While total 1999 state funding sources going to local governments for local roads and bridges exceed $787 million, state funding for mass transit in calendar year 2000 approximates $76 million, or less than one tenth the amount distributed for other local transportation needs in the previous year.
By law, Ohio's top transportation funding sources--the gas tax and license plate taxes--are specifically dedicated for use in the construction and maintenance of Ohio roads and bridges.
The Ohio Constitution prohibits the use of these revenues for any non- highway related purpose, such as mass transit.
Possible Alternatives: Revenues, Cost Savings, and Responsiveness to Local Need LBO has developed fifteen options for the General Assembly to consider in its deliberations concerning local transportation needs and funding.
A list of these options is presented on the following page, while a LBO has developed 15 options ... detailed discussion of each option can be that w ill boost revenues found in Part One of the report.

Each option requires some level of action by the General Assembly to achieve the anticipated goal, even for options that require local implementation.

LBO Local Transportation Needs and Funding Report Introduction Section 10 of Am.
Sub. H.B. 163 of the 123rd General Assembly requires the Legislative Budget Office (LBO) to conduct a study of Ohio's local transportation needs and funding in order to: Â· Â· Â· Determine the need for additional resources to meet local construction and maintenance needs for highways, bridges, and mass transit Identify possible alternative sources of revenue that could be imposed by local governments, or imposed by the state and distributed to local governments Consider whether and how the state's allocation of funds to local projects could be done in ways more responsive to local needs and local variations in condition
In an effort to address these concerns, the report is organized as follows: Part One identifies possible alternative sources of revenue and describes other options for the General Assembly to consider when deciding how to make the allocation of funds more responsive to local needs, ho w to maximize the benefit from dollars spent on local transportation infrastructure, and how to generally improve Ohio's local transportation system.
Information and data supporting these suggestions can be found in the ensuing sections of the report and in the appendices.
Part Two examines local government "needs" by presenting various measures of need.
First, a general explanation of road and bridge responsibilities is provided, along with a discussion of other factors that can impact costs for maintaining roads and bridges.
Next, local government needs are explored using three sources of information: a) data obtained directly from local governments using an LBO survey, b) data reported by local governments to the Public Works Commission, and c) estimates of road maintenance costs developed from information provided by the County Engineers Association of Ohio.
Part Three analyzes the amount and distribution of revenues received by local governments from local, state, and federal sources for roads and bridges.
This information is presented in detail to promote a better understanding of Ohio's complicated transportation funding system and the suggestions included in Part One.
Part Four addresses the question of whether the current allocation of state funds is responsive to local highway and bridge needs.
Suggestions of how the distribution of funds could be made more responsive are included in Part One.
Part Five discusses funding and needs for mass transit in Ohio.
Part Six contains a brief review of Ohio law, both constitutional and statutory, as it relates to state and local transportation responsibilities and funding.

Part 1 Possible Alternative Sources of Revenue and Other Options The purpose of this study is to provide information about Ohio's tra nsportation finance system and how such a system provides local governments with resources to address local transportation needs.
During the course of this study, it became apparent that a variety of factors contribute to the condition of infrastructure, which impact the cost of repair and ultimately the need for additional revenue.
Also, it became apparent that the availability and distribution of funds varies greatly among governmental units.
After examining the many facets of Ohio's transportation finance system and gathering information about Ohio's local transportation infrastructure needs, LBO has identified 15 options for the General Assembly to consider in its deliberations.
Each option, if implemented, would achieve at least one of three desired impacts: 1) produce additional revenue, 2) enhance cost savings measures, or 3) help realign funding allocations with local need.
Each option is identified according to place of implementation, e.g. at the state level, local level, or both.
At the end of each option description, LBO includes a list of summarizing some of the key advantages and disadvantages of each option.
Researching and analyzing potential funding alternatives is not an easy undertaking.
Even the most careful consideration of an iss ue can produce unforeseen impacts.
A seemingly minor change in a funding source can generate numerous concerns among decision makers, administrators and residents alike.
With these issues in mind, LBO has compiled the following list of criteria for use when considering this section's options : Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Is the r evenue stream predictable? Is administration simple and inexpensive to implement ? Is the revenue source d irectly linked to transportation? Does the action b uild upon the existing tax system? Is the action understandable to the public? Is the action consistent with "User- Pays" principle of raising revenues ? Does the action e xpand or maintain local government responsibility in providing transportation infrastructure? Does the action promote inter- jurisdictional cooperation?

Possible Alternative Revenue Sources and Cost Savings Measures
Suggestions for State Level Implementation Â­ Additional Revenue Option 1: Provide One-Time Funding to Repair Critical Infrastructure Based on data provided by the Ohio Public Works Commission, the estimated cost of restoring local transportation infrastructure in critical condition is in the magnitude of $527 million.
One way of addressing this immediate need would be to identify a source of one- time funding, for use over a period of one or more years, to repair these local roads and bridges.
Whether the source of funds is GRF or bond proceeds, and whether the amount is $50 million or $500 million, a one time increase in funding could be a stand - alone option to temporarily supplement existing sources of funding.
Depending on the amount of funding for one - time repairs, the state could direct one - time money for critical infrastructure in various ways.
The total cost figure of $527 million is a compilation of costs identified by type of local government jurisdiction and by type of infrastructure in need of repair, e.g. road, bridge, or culvert.
Table 1A provides further detail by government and infrastructure type.
Table 1A: Estimated Costs of Repairing Critical Roads, Bridges and Culverts* (Millions of Dollars) Local Government Counties Cities Villages Townships Total Road Repair Cost $58.1 279.6 31.3 54.6 $423.6 Total Bridge Repair Cost $57.8 17.4 2.5 0.0 $77.7 Total Culvert Repair Cost $11.2 6.5 1.5 6.1 $25.3 Total Repair Cost $127.1 303.5 35.3 60.7 $526.6
Total Cost *LBO estimates based on data provided by the Ohio Public Works Commission.
Columns or rows may not sum to totals shown because of rounding.
Among the four types of local governments, cities appear to face the highest overall repair cost, about $304 million or 58 percent of the $527 million.
Counties account for $127 million or 24 percent, while the combined total for villages and townships is just under $100 million or roughly 18 percent.
Among types of infrastructure, a similarly lop- sided situation is revealed.
The estimate for fixing critical roads totals about $424 million or 80 percent of the $527 million.
The cost of fixing critical local bridges (which may be a higher priority than roads from a safety perspective) is about $78 million or 15 percent, and culvert repairs total $25 million or less than 5 percent.

Providing one - time funding seems to make sense for several reasons.
First, assuming the "critical" condition rating provided by local governments is accurate, a number of Ohio roads and bridges are likely hazardous to Ohio drivers.
Second, the cost of repairing and maintaining infrastructure that is in critical condition is much higher than maintaining infrastructure in good condition.
Therefore, the repair of critical roads and bridges would likely free- up funding that could be used to improve infrastructure in poor condition or to expand preventive maintenance efforts to slow the deterioration of other roads and bridges.
Finally, it is possible that, if critical infrastructure were restored to adequate condition, at state expense, current - funding levels might be sufficient to address ongoing local government infrastructure needs.
Providing one- time funding could serve as a pilot program designed to determine whether existing funding is sufficient to meet local government's on- going maintenance needs.
Problems with existing data make it difficult, if not impossible, to say whether existing funding would actually be sufficient if critical infrastructure were repaired.
Advantages and Disadvantages of One -Time Funding for Critical Roads and Bridges Advantages Would promote the safety of the transportation network Would promote fiscal flexibility for local governments Provides an opportunity for targeting assistance to particular types of local government or particular types of infrastructure where there is significant need Could serve as a sort of experiment to help determine whether e xisting revenue sources are sufficient for local governments' on-going maintenance needs Disadvantages Would increase the fiscal burden on Ohio taxpayers Might leave lo cal governments with a continuing shortage of funds in the absence of any increase in ongoing sources of revenue Might provide local governments with additional incentive to overstate cost figures reported to Public Works Commission and to overstate the amount of critical infrastructure
Option 2: Increase the Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax (or Gas Tax) The Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax (MVFT), commonly known as the "gas revenue source distributed to local governments for their transportation excise tax assessed on a per gallon basis.
The current tax rate Implementing this option would require legislative action as the tax rate Assuming there is no sustained increase in the real raise significant revenues, as consumers are less resulting from taxation given the larger effect from below provides an estimate of additional motor fuel 1

compared to historical tax collections between FY 1995 and FY 2000.
These figures may be somewhat high, as they do not allow for a decrease in motor fuel demand that may result from increases in the motor fuel tax rate.
Historical gross tax collections are from the Department of Taxation Annual Report, FY 1999.
Taxable gallonage for FY 2000 is estimated from historical trends.
The table shows increased annual same period, an increased annual that a one cent increase in the gas tax rate, to 23 cents per gallon, would have tax collections from $59 to $65 million between FY 1995 to FY 2000.
For the excise tax rate of 25 cents per gallon (a three cent increase) would have gross receipts from $176 to $195 million.

Table 1C presents a forecast of additional fuel tax revenues for FY 2000 through 2005 for higher excise tax rates compared to the current rate of 22 cents per gallon.
The forecast accounts for decreases in motor fuel consumption following the tax increases.
It further assumes annual growth rates of 2.3 percent in Ohio personal income growth and 1.3 percent in gas prices.
4 Table 1C shows that an increase in the gas tax rate to 23 cents per gallon would provide additional revenues of $58 to $64 million in the next few fiscal years.
Increasing the excise tax to 25

Actu al tax collections are usually less than potential tax revenue (obtained by multiplying taxable gallons by 22 cents/gallon) because of deductions, refunds and credits (see ORC 5735.05 and 5735.06) and tax avoidance.
For FY95, FY96 and FY97, actual collection rates were lower than in FY98 and FY99.
This explains higher additional tax revenue at higher tax rates for those FY95, FY96, and FY97 as opposed to for added revenues in FY98 and FY99.
For fiscal year 2000, actual tax collections are assumed to equal estimated potential tax revenues.
4 To forecast future fuel tax revenues, key assumptions must be made regarding growth rates of disposable income and gas prices, the main drivers of motor fuel demand in the short -term.
No assumptions were made for population growth, changes in the stock of cars or fuel efficiency.
Growth rate in yearly disposable income was provided by WEFA, an econometric and forecasting group.
WEFA's moderate trend outlook predicts Ohio personal income will grow at an annual rate of 2.3 percent.
Growth rate for gas prices was obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy, and is based on EIA's long-term outlook for motor fuel prices.
These assumptions are maintained in the estimations.
However, calculations include a short -term rise in gas prices for CY 2000 and a return to moderate gas prices in CY2001.
10
cents/gallon, or an additional 3 cents, will generate an additional $173 to $188 million.
5 However, a sustained rise in gas prices and/or an economic recession could reduce motor fuel demand further than the tax rate changes contemplated above, resulting in less revenues than the amounts estimated in the table.
Table 1C.
Estimated Add itional MVFT Revenue for Higher MVFT Rates, FY 2002 - FY 2005 Tax Rate Per Gallon FY 2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005
23 cents $ 58,549,645 $ 60,329,918 $ 62,172,652 $ 63,675,355 24 cents $116,234,260 $119,794,806 $123,480,274 $126,485,681 25 cents $17 3,053,844 $178,394,664 $183,922,865 $188,430,975 26 cents $229,008,398 $236,129,491 $243,500,427 $249,511,240
In addition to raising a significant amount of revenue, an advantage to raising the MVFT is that it involves an existing tax collection system.
Administration of the tax is in place and consumers are already accustomed to this tax.
Therefore, the costs of implementing changes would be small.
On other hand, there are some disadvantages to increasing the MVLT that merit consideration.
Obviously, increasing the tax rate raises the tax burden for all Ohioans.
To the extent that Ohio is in competition with its neighbors, increasing the excise tax could negatively impact the competitive balance.
Ohio motor fuel tax rates are already higher than Indiana (19 cents/gallon), Kentucky (16.4 cents/gallon), Michigan (19 cents/gallon), but still lower than Pennsylvania (25.9 cents/gallon) and West Virginia (25.35 cents/gallon).
This may be of importance to businesses and consumers in border counties.
Although it is unlikely a minor tax increase will significantly change the overall demand for motor fuels, a tax hike may push some Ohioans to consider buying motor fuels out - of- state, thus reducing sales in certain counties.
Also, if one assumes that motor fuel consumption is a necessity, a tax rate increase would harm lower- income citizens more because they would have to spend a higher share of their income on motor fuels.
Therefore, raising the excise tax rate may increase the regressivity of the gas tax for lo wer- income citizens.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Increasing the MVFT or Gas Tax Advantages Increases revenues Disadvantages Increases tax burden on Ohioans
5
Depending upon how the language for an increase in the MVFT was structured, raising the MVFT could also increase the motor vehicle fuel use tax rate and revenues collected.
The General Assembly would need to consider this impact when contemplating any MVFT increase.
Currently, ODOT receives fuel use tax revenue to retire highway bond debt service and to fund state highway construction.
In FY 1999, the fuel use tax generated about $64 million, of which about $48 million went to fund state highway construction.
11
Advantages Easy to implement; small changes to an existing system Stable revenue source that is sensitive to small changes in tax rates May decrease growth of motor fuels consumption, thereby helping to reduce emissions.
Disadvantages Increases motor fuel excise tax d ifferential with some neighboring states Makes tax more regressive; lowerincome citizens would spend a higher share of their income on transportation needs May decrease growth of motor fuels consumption, thereby reducing revenue growth
Option 3: Realign Funding for Certain Department of Public Safety Activities In fiscal year 1998, approximately $161.4 million in motor vehicle fuel tax (gas tax) revenues were used to support expenses within the Department of Public Safety (DHS).
6 As shown in the following table, the bulk of the se funds (about $149 million) supported activities of the State Highway Patrol (SHP ).
Approximately $8 million was used for the Department's Administrative Division and approximately $5.1 million was transferred to the Department of Health (a statutory requirement) to pay for indigent person's hospital expenses if their injuries resulted from auto accidents.
Thus, the combined operating costs for the State Patrol and Administrative Division would total approximately $156 million annually.
Table 1D shows the history of the State Highway Patrol's draw on MVFT revenue.
Table 1D: Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax Revenue Supporting the State Highway Patrol (Millions of Dollars) Fiscal Year 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Appropriated $108.0 $115.4 $126.4 $141.2 $144.5 $148.5 $152.4 $158.5 Disbursed $94.8 $101.4 $111.3 $123.4 $128.3 $136.9 $142.7 $148.7
If the State Patrol and Administrative Division were funded from a source other than the gas tax, and if the gas tax continued to generate funds at its current rate, then the "freed- up" revenue could be used to increase support to local governments for infrastructure purposes.
6
A number of legislative changes have been implemented over time to reduce the agency's reliance on fuel tax funding including: (1) allowing funds to retain earned interest, (2) having driver license fee revenues be paid solely into the State Highway Patrol's operating account, (3) increasing various agency fees, (4) shifting funding for the "parking lot detail" at the State Fair from fue l tax revenue to fine revenue, (5) allowing for transfers of cash balances to offset fuel tax funded appropriations Â­ in FY00 $1.3 million was shifted to the State Patrol, and (6) through biennial budget reductions.
12
Of course, an alternative source of revenue must be found to ensure the continuous and continued operation of these DHS activities.
The following funding alternatives are presented as options to examine potential funding alternatives for certain DHS operations, and thus, fully or partially reduce DHS's dependence on the gas tax.
Option 3.1: Shift funding for certain DHS activities from the gas tax to the to motor vehicle license tax (license plate fees) Under this option, all gas tax revenue s supporting the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety's Administrative Division would be replaced with existing state MVLT (license plate fee) revenue.
7 Simultaneously, the exact amount of revenue from the state portion of the MVLT, currently distributed to local governments for transportation infrastructure needs, would be replaced with existing gas tax revenue.
The end result is a swap of funding sources, intended to be revenue - neutral for all parties involved.
While it does not increase the availability of funds for local governments, this option provides a better alignment of revenue sources with funding uses.
Assuming DHS's funding needs are similar to past years, there would be enough state MVLT (license plate fee) revenue available to replace the amount of gas tax receipts that DHS currently receives.
Using 1999 revenue figures and 1998 cost figures, the table below presents an example of how state motor vehicle license tax revenues, currently going to local governments, could be affected under this option.

Table 1E shows there would be approximately $156 million less state MVLT revenue available for distribution to local governments, but this amount would be replaced with $156 million in MVFT (license plate fee) revenues.
To maintain revenue neutrality for specific jurisdictions, the gas ta x funding would have to be distributed in the same way as current state MVLT revenues are distributed.
The relationship between this alternative and any potential future increase in the state motor vehicle license tax might need to be considered jointly.

This would in no way affect permissiv e local motor vehicle license taxes.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Funding Shift Advantages As proposed, this alternative could be implemented in a revenue neutral manner for local governments and DHS Would not require any fee increases for the public Disadvantages Would shift funding from a source provided by in -state and out-of-state residents (all of whom benefit from Department of Public Safety activities) to only in -state residents Could require the Department of Public Safety to potentially request fee increases over time if additional revenues are required to support programs From an agency perspective, this option may be considered a disadvantage because increasing a flat fee like the MVLT to meet additional needs cannot be done without additional governmental authority
From an oversight perspective, this option may be considered an advantage in that flat fee increases , such as increasing the MVLT , cannot be adjusted to meet additional needs without additional governmental authority Would more closely tie motor fuel taxes directly to construction and maintenance of transportation projects Would shift funding source to the agency that determines expenditure plans (Department of Public Safety) and eliminates the inter-agency competition for motor vehicle fuel tax revenues
Option 3.2: Increase certain fees to help reduce DHS 's use of gas tax revenues Certain DHS fees could be increased and the additional revenues could be used to pay for some or all of DHS ' expenses currently funded with MVFT revenues.
Such fee change s could free- up gas tax revenue that could then be distributed to local governments.
The Department of Public Safety is responsible for assessing a wide variety of fees.
The following three fees are simply examples to consider for a modest increase.
The current fee, a suggested increase, and the amount of revenue that would be generated from that increase are presented below.
In total, such changes could result in total additional revenues of $39 million per year.
Title Fee Increase : If the current title fee were increased from $5 to $10, approximately $34 million in additional revenue could be generated annually.
Driver Abstract Fee: Increasing this $2 fee by $1 to $3 could generate additional revenue of approximately $4 million per year.
14
Commercial Traile r Fee: Increasing this $25 fee to $30 could result in additional revenues of approximately $1 million annually.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Increasing Fees Advantages Would more closely tie a portion of motor fuel taxes directly to construction and maintenance transportation projects Disadvantages Would shift funding from a source provided by in -state and out-of-state residents (all of whom benefit from Department of Public Safety activities) to only in -state residents Would require the Department of Public Safety to potentially request fee incre ases over time if additional revenues are required to support programs From an agency perspective, this option may be considered a disadvantage because flat fee increases cannot be adjusted to meet additional needs without additional governmental authority Would increase fees paid by the public
Would shift some additional funding responsibilities to the Department of Public Safety that determines expenditure plans and reduce some of the inter-agency competition for motor vehicle fuel tax revenues From an oversight perspective, this option may be considered an advantage in that flat fee increases cannot be adjusted to meet additional needs without additional governmental authority
Option 3.3: Chang e the distribution of certain fine revenue In FY 1999, the State of Ohio received over $6 million in fine revenue.
Generally speaking, current law requires that 45 percent of any fine revenue resulting from a state law violation be deposited into the state's General Revenue Fund.
8 If all of these funds were distributed directly to DHS to support daily operations, there would be a reduced need for gas tax revenues and ultimately more money could be made available for distributions to local governments.
Under ORC 4501.11, four different Department of Public Safety budget line items receive funding from a portion of the collected fines: Â· Â· Â· Â· 764 764 761 764 607, 626, 667, 617, State Fair Security State Fairground Police Force Security Assessment Security and Inve stigations
Table 1F below provides a six- year summary of Total Fine Revenue and Distributions to the Department of Public Safety.
From FY 1994 to FY 1999, total costs for the above line items have ranged from $2.6 million to $5.8 million.
This data suggests that State Patrol is using a larger portion of GRF fine revenue over time, and it may make sense to distribute these revenues directly to the department .
8
The specific distributions are detailed under ORC 5503.04 .

Fiscal Year 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 6-Year Average
Advantages and Disadvantages of Changing Fine Distribution Formulas Advantages More fine revenue could reduce DHS dependency on the MVFT and could free up additional revenues to fund local government transportation needs Provides a more direct link between Public Safety-generated revenues and Public Safetyrelated expenditures A large percentage of fines currently support State Patrol purposes, therefore, it may be reasonable to direct all of these revenues to pay for State Patrol operations Disadvantages Reduces the amount of incoming GRF revenue directly attributable to violations of state law.
However any reduction may be mitigated by a similar reduction in GRF allocations to DHS Possible public perception concern because the Highway Patrol would be directly benefiting from fine revenue generated as a result of Patrol arrests
Option 4: Increase the State Motor Vehicle License Tax (license plate fee) Ohio has not increased the state's share of the motor vehicle license tax since 1980.
Increasing the state fee could provide additional revenues for local government transportation purposes.
For example, if a $5 increase were enacted, approximately $58 million in new reve nue could be generated and dedicated for local government infrastructure uses.
If the new revenues were equally divided among all counties, an average of about $659,000 per county would be distributed annually.
If equally divided among Ohio's 2,260 municipalities and townships, an average of $25,700 per municipality and township would be distributed per year.
16
Advantages and Disadvantages of Increasing the State Motor Vehicle License Tax Advantages State MVLT has not been increased in 20 years Disadvantages The amount paid is not tied to use, like the motor fuel tax, therefore all vehicle owners will pay the same flat rate regardless of how much they actually use local roads Local governments are best able to determine their needs and revenues should be raised only when additional funds are needed Makes the tax more regre ssive by raising everyone's fee the same amount From a local government perspective, flat fee increases cannot be adjusted to meet additional needs with additional governmental authority MVLT is only paid by state residents and does not require additional funds be paid by residents from other states who use Ohio's infrastructure and thus contribute to Ohio's transportation needs
Statewide revenues could be distributed to local governments that lack the capacity to raise revenues on their own Easily implemented and easily understood method for raising revenue From an oversight perspective, flat fee increases my be advantageous because they cannot be adjusted to meet additional needs without additional governmental authority
Option 5: Convert to a New Vehicle Registration (license plate) Fee System Currently, owners of passenger automobiles in Ohio must pay a flat $20 annual vehicle registration fee.
Over half of the states in the U.S. have this kind of "flat- rate" registration fee for automobiles.
In comparison, nearly all 50 states have a weight- based registration fee system for trucks.
Flat automobile registration fees vary throughout the country.
For example, Kentucky charges a fee of $11.50 while Illinois charges a $24 fee.
9 Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Oklahoma use vehicle value in the calculation of passenger vehicle registration fees.
10 States have implemented four basic options for assessing registration fees (t hese options can be combined and fee amounts can be indexed to increase on a regular basis): Â· Â· Â· Â· Flat fee Fee based upon the age of the vehicle Fee based upon vehicle weight Value - based fee
For example, a value- based registration system for automobiles would require owners to pay an annual registration fee based upon the value of the vehicle.
A fee schedule would be used to determine the fee, based upon each increment of value.
One value - based option would have fees ranging from $20 to $50, depending upon the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) and 9

the age of the vehicle.
Cars of the current model year would pay the full fee with the fee decreasing 10% per year to a 50% minimum level.
Cars five years or older in the first year of implementation could be grand fathered in and charged a flat fee or the sixth- year fee in the fee schedule.
The minimum fee would be $20.
Table 1G below presents one possible example for how a value - based fee schedule might be structured and calculated.

In 1996, the state of Wisconsin estimated the amount of additional revenue that would be generated by switching from a $40 flat fee to a value - based fee, but with fees ranging from $40 to $100.
The state of Wisconsin estimated that it could generate an additional $8 million in 1997 if it changed from a flat fee to value- based fee with a schedule increase similar to the example schedule presented above.
Wisconsin estimated that over the next decade the additional revenue generated would increase by an average of 15 percent to $30 million in 2006.
11 Assuming that Ohio would realize a similar percentage increase in its automobile registration revenue if it went to a value based system with fees ranging from $20 to $50, Ohio could expect to raise amounts significantly higher than these estimates for Wisconsin, as Ohio has more than twice as many registered automobiles than Wisconsin.
12 However, the actual revenue generated could vary widely depending upon the particular system implemented.

Alternatives for State Level Implementation Â­ Cost Savings Measures Option 6: Develop Statewide Pavement Management Guidelines In order to maximize resources used to maintain local roads, a set of statewide pavement management guidelines could be developed to aid local governments.
Effective pavement management includes performing preventive maintenance that can add 5 to 10 years of life to existing pavement surfaces, resulting in significant cost savings.
14 A committee of local government officials , experts, and interested parties, chaired by ODOT, could be convened to develop pavement management guidelines and other road and bridge maintenance standards.
When the standards are agreed to, the General Assembly could set aside funding to support a pavement management pilot program, with selected cities and counties participat ing. 15 ODOT and the local governments in the pilot program would work together to evaluate the usefulness and the financial benefits of the se preventive maintenance standards and report their findings to the General Assembly.
Once the standards are finalized, local governments seeking Public Works Commission funding also could be required to follow these standards in order to be eligible to receive funds.

Adapted from Final Report: Transportation Finance Study Committee, State of Wisconsin, pp. 54- 55, 1996.
According to a study conducted by the Michigan Department of Transportation cited in Innovative Concepts for Preventive Maintenance, July 29, 1997, pg. 10) 15 The state of Michigan began its preventive maintenance program with $12 million annually .
19
Advantages and Dis advantages of Developing Pavement Management Guidelines Advantages Help ensure that local governments are using the best techniques for managing local infrastructure Could result in long term cost savings Could help maximize benefits from dollars spent and improve condition of infrastructure Disadvantages Will require a lengthy and time consuming effort on the part of ODOT and local governments Would require up -front expenditures to develop Another mandate on local governments
Alternatives for Local Level Implementation Â­ Additional Revenue Option 7: Increase the Cap on Local Motor Vehicle License Tax (license plate fee) Current law effectively caps the amount of local motor vehicle license tax (LMVLT) that may be charged at $20 per registration.
Increasing this cap could allow local governments to generate additional revenue to meet their transportation needs.
There are endless possibilities for how the current MVLT system could be changed and the tax increased.
Two possibilities are presented here.
Under either scenario , total LMVLT fees would not be allowed to exceed $40, thus making the total MVLT fee no more than $60 across the state.
1.
Local governments could be permitted to assess additional $5 levies up to an additional maximum of $20, bringing the total possible assessment to 40 dollars.
Under this scenario all local governments could raise additional revenue if an additional levy were approved.
This option would keep the structure of the current MVLT system in place.
2.
Each county, township, or municipality could be permitted to enact up to two $5 levies, regardless of the levies other local have governments already enacted.
In addition to generating more revenue for local governments, this alternative would greatly simplify a system that is very complex.
This alternative could work as follows: Â· Â· Â· Counties could enact one or two additional $5 levies that would total no more than $10, with all revenues being distributed to the county.
Municipalities could enact one or two additional $5 levies that would total no more than $10, with all revenues being distributed to the municipality.
Townships would also be able to enact one or two additional $5 levies that would total no more than $10, with all revenue being distributed to the township.
20
Tables 1H and 1I illustrate potential maximum revenues that may be generated if all local government units enact either a $5.00 or $10.00 additional lev y for a total increase of either $10.00 or $20.00.
While the tables show the revenue that could be gaine d if local governments could enact additional levies, it is very unlikely that this amount would be raised.
It is more likely that only a portion of local governments will choose to enact additional levies.
Past history supports this assumption.
For exa mple, between the years 1988 and 2000, on average, 38 of 88 counties, 141 of 984 municipalities, and 301 of 1,309 townships have enacted at least one of their local levy options.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Permitting Additional Local License Plate Tax Levies Advantages Would allow local governments to raise additional revenues for transportation purposes , could be particularly beneficial to certain highly populated jurisdictions.
Could provide for a less complex system of raising MVLT revenue Existing funding mechanism previously approved by the state and some local governments Disadvantages Not likely to be used by many local governments, particularly less populous jurisdictions
Would result in motor vehicle license fee increases to the public

Option 8: Allow Counties to Enact a Local Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax for Bridge Replacement and Repair During investigation for this report, LBO found that numerous county bridges are in need of repair or replacement, and funding to address this problem is currently unavailable.
Of the 25,898 bridges maintained by counties, approximately 16% (or 4,143 bridges) were reported to the Public Works Commission (PWC) as being in poor or critical condition.
This finding concerned LBO staff because the failure of a road in critical condition would be dangerous but not life threatening; the failure of a bridge in critical condition could endanger the lives of the general citizenry.
Therefore, the following funding option permits a dedicated revenue source for county bridge repair.
The state currently collects a 22 cents per gallon excise tax on motor vehicle fuel.
As stated in Part Three of this report, a portion of this tax is provided to local governments for general infrastruc ture needs.
Option 2 discussed increasing the state gas tax to increase that source of revenue.
This funding option suggests a change in statute to permit counties to enact a local, one cent gas tax (in addition to the state excise tax) solely for the purpose of replacing and repairing county bridges.
If all counties in the state exercised the right to increase the motor fuel excise tax by one - cent, all counties together could raise between $58 and $64 million per year.
Table 1J below shows the additional revenue increase over a four - year period.
16 Unfortunately, county fuel consumption figures are not readily available to LBO and, therefore, it is difficult to determine how much specific counties could generate.
Table 1J: Estimated additional motor fuel tax revenues at higher excise tax rates, FY02-05 (Millions of Dollars) Tax rate 23 cents/gallon FY2002 $58.5 FY2003 $60.3 FY2004 $62.2 FY2005 $63.7
One concern about this funding option would be the tendency of some fuel purchases to shift to counties not exercising the local one - cent option.
Although this is possible for people residing on the border, it would appear that the majority of the county would not notice the one - cent difference relative to all other possible fluctuations in the price of fuel.
Driving to another county to save a few cents would not result in a true savings to the individual.
As discussed in Part Two of this report, one estimate for need is the information self- reported by political subdivisions to the PWC. 17 Based on this PWC data, LBO estimates a county need of $57.8 million for bridges in critical condition and $220.3 million for bridges in poor condition.
16
Please note that this option is independent of the previous discussion that would increase the state motor fuel tax from 23 to 26 cents per gallon.
If this local option were exercised to raise the motor fuel tax to 27 cents per gallon, less additional funds would be raised because some people would consume less fuel.
Fuel consumption is relatively inelastic so this decrease would be small.
17 Please see Part 2 for a greater discussion of need as estimated by LBO based on PWC data.
22
Although a number of sources of revenue can be used to address this need, a dedicated local tax option provides counties the ability to raise these funds as deemed necessary.
For some counties, bridge repair and replacement is the largest, single infrastructure item they have.
For example, Cuyahoga County is responsible for 24 road miles, due to the large amount of incorporated area in the county, but maintains ongoing responsibility for 209 bridges.
Of these bridges, 104 (or 50%) are currently reported to be in poor or critical condition.
According to PWC data, Cuyahoga County has no need for funds to fix any of its road miles but has a need around $71.0 million (reported January, 1999) to fix 104 poor and critical bridges within its boundaries.
As stated earlier, motor fuel consumption by county is not readily available, so LBO was unable to determine how much Cuyahoga County could raise if they exercised this local option.
In another example, Miami County is responsible for 436 road miles and 349 bridges.
The county reported that 16 road miles (or 4%) are in poor and critical condition (PWC, October, 1999).
The county also indicated it would cost $1.2 million to repair these 16 road miles.
Additionally, the county reported that 75 bridges (22% of the total) are in poor and critical condition.
To repair these 75 bridges, the county reports to the PWC that it will cost $12.3 million to bring the bridges to excellent condition.
Under this funding option, the county could choose to add the one - cent motor fuel excise tax until these 75 bridges are repaired or replaced.
Admittedly, most counties are not in the same situation as Cuyahoga County and are closer to the situation in Miami County.
If a county does not wish to exercise their local option strictly for bridges, then they would not have to pursue this funding option.
Most counties do have some poor and critical bridges and could use this dedicated source for a limited number of years and then allow the option to expire.
When significant bridge needs again resurface, the option can be reconsidered.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Permitting a Local Option Fuel Tax Advant ages Increases revenues for certain counties Permits counties to raise funds based on self-determined needs St able revenue source; less sensitive to small changes in tax rates May decrease growth of motor fuels consumption, thereby helping to reduce emission Disadvantages Increases tax burden of certain counties Increases motor fuel excise tax differential with some neighboring states and counties Increases the regressivity of the tax; lower- income citizens would spend a higher share of their income on transportation needs May decrease growth of motor fuels consumption, thereby reducing revenue growth Additional administrative costs in collecting fuel consumption data by county.
23
Alternatives for Local Level Implementation Â­ Cost Savings Actions Option 9: Permit Local Governments to Use Design-Build Process The design- build method is a way of consolidating the contracting and building process for public improvements.
It varies from the traditional process where the design- phase and the constructio n- phase of a project are bid separately.
This process can be quicker than traditional methods of bidding, and research has also suggested that it can be more cost efficient.
Under design- build, a single contract is sought and teams of design firms and cons truction contractors join forces to bid on a project, incorporating both design and construction elements in their proposal.
For certain types of projects, using design- build can result in a notable savings of time and cost.
In recent years, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) has used the design build process on certain projects.
In 1995, the General Assembly authorized use of the design build technique for state projects after federal legislation permitted federal moneys to be used on design- build projects.
18 Federal law stipulates that states may employ the design- build contracting technique for projects costing $50 million or more.
In fact, over 20 states have undertaken projects using design- build.
The use of a single contract can save a significant amount of time in the initial review, design, and construction of the project.
Whether or not design- build should be used on a project depends upon technical factors and the estimated price of the project.
Initial ODOT experience with six pilot projects using design- build suggests possible cost savings between 10% and 15%, and potential time saving of approximately 6 months.
The se pilot projects had relatively small contract amounts, ranging from $1 to $10 million.
However, with larger projects to be undertaken during FY 2000 and FY 2001, ODOT expects more significant time saving.
For example, ODOT anticipates that it will only take about 6 months from the point of a project's conception to the point when construction actually begins .
Under the traditional process, where the bidding and selection of firms for the design- phase and the build - phase occur separately, the time from project conception to the beginning of construction could take from 2 to 3 years.
In addition to these initial time and cost savings, ODOT expects to reduce the number of project delays result ing from fewer design/contractor issues.
Due to its positive experiences with design- build , ODOT has slated 15 such projects for FY 2000 and 14 for FY 2001.
The ideal design- build project is one that is free of any of the elements that would hamper an accelerated time line.
These include environmental documentation, right- of- way purchases, and utility relocation work.
ODOT currently includes Local Public Agencies in the design- build process by allowing the agency t include its project tasks in the contract under a separate o agreement.
Of course this separate agreement is funded 100% by the local government .
18
Six design-build pilot projects were authorized by the General Assembly in 1996.
In 1999 , ODOT was authorized to undertake construction projects utilizing design-build through June 2001, with a total contract amount not to exceed $250 million.
24
Enabling legislation would be required to allow townships and non- charter co unties to use design- build methods on local projects.
Counties and large cities are most likely to benefit from design- build, as they are more likely to have kinds of projects and the technical expertise needed to effectively use the process.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Design-Build Legislation Advantages Time savings in the project bidding process and less construction delays Cost savings for many projects , particularly for counties and large cities Disadvanta ges Design-build is not beneficial if hampered by unforeseen constructio n delays or for problematic projects Many projects may not benefit from the use of design-build and using the process could actually increase costs in certain instances
Option 10: Encourage Group Contracting with Counties Each year the Franklin County Engineer cooperates with townships in the county to bid one pavement maintenance contract.
In doing so, the townships are able to take advantage of the county engineer's expertise and obtain a better price on the cost of road maintenance work.
County government responses to the LBO survey suggest that local governments could save more than 15% through group contracting and bidding.
However, the survey data also show that over 50% of counties ha ve not participated in a group contract in the past five years.
The General Assembly could take several steps to encourage and facilitate this type of cooperation, which would enable the state, local governments, and Ohio citizens to get more for their money.
At a minimum, County Engineers could be required to permit townships to participate in group contracting for transportation related goods and services.
For example, if a township needed road resurfacing work to be done , it could seek to include its project work as part of the County's resurfacing project contract.
As counties have a long history of cooperating with townships on various issues and many counties already use group contracting in some form, implementing this provision should not be unduly burdensome.
A further expansion of this option would be to permit any village or small city to participate in group contracting with their respective county.
Small governments seem most likely to benefit from the expertise and purchasing power of the county because they have small contracts to bid and often do not have work to bid every year.
If enough local governments in a county participate in a group bid for goods or services, the county may also realize significant cost savings, and perhaps even additional income if allowed to charge an administrative fee to cover the cost of an expanded bidding process.
However, simply permitting small governments to take advantage of this option does not guarantee it will be used.
Therefore, the General Assembly could consider revising the Public
25
Works Commission (PWC) scoring process to award points to county and township projects bid as a group contract.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Group Contracting with Counties Advantages Due to economies of scale, participation s hould result in cost savings, therefore, maximizing the benefit received from state and local dollars spent Would empower local township officials to work with the county when beneficial Disadvantages Creates a new mandate for county engineers
Will not ensure that local governments are taking advantage of the time and cost savings that often result from group bidding
Counties could be permitted to charge a fee to cover administrative costs Many counties already engage in group contracting with townships suggesting that it is a workable option
II.
Possible Changes in the Allocation of State Resources to be More Responsive to Local Needs
Observations: Ohio's Current Transportation Finance System Option 11: Improving the Responsiveness of State Funding to Local Need Because need developed to answer to this be considered needs.
is such a subjective term and the possible methods of distribution that could be respond to local needs are limitless, LBO does not attempt to offer a definitive question.
However, some guidance can be offered regarding which factors should in developing a method of distributing resources that is more responsive to local
Many aspects of Ohio's current distribution methods make no attempt to account for need.
State revenue distributions initially allocate funding based upon type of government (i.e. county, municipality, township), which has little direct bearing on infrastructure need or repair costs.
For example, cities are lumped with villages as municipalities for initial fund allocations, despite the fact that the cities have much greater needs than villages.
The current system treats villages and cities similarly even though their circumstances are not at all similar.
Also, within governme nt type, allocations for townships and counties too often do not account for any measure of need.
A system maximally responsive to need would have an infrastructure focus.
Such a system would allocate money largely based upon some measure of need or cost, not based upon political jurisdiction.
If the General Assembly wanted to provide funding to local governments in fiscal
26
distress or with limited taxing capacity, using some measure of community transportation needs and some measure of fiscal distress could accomplish this task.
Obviously, certain need criteria will have advantages over other need criteria.
For example, allocating funds based on the number of motor vehicle registrations rewards more populous communities, which are likely to have more roads to maintain and more daily traffic (which hastens the deterioration of infrastructure).
However, this measure does not take into account non- resident traffic, which can be significant for some local jurisdictions, particularly at the county level.
Also, more populous communities may be better able to raise their own revenue relative to less populous jurisdictions; thus, less populated jurisdictions might require relatively more state assistance.
Because different measures of need reflect different priorities, a maximally responsive system should encompass more than one measure of need to allocate funds.
For example, such a system could allocate a portion of funding based on road miles, a portion based on bridge feet maintained, some based on a road condition rating, and some based on registrations, etc.
While a mix of need criteria can help balance out the advantages and disadvantage of specific measures, it is also important to be sure that the measures chosen can be fairly easily collected and are comparable across jurisdictions.
Presumably, a system could be designed that is significantly more responsive to local needs (allocating funds based upon at least two or more measures of need) and yet is less complex than the current distribution system.
Listed below are some commonly used measures of need, with a brief description of their advantages and disadvantages.
Number of Lane Miles/Bridge Feet : This criterion closely measures of the amount of infrastructure requiring periodic maintenance.
The criterion does not measure the condition of a road or bridge, the traffic volume on the infrastructure, or other factors affecting maintenance costs.
Also, it provides no information regarding the need for new or expanded infrastructure, nor does it reveal if the road or bridge is actually necessary.
Data using the number of lane miles/bridge feet is already collected, and should be fairly easy to aggregate or compare across jurisdictions.
However, lane mile data likely would need to be verified by the state.
Average Daily Traffic Volume (ADTV): This criterion highlights road or bridge activity, which relates to the level of wear and tear occurring daily.
Traffic counts help determine the need for road maintenance and road upgrades, when needed, but this measure is just one of many criteria (truck traffic, weather, topography, road condition, etc.) that impact road maintenance costs.
ODOT provides ADTV data for local roads to the Federal Highway Administration, although the reliability of that information is uncertain.
However, other more reliable and readily available data, such as vehicle registrations or population in a given jurisdiction, could serve as a rough proxy for this measure.
Road/Bridge Condition : This measure reflects both one - time revenue needs and on- going maintenance needs.
As road or bridge conditions worsen, on- going maintenance costs, as well as
27
rehabilitation or reconstruction costs, increase.
the amount of infrastructure maintained.
19
This measure says nothing about use or about
Comprehensive (and relatively standardized) bridge data exist, including condition and maintenance responsibilities across local jurisdictions.
Therefore, incorporating a "bridge condition" measure into any distribution of funds intended for bridges would be relatively easy.
Unfortunately, Ohio currently lacks the use of a common standard or method to assess road condition on a statewide basis.
This void prohibits the comparison of road conditions among jurisdictions.
This would require conducting a statewide inve ntory of all local roads; an expensive, 2- 3 year process at best.
Still, with the help of technology, comparable condition ratings can be developed using pavement management software system that could be made available to local governments.
LBO survey data suggest that the average start- up cost of such a system could be about $48,000 and average on- going costs to assess road condition could be about $25,000 per year.
Costs vary widely depending upon the number of road miles to maintain.
Road Classification : This measure identifies a road's purpose or type.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) system for classifying roads, called the National Functional Classification, aids governments in infrastructure planning.
20 Used since the 1960s, this classification system, or NFC, categorizes each road according to its function, along a scale of long- distance mobility and local property access.
(Most roads perform some of both functions).
Roads are also designated as urban or rural, based on federal aid urban bo undaries established for places with a population of 5,000 or more.
Spacing and density criteria used to classify roads differ between urban and rural systems.
The major classifications are: Arterials : Roads that contribute most to statewide or regional mobility.
Interstate freeways, other freeways, and principal and minor arterials fall into this category.
All arterials are designated as urban or rural, depending upon location.
Collectors : Roads that balance mobility and local property access functions.
Specific classifications are urban collectors, rural major collectors, and rural minor collectors.
Local- Access : Roads that provide access to property, almost exclusively.
The NFC is used to determine whether a road is eligible for federal aid.
Eligible roads include all principal and minor arterials, urban collectors, rural major collectors, and rural minor collectors.
21 Ohio could follow a similar strategy by directing aid based upon road classification.
Funding by classification for each mile of road ca n direct money toward roads based upon usage and purpose.
For example, the General Assembly could choose to direct state funding only to roads that contribute to statewide mobility, and specifically exclude roads dedicated solely for local property access.
19
Using condition ratings could reward poor management by giving money to those local governments with the worst roads and bridges, even if the condition of the roads is largely the result of poor management.
On the other hand poor road conditions can also indicate an inability to raise local revenue to supplement state funding.
20 More information on the National Functional Classification by local government type is presented Part 2.
21 Adapted from the Report of the Michigan Act 51 Transportation Funding Study Committee, June 1, 2000, pg. 81.
28
The NFC for each mile of Ohio's local roads is readily available through ODOT, although the data may require verification to ensure that the classifications are correctly applied and updating to make sure that it is comparable among jurisdictions.
Also, the state might want to develop additional classifications under the local- access classification if the General Assembly wanted to fund some, but not all, roads classified as local- access roads.
Improve the Availability and Use of Information Option 12: Create an Annual State of the Local Transportation System Report While conducting this study, it became apparent to LBO that there is a dearth of comparable and reliable data regarding the condition of local roads and bridges, and regarding local funding used for transportation purposes.
In fact, current local "own- source" funding amounts reported by Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to the Federal Highway Administration may be greatly underestimated.
To help remedy this deficiency, ODOT could issue an annual report on the state of local transportation system in Ohio.
It could be done in conjunction with the annual State of the State Transportation System Report that it currently issues, which focuses largely on the state- maintained transportation system.
A local transportation system report could provide information on the condition of local roads and bridges, and the available funding for local transportation infrastructure.
As a public document, the report could be an informative and useful tool for legislators and other decisionmakers, and a reliable source of historical data for local officials and the public.
The report would complete the picture of transportation infrastructure across the state, filling the current void of information on local infrastructure.
In addition, compiling the report each year would enable ODOT to more effectively meet certain federal reporting requirements.
ODOT could coordinate efforts with the Public Works Commission (PWC) to obtain road and bridge condition data for the vast majority of local governments in the state.
ODOT could randomly sample local governments that did not have to report data to PWC.
To fill some of the information voids, ODOT may choose to survey local governments to obtain more specific local transportation finance data or other relevant information.
LBO experience in surveying local governments for this study suggests that local governments would need to be legally required to respond to any ODOT survey instruments in order to collect the necessary data for a local transportation system report.
29
Advantages and Disadvantages of Requiring an Annual Report On the State of the Local Transportation System Advantages Enhances ODOT's ability to meet federal reporting requireme nts Could help to educate local officials, the public, and others about transportation revenue sources and expenditure s Legislators would have access to important information about the condition and funding of the public roads Disadvantages Requires additional cost and effort for ODOT to collect data and publish a new report Local governments will have to complete additional paperwork.
Option 13: Increase Coordination between Public Works Commission's District Integrating Committees and Municipal Planning Organizations The Public Works Commission (PWC) allocates about $141 million per year for local road and bridge projects.
Actual funding decisions are made by District Public Works Integrating Committees (DPWICs) composed of local government officials.
The DPWICs accept project applications from local governments wishing to receive funding.
The n, committee members rank the ir district projects based on ten criteria established in the Ohio Revised Code.
To assist the DPWIC and the PWC application review process, inp ut from Municipal Planning Organizations (MPOs), with jurisdiction's overlapping a DPWIC district, could be helpful.
MPOs could review the government proposals, evaluate these requests, and provide their own funding preferences based on regional transportation needs.
This input could be taken into account by the DPWIC before preparing their project rankings for the PWC.
When the DPWIC submits its funding recommendations to the PWC for approval, the MPO's report could also be presented to the PWC for review.
Collaboration at the district level will help the DPWIC members better understand regional transportation concerns and support projects that are of most benefit to the entire region covered by each DPWIC.
Advantages and Disadvantages of MPO Collaboratio n with DPWIC Applications Advantages Provides the DPWIC a list of preferences and other information on the needs within the PWC district, which may not be not included in requests prepared by local governments Provides the PWC additional information it can use to evaluate project rankings Disadvantages The MPO will provide staff f review or and provide recommendations without any compensation to the organization Individual disagreements between the MPO and DPWIC members over preferences may strain other matters of importance to the MPO that are controlled by DPWIC members
Provides the MPO an avenue to provide input into the use of a regionally -funded state program
30
Clarify or Enhance Local Government Resource Options Option 14: Formalize Municipal Paving Policy for Certain State Routes Although the legal responsibility belongs to municipalities, the Ohio Department of Transportation currently pays for about 80% of the costs for paving state routes within municipal jurisdictions through its Urban Pa ving Initiative.
Responses to the LBO Transportation Survey suggest that some municipalities think that ODOT should pay the full cost for maintaining these routes.
At one point in the past, ODOT considered reducing the amount of support provided for state routes within municipalities, although for this biennium, ODOT is committed to current funding levels.
Still, the disagreement over this issue suggests a role for the General Assembly to ensure that the policy appropriately considers and is responsive to both local and state transportation needs.
The General Assembly could address this issue during the biennial budget process by working with ODOT and municipalities to determine an appropriate state policy for maintaining state routes within municipal jurisdictions.
Language specifying the policy could then be included in temporary language in the transportation budget bill each biennium.
Addressing this on a biennial basis would help ensure that the policy changes as local and state needs change.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Formalizing ODOT's Municipal Paving Policy Advantages Provides formal on-going review of the policy so that it can be adapted, as appropriate, with Legislative input Local governments will have a predictable revenue source each biennium Disadvantages Limits ODOT's discretion to adapt this policy on a more short -term basis, as needs may dictate
31
Option 15: Expand the Use of Gas Tax and License Plate Revenues to Include Mass Transit Section 5a of Article XII of the Ohio Constitution restricts the use of state motor vehicle license and fuel taxes to highway- related purposes, effectively prohibiting the use of these moneys for mass transit.
This constitutional restriction limits the options both state and local officials may use to meet the transportation needs of Ohio.
The General Assembly could pass a joint resolution to eliminate the constitutional prohibition on spending gas tax revenue for public transportation purposes, so that local officials would have all transportatio n options available to them when making decisions concerning the transportation needs of their communities.
Similarly, eliminating this prohibition would also give the General Assembly more discretion when considering how to spend gas tax revenue for local and state purposes.
Allowing all types of transportation projects to compete for gas tax revenues could create a more competitive process, permitting a wider consideration of the most effective strategies for meeting transportation needs.
While this cha nge might result in less funding for roads and bridges, the overall result could be a more efficient and better quality transportation system for Ohio residents.
In some communities and areas, funding an effective public transportation project, in lieu of a road or bridge project, may have the effect of reducing congestion on roads and bridges.
In turn, this would improve the efficiency of the overall transportation system, reduce the rate of deterioration of road and bridge infrastructure, and reduc e the a mount needed for road maintenance and new road construction.
Because all modes would be competing for the same dollars, any public transportation project would have to demonstrate to state and/or local decision makers that its benefits outweigh the benefit s of other projects.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Allowing Gas Tax Revenues to Pay for Public Mass Transit Advantages Disadvantages
Allows greater flexibility in the use of gas tax revenue May provide additional funding for transit projects and operations Improving mass transit services and facilities could increase ridership and reduce wear on current infrastructure Ideally, would result in a more efficient and effective allocation of funds for local transportation systems
Spending more money on transit would reduce spending for other transportation projects Gas tax moneys spent on mass transit would not directly benefit payers of the gas tax Increased mass transit ridership would result in decreased MVFT revenue Costs to educate public about and advertise a ballot initiative

Part 2 Local Government Needs for Roads and Bridges This part of the report examines the need for additional resources to meet local government transportation "needs."
The first section of Part 2 presents information on current road and bridge maintenance responsibilities and discusses factors that impact the cost of maintaining those roads and bridges.
The remaining sections of Part 2 present various estimates of the dollar amount of local government need.
Becaus e of data limitations and the subjective nature of defining needs, LBO does not claim to offer a definitive answer to the need question.
However, LBO believes that the various estimates do provide some insight into the magnitude of local government need in terms of: Â· One time costs to repair all poor and critical roads and bridges Â· On- going annual additional funding required for maintenance and construction as would be self- reported by local governments Â· On- going cost to maintain current roads Maintenance Responsibilities It seems appropriate to begin the discussion of local need, in regard to roads and bridges, by examining current road and bridge responsibilities.
Assessing who is responsible for how much can provide insight into the cost of maintaining current infrastructure.
In addition, there are many factors that impact the rate of deterioration of a road mile or a bridge that significantly impact costs.
It is necessary to have some understanding of the cost of adequately maintaining current infrastructure and who must pay those costs to be able to determine amount of need and where the need is located.
Who's Responsible for Ohio's Roads? Chart 2A below illustrates the responsibilities for Ohio's public roads, showing how many lane miles of road eac h local government type is responsible for maintaining.
The chart shows that townships have the most lane miles of road responsibility at over 80,000 lane miles and counties are second with responsibility for over 58,000 miles.
Cities are responsible for just less than half as many miles as townships with more than 45,000 and villages are responsible for less than 10,000 lane miles of road.
By comparison, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is responsible for about 48,201 lane miles of road.

Factors Affecting the Cost of Local Road Responsibilities At this point, it might seem local government should fall for maintaining.
In fact, this beginning in assessing costs.
receives, which is commonly reasonable to assume that the relative maintenance costs of each directly in- line with the amount of road miles they are responsible may not be the case.
Knowing road responsibilities is only the One critical factor that impacts cost is the level of use the road measured in terms of average daily traffic volume (ADTV).
The level and type of traffic expected to occur on a given mile of road impacts the design chosen when constructing the road and subsequently the materials used in the road.
Basically, the higher the expected ADTV the more expensive the design and materials used in the road will be.
Also, the cost to repair the road will be higher, as more expensive materials will be needed.
Actual ADTV also directly impacts maintenance costs, because the higher the ADTV the more quickly a given road mile will deteriorate and the more expensive that mile of road will be to maintain.
Therefore, it is necessary to examine the ADTV on the miles of road maintained by each government type to accurately assess costs.
Unfortunately, ADTV data for local roads is not readily available.
Fortunately, there are indirect measures that permit an assessment of ADTV and costs associated with it.
One such measure is the National Functional Classification (NFC).
Used since the 1960s, functional classification categorizes each road according to its function, along a scale between long- distance mobility and local property access (Most roads perform some of both functions).
The major classifications are listed below.
34
Arterials : Roads that contribute most to statewide or regional mobility.
Interstate freeways, other freeways, and principal and minor arterials fall into this category.
All arterials are designated as urban or rural, depending upon location.
Collectors : Roads that balance mobility and local property access functions.
Specific classifications are urban collectors, rural major collectors, and rural minor collectors.
Local- Access : Roads that provide access to property, almost exclusively.
Under the NFC system, roads are also designated as urban or rural based on the federal aid urban boundary.
Federal- aid urban boundaries are established administratively for places with a population of 5,000 or more.
Spacing and density criteria for classifying roads differ between urban and rural systems.
23 These road classifications suggest the level and type of traffic that one can expect on a given road mile.
Essentially, the classifications that indicate the highest mobility suggest the highest ADTV, including higher levels of traffic by heavy vehicles that do the most damage to roads.
For example, no roads in Ohio classified as local- access have an ADTV above 10,000 vehicles.
Therefore, it is likely to be significantly more expensive to construct and maintain a road classified as an arterial than one classified as local access.
Also, an urban road of any classification will likely be more costly to maintain than a rural road mile of the same classification because the urban road mile, by definition, has more traffic.
Therefore, local governments with more arterials and collectors are likely to have much higher costs per lane mile, as are local governments in urban areas.
With this in mind, Table 2A shows road mile responsibilities by functional classification.

35
Table 2A figures show that, although townships have the most miles to maintain, counties and municipalities have the most arterials and collectors, which are the most expensive roads to build and maintain.
In fact, municipalities and counties are responsible for nearly 97% of the arterials and major collectors, while 82% percent of municipal roads and 67% of county roads are classified as local- access roads.
Conversely, over 98% of all the miles townships maintain are classified as local access road miles, the least expensive roads to construct and maintain because they require less expensive designs, materials, and have much less traffic.
In fact, nearly 20% of Ohio's local- access road miles are unpaved; with the vast majority of those located in rural areas.
25 The road responsibility and classification data suggest that cost per lane mile for maintenance is likely to be significantly higher for counties and municipalities, with the higher municipal costs likely falling on cities.
Village costs per lane mile are likely to be more similar to townships than cities.
However, road maintenance responsibilities are only part of the picture in attempting to determine maintenance costs, as local governments' bridges responsibilities are also significa nt. Who's Responsible for Ohio's Bridges? Ohio has roughly 43,000 bridges, approximately 28,000 of which are maintained by local governments.
As shown in Chart 2B below, counties are responsible for maintaining about 26,000 bridges or 90% of all local br idges.
Cities are responsible for over 1,500 bridges and townships and villages 90 and 500, respectively.
By comparison, the state is responsible for about 14,930 bridges.
These figures suggest that county bridge costs are quite significant.
Undoubtedly county bridge maintenance costs far exceed those of other local governments, and perhaps even those of the state.
As with roads, there are many factors that impact costs including bridge design, material composition, ADTV, age, size, etc.
Even more than for roads, these factors vary so greatly from bridge to bridge that it is difficult to compare one bridge to another.
However, ODOT bridge data suggests that, in general, counties and cities maintain the largest and most costly local bridges.

Implication of Road and Bridge Responsibilities Together, the road and bridge data suggest that counties' and cities' maintenance responsibilities are likely the highest and township costs are likely significantly more than village costs.
However, this information only hints at costs and is far from providing guidance on additional needs.
Another important factor in assessing maintenance costs is the condition of each road mile and each bridge.
Data on the condition of roads and bridges is presented in the next section.
The remaining sections of the Part 2 attempt to quantify the cost or need suggested by the responsibility data presented here.
Need and Cost Estimates Additional Need Reported in LBO Survey LBO Survey Responses About Need LBO surveyed over 1,000 local governments, including all cities, counties, and townships with populations over 5,000, as to their transportation revenues, prioritizing, needs, and opinions on state funding.
26 In the survey, LBO asked local governments if current state and local funding for roads and bridges was sufficient, and, if not, how much total additional funding was required per year.
Table 2B summarizes the responses to the additional need question.
26
A copy of the survey instrument is provided in Appendix A and a detailed explanation of the survey and survey results are presented in Appendix B.

than of cities (13%), reported
Not surprisingly, a substantial majority of local governments reported that they did need additional funding.
As shown Table 2B, the 376 local governments that responded to the additional need question reported a total annual additional need of $433 million.
However, not all of the $433 million is needed from the state, as local governments reported that they could raise $72 million from local resources.
It is important to note that LBO does not know how local governments determined the additional need amount that they reported or the amount that could be raised locally.
The numbers reported may not have been determined reliably or precisely and almost certainly were not determined in a consistent manner from one governmental unit to another.
The amount of additional need reported varied enormously by government type (county, city, township, village) and between specific lo cal governments of each type.
For example, counties and cities reported additional need of $406 million, account ing for nearly the entire additional need amount.
28 However, Cuyahoga County reported additional need of $80 million, which represents almost 40% of the total amount reported by counties.
The next- highest reporting county was Medina, which reported needing an additional $5.3 million.
Similarly, Columbus and Cleveland accounted for almost 40% of the total need amount reported by the cities that responded.
Developing a Need Estimate Based Upon Survey Response s Developing a statewide need estimate requires accounting for the need of all local governments whether or not they responded to the survey.
Obviously, there must be some need beyond $433 27
There are approximately 2,348 local governments in Ohio including 88 counties and about 242 cities, 1,309 townships, and about 709 villages.
28 Cincinnati did not respond to the survey, and is therefore not included in the city total.
Other large cities not responding included Youngstown, Lorain, Hamilton, Kettering, Lakewood, and Mansfield.
Also, 20 counties did not respond to the survey, including three of the six largest Franklin, Summit, and Montgomery.
38
million on the part of the nearly 2,000 local governments, which either were not surveyed or did not respond to the survey.
Estimating this need in a statistically valid way is complicated by several issues that all relate to one essential question, "Does the need of the governments that did not respond to the survey differ in any systematic way from the need of those who did respond? " If the answer is no , then there is little difficulty.
I f there is some systematic difference then there may be no statistically valid way to project the additional need.
For example, s uppose most of the local governments that received the survey believed that an increase in state aid might result from reporting need in the survey.
If so, the local governments that have the greatest need would have the greatest incentive to return the survey.
Assuming that local government officials consider such incentives as they decide whether or not to complete a survey, the higher- need governments would be more likely to respond than the lower- need governments.
Therefore, the average need of the responding local governments would be greater than the average need of the non- respondents.
In such a case, simply using the average for the respondents to project the need of the non- respondents would overstate the need statewide.
In fact, LBO suspects that there are several factors, including the one explained in the above example, which make it more likely that local governments with above average need would respond to the survey.
Therefore, the estimates in the following table are likely an upper bound on local need.
Another factor that affects the development of a statewide need estimate from the survey responses is the response rate.
A low response rate seriously limits any general conclusions that can be drawn from survey data.
The previous table showed that 68 of 88 of count ies, or over 75%, responded to the survey.
The city response rate was also relatively high with 119 of 242 or nearly 50% responding.
In contrast, about one - third of surveyed villages and one- fourth of surveyed townships responded.
The low response from townships means that the additional need of non- responding townships cannot be estimated in any statistically valid way.
However, analysis of the characteristics of responding and non- responding villages indicates that it is possible to produce a statistically unbiased projection of statewide village need for additional funding.
Thus, a statewide projection for villages, based on an average of additional ne ed reported by villages that did respond to the survey, is shown in Table 2C.
Despite the relatively high response rate from cities and counties, projecting the ir statewide need is not a simple process because some of Ohio's most populo us cities and counties did not respond to the survey.
This is particularly problematic because statistical analysis of the survey respondents and their response to the need question shows that the reported need is positively related to popula tion.
This is not surprising because larger population centers likely require more roads and bridges and those roads and bridges endure more wear.
Because of this relationship, it is statistically invalid to p roject Franklin County's need, for example, based on an average because the population of Franklin County is several times higher than the statewide average population for counties.
S imilarly, it wo uld be invalid to project Cincinnati's need based on an average .
Table 2C below shows two estimates fo r annual additional local need developed from survey response data using two different methods.
The two methods are described below.
39
Table 2C: Statewide Estimated Annual Need Based on LBO Survey Responses29 (Millions of Dollars) Government Type Estimated Funding Gap Method 1 (Adjusted averages) Adjusted Averages Used in Method 1 * Estimated Funding Gap Method 2 (Statistical regression)
City County Village Total
$375.2 $238.7 $29.9 $643.8
$1.245 $1.845 $0.042
$342.7 $271.4 -$644.0**
*Reported average additional need per local government.
**Total includes Method 1 village estimate.
Explanation of Estimate Methods The statewide estimates labeled Method 1 in Table 2C begin with the actual need reported by all responding governments ( i.e., the $433.4 million reported in Table 2B), and add an amount based on adjusted averages to project need for all governmental units except Franklin County and Cincinnati.
30 The total for all counties and municipalities es timated using Method 1 is $643.8 million.
Figures for Franklin County and Cincinnati should be added to this total to obtain a reasonable total estimate.
A second method, Method 2, was used to estimate a complete statewide need estimate because The Method 1 approach, while relatively simple to understand does not allow the (statistically valid) inclusion of Franklin County or Cincinnati.
Method 2 overcomes this drawback by adjust ing for differences in local government characteristics.
Method 2 employs statistical regression techniques, rather than averages, to project the need of counties and cities that did not respond to the survey.
The regression equation used the reported funding gap as the dependent variable and population; total number of road miles, bridges, and culverts; average amount of snowfall in the county; and average wages for government workers in the county as independent variables.
The estimates resulting from the regression analysis should be statistically valid projections of the statewide need of county and city gove rnments.
Employing the statistical regression approach yields a need estimate of $614.1 million for cities and counties.
Adding in the Method 1 estimate for villages brings the total to $644.0 million.
It is important to note that the estimates provided by the two methods were derived by completely different approaches-- there is no implication that the combined need of Cincinnati
29
Method 1 total excludes Franklin County and the City of Cincinnati.
The adjusted averages used exclude Cuyahoga County from the calculation of the county average, and Columbus and Cleveland from the city average.
Only one figure, derived using the arithmetic average of survey respondents, was calc ulated for villages.
30 The arithmetic averages have been adjusted by excluding Cuyahoga County from calculation of the county average and excluding Cleveland and Columbus from the city average.
This method mirrors the exclusion of Franklin County and Cincinnati from the projected totals.
40
and of Franklin County is just $200,000.
In f act, the statistical regression approach yields estimates of $13.7 million for Cincinnati's need and $32.9 million for Franklin County's need.
31 The $644.0 million estimate is incomplete, of course, without an estimate for townships.
As shown in Table 2B above, the 117 townships that responded to the LBO survey reported an additional need of $24.6 million.
Although there is no statistically reliable way to arrive at a statewide estimate based on this survey result, this number can be used to arrive at a statewide estimate that is statistically unreliable.
Calculating statewide need for townships using an adjusted average approach, similar to Method 1 above, yields an estimate of $174.3 million.
32 This number should be viewed with a great deal of caution, however, because of the small sample size and the diversity among townships.
Based upon an estimate developed using self- reported survey response data, local governments in Ohio could need about $818 million in annual additional highway and bridge funding.
As discussed above, this figure is best interpreted as an upper bound --the true need i likely less s than $818 million.
33 Moreover, this figure does not take into account local resources.
Local governments stated in the survey that they could raise $72 million (about 16.7% of the total need) from local sources.
Reducing the $818 million estimate by $72 million would leave $746 million in net additional need that cannot be generated at the local level.
However, the actual amount that could be raised locally is likely more than $72 million statewide.
For example , if 16.7% of the statewide estimated need could be raised locally (the same percent reported by survey respondents), the net additional need estimate falls to $681 million.
Additional Need Reported to the Public Works Commission The Public Works Commission compiles data on transportation infrastructure from each local government that applies for PWC funding.
The data include an assessment of the condition of roads, bridges, and culverts in the local jurisdiction, and an estimate of the cost of restoring all such infrastructure to excellent condition.
The figures are produced by the local jurisdictions themselves, so the standards used to assess the condition of infrastructure likely var y from one local government to the next.
The data include assessments from all 88 counties, 240 cities, 855
31
It may seem reasonable to want to add these numbers to the $643.8 million from Column 1, yielding a statewide need figure of $690.4 million for counties and municipalities.
However doing so involves blending two fundamentally different approaches to calculating the statewide need.
The result likely significantly overstates local needs and is probably not valid.
Certainly if Franklin County or Cincinnati produced a figure for their actual need, however, that number could with validity be added to the $643.8 million.
32 In this case, the arithmetic average was adjusted by removing Colerain Township of Hamilton County from the computation of the township average.
Colerain Township reported a need of $10 millio n, which was over 40% of the total township need shown in Table 2C.
Since the second highest amount reported by a township was just $2 million, it would seem that the $10 million figure reported is not representative of township need statewide.
The $174.
3 million figure was found by multiplying this adjusted average need, $125,595, by the 1,308 townships other than Colerain Township, and adding Colerain Township's $10 million need to the result.

The assessments were completed in different years, with most
The figures provided to PWC by local governments should be viewed with some caution.
Presumably, there is an incentive for local governments to overstate their need, in terms of the cost of fixing infrastructure and the condition of infrastructure, to demonstrate more need for PWC funding than other communities.
Also, it is not known how local governments determined the repair costs figures for their infrastructure.
The numbers reported may not have been determined reliably or precisely and almost certainly were not determined in a consistent manner from one governmental unit to another.
For example, the city of Akron reported that it would cost over $2.1 million per road mile to bring all of its roads that were not in excellent condition up to excellent condition.
This figure is nearly twice that reported by the City of Cleveland, which reported the next - highest city per mile cost for repairing its roads.
This suggests that the Akron estimate is rather high and was likely derived using a very different method than any other city reporting to PWC.
Finally, there seems to be some double counting of infrastructure, with some villages and cities reporting statistics on bridges for which the county government has responsibility.
For example, several villages claimed that it would cost over $800,000 per bridge to fix bridges that are in fact a county responsibility, according to ODOT data.
Despite its limitations, the PWC data may give a broadly accurate picture of the cur rent condition of roads, bridges, and culverts in the state, and could be helpful in assessing the possibility that local governments need one - time assistance to repair and restore infrastructure that has deteriorated.
The data might also be he lpful in assessing ongoing financing needs of local governments.
Table 2D shows the total units of local road and brid ge infrastructure in the state, as reported to PWC, and statistics on its overall condition.
On the positive side, almost 60% of the bridges in the state and almost half of the roads and culverts are classified as being in either good or excellent condition.
Roughly 4% of the transportation infrastructure in Ohio was judged to be in critical condition.
About 17% of roads and culverts were judged to be in poor condition, while about 13% of bridges were judged by local governments to be critical.
There was not much variation in these numbers between the different types of jurisdiction.
For example, townships reported the highest percentage of critical roads (4.1%), villages reported the highest percentage of critical bridges (5.9%), and counties recorded the highest percentage of critical culverts (4.6 %).

Assessing Need from the PWC Data One useful place to begin examining need using PWC data would be to find the cost of fixing all of the critical infrastructure in the state, since a classification as "critical" suggests that safety may be an issue --especially in the case of bridges.
A natural progression then would be to determine the cost of fixing all of the poor infrastructure and so on.
Unfortunately, the nature of the data limits the ability to determine these numbers.
The cost figures reported by each jurisdiction are for all roads, bridges, etc.--regardless of their current state of repair.
The estimates shown below are therefore based on an unrealistic assumption--that one mile of critical road costs the same to bring up to excellent condition as one mile of good or fair road.
Thus, the estimates shown in Table 2E below are probably lower bounds on the true costs.
34 As shown in Table 2E below, it could cost approximately $527 million to raise infrastructure that is currently in critical condition to excellent condition.
Slightly over half of this amount is due to city roads, and about $116 million is needed by counties to fix roads and bridges.
The cost of improving infrastructure deemed to be in poor condition could be about $2,361 million.
Again, slightly over half of this amount is due to city roads.
Counties could need just over half a billion dollars to fix roads and bridges to excellent condition.

There are at least two possible ways to use these numbers: 1.
To determine a one - time supplement to existing so urces of funding to repair critical and/or poor to adequate condition with the assumption that existing sources of funding may be sufficient if local governments just had the funding to address the backlog of infrastructure repair.
The word "probably" is added to this sentence because it is plausible that the cost figures reported by local jurisdictions are inflated-- in order to attract more funding from the PWC. 34
43
2.
To determine an annual funding amount, with the assumption that existing funding is likely insufficient so that, even if the existing backlog of infrastructure judged critical and/or poor were dealt with, another backlog would develop.
To illustrate the first alternative, o ne option could be to supplement the usual funding sources by enough to improve all the critical infrastructure over a period of one or more year s. Based upon the estimates from Table 2E, it would cost about $176 million per year for three years to repair all critical infrastructure.
One way to modify this option would be to increase the amount of the supplement to pay for improving some fraction of the poor infrastructure in addition to the critical infrastructure.
Based upon the estimates from Table 2E, to fix all of the critical infrastructure and 25% of the poor infrastructure over 5 years would require spending about $223 million each of the five years.
Generating an annual need figure under the second alternative is complicated by the nature of this data-- how does one convert one - time cost data on need to annual on- going estimate of need? Does each individual unit of the infrastructure need to be completely rehabilitated once every ten years, or fifteen, or twenty? Research suggests that rehabilitation and/or reconstruction provide a new pavement structure with 10 to 25 years of additional service life.
35 The estimated service life range is large because the life of a road depends on so many factors, including pavement type, traffic volume, climate, pavement management techniques, etc.
According to PWC data, the total cost of bringing all transportation infrastructure up to excellent condition could be $13.6 billion.
If life of the average unit of transportation infrastructure was, say, fifteen years, then it would be simple to convert the $13.6 billion cost figure into an annual need figure by finding the annual debt service on a 15- year bond without needing to settle on a s ingle figure for all types of infrastructure.
I t would be only slightly more complicated to calculate a debt service number using different figures for the life of a road, a bridge, and a culvert.
Despite the difficulties imposed by these issues, an estimate of the general order of magnitude of the annual cost derived using this approach can be presented.
Suppose that the lifespan of the average unit of transportation infrastructure is twenty years, and that the state would pay an interest rate of 6% on a bond.
Then, the payment on a $13.6 billion bond issue would be just under $1.19 billion per year.
On-Going Maintenance Costs The two measures of need discussed up to this point have at least three major and interrelated weaknesses.
One weakness is that the need figures are self- reported and, therefore, may present relatively high estimates of the need.
A second weakness is that LBO does not know how cost/need estimates were derived by each local government; meaning that it is not possible to evaluate whethe r a given estimate is a reasonable one.
Finally, the need figures were most certainly not arrived at using the same method, so that estimates for specific local governments are not comparable.

In order to develop a more independent and comparable estimate of basic on- going need, LBO sought the expertise of the County Engineers Association of Ohio.
LBO asked CEAO to provide a rough estimate as to the annual cost of maintaining a county road mile.
CEAO estimated ongoing county road maintenance costs at $15,000 per mile of road or $7,500 per lane mile of road.
This cost estimate includes the cost for snow removal, pothole filling, and other regular road maintenance activities.
The estimate assumes a two - lane asphalt road that is 20 feet wide and is both structurally sound and generally meets current levels of service expectation.
The estimate could be low in some urban areas and high in some rural areas.
CEAO provided this as a rough estimate for county roads only.
36 LBO chose to take this estimate and also apply it to cities, villages, and townships.
37 LBO assumed that the costs per lane mile for townships and villages would be 50% less than for counties because they likely have the least expensive roads to maintain.
County costs, on average, are likely to be higher than for townships and villages because of higher traffic volume and more expensive road designs and materials.
LBO increased the cost per lane mile for cities by 50% to $11,250 because cities are likely to face higher costs per lane mile than count ies, on average, due to higher traffic volume and more expensive road designs and materials.
Table 2F below shows these estimates for local on- going road maintenance costs.
These estimates are likely to be low since the average cost figure assumes that every road mile is structurally sound and generally meeting service expectations.
Because the on- going road maintenance cost figure does not take into account bridges, the table includes the number of bridges for which each government type is responsible.
The number of bridges is important to account for when considering on- going costs, as a mile of bridge is likely to be significantly more expensive to maintain than a mile of road.
LBO did not consider it appropriate to develop an average bridge maintenance cost figure because the difference from one bridge to another is significantly greater than the difference between particular road miles.

There are countless variables affecting maintenance costs that make developing an average maintenance cost number as much art as science; some of these factors include pavement type, history, width, traffic volume, snowfall, drainage, truck traffic, etc.
37 CEAO in no way suggested the use of the cost figure it provided for such a calculation.
38 Without controlling for the size of the bridge, the material composing the bridge, bridge traffic volume, age, and other factors, it is not possible to develop a meaningful average cost per foot to maintain a bridge.

46
The Estimate 1 method suggests an on- going road maintenance cost for local governments of about $1.3 billion.
These estimates indicate that cities may have the highest annual road maintenance costs with counties second.
Taking into account bridge responsibilities suggests that counties and cities have the highest on- going infrastructure maintenance costs.
Township maintenance costs could likely be significantly less t han those of cities or counties, but still much higher than village costs.
LBO performed a similar calculation using estimates of the NFC for each lane mile and weighting the average cost for each lane mile depending upon the classification.
This calculation is presented in Table 2G below.
Table 2G: Estimate 2 of Annual On- Going Road Maintenance Cost Using Estimates of Lane Mile National Functional Classifications Estimated Cost City* Functional Classification Per Lane Mile Rural Local Access $3,750 28.9 140.5 257.2 Urban Local Access $3,750 117.1 6.7 41.5 Rural Minor Collector $5,000 1.1 51.1 3.5 Rural Major Collector $7,500 2.0 48.5 1.6 Urban Collector $9,375 32.2 15.7 3.3 Rural Minor Arterial $9,375 0.1 0.2 0 Urban Minor Arterial $11,250 27.6 13.9 0.8 Rural Other Principal Arterial $13,125 0 0 0 Urban Other Principal Arterial $15,000 6.6 1.4 0 Urban Other Freeway or Expressway $18,750 0.1 0.1 0 Total -$215.7 $278.1 $307.9 *Some of these miles may be maintained by other jurisdictions.

For Estimate 2, LBO assumed that each local government type's percent of lane miles in each NFC was the same as the percent of road miles reported in Table 2A.
LBO assumed that the rural major collector was of average cost to maintain.
Then, every other road classification was weighted to calculate a cost greater or lesser than the average road cost.
Obviously, the average cost road selected and the weights applied significantly impact the magnitude of the estimate.
This is particularly true for local- access roads.
Lowering the per lane mile cost estimate for local access roads, dramatically decreases the overall estimate, particularly the annual maintenance cost estimate for townships.
The Estimate 2 method provides a figure nearly one - half billion dollars lower than Estimate 1.
This estimate also changes the estimates for each government type.
Under Estimate 2, townships have the highest cost as opposed to cities, although the cost estimate for townships remains about the same.
Cities' estimated costs under Estimate 2 are third at $216 million and are about $300 million less than in Estimate 1.
Counties' relative position in Estimate 2 remains the same, but the estimated cost is less than Estimate 1 by over $160 million.
Comparing both estimates suggests that local road maintenance costs, if all local roads were in relatively good condition, could fall somewhere between several hundred billion dollars and well over a billion dollars.
Either estimate suggests that counties and cities likely have the highest ongoing costs if bridges are taken into account.
However, townships road maintenanc e costs could be more or less than cities' costs depending upon the estimate used.
Both estimates also suggest that villages have the lowest on- going costs.

Part 3 Road and Bridge Finance In order to evaluate the need for additional funding and the responsiveness of current funding to needs, it is important to understa nd how current funds are allocated on the state level and to know how much funding local governments currently receive from state, local, and federal sources.
Table 3A below shows an estimate of the total amount of revenue that local governments received or generated for roads and bridges from state, local, and federal sources.
State figures represent actual distributions.
The local figure is developed from actual disbursement data for the local permissive license tax and from LBO estimates for other sour ces.
The federal total is estimated using both survey response data and actual 1998 data provided by ODOT.
The total amount for all local governments is higher than the sum of the totals for each government type because, for some sources, it was not possib le to determine the distribution to each government type.
The table shows that local governments had nearly $1.8 billion available to spend on roads and bridges in 1999.
Cities had the most revenue available to spend and counties had the second most fund ing available.
Townships had the third most funding available to use and villages the least.
These revenue figures should be considered in light of the need and cost information presented in Part 2 when evaluating the appropriateness of the relative distribution of revenues among each local government type.
While cities have the most revenue to spend, over 60% of city revenue is generated from local sources.
Over 2/3 of township and village revenue is generated from local sources.
Conversely, less than 1/4 of total county funding is locally generated.
About 11% of the total funding comes from federal sources, with the vast majority of that amount going to cities and counties.
Table 3A: Estimated Total Revenues for Local Roads and Bridges, 1999 (Millions of Dollars) Local Government City County Township Village Total* State Local** 245.5 379.6 390.2 129.7 92.5 200.1 45.6 97.3 $786.9 $806.8 Federal ? ? ? ? $200 Total 625.1 519.9 292.6 142.9 $1,793.7
*The state total is greater than the sum of t he local government state amounts because the total includes $13.1 million in grant money for which LBO does not know the distribution.
This also means that the sum of the local government total revenue figures do not add up to the statewide revenue total.
Totals may appear incorrect due to rounding.**City and village local revenue figures assume that LMVLT and property tax revenue going to municipalities is evenly split between cities anvillages.
This is likely not the case.
48
State Funding to Local Go vernments Excluding federal revenue, funding for local roads and bridges is split almost evenly between state and local sources.
State funding is a major portion of all local governments' funding for roads and bridges.
Table 3B below shows the amount of state revenue received by local governments for roads and bridges in 1999.
Overall, counties received the most state support followed by cities.
In fact, over 75% of the nonfederal revenue available for counties was state revenue.
State revenue was about 40% of the city non- federal revenue total.
Less than 1/3 of the revenue available to townships and villages came from state sources.
As Table 3B shows, the three main sources of state funding for local roads and bridges are the motor vehicle fuel tax (MVFT), the motor vehicle license tax (MVLT) and funding from the Public Works Commission (PWC).
Both the MVFT and the MVLT provided over $300 million to local governments in 1999.
PWC funding accounted for about $141 million, less than half the amounts provided by the MVFT and the MVLT.
Department of Development (DEV) grant money accounted for less than 2% of all state funding for local roads and bridges.
Combined, cities and counties received almost 75% of all MVFT revenue and nearly 80% of all PWC funding for roads and bridges.
Counties alone received nearly 75% of all MVLT revenue.
Townships received about 20% of all MVFT revenues, about 5% of MVLT revenue, and over 8% of PWC funding.
Villages received over 5% of MVFT moneys, less than 3% of MVLT revenue, and over 12% of PWC funding.
While these percents appear to be generally in line with many of the need and cost estimates presented in Part 2, a more detailed analysis of the responsiveness of state funding is offered in Part 4 of the report.
The remaining parts of this section explain how state funds are allocated.
Table 3B: State Revenues for Roads and Bridges, 1999 (Millions of Dollars) Local Government City County Township Village Total MVFT 121.3 122.4 65.8 19.6 $329.1 MVLT 54.7 225.4 15.2 8.9 $304.2 PWC* 69.5 42.4 11.5 17.1 $140.5 DEV** ? ? ? ? $13.1 State Total 245.5 390.2 92.5 45.6 $786.9
*Includes value of all PWC grants, loans, enhancements etc.
**It was not possible to determine the distribution to each government type for DEV grant money.
Therefore, the sum of the local government total revenue figures does not add up to the statewide local revenue total.
49
The Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax The motor vehicle fuel tax (MVFT), commonly known as the gas tax, generates the largest amount of state revenue distributed to local governments for maintaining local roads and bridges.
In 1925 the 86th General Assembly enacted Ohio's first MVFT.
Since then, no fewer than 32 pieces of legislation have impacted the collection and/or distribution of the MVFT in Ohio.
Today, Ohio's MVFT is composed of five different levies contained within four separate sections of code, and five sections of the Revised Code spell out how each separate levy is to be distributed.
The actual sections of code and the amounts that are levied in each are presented in the Table 3C.

Currently, the total rate of Ohio's fuel tax is 22 cents.
By comparison, the federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Each penny of the MVFT generates more than $60 million per year.
The gas tax was initially enacted in 1925 at 2 cents per gallon.
By 1959, increases in the existing four levies, brought the tax to 7 cents where it remained until 1981.
In 1981, the indexed motor vehicle fuel tax or cents per gallon tax was created.
Today's 22- cent tax has been in effect since 1992.
Chart 3A shows the growth of the MVFT from a rate of 7 cents per gallon in 1980 along with the federal gas tax rate growth from 4 cents per gallon 18.4 cents per gallon.

MVFT General Distribution All five MVFT levies have different distribution formulas within the Revised Code.
Since each levy is distributed differently, a series of complex calculations, deposits, and transfers are necessary in order to make the legally required distributions.
Once the 22 cents per gallon tax is collected, the following steps are taken: 1.
The Treasurer receives the taxes and .75% is taken from the net receipts and deposited into the Waterways Safety Fund within the Department of Natural Resources.
2.
The Treasurer then sets aside an amount certified by the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund as necessary for bond repayment in the current fiscal year.
3.
The Treasure r deposits the remaining revenue into state accounting funds pursuant to the statutory allocations.
An equivalent of 5.25 cents of the 22- cent tax is deposited in the Highway Operating Fund; a 1.75- cent equivalent is deposited in the Gasoline Excise Tax Fund, and the remaining 15- cent equivalent is deposited in the State and Local Government Highway Distribution Fund.
In addition, the Treasurer places $0.5 million in the Grade Crossing Fund.
4.
Each month, the Department of Taxation transfers to the Ohio Turnpike Commission an amount equal to 5 cents times the number of gallons sold at gas stations operated by the Turnpike.
5.
Once steps 1 to 4 are completed, the Department of Taxation apportions the remaining monies utilizing five different calculations .
The 15- cent per gallon levy is allocated so that a one - cent equivalent goes to the LTIP, and 75% of the 14- cent equivalent is transferred to the Highway Operating Fund.
The remaining 25% is distributed among counties, townships and municipalities mo nthly, based on statutory formulas with about 10.7% going to municipalities, 5% to townships, and 9.3% to counties.
Furthermore, the proceeds from the Gasoline Excise Tax Fund are distributed monthly to counties, municipalities, and townships.
6.
After all the distributions outlined order to meet legal requirements.
Highway Operating Fund to the Develo pment, and to the Department in number 5, additional transfers need to be made in Additional transfers are made by OBM from the Department of Public Safety, the Department of of Taxation.

MVFT Distribution to Local Governments The Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax has been a reliable source of funding for Ohio's roads and bridges with local governments experiencing a fairly consistent increase in revenue from the tax.

Local governments' share of the MVFT totals about 25% of the total revenue distributed.
After netting out 1 cent for the LTIP, the Department of Taxat ion has computed that the State of Ohio gets 75% of the 21 cents, counties receive 9.3%, municipalities receive 10.7%, and townships receive 5%.
Distributions to Ohio's municipal corporations are based in proportion to vehicle registrations and distributio ns to counties and townships are done equally.
Initially, all revenue collected from the 15 cents per gallon tax is deposited into the State and Local Government Highway Distribution Fund.
Money from the fund is allocated as shown below with the FY 1999 estimated amounts.1

The State Motor Vehicle License Tax The second largest source of state funding for local roads and bridges is the state motor vehicle license tax (MVLT), commonly known as the license plate fee.
The MVLT is assessed annually on motor vehicles operated on Ohio public roads or highways.
Vehicle types on which the tax must be paid include passenger cars, trucks, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, and motorized bic ycles.
In 1999, there were approximately 8.2 million registered passenger vehicles; 244,000 motorcycles and mopeds; and 3.2 million trucks, motor homes, buses and other vehicles - for a total of 11.6 million registered vehicles.
Depending upon which taxing district a vehicle is registered in, total state and local fees for passenger cars range from $20 to $40.
The state portion of the annual licensing tax on passenger cars is $20.
All of the motor vehicle license tax is constitutionally earmarked for highway purposes.
Table 3D below shows the state license fee charged for various types of vehicles.

Initial vehicle registration or renewal registration fees are transmitted to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
Local governments receive a significant portion of the state license tax revenue, which the registrar is responsible for remitting along with any local motor vehicle license tax revenue due specific counties, municipal corporations, townships, and transportation improvement districts.
However, before any state license tax revenues are distributed back to local governments, distributions must be made for Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) bond obligations and Department of Public Safety and Department of Taxation administrative expenses.
Included in these transfers is a portion of the revenue from commercial vehicles having gross vehicle weights over 26,000 pounds, which is commonly referred to as International Registration Plan (IRP) revenue.
The International Registration Plan or IRP is a vehicle registration system that registers motor carriers with all state jurisdictions in which they operate by filing one app lication with their home state.
The types of vehicles required to register with IRP are: vehicles operating or
54
registered over 26,000 pounds, vehicles with three or more axels, and combination vehicles with a combined weight over 26,000 pounds.
Registration fees are calculated on the percentage of miles a carrier travels in each jurisdiction.
The home state collects the fees for all jurisdictions where the carrier operates and forwards the fees to those jurisdictions.
By law, the highway bond retirement fund and the Highway Operating Fund must receive 42.6% of the IRP revenue.
39 As shown in Table 3E below, since 1997, the debt service on highway bonds has been significantly reduced as older bonds have been paid off and new bonds have been paid off using gas tax revenues.
40 Table 3E: Revenues Used for Highway Bond Retirement, 1990 Â­ 1999 Year 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 IRP Revenue Used to Retire Highway Bonds (Millions of Dollars) $0 $24 $51 $45 $43 $43 $46 $43 $20 $14
After bond retirement obligations and administrative expenses are met, the remaining portion of state license tax revenue is distributed to local governments as follows: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· 34% to the municipal corporation or county of registration 47% to the county of residence 9% to counties distributed by miles of county roads to the state total 5% to townships based upon the number of miles of township roads to state total 5% divided equally among countie s
License Tax Revenue Revenues associated with the state and local motor vehicle license taxes are collected and distributed back to local government taxing districts.
Revenues distributed back to local governments are comprised of two parts: (1) the license revenue from the $20 state license tax and (2) the permissive local motor vehicle license tax which ranges from $0 to 20 dollars.
The actual license fee paid can range from $20 to $40, depending upon the local license tax fee, if any.
In 1999, there were 11,581,700 vehicle registrations.
Of this total, 7,239,024 were registered to municipal residents and 4,342,676 were registered to township residents.

Ohio Re vised Code Section 4501.044 A (2).
Throughout this report revenue figures reported by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles do not include the 42.6% of IRP revenues allocated to the Highway Operating Fund because these moneys are not included in any BMV reports since they are not Department of Public Safety revenues.
55
Various activities occur to increase and decrease the total revenues available for distribution to local governments from the state's $20 state MVLT revenue including: IRP Compensation to Local Governments: Local taxing districts "lose " a certain amount of IRP revenue because not all the amount collected goes to Ohio.
For example, a motor carrier may pay $1,000 in fees to Ohio, however, if only 60% of their travel is within Ohio, only $600 remains with the taxing district and $400 is remitted to another state.
However, Ohio receives IRP revenues from other states as well and this is included in any net total of funds that are distributed back to local governments.
Administrative Costs: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) retains revenues associated with administering the vehicle registration program.
Audit Costs: A portion of the MVLT revenues are retained by the Department of Taxation for performing IRP mileage audits on carriers who have designated Ohio as their home state.
Annual Interest: MVLT revenues in state accounts accumulate interest, which is paid quarterly.
Table 3F shows the dollar amounts associated with the increases and decreases in MVLT revenue described above.

Public Works Commission Funding Moneys from the Public Works Commission (PWC) represent the third largest source of state funding for local roads and bridges.
PWC is responsible for the implementation of two infrastructure assistance programs for local governments, the State Capital Improvements Program (SCIP) and the Local Transportation Improvements Program (LTIP).
SCIP is used to distribute over $120 million annually to local governments for water, sewer, and transportation capital improvements.
LTIP provid es about $69 million per year for loca l transportation infrastructure projects.
In its first ten years, nearly 33% of SCIP grants or about $39 million
56
annually were spent on local roads, bridges, and culverts.
In recent years the PWC has provided about $141 million annually for transportation projects.
Local Transportation Improvement Program The Local Transportation Improvement Program was created in the transportation budget act of the 118th General Assembly.
This act increased the motor vehicle fuel tax by 3.2 cents, and set aside one cent of the increase for LTIP.
LTIP moneys are disbursed through grants that may pay for all or part of a project's cost.
Projects must have a useful life of at least seven years.
Program moneys are allocated in the same manner as described below for SCIP.
State Capital Improvements Program SCIP (also know as Issue II) provides over $120 million per year in grants and low- interest loans to local governments.
Funding for SCIP comes from bonds originally authorized by a constitutional amendment approved by vo ters in 1987, and then re- authorized in 1995.
SCIP moneys can be used to fund the following infrastructure facilities for local governments: Â· Â· Â· Â· Roadways and bridges/culverts Fresh water supply treatment and distribution systems Waste water collection and treatment facilities Storm sewer systems and solid waste disposal facilities
Allocation of PWC Funds Overall, PWC distributes more than $180 millions per year in grant moneys.
After setting aside funds for SCIP subprograms, more than $164 million is available for SCIP and LTIP grants awarded by local committees.
PWC allocates remaining moneys to 19 District Public Works Integrating Committees (DPWIC s) on a per- capita basis.
41 LTIP funds are also distributed to each district on a per capita basis.
District Public Works Integrating Committees are responsible for recommending projects for funding to the Ohio Public Works Commission.
DPWICs consist of local officials representing all types of government.
Although the per capita share is by district, the per cap ita share by county must still be computed.
If a county's total per capita share is less than $300,000, PWC must make adjustments to all the district allocations until that per capita requirement is met.
The 19 DPWIC s evaluate the projects using ten crite ria established in the Ohio Revised Code.
Each DPWIC decides how the criteria are weighted and applied.
The DPWIC s use these criteria to rank the project proposals submitted by local governments in the district.
Districts may fund up to 90% of any repair o r replacement projects, but only 50% of new or expansion projects.
The ten criteria that must be considered by d istrict committees when ranking projects are: 1.
The infrastructure repair and replacement needs of the district 2.
The age and condition of the sys tem to be repaired or replaced 41

Whether the project would generate revenue in the form of user fees or assessments 4.
The importance of the project to the health and safety of the citizens of the district 5.
The cost of the project and whether it is consistent with division (G) of section 164.05 of the Ohio Revised Code and the district's allocation for grants, loans, and local debt support and credit enhancements for that year 6.
The effort and ability of the benefited local subdivision to assist in financing the project 7.
The availability of federal or other funds for the project 8.
The overall economic health of the particular local subdivision 9.
The adequacy of the planning for the project and the readiness of the applicant to proceed should the project be approved 10.
Any other factors deemed relevant to a particular project SCIP subprograms In addition to the more than $164 million allocated through the DPWICs, up to 14.5 million of SCIP bond revenues are set aside each year for the SCIP's subprograms.
The subprogr ams are: Small Government Program (SGP): Funds for this program are set aside for villages and townships with populations of less than 5,000.
SGP gives smaller subdivisions, which have projects that may not be as highly prioritized as other district projects, a second opportunity for assistance.
A $12 million maximum is available each fiscal year for the SGP.
Emergency Assistance Program: Emergency assistance moneys, amounting to $2.5 million each fiscal year, are for the immediate preservation of hea lth, safety, and welfare.
Moneys for emergency assistance are awarded at the discretion of PWC's director.
Small Counties Capital Improvement Program: Am.
Sub. S.B. 257 of the 121st G.A. created this SCIP subprogram, which is modeled after the SGP and targets districts that include a county with a population of less than 85,000.
Each integrating committee must appoint a subcommittee to select and submit projects to PWC for this program.
Funding of $2 million was allocated from the capital budget for fisca l years 1999 and 2001.
Revolving Loan Program Within the SCIP program, PWC administers a revolving loan program (RLP ).
The SCIP Law requires each DPWIC to allocate a percentage of their budgets for loans.
All repayments of loans made under SCIP are depo sited into the RLP Fund.
These moneys are disbursed back to the integrating committees to be used for loans.
Each district public works integrating committee is allocated an amount equal to the sum of all loan repayments made to the RLP Fund by local subdivisions that are part of their district.
The repayments received are on loans made under the SCIP's initial authorization.
Money not used in a program year can be carried over to the next year for the same purpose.
Loans approved under the RLP may fund up to 100 percent of the total project costs.
Investment earnings credited to the fund that exceed the amount required for estimated federal arbitrage rebate requirements are to be used to administer the RLP.
Any investment earning balance is to 58
be allocated to the districts on a per capita basis.
Loan repayments for loans made from the Small Government Program and the Emergency Assistance Program are to be used for each program respectively.
In FY 2000, the commission released about $26 million from the Revolving Loan Fund and another $32 million will be released in FY 2001 for the Revolving Loan Program.
These allocations will pay for 25 to 40 loans each fiscal year.
Through FY 1999, PWC had approved over 817 loans and collected over $29 million in repayments under the RLP.
Revenue Distributed As show in Chart 3D below, the Public Works Commission (PWC) distributed nearly $1 billion dollars to Ohio's local governments for transportation projects from FY 1989 to FY 1998.

Chart 3E shows how much money PWC distributed, statewide, per road mile and per bridge /culvert from 1989 to 1998.
42 As the chart shows, funding per road mile was nearly twice the amount per bridge/culvert.
43
42
Culverts are often thought of as small bridges, but they are not.
A culvert is a structure that conveys water, or forms a passageway through an embankment, and is designed to support the earth on top of it and the vehicles going over it.
Typically, culverts are much less expensive to build and maintain than bridges.
43 Comparisons with data provided by ODOT indicate that some bridges are counted twice in the PWC data--some municipalities, for example, claimed responsibility for bridges that are actually a county responsibility.
Some road miles may also be double counted.

Ohio Department of Development Grants The Ohio Department of Development (DEV) administers a number of grants that local governments can tap for roadwork improvements.
These grant programs are in place to attract and retain business in the State of Ohio.
Although the grants are awarded throughout the year as projects come to the department's attention, the projects should have a significant number of jobs involved and show a large private investment at the business location.
To access the funds, local governments must contact their regional DEV representative and share information regarding the proposed project.
After receiving details regarding the potential private investment, the Department of Development develops an incentive package based on the particular needs of the company.
When infrastructure improvements are included in the package, the local government receive s their grant award for the project while the company receives a separate package of tax incentives, grants and/or loans.
After receiving a commitment letter, the local government or business must provide an acceptance letter agreeing to the terms in the commitment letter.
At this point, the package of information is submitted to the Controlling Board of the Ohio General Assembly for approval.
After the approval date, the package is awarded.
The business or local government must display the job involvement and the private investment within three years or the award is forfeited back to the Department of Development.
Although DEV administers a large number of incentive programs, this report will describe only the four grant programs that have ties to roadwork and transportation infrastructure improvement.
60
Roadwork Development The Department of Development program that provides the most funding for transportation projects is the Roadwork Development Grant program.
The funding source for this program is motor vehicle fuel tax revenue.
The current transportation budget appropriates $14.3 million in FY 2000 and $13.0 million in FY 2001 for the roadwork developme nt program.
These funds are used for road improvements associated with attracting or retaining businesses.
Although the agency determines most grant recipients, the biennial budget contains an earmark for certain transportation improvement districts.
Each TID is granted $250,000 in each fiscal year for administrative purposes.
In 1998, the Hamilton, Butler, Medina and Stark TIDs each received a grant.
In 1999, the Rossford TID was added.
Unlike other Department of Development programs that provide direct benefit to businesses, the Roadwork Development program awards the great majority of its grants directly to the political subdivision for performing the infrastructure improvements.
Common recipients of grant awards include cities, counties, port authorit ies, and village s Table 3G provides a breakdown of the declared purpose for awards during calendar years 1998 and 1999.
Besides the total provided for each grant purpose, an average award per category is shown.
Many of the categories are self- explanatory but one requires explanation.
The third category titled "nondescript improvements to infrastructure" represents roads that currently exist and are being improved, but the department did not provide enough detail to determine what exactly is being done to t he roadway.
After breaking down the projects by purpose, Table 3G separates the urban projects from rural projects.
With the information provided by DEV, it was not possible to determine, below the county level, whether a project was in a rural urban area.
Therefore, in the following table urban is defined as any project that occurred in any of the following counties: Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Montgomery, Stark, or Summit.
Any project not in one of the above counties was considered a rural project.

Other Transportation Related Grant Programs In addition to several other Funding for programs are the Roadwork Development program, the Department of Development administers programs that often provid e some local assistance for roadwork infrastructure.
these programs is provided through the state's General Revenue Fund.
These described below.
Business Development Grants With a typical appropriation of over $10 million each fiscal year, the Business Development Grant program is one of the largest business incentives within the Department of Development.
Grant funds may be used for a large number of incentive projects including investments in machinery, equipment, water system f acilities, site preparation, parking facilities, sewer and sewage treatment facilities, and electric or gas service facilities.
Although there is a wide range of activities that this grant program can be used for, the great majority of the grants are awarded directly to businesses to offset the cost of new machinery and/or equipment.
Of the $9.8 million awarded during calendar year 1999, just $562,000 was awarded for projects with a roadwork investment component .
These projects consisted of a paving project, the construction of a parking facility, and the purchase of wetland credits to expand a surface parking lot.
62
Urban and Rural Initiative Grants Under Ohio Revised Code Sections 122.19 to 122.22, the department may issue Urban and Rural Initiative Grants for land acquisition, infrastructure improvements, brownfield site remediation, and building renovation.
The department's most recent information for the program included 1997 and 1998 calendar year information for the awards.
Please note that job creation is not a requirement of this program but the applicant for funds must provide a marketing and management plan for the site.

In 1998, the Controlling Board approved 11 projects and five of these projects included roadwork projects in the purpose for the grant.
These five projects received a total of $2.6 million in grants.
Three of the projects required new roadwork to provide access to new industrial parks.
The other two projects received grants to build a new parking facility in Canton and to make parking lot improvements in Dayton.
Funding for this grant program has diminished over time.
When the program began in 1998, the grant program was awarded $10 million in its first year.
In the following year, the grant program received $4 million.
In the current appropriations budget, the grant program was approved for $1 million in FY 2000 and $1 million in FY 2001.
Project 100 Project 100 is a new program, which was appropriated $2.0 million of GRF moneys in both FY 2000 and FY 2001.
Project 100 allows the department to award funds for the construction of composite materials bridge decks across the state.
Recently, a Controlling Board from the department indicated that nineteen grants totaling $1.5 million have been awarded and an additional $2 million is to be used for further research and development.
The remaining $500,000 is yet to be awarded.
State Infrastructure Bank Congress created the State Infrastructure Bank, or SIB, in 1995 through the National Highway System Act of 1995, with an initial capitalization loan of $120 million, $30 million of which came from state the GRF.
The purpose of the SIB is to allow local communities to leverage additional funding for transportation infrastructure projects by providing low- interest loans.
The Ohio SIB is capitalized by federal and state funds and is administered by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
63
SIB appropriations for the current biennium are $5 million in each year from the federal government, and $32 million in each year from the states' Highway Operating Fund.
Loan repayments to the SIB are used to fund additional projects, so that the SIB essentially functions as a revolving loan program.
Projects not funded through moneys for Ohio's State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) are eligible SIB loans .
As of March 2000, 21 active projects, worth a total of $82 million, had been leveraged through the SIB.
Locally Generated Revenues The following sections provide information about current local sources of revenues for cities, counties, townships, and villages within Ohio.
Local revenues are the largest source of revenue for local governments to build and maintain roads and bridges.
LBO estimates that local revenues providde more than $800 million for roads and bridges in 1999.
The first section on local revenues provides information from a survey conducted by the Legislative Budget Office.
The remaining section provides more detail on three local funding options: Â· Â· Â· Local motor vehicle license tax Road and bridge property tax levies Transportation improvement district and license tax
Total Locally Generated Revenue The LBO survey was sent to all 88 counties, all 242 cities, and all townships with a population greater than 5,000, and to a random sample of 200 villages and 200 townships with populations below five thousand .
44 The survey asked local governments about specific local funding sources.
The survey asked, for example, how much the local government had spent on roads and bridges from its general fund.
It also asked respondents to report the amounts received from dedicated property tax levies, bonds issued by the local government, permissive local motor vehicle license taxes levied, and from any other sources.
Other sources of revenue reported included permissive sales taxes, municipal income taxes, fines levied, and interest on investments.
Table 3H summarizes the responses regarding locally available funding in 1999.
As shown in Table 3H, the 373 responding local governments reported total locally available funding of $363.6 million.
The amount received varies enormously by the specific government reporting.
Cuyahoga County reported that it receives $14.7 million from local sources, which represents about 18% of the total amount reported by counties.
At the opposite extreme, Darke County reported receiving less than $16,000 from local sources, and four counties reported no local revenue receipts at all.
45 Similarly, Columbus, Cleveland, and Toledo together reported 44 45
A detailed analysis of the responses to all the survey questions is presented in Appendix B. Sixty-eight of 88 counties responded to the survey.
Some of the largest counties not responding included Franklin, Summit, and Montgomery.
64
receiving $110.0 million from locally available sources or nearly 43 % of the total amount ($256.7 million) reported by cities.
In contrast, two cities (Heath and Ironton) reported less than $1,000 in local revenue receipts.

* Approximately $15.8 million was transferred between local governments, most commonly from counties to municipalities.
Although the numbers shown for each unit of government are actually available to them to spend , the transfers are counted twice.
Thus the transfers are subtracted to show accurate totals for local governments as a whole.
Because some local governments were not surveyed and many of those surveyed did not respond, the figures in Table 3H do not represent the total amount of locally available resources statewide.
Therefore, LBO had to estimate the total statewide revenues available to local governments.
Helpfully, LBO d id have other resources for such an estimate in addition to the survey results--the Bureau of Motor Vehicles provided statewide figures on local Motor Vehicle License Tax ( LMVLT) revenue, and LBO developed statewide estimates for property tax revenue from data provided by the Department of Taxation.
The revenue available from all other local sources had to be estimated using the LBO survey results.
Estimating the total statewide local revenue based on a sample raises rather complex statistical issues.
Although these issues are numerous, they all relate to one fairly simple question: are the local governments that responded to the survey different in some systematic way from the local governments that did not respond? LBO ran some statistical tests to answer this question.
The results of these tests suggest that the county respondents to the survey do not significantly differ from those counties that did not respond.
Cities and villages were an intermediate case-- one or two differences between respondents and no n- respondents were close to being statistically significant.
These tests lead us to conclude that the estimates of locally available revenues for all counties, cities and villages found below are probably statistically reliable or statistically unbiased.
On the other hand, the townships that responded to the survey do differ significantly from those that did not respond.
Therefore, it is not possible to produce statistically reliable estimates for all townships.
47 46
Of the 242 cities in Ohio, 119 responded to the survey.
Cincinnati is the largest city that did not respond.
Other large cities not reporting were Youngstown, Lorain, Hamilton, Kettering, Lakewood, and Mansfield.
47 Only about 25% of townships responded and since the survey was sent to a sample of the townships, not to all of them, the percentage of all townships from which we have a response is about 9 percent.
Although the response rate is also low for villages, just 1/3 surveyed returned the survey, LBO statistical tests suggest that the village estimate

Table 3I reports estimates of locally available revenues for all counties and municipalities in the state.
Two estimates derived using different methods are shown for counties and for cities, while only one is shown for villages.
The totals for each local government type in the table include the actual figures on LMVLT revenue , the LBO estimate s of property tax revenue , and the LBO estimate for all other sources generated from survey response data.

**The Method 1 city estimate does not in clude the city of Cincinnati, so the city numbers and the totals for Method 1 would need to have Cincinnati's revenues added to them to arrive at a valid statewide estimate of revenue.
*** Revenue from property taxes and the Local Motor Vehicle License Tax was not available separately for cities and villages, so the total municipal revenue is split evenly between cities and villages.
Table 3I includes two estimates of the locally available revenues for counties and for cities.
Method 1 estimates were based on the average revenue for those local governments that respond ed to the survey, so that the average revenue from all local sources, excluding property tax and LMVLT revenue , was calculated and imputed to all the non- respondents.
Because using simple averages may be misleading in the case of some local jurisdictions, like the City of Cincinnati or Franklin County, which are substantially larger than the average , Method 2 accounts more explicitly for the differences between cities and counties.
The Method 1 estimate is reasonable for the counties, because there are no statistically significant differences between the populations, total numbers of road miles, total numbers of bridges, or average weekly wages in the counties that responded and those that did not.
The Method 1 estimate should also be reasonable for villages, which are similar in terms of their populations and therefore likely similar in terms of their revenue raising possibilities.
Method 1 is less reasonable way to estimate cities' revenue s.
The difference between the populations of responding cities and non- responding cities is almost large enough to be statistically significant at 95% significance level.
Also Cincinnati is so much larger than the average city size, that any inference based on statewide averages could be seriously inaccurate.
Because of these concerns, the Method 1 estimate does not include a figure for Cincinnati in the
is probably statistically unbiased.
The low response rate for villages does mean, however, that a 95% confidence interval for this estimate would be very wide.

city or overall totals for Method 1 in Table 3I.
To find the actual statewide estimate, Cincinnati's revenues would need to be added to the totals shown.
Method 2 estimates shown in Table 3I used statistical regression to estimate the locally available revenue not resulting from property tax or LMVLT.
Statistical regression allows for the estimated amount of revenue to vary with population; total number of road miles, bridges and culverts; and average wages for workers in the county.
Therefore, Method 2 overcomes the problems described above for Method 1.
As with the first method, the resulting estimate has the actual numbers reported by respondents added to it, along with the actual revenue from LMVLT and the separate estimates of property tax revenue.
The Method 1 estimate for villages is $97.3 million.
The two methods yield similar estimates for count ies with the Method 1 estimate being $128.0 million and the Method 2 estimate $129.7 million.
This is not surprising, since preliminary tests found insignificant differences between the counties that responded and those that did not.
In contrast, t he two methods yield significantly different numbers for cities at : $409.5 million for Method 1 compared to $379.6 million for Method 2.
The number generated by Method 2, the statistical regression method, is likely the more accurate estimate.
Whichever estimate one prefers, the city and village numbers are likely off somewhat because all municipal property tax revenue and local MVLT revenue was evenly split between the two local government types.
However, this imprecision does not affect the overall totals.
Unfortunately, LBO cannot provide a statistically reliable figure for township revenues because of the low township response rate and the fact that townships significantly differ from each in a number of important ways.
Applying Method 1 to townships by imputing the average revenue for respondents to all non- respondents, does provide a reasonable, though not statistically valid, guess at the total locally available revenues for townships.
This approach yields a figure of $200.1 million.
Overall, LBO estimates that million in locally available estimated and the township possible that the true amount local governments in Ohio received between $806.7 and $834.9 resources in 1999.
Because many of the revenue figures were component of the total is not statistically reliable , it is entirely of revenue received lies outside of this range estimate.
Local Motor Vehicle License Taxes Similar to the state, counties, municipalities, and townships may enact a motor vehicle license tax on vehicle registrations .
This local motor fee license tax revenue (LMVLT) is a significant source of local own- source revenue.
Counties and municipalities have had the authority to enact local license tax levies since 1967.
Local governments may assess up to a total of four $5 levies that can total to no more than 20 dollars.
Counties are authorized to enact a maximum of three levies totaling 15 dollars.
Municipalities, within certain restrictions described below, may assess a maximum of four levies totaling 20 dollars.
Townships are authorized to assess one levy of 5 dollars.
However, in total, local government districts may only assess a maximum of $20 in levies per vehicle registered.
67
The actual amount in local license tax fees that must be paid by a vehicle owner varies widely from county to county and even between local governments within a county.
48 For example, in Franklin County residents of the Canal Winchester municipality pay $15, which includes three $5 county levies and no municipal levy while residents of Plain Township in Franklin County pay $20, which includes $15 in county levies and a $5 township levy.
In Lucas County, residents of the Maumee municipality pay $20 in local license taxes, including $10 in county levies and $10 in municipal levies.
Residents in Harding Township in Lucas County pay $10 for the county levies.
In Marion County all residents of municipalities and townships pay $5 for a county levied local license tax.
Finally, in Wyandot County residents of 3 municipalities pay $5 in license taxes levied by their respect ive municipal governments, while residents in the remaining municipalities and townships are not assessed any additional local license tax.
The authority for an individual municipality or township to levy additional permissive taxes may depend on whether or not the county has enacted certain levies.
Two municipal levies that became effective in 1987 were contingent upon whether or not counties levied specific $5 levies within a certain period of time.
If counties had not enacted these levies by April of 1989 and April of 1991, respectively, municipalities were authorized to enact separate $5 levies.
Current levies available to local governments are: County Levies: 3 levies are available and funds can be distributed to counties and municipalities.
For unincorporated registrations funds are distributed to counties and townships (ORC 4504.02, 4504.15 and 4504.16).
Municipal Levies: 4 levies are available and funds are distributed to municipalities (ORC 4504.06, 4504.17, 4504.171, 4504.172).
Township Levy: 1 levy is available and is distributed to townships (ORC 4504.18).
To clarify the collection and funding process associated with the various LMVLT levies, Table 3J illustrates the complex enactment and collection process for the LMVLT levies.

Table 3K below shows the number of local license tax levies enacted since 1988.
Not all local governments have enacted local motor vehicle license taxes.
This suggests that many local governments in Ohio have existing revenue generating authority that is untapped.

For example, o f 88 counties in Ohio, 24 counties have enacted one county levy, 15 have enacted two county levies and 20 have enacted all three available county levies.
This suggests that there may exist revenue - generating options for counties to pursue since all counties have not enacted the maximum number of levies available.
Similarly, there are 951 municipalities in the State of Ohio.
Of these, enacted one municipal levy, 87 have enacted two municipal levies, municipal levies, and 1 has enacted all four available municipal levies.
that revenue- generating options exist for municipalities to pursue since not enacted the maximum number of levies available.
397 municipalities have 8 have enacted three This may also suggest all municipalities have
The case is similar for townships.
There are 1,309 townships in the State of Ohio.
Of these 301 have enacted the one available township levy.
The low percent age of local governments not using their maximum levy authority might be explained, in some cases, by the fact that the revenue that can be generated is relatively low.
Also, in some cases, the possibility that the levy may be repealed by voters, may preve nt officials from enacting a LMVLT levy.
As Table 3K indicates, six municipalities and five townships have either repealed enacted levies or the local government unit may no longer be in existence due to annexations.

Local Road 
In 1997, there were 1,710 separate road and bridge levies across all taxing jurisdictions.
The average property tax levy dedicated to road and bridge projects was about 1.45 mills where one mill equals one - tenth of one percent.
Detailed data on how much revenue each levy raises is not available, requiring an estimate to be calculated based on rough property valuation (real and tangible property) measures in tax districts.
Chart 3F breaks out the distribution of revenue by tax district.
Assuming a six percent annual growth in property tax revenue since 1997, estimated calendar year 1999 local property tax collections for road and bridge projects would have been about $85.8 million.
As Chart 3F shows, townships account for about $75.8 million or 88% of all local property tax collections.
Municipal corporations account for about 7% of all these collections and counties less than 5 percent .

Transportation Improvement Districts and License Tax Ohio Revised Code Section 5540 allows for the establishment of Transportation Improvement Districts (TIDs) in accordance with an agreement between a board of county commissioners and the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Boards of county commissioners are given authority to create Transportation Improvement Districts in order to finance, construct, maintain, repair and operate specific transportation projects.
The TID is given the authority to issue bonds, to make and enter into contracts, and to function as a separate public entity in its own name.
The first TID was created in Butler County under House Bill 154 of the 120th General Assembly.
Active districts that are eligible to receive funding from the state are currently limited in number to five at any given time.
All counties have the authority to create a TID.
I n 1997, there were as many as seven such districts operating in Butler, Stark, Medina, Hamilton, Lick ing, Muskingum, and Wood counties.
The existing TIDs in Butler, Hamilton, Medina, and Stark counties received an appropriation of $250,000 for each fiscal year of the 2000- 2001 biennium.
These monies are distributed to the Department of Developme nt from ODOT's share of the motor vehicle fuel tax revenues.
TIDs may also generate revenue by levying an annual license tax, in $5 increments, upon the operation of motor vehicles on public highways within the area of the TID.
The levies may be used gene rally for: (1) administrative costs associated with the tax; (2) planning, constructing, maintaining, and repairing roads, bridges and culverts; (3) purchasing and maintaining traffic signs, markers, lights and signals; (4) paying debt service on obligatio ns issued for those purposes and supplementing revenue meant for these purposes.
This levy is subject to approval by the voters, and may not exceed $20 per vehicle.
TIDs are also given the authority to issue revenue bonds.

Federal Funding for Roads and Bridges The Transportation Efficiency Act of the Twenty- First Century (TEA- 21) is the federal government's transportation appropriation bill, aimed at distributing revenues from the 18.4Â¢ federal gas tax collected from all 50 states.
TEA- 21 represents a 40% total increase in funding for the 50 states over the previous federal transportation budget bill.
Over its five- year effective period, TEAÂ­21 will distribute $220 billion to the 50 states.
Ohio will see a 14% increase in federal aid to $900 million in FY 2000 and $915 million in FY 2001.
Federal funding in the previous biennium was $714.6 million in FY 1998 and $878.1 million in FY 1999.
Most of federal funding goes toward roads in the National Highway System (NHS), a 163,000- mile network of rural and urban roads that are considered as contributing to national mobility.
Some of the major federal programs that Ohio will receive this funding through are listed belo w. LBO estimates that local governments received about $200 million in federal funding in FY 1999.
ODOT estimates that federal funding to local governments in FY 2001 will be about $278 million.
Interstate Maintenance program (IM) - Funds the ongoing improvement and maintenance of the 46,000- mile system of highways created by the Eisenhower administration, which is a part of the NHS .
National Highway System program (NHS) Â­ Funds projects on the 163,000- mile network of rural and urban roads.
Surface Transportation Program (STP) - A discretionary- funding program used for a variety of environmental, multi- modal, and infrastructure projects.
51 Part of STP funding includes approximately $20 million per year for Ohio's counties through the County Surface Transportation Program, in which federal STP funds are distributed at the discretion of the CEAO for highways and bridges.
These federal funds are provided at an 80% participation rate, meaning that local governments must pay for 20% of the cost of any project funded.
STP funds are also used for the County Local Bridge Program, which the County Engineers Association of Ohio (CEAO) administers.
The CEAO administers approximately $30 million annually through the County Local Bridge Program.
These funds are limited to $2.5 million per county, and may be used to provide a local match for the 80% federal participation rate through the federal Discretionary Bridge Program, which is described below.
Also the City Bridge Progra m provides about $8 millio n per year to cities.
These funds may also be used to provide a local match for the 80% federal participation rate through the federal Discretionary Bridge Program.
Funds not used by municipalities are made available to the counties.
51
Under a federal minimum guarantee, states are assured to receive at least 90.5% of their contribution to the Highway Trust Fund from this program.
72
Congestion Mitigat ion and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) - This funding is used to reduce the effects of pollution and traffic congestion by meeting national ambient air quality standards.
Appalachian Development Highway System program - Funds highway development and rehabilitation in the 13 states of the Appalachian region High Priority Projects - Congressionally identified projects totaling 1,850, to be funded over the life of the Act Metropolitan Planning Program: Provides funding to support the planning efforts of metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and other state planning entities.
The efforts of Ohio's MPOs are detailed later in this section.
Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP) : A formula based program that provides both a need- based allocation to states as well as funds set aside for discretionary use by the Secretary of Transportation for the replacement and/or rehabilitation of bridges.
Discretionary Bridge Program: The program provides discretionary funds for the rehab ilitation and replacement of deficient county- owned or city- owned bridges.
Small City Program: For municipalities with populations from 5000 to 25,000, ODOT administers the Small City Program.
With an annual budget of approximately $8 million, funding is available to each qualified city for construction only, in the amount of $1 million every four years.
These cities are in turn eligible to provide a local match to an 80% federal contribution.
Large Cities Program: Five municipalities (populations 25,000 to 50,000) outside of an MPO area receive a combination of federal STP, CMAQ, and Enhancement Funds funneled through ODOT for the purposes of road and bridge maintenance and construction.
These areas are Findlay, Lancaster, Marion, Sandusky, and Zanesville.
Two other notable programs that involve federal funds are the Urban Paving Initiative and the Local Public Agency Program: Urban Paving Initiative - An ODOT policy initiative that provides a standardized process for the increasing the level of ODOT participation in assisting municipalities with paving state routes within municipal boundaries is the Urban Paving Initiative.
ODOT will allocate $35 million a year for four consecutive years for this program, beginning in FY 2000.
Municipalities typically will be required to meet a 20% local share match, though this amount may be either reduced or waived based upon fiscal considerations.
ODOT will assist municipalities in maintaining an estimated 1,883 additional miles through this initiative.
73
Local Public Agency Program : ODOT provides for Local Public Agencies (LPA) to sell and administer highway improvement projects for possible reimbursement with ODOT or federal funds.
Projects eligible for the LPA Program are those listed on the STIP.
Metropolitan Planning Organizations To assist with the coordination of infrastructure development, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are created and empowered by local governments.
Ohio has 16 MPOs, for which most of the funding comes from the federal government.
These organizations provide information on local priorities and attempt to coordinate a region's investments to best meet ar ea needs.
The following describes some of the activities that MPOs conduct regarding infrastructure as directed by TEA- 21 funds.
Ohio's MPOs receive monies from TEA- 21 through ODOT.
The federal funds allocated to MPOs include: Transportation Enhancements: Approximately $19 million, or 10% of Ohio's STP setaside, is to be directed to this program.
Of this amount, each MPO will receive an amount equal to 10% of its annual STP allocation, plus an additional 2% increase from ODOT.
The remainder of monies will fund bicycle and pedestrian projects, and historic, archaeological, scenic, environmental enhancements outside of MPO areas.
Metropolitan Planning Program: Provides approximately $9 million for transit to be passed through ODOT to the 16 Ohio MPOs.
These moneys are distributed based upon population.
Metropolitan Planning Organizations and Large Cities: This program ensures that a federally mandated portion of STP funds is passed to MPOs.
ODOT contributes additional funding comprised of STP funds, CMAQ , and federal enhancement funds.
ODOT distributed $134 million in 1999 under this program.
Rideshare Program: This transit program allocates by formula, $1.5 million annually to Ohio's 11 Local Rideshare Agencies.
MPOs plan for and monitor this ODOT program Statewide Planning and Research Program: Approximately $400,000 per year is distributed, based upon population, from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
This money is a llocated to MPOs at ODOT's discretion for planning and study efforts.
MPO Activities MPOs are required to produce a listing of projects in accordance with the Federal- aid Highway Act of 1962 and the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964.
This 3- C Transportation Plan process (continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive) is a four- year activity involving ODOT as well as interested parties from local government and multi- modal (transit and bikeway) transportation entities.
This listing of projects culminates with the creation of ODOT's State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), which provides a comprehensive "snapshot"
74
prioritization of Ohio's transportation needs and available resources f highway, transit, and or multi- modal projects.
The STIP is comprised of 17 chapters including one for each of 16 individual Transportation Improvement Plans submitted by the MPOs and one chapter devoted to coverage of the needs of those rural areas not within the boundaries of an MPO.
All projects that are eligible to receive federal funding must be listed through documentation in the State Transportation Improvement Plan.
The current planning areas of Ohio's 16 MPOs are shown on the map below.

Part 4 Responsiveness of Funding to Local Road and Bridge Needs To assess the responsiveness of the distribution of funds, LBO examined the current distribution methods for the major state sources of funding for local roads and bridges: Â· Â· Â· Motor vehicle fuel tax Motor vehicle license tax Public Works Commission funding
To evaluate the responsiveness of the various funding distributions, LBO compared the percent of the total funding from each state source received by each type of local government to that government type's percent of the total "need," as assessed by the different measures presented in Part 2 of the report.
The tables below present the results of this analysis.
It is important to note that, as discussed in detail in Part 3, MVFT and MVLT distributions are done in two steps.
First, a certain percent of the total funds are distributed between government types, with cities and villages lumped together as municipalities.
Second, the funds allocated to a particular government type are allocated by some formula or method to specific local governments within the group.
So for example, townships receive 5% of the state MVLT and a specific township would be allocated an amount of that 5% based upon its percent of the to tal township road miles statewide.
Funding for One -time Costs In Table 4A, the "% of Total Need" column shows LBO's estimate, calculated using the selfreported data provided to the PWC, as to how much it could cost local governments to repair their poo r and critical roads, bridges, and culverts to "excellent" condition.
52 The last two columns show the percent of the all PWC funding received by each government type for roads and bridges.
This data is compared separately from other need and revenue figures, because the PWC figures represent one - time repair costs and PWC funding is done on a one time project- by- project basis.
53 The data presented in the next table, Table 4B, are regarded as on- going need and revenue figures.
Table 4A: One - Time Need and Perce nt of PWC Funding* Government Type City County Township Village % of Total Need for Poor and Critical Infrastructure 59% 24% 12% 7% % of All PWC Funding, 1999 49% 30% 8% 12% % of All PWC Funding, Ten Year Average 45% 33% 7% 15%
*Percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.
The funding percents given are for all road and bridge funding, not just infrastructure in poor or critical condition.
52 53
For a complete explanation of development of those estimates and their limitations please see Part 2.
A factor complicating the analysis is that a large percentage of PWC funding goes to new or expansion projects, while the n eed estimates only account for current infrastructure.
77
The PWC data suggest that the distribution of PWC moneys is only roughly in line with this measure of need.
Counties and villages are receiving a higher percent of the funding than their percent of the total estimated need, while cities and townships are receiving a lower percent of funding than their percent of the need measure.
On the other hand, the relative distribution more closely matches need, with cities receiving the most funding and having the highest need (as it is measured here), and counties receiving the second highest percent of the funding for the second highest need.
Funding of On-going Need or Cost Table 4B below presents two measures of on- going funding need and shows the number and percent of all local bridges for which each local government type is responsible.
The first measure of need comes from LBO's estimate of statewide annual additiona l funding needed, which was projected from LBO survey response data, and the second measure are estimates of each local government type's percent of the on- going maintenance costs calculated from information provided by the CEAO.54 Because the on- going road maintenance cost figure does not take into account bridges, the table includes the number of bridges for which each government type is responsible.
The number of bridges is important to account for in considering on- going costs or need.

**Rounded to the nearest hundred
Responsiveness to ongoing need The last two columns of Table 4B show the percent of the total MFT and the total state MVLT that each government type receives.
Cities and counties received roughly the same amount of fuel tax dollars, about 37%, with townships receiving 20% of all the MFT and townships receiving about 6 percent.
This distribution seems to be roughly in line with the ongoing needs and costs suggested by the data.
54
For a complete explanation as to the development of those estimates and their limitations please see Part 2.
78
The MVLT distribution is significantly different from the MFT with counties receiving 74% of MVLT revenue, cities receiving 18%, townships 5%, and villages 3 percent.
The distribution of the MVLT revenue appears to be out - of- line with the ongoing needs and costs as measured here.
The county percent of the revenue is four times that of cities and the percent received by townships is much lower than townships percent of the total need, even after accounting for the fact that townships have very few bridges to maintain.
State Distribution to Spe cific Local Governments The above analysis only examined the first step in the distribution of state revenues; dividing up funds between each government type.
The second step in the distribution process involves allocating state funds to specific local go vernments.
Analyzing the responsiveness of the state distribution in terms of specific local governments is problematic because LBO does not have reliable, comparable, data for performing a reasonable systematic analysis that compares local government needs with state funding received.
However, LBO can offer some general observations supported by specific examples.
Motor Fuel Tax Distribution First, the method for distributing the MFT to specific counties and townships is not responsive to "needs" in any sense, as each county and township receives the same amount of the respective county and township portions of the MFT, regardless of the number of road miles, bridges, traffic volume, or other measure of need.
So, for example, in 1999 two Ohio counties received the exact same amount of MFT dollars even though one of county was responsible for six times more road miles than the other county and four times more bridges.
Two townships received the same amount of MFT but one has over 100 miles more road and over 7,000 more culverts than the other (neither township maintains any bridges).
These four local governments have different needs, but the distribution method is not designed to allocate resources in a manner responsive to those different needs.
It seems reasonable to assume that the within group MFT distribution formula for townships and counties is often providing many local counties and townships with more than their fair share of MFT revenue, in relative terms based upon their share of the need.
Conve rsely, many local counties and townships are likely getting less under the current distribution system than their needs would dictate they probably should.
The distribution of the MFT to municipalities makes some attempt to account for need by distributing revenues in proportion to the number of registered vehicles each municipality has relative to the total number of registered vehicles.
Presumably, the number of registered vehicles in a city or village has an impact on the number of lane miles required to serve the population and the traffic volume on those roads.
Still, this is only one measure of need and other measures would result in a different distribution, which could make the current distribution seem unresponsive to certain municipal needs.
Nevertheless, this method of distribution is more likely to provide funding in a manner approximating need than the method for distributing revenue to specific counties and townships.
79
Motor Vehicle License Tax Distribution The distribution of the state MVLT t specific local governments also uses some rough o measure of need to allocate moneys to specific local governments.
Again, the municipal portion is distributed based upon registration, as are portions of the county allocation.
The township allocation and a portion of the county allocation are distributed based on the number of road miles relative to total road miles.
A small portion of the county allocation is an equal distribution, as described above for the MFT.
Therefore, it is more likely that the within government type allocation of MVLT funds is responsive to need while the allocation to government types is not.
Overall Responsiveness In general, it appears that the current distribution of state funding for local roads and bridges is in roughly line with needs or costs in some instances and not others.
This suggests that some aspects of Ohio's funding system for local governments could be made more responsive to need.
Specifically, the initial distribution of the MFT to local government types, appea rs to be relatively in line with various local need measures, but the within group distribution for townships and counties takes no account of need.
The opposite situation appears to exist with the state MVLT, the initial distribution appears to be out - o f- line with need measures while the within government type distributions are much more likely to distribute moneys in relation to needs or costs.
Finally, the PWC distribution appears roughly in proportion to need.
However, townships do appear to be rece iving significantly less than their percent of the need, as measured by the PWC data, and villages significantly more.
The PWC distribution should be distributed in a responsive fashion as the system for making funding decisions is intended to take into account transportation needs of each community, the benefits of each project to the PWC district, and the fiscal distress of each community.
The seeming discrepancies in township and village funding could be a result of village projects providing a greater benefit and/or because villages, in general, could have a higher level of fiscal distress.
However, these discrepancies could be impacted by the composition of the PWC district committees and/or other such factors.

Part 5 Mass Transit Finance and Repor ted Needs Public transportation plays an important role in Ohio by reducing congestion and pollution, by providing mobility to those physically or financially unable to provide their own transportation, and by offering transportation options for meeting the mobility needs of all citizens.
The examples listed below, from a 1996 report by the Federal Transit Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, illustrate the importance of mass transit:55 Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· If all the Americans who take transit instead decided to drive, their cars would circle the Earth with a line of traffic 23,000 miles long.
The nation's $40 billion in economic losses due to traffic congestion would be $15 million higher.
Transit prevents the creation of more than 126 million pounds of hydrocarbons and 156 pounds of nitrogen oxides from automobile tailpipes.
Public transit reduces fuel consumption by approximately 1.5 billion gallons annually.
Thirty- one percent of Americans cannot drive due to age, disability or income.
Research indicates that public transit improves the overall speed of travel for both transit riders and highway users in severely congested, urban travel corridors.
Two rail tracks have the same capacity as 16 lanes of highway.
The cost of driving reduces the ability for many people to own their own vehicle.
According to the American Automobile Association, the average cost of owning and operating an automobile is $6,839 per year (including costs for gas and oil, maintenance, tires, insurance, registrat ion, finance charges, and depreciation).
As shown elsewhere in this report, this figure does not cover the full cost of driving because some road costs are not paid directly by drivers due to funding from general revenue sources at the various levels of go vernment.
While Ohio's transit authorities serve various individuals who are unable to fulfill their own transportation needs, public transportation is also widely used by individuals avoiding traffic congestion or high parking costs or simply the task of driving.
For example, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) provided 59.3 million passenger trips during the 1999 calendar year.
A ridership tally this high-- the highest in the state--could only be created by a cross- section of the citizens (not just poor, disabled, or elderly persons) living in the Greater Cleveland area.
To provide this level of service, the GCRTA has an annual operating budget of approximately $200 million and an annual capital budget of approximately $50 million.

budget is funded with 72% local assistance, 22% passenger fares, 3% state funds and less than one percent of federal funds.
Compared to this level of service, the Allen County Regional Transit Authority (ACRTA) served approximately 250,000 citizens in 1998.
To serve this population, the ACRTA has an annual operating budget of nearly $1.1 million and a capital budget of approximately $125,000.
This budget is funded with 42% federal funds, 12% local assistance, 11% state funds, 9% passenger funds and 24% in other revenue.
Compared to the GCRTA, these revenues are much more dependent on state and federal funds.
As the above examples suggest, mass transit in Ohio includes a wide range of services.
The dual rail and bus service provided by the GCRTA is unmatched in Ohio, but many large urban areas with sophisticated bus systems provide service to the residents in those communities.
The following discussion of state funding begins with a description of how the various levels of service are categorized by the state and how funding is provided.
Following that discussion contains an explanation of federal funding, a presentation of reported needs from transit authorities and a comparison with other states.
State and Federal Funding for Mass Transit At the state level, General Revenue Fund (GRF) moneys are used to support mass transit.
In calendar year 2000, the state and federal governments will provide about $76 million for mass transit in Ohio.
By comparison, this is about 7.7% of the total state and federal funding for local government road and bridge needs in 1999.
Local assistance for mass transit includes revenue from sales tax operating levies and fare revenue.
Also, transit authorities are refunded 21 cents of the 22- cent motor fuel tax for their diesel fuel expenditures.
For the distribution of GRF funds, all of Ohio's public transportation systems have been placed into five classifications, as illustrated in Table 5A below.
Within each of the major five categories, ODOT allocates GRF funds to specific transit systems based upon each transit systems' performance, as measured in the areas of ridership, revenue service miles, and local financial support.
Table 5A: Transit Categories and Funding Allocations Category I II III IV V Designation Large Rail/Bus Systems Large Bus Only Systems Intermediate Bus Systems Small Bus Systems Non-Urbanized Bus Systems Formula Funds Allocated % 27.1% 42.0% 13.0% 17.9% The allocation is determined at the beginning of each fiscal year
82
ODOT's Public Transportation Program ODOT's Public Transportation Program has been in existence for over 25 years, providing services in the form of capital, operating, and technical/planning assistance for 60 urban and rural transit systems.
The programs within ODOT's Public Transportation program are listed below.
These programs receive both federal and state dollars.
Typically, a match of about 20% must be provided to obtain federal dollars.
Ohio Public Transportation Grant Program ( OPTGP ) provides approximately $29 million (the 2000- 2001 budget provides an additional $9 million yearly) in funding for urban and rural transit systems through three components: 1.
Formula: Up to 50% of the non- federal share for operating, 10% of planning costs, and up to 80% of capital costs 2.
Discretionary Capital : State participation at a maximum of 50% based upon potential increases in mobility, access, and ridership .
3.
Supplemental Capital : RTAs, County transit systems, municipalities, and private non- profit organizations are eligible for these funds, with maximum state participation at 20 percent.
Elderly and Disable d Transit Fare Assistance Program ( E
Approximately $3.3 million annually is available for this program.
Transit Capital Program (Cap) is available for all transit systems.
Funds are distributed to fund major capital purchases identified by OPTA.
Ohio's congressional allocation ranges between $12 million and $15 million annually.
Rural Transit Program (RTP) provides approxima tely $8 million in operating and capital assistance to transit systems that serve areas with populations less than 50,000.
Ohio Coordination Program (OCP) expands transportation through the coordination of transportation services of existing providers.
Total annual funding of $1 million in GRF provides up to 75% of the operating expenses, up to $75,000 per project for a one - year period.
Specialized Transportation Program provides capital assistance to private nonprofit organizations that provide transportation services to elderly and disabled persons.
Ohio's allocation approximates $3 million annually.
83
Additional Information on Federal Funding On the federal level, transit- funding sources also include Federal Transit Administration programs (FTA), and special transit provisions within TEA- 21.
Ohio is guaranteed to receive $658.9 million in formula funding over the six- year life of TEA- 21.
One of the new provisions of TEA- 21 is that it allows transit operators to issue bonds secured wit h transit system revenues.
The proceeds from the sale of bonds may be used as part of local matching funds for a transit capital project.
This increases flexibility and local funding for transit capital projects.
The FTA provides both formula and discretio nary funding for Ohio's transit efforts with specific population- based guidelines for operating and capital costs.
Federal Operating Assistance For areas with populations over 200,000, there is no federal or state operating assistance available.
Regional transit authorities (RTA) that serve these areas derive the majority of their operating revenue from local levies and fare revenue.
However, some operating assistance may be available to these entities in the form of temporary "seed" money from Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ).
These funds are limited for three years to RTAs for bus purchases, demonstration purposes, i.e. initiating route service to assess potential ridership and to establish transit services as such service reflects a reduction in ozone emissions.
The flexibility of Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds allows for some capital costs to be defrayed as well.
For areas with populations under 200,000, FTA formula based funds are distributed directly to transit systems.
The y also receive monies from General Revenue Fund (GRF) and local levies to support costs.
Areas under 50,000 take part in the FTA non- urbanized area formula program (Section 5311) that provides up to 50% of the operating cost deficit.
Preventative Maintenance New provisions under TEA- 21 (Section 5307) allow for FTA funding of preventative maintenance costs for transit systems in urbanized areas at an 80% rate of reimbursement.
Capital assistance For areas with populations over 50,000, FTA's Section 5307 formula based funds can be used for capital purchases at an 80/20 federal/local match.
Section 5309 discretionary funds are available for systems in areas with populations greater than 50,000 at an 80/20 match for capital projects as identified by the Ohio Public Transit Association (OPTA).
Section 5311 provides capital funds for areas under 50,000 at an 80/20- federal/local match.
STP/CMAQ - STP provides flexible funding for transit capital projects such as intercity bus terminals and facilit ies. CMAQ funds are also flexible and may be used for specific transit purposes that can be shown to reduce ozone emissions.
84
Job Access and Reverse Commute Â­ Discretionary funds allocated at the federal level; proposals from both urban and rural areas are submitted to the FTA in conjunction with Welfare to Work program efforts.
RTAP Â­ The Rural Transit Assistance Program provides training, technical assistance, research, and related support services for providers of rural transportation with no local s hare required.
Chart 5A shows the level of funding of these programs for the year 2000.
The total from all funding sources is over $76 million.

Ohio Funding for Transit Co mpared to Selected States The federal programs for mass transit included in TEA- 21, assist Ohio and neighboring states in meeting the demand for multi- modal services.
The sources of in- state revenue that Ohio's neighboring states use for mass transit funding and 1999 funding levels are listed in Table 5B.
The funding levels represent the amount of revenue from the state and are exclusive of any local funding efforts.
86
Table 5B: Sources of State Funding for Mass Transit 
*Detailed below for each state.
**Local tax levies provide additional transit funding
As shown in the table, Ohio's support for mass transit from state revenues falls below the levels provided for in three neighboring states.
Ohio's funding is about 10% of Michigan's funding level, and the percentage decreases when compared with funding in Illinois or Pennsylvania.
The following listing further details Ohio's and neighboring states' funding sources for mass transit.
Illinois Â· General funds Â· General obligation bond proceeds Â· Local tax levies Indiana Â· Public Mass Transportation Fund (PMTF) consists of 0.76% of the 5% state sales tax Kentucky Â· General funds Michigan Â· General obligation bond proceeds Â· The Comprehensive Transportation Fund consists of: - 10% of the Michigan Transportation Fund, which consists of motor fuel taxes and motor vehicle registration revenues - Not less than 27.9% of 25% of the state sales tax collected at 4% on the sale of motor vehicles, motor fuels, and motor vehicle parts and accessories Â· Local tax levies
87
Ohio Â· General funds Â· Local taxes levied at the county level Pennsylvania Â· General funds attributed are from a 6% state sales tax, and a 2.1% state income tax Â· General obligation bond proceeds Â· Lottery funds Â· Other state- dedicated revenue includes: - One dollar fee from the sale of new tires - 3% tax on the lease of motor vehicles - $2 per day tax on the rental of motor vehicles - Public utility realty tax of 7.6.mills on each dollar of taxable realty - Mandatory and supplemental set- asides of state sales tax revenue West Virginia Â· General funds Â· Local tax levies at the city and/or county level
Examples of Mass Transit Need: LBO Transit Survey Responses Nine transit systems were surveyed throughout the state of Ohio, which represent the varying sizes and obligation authorities to which ODOT and the Federal Transit Administration provide funding and funding assistance.
These systems, according to transit category, are as follows: Category I - Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) Â­ Cleveland Category II - Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) Â­ Columbus (did not respond) Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (MVRTA) Â­ Dayton Southwest Regional Transit Authority (SORTA)Â­ Cincinnati Category III - Metro Regional Transit Authority (MRTA)Â­ Akron Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority (TARTA) Â­ Toledo Category IV- Lorain County Transit (LCT)Â­ Lorain Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) Â­ Canton (did not respond) Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA) Â­ Youngstown Category V - No systems in this category were contacted through the Mass Transit survey, but local governments were given the opportunity to respond in the Local Government survey.
88
Each system was asked to provide actual and estimated revenue source information (federal, state, and ocal) from calendar years 1998 to 2003.
In addition to this data, the transit l systems were asked to give suggestions as to what measures the state of Ohio could employ to ensure reliable and adequate transit funding.
The following section more fully describes each of the transit systems surveyed, including funding category, levels of existing need, and specific recommendations for generating additional state and local revenue sources to meet transit needs.
In total, the seven responding systems detailed annual additional capital and operating need of about $121 million.
However, GCRTA accounted for $95 million or 76% of the total need.
Category I Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority - The Greater Cleveland Aut hority reports that it needs an additional $60 million in capital funding and an additional $35 million in operating funding per year to meet system demands.
Needs met by this increase in funding would include increases in paratransit services and in both capital and operating long range plan projects.
The authority made the following suggestions for possible alternative revenue sources for mass transit : Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Broaden the sales tax base Increase gas taxes and allocate to transit; fund highway patrol through general fund revenues freeing gas tax funds for transit Increase motor vehicle registration tax and allocate to transit More support is needed from the state because of the increased ne ed for either local matches or for local funding entirely Increase the local parking tax and allocate to transit Create special assessment districts Implement a surcharge on car rental fuel Levy an airport tax Charge impact fees Create economic/joint development partnerships Increase sales tax
Category II Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority Â­ Reported no additional need for funding.
Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) Â­ SORTA reported needing an average of $12.5 million per year over the next 5 years.
SORTA estimated that approximately $1.25 million of this total revenue could be raised locally.
89
Category 2 authorities made the following suggestions for possible alternative revenue sources for mass transit: Â· Â· Â· Greater flexibility on state funds Either increase or implement state and/or local sales, gas, and parking taxes to be allocated to mass transit Raise the procurement threshold fo r competitive bidding from $25,000 to $100,000
Category III Metro Regional Transit Authority Â­ This authority, which serves the Akron area, reported needing an additional $6 to $12 million dollars per year for bus replacements and other capital equipment upgrades.
The Authority estimates that an increase in the local sales tax of .25% would cover the amount needed.
Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority (TARTA) Â­ TARTA estimates that an additional $1 million per year is needed for bus replacement, expansion, and facility improvements.
These authorities made the following suggestions for additional revenue for mass transit needs : Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Dedicate the state motor vehicle fuel tax for mass transit Additional funding from the general revenue fund A state wide sales tax allocation for mass transit Increase the countywide sales tax for allocation to mass transit A local gas tax levy for mass transit A transit surcharge on vehicle registration and licenses
Category IV Lorain County Transit Â­ The authority reported need of $2 million per year to expand service by three routes per year and to add three additional buses per year for three years.
Western Reserve Transit Authority Â­ Reported additional need of $1.5 million per year for operating and capital expenses, including vehicle replacement.
These authorities made the following suggestions for possible alternative revenue sources for mass transit needs: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Increase the state gas tax Dedicate a portion of the state sales tax or income tax Create a dedicated statewide source for mass transit Increases in local sales and property taxes and allocated to a dedicated line item in the County budget Allocate a portion of local income taxes for mass transit
90
Category IV Local governments responding to the LBO survey were asked if they anticipated a ne ed to establish or expand public transit service in their community in the next ten years.
Although only one- third of local governments reported having public transit service, even a lower percentage, 27 percent, reported needing new or expanded service.
Thirty- eight percent of counties and 47% of cities reported that they would need new or expanded transit service in the next ten years.
In contrast, only 18% of townships and 6% of villages reported that they would need new or expanded service.
91
Part 6 Local Transportation and the Law This section of the report details in a summary fashion some of the legal requirements and authority local governments have under the Ohio Revised Code for maintaining roads and bridges and for raising revenue for transpor tation purposes.
The law behind the information presented in this report is often lengthy and complex, but any changes to the current system require, at least, a basic understanding of this information.
This presentation begins by outlining the legal sections that set forth the responsibilities for road and bridge maintenance responsibilities.
Then, relevant sections of the Ohio Constitution are discussed.
Finally, a detailed summary of local government authority to raise revenue for transportation purposes follows.
Legal Responsibility for Roads and Bridges Table 6A below shows the Revised Code sections that detail local and state responsibilities for road ownership and maintenance.
Chapter 5535 of the revised code details the types of highways in the sta te and section 5535.01 delineates the classification of Ohio's public highways into state, county, and township roads.
Revised Code Section 5501.31 gives ODOT responsibility for the inter- county or state highway system except for inside cities.
Section 723.01 makes municipalities responsible for the roads inside their boundaries, except as provided for in section 5501.31.
Finally, Ohio Revised Code Section 5535.08 gives townships and counties the permission to make agreements to work on one another's roads.

Township Roads Outside Township Inside Township
Responsibility as it applies to bridges is classified in Table 6B by the authority for inspection and by the section of Revised Code that authorizes actual bridge construction, major maintenance and repair.
ODOT is responsible for construction and inspection of bridges carrying or crossing state highways with the exception of Turnpike br idges, and ODNR bridges.
The county engineer inspects all bridges or portions of bridges on the county highway system inside and outside of municipalities, bridges on township roads, and other bridges or portions of bridges assigned to the county by law or agreement.
Bridges within a municipality (on a state highway) that cross a waterway are the responsibility of the county.
If law or agreement does not implicitly state the responsibility for inspection of a bridge and the county performs the largest share of maintenance on a bridge, inspections are made by
92
the engineer.
Bridges within a municipality that cross streets are the responsibility of the municipality, including those on state highways.
Bridges on township roads are inspected and maintained by the counties.

The Ohio Constitution and Transportation To better understand the following information and issues, it is important to first look at relevant portions of the Ohio Constitution.
Section 6 of Article VIII prohibits local governments from becoming stockholders in, raising money for, and lending their credit to any private enterpris e. Section 2 of Article XII limits property taxes to 1% of true value, but empowers the General Assembly to authorize higher taxes when approved by the voters of the taxing district or permitted by a municipal charter.
Section 5a of Article XII restricts the use of state motor vehicle license and fuel taxes to highway- related purposes.
This section impinges on local spending for roads because part of the revenue is distributed to local governments.
Section 9 of Article XII requires that at least half the income, estate, and inheritance taxes collected under state law be returned to the local taxing districts of origin.
The constitutional provision does not limit the use of such taxes by the districts.
Article XVIII provides for municipal home rule, but Â§ 13 of the article authorizes the General Assembly to limit municipal power to levy taxes and collect debts, and Â§ 11 limits special assessments for the appropriation of private property in connection with a public improvement to 50% of the cost of the appropriation.
Section 3 of Article X permits counties to adopt charters and exercise the same home - rule powers as municipalities.
Summit County is the only county to have adopted a charter.
In the presentation that follows, the term county means a non- charter county, but it should be remembered that Summit County has the same authority as a municipal corporation except where that authority is limited by the Summit County charter.

Revenue Raising Authority for Transportation Purposes Local Authority to Levy Taxes for Transpo rtation Purposes Property Taxes Chapter 5705 of the Revised Code grants authority to political subdivisions to levy taxes on real and personal property and imposes restrictions on that authority.
For the most part, the chapter spe aks in general terms, but there are a few provisions addressed to particular subdivisions or particular purposes.
R.C. 5705.02 limits the amount of property taxes that may be levied by a subdivision to ten mills per dollar of valuation.
Within the ten- mill limitation, there may be both general and special tax levies.
Subdivisions may levy property taxes "for the purpose of paying the current operating expenses of the subdivisions and acquiring or constructing permanent improvements."
R.C. 5705.03.
The general levy for current expenses may include amounts for the acquisition or construction of permanent improvements, other than the construction or repair of roads and bridges in counties and townships.
R.C. 5705.05.
Special levies within the ten- mill limitation may be made for any specific permanent improvement that the subdivision is authorized by law to acquire or construct.
R.C. 5705.06(A).
A county may have special levies for the construction and repair of its roads and bridges, and for its share of the cost of construction and maintenance of state highways.
R.C. 5705.06(D) and (E).
A township may have special levies for the construction and repair of roads and bridges, excluding state roads and bridges, but including the township's share of the cost of constructing or repairing county roads and bridges.
R.C. 5705.06(F).
(The use of special levies is qualified when a township does roadwork upon petition.
R.C. 5571.07 and 5573.07.
See the general- revenue portion of this letter, below.)
A township that has created a road improvement district may also levy a tax of up to three mills for district purposes, subject to the combined maximum rate for all taxes.
R.C. 5573.211.
The ten- mill limitation may be exceeded upon approval of the people of a sub division at an election.
R.C. 5705.03, 5705.07.
Approved levies in excess of ten mills may be for current operating expenses and permanent improvements.
R.C. 5705.03(A).
The ten- mill limitation does not apply to municipal corporations whose charters pe rmit levies beyond that amount without a vote of the people.
R.C. 5705.18.
All subdivision revenue derived from a general levy, whether within or exceeding the tenmill limitation, and all revenue from other sources that is not otherwise earmarked by law, are paid into the subdivision's general revenue fund; revenue from a special levy is paid into a special fund for the purpose for which the levy was made.
R.C. 5705.10.
Revenue derived from a special levy, therefore, may not be used for roads, bridges, or mass- transit projects unless the levy was made for those specific purposes.
Income Taxes Under the home - rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution, a municipal corporation may impose an income tax.
Village of Ottawa Hills v. Joelson (1975) 45 Ohio App. 2d 176.
94
Chapter 718.
of the Revised Code sets forth the procedure for imposing a municipal income tax and other matters relating to the tax.
Since Chapter 718.
does not limit the purposes for which the tax may be levied, these purposes would be any municipal purposes allowed by law.
The list of municipal powers in Chapter 717.
is very broad and specifically includes various provisions for the construction and repair of roads and bridges, rail property, and subways.
Even Chapter 717.
does not exhaust the authority of municipal corporations, which may constitutionally exercise "all powers of local self- government . . . as are not in conflict with general laws."
OHIO CONST. art.
XVIII, Â§ 3.
Such powers include the expenditure of funds for public transportation projects not specifically enumerated in Chapter 718.
Counties and townships do not have legal authority to impose an income tax.
However, joint economic development districts created under R.C. 715.70 or 715.71 and each consisting of one or more municipal corporations and one or more townships may impose an income tax.
The purpose of these districts is to "...facilitat[e] economic development..." which could conceivably include road, bridge, and mass- transit projects.
Excise Taxes Townships, including those with limited home- rule powers, may enact only those taxes that are authorized by general law.
R.C. 505.04.
Under R.C. 5739.101, resort- area townships may levy a tax for general- revenue purposes of up to 1.5% on sales and on certain types of transportation of passengers and property.
The broader home- rule powers of municipal corporations include the power to tax without specific legislative authorization.
However, municipal powers may be limited by implication under the doctrine of preemption, which holds that when the state "occupies a field," subdivisions are precluded from acting within that field.
The Ohio Supreme Court formerly held that the adoption of excise taxes by the state precluded municipalities from passing their own excise taxes.
Recently, however, the court overruled the earlier decisions and held that municipal taxing power can be limited only by express act of the General Assembly.
Cincinnati Bell Tel.
Co. v. City of Cincinnati (1998) 81 Ohio St. 3d 599.
The Revised Code cont ains no provisions expressly restricting the power of municipal corporations to levy excise taxes.
(Nor does the Revised Code specifically limit municipal authority to levy other kinds of taxes, except for taxes on property.)
Cincinnati Bell would appear to make redundant those statutes, such as R.C. 5739.101 (the resort- area tax) and 5739.02(D) (the tax on recreation and sports clubs), that expressly grant to municipalities the power to levy excise taxes.
Counties have no home - rule powers.
However, the General Assembly has conferred upon them the authority to impose various excise taxes.
A board of county commissioners may, subject to permissive referendum, adopt a sales tax of up to 1% on retail sales for generalrevenue purposes, for supporting criminal and administrative justice services, or both.
R.C. 5739.021.
If a county adopts a sales tax, it must also levy a corresponding use tax.
R.C. 5739.021(E), 5741.021.
R.C. 5739.026 allows for an additional sales tax of .25% or .5 % on most retail sales (there are watercraft and motor- vehicle exceptions) for certain enumerated purposes, including support of a transit authority, financing of permanent improvements, and adding to general revenue.
An additional sales tax must be accompanied by an equivale nt additional use tax.
R.C. 5739.026(E), 5741.023.
The Revised Code specifically requires that money raised by a county sales tax levied under Â§ 5739.021 and the corresponding use tax be 95
credited to the general fund for any purpose, including permanent improvements, for which general funds may be used, and that revenue from additional sales and use taxes levied under R.C. 5739.026 and 5741.023 be spent for the purposes specified in the resolution authorizing the levy.
R.C. 5739.211, 5741.031.
Under R.C. 5743.024, counties may levy a tax on the sale of cigarettes not exceeding 2.25 mills per cigarette for certain purposes, including the supply of revenue for permanent improvements.
Authority to Levy Assessments for Transportation Purposes A special assessment is a charge upon real property that is specially benefited by an improvement.
Townships may levy special assessments for the improvement of waterways (R.C. 505.88), and townships that have limited home rule under Chapter 504.
may levy special assessments for certain purposes unrelated to transportation.
Otherwise, only municipal corporations may levy special assessments.
R.C. 727.01 grants the power for enumerated purposes, including the improvement of roads and watercourses.
The statute makes no mention of mass- transit expenses or bridges.
Since roads go over bridges, however, the latter may be encompassed within roads.
A special assessment for repaving a street that was originally paved within the previous 20 years may not exceed one- half of the cost of repaving.
R.C. 727.04.
A municipal corporation must pay at least 2% of the cost of any improvement for which a special assessment is levied and pay the entire cost of intersections (R.C. 727.05), except when an intersection is improved as a result of a petition of property owners made pursuant to R.C. 727.06.
R.C. 727.08 lists the various costs of a public improvement that may be paid from special assessments, such as surveys, labor and materials, damages, and so on, but the list is not exclusive.
In addition to the authority expressly granted by Chapter 727., municipal corporations may have general home- rule power to levy special assessments under the reasoning of the recent Cincinnati Bell decision, discussed above, dealing with the power to tax.
However, there are no cases that specifically apply this reasoning to special assessments.
Authority to Issue Debt for Transportation Purposes Chapter 133.
of the Revised Code, the Uniform Public Securities Law, limits the amount of net indebtedness a political subdivision may incur.
For municipal corporations, the ceiling is 5.5% of the municipality's tax valuation without a popular vote or 10.5% with voter approval.
R.C. 133.05.
For counties, the ceiling is 1% of tax valuation without voter approval; with voter approval, the limit varies with the size of the county.
R.C. 133.07.
Except as permitted by R.C. 505.262 in relation to equipment, buildings, and sites, townships that have not adopted limited home rule may not incur any indebtedness without voter authorization; the debt ceiling for such townships is 5% of the township's tax valuation.
R.C. 133.09.
Townships with limited home rule have the same debt limits as counties.
R.C. 133.09.
96
Chapter 133.
does not generally restrict the purpo ses for which subdivisions may incur debt.
However, R.C. 133.07 does place upon counties a limit of .5% of tax valuation for the construction, maintenance, or repair of state highways, unless the electors approve a higher percentage.
With this exception, townships, counties, and municipal corporations may incur debt within the stated limitations for any purpose within their powers, unless their own charters impose additional restrictions.
See 21 O. Jur. 3d, Counties, Townships, and Municipal Corporations , Â§ 770; 77 O. Jur. 3d, Public Securities, Â§ 20.
Chapter 133.
specifies how the indebtedness of the various subdivisions is to be calculated.
Many types of securities are omitted from the calculation.
For example, self- supporting securities are not counted.
These are securities that are financed by receipts generated by the improvement being funded rather than by taxes.
R.C. 133.01(LL).
Securities issued for the purpose of constructing or improving roads or bridges may also be excluded from the calculation of indebtedness if they are financed by motor vehicle license and fuel taxes distributed to the subdivision by the state under Chapters 4501., 4503., 4504., or 5735.
It is possible that other securities omitted from the calculation may be used to fund transportationrelated projects, but the types mentioned here would seem to be the chief ones.
See R.C. 133.05, 133.07, and 133.09 for the methods of calculation.
Authority to Expend General Revenues for Transportation Purposes Every subdivision is required by law to establish both a general fund and special funds for revenue that the law requires to be devoted to particular purposes.
R.C. 5705.09.
A general fund or general revenue fund is a government's chief operating fund from which it pays its "ordinary and incidental" expenses.
BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 682 (7th ed. 1999).
To the extent that the payment of road, bridge, and mass- transit projects and expenses are within the general powers of a local government, they may be paid from the general fund, unless the Revised Code otherwise provides.
Counties have the authority to construct and improve roads.
R.C. 5555.02.
When acting upon petition, they may finance road improvements through a combination of assessments and tax levies.
R.C. 5555.41 provides that from 35% to 50% of the cost "shall be paid out of the proceeds of any levies for road purposes upon the grand duplicate of all taxable property in the county, or out of any funds available therefore."
(This section also provides for an apportionment of costs among the counties and townships in which the improvement is located.
R.C. 5555.43 allows for modification of the apportionment by agreement.)
The quoted words imply that general revenues may be used for road improvements.
(Subdivisions generally maintain road improvement funds, in part because they receive state and federal money for the specific purpose of funding road- related improvements.
See, e.g., R.C. 4501.04, providing for distribution of revenue from state motor vehicle registrat ion fees.
However, money may always be transferred from the general revenue fund to any other fund of the subdivision.
R.C. 5705.14(E).)
When a county road improvement has been authorized without petition, it may be paid for through assessments or taxes.
R.C. 5571.01 authorizes townships to construct and repair public roads, including county and state roads.
Under certain circumstances, when a township relocates, constructs, or improves a road upon petition of landowners, the landowners must bear the e xpense of the work.
R.C. 97
5571.011, 5571.07.
Generally, however, when a township builds or improves a road upon petition, the work is paid for in the first instance by assessments, with any balance being covered by a tax levy for road purposes and then from other funds available in the township treasury.
R.C. 5571.07, 5573.07.
A road project that is done by unanimous vote of the trustees, without petition, may be paid for by assessments or a combination of tax levies and other available funds.
R.C. 5573.07, 5573.09.
Authority to Cooperate with Other Political Subdivisions for Transportation Purposes The Revised Code provides for the creation of joint economic development zones (JEDZ) and joint economic development districts (JEDD), both of which are intergovernmental entities intended to foster economic development.
A JEDZ (R.C. 715.69, 715.691) is formed by an agreement among two or more municipal corporations "to share in the costs of improvements."
The Code does not define improvements, but presumably they would include roads, bridges, and mass- transit facilities.
The Code permits the imposition of a JEDZ income tax, but does not preclude other forms of financing that are otherwise available to the contracting parties.
A JEDD (R.C. 715.70- 715.83) is created by agreement among municipal corporations, on the one hand, and charter counties or certain categories of townships, on the other.
R.C. 715.70.
A JEDD may construct "facilities" and "improvements" (R.C. 715.70(D)(1)), which again are not defined but probably include transportation infrastructure.
The JEDD agreement must specify the contributions of the contracting parties including money, real or personal property, or services.
Presumably, the contributions would have to be raised by means otherwise available to the contracting parties.
The JEDD itself may raise revenue through a district income tax (R.C. 715.70(F)) and the sale of industrial development bonds (R.C. 715.82).
Apart from JEDDs, municipal corporations and townships may enter into cooperative economic development agreements with each other under R.C. 701.07.
Upon consent of all the original contracting parties, counties may be permitted to join an agreement.
The agreement may provide for the "provision of . . . improvements," which explicitly include "roadways."
R.C. 701.07 lists various financing matters that may be included in the agreement, but some of them relate to payments by one subdivision to another.
For example, one subdivision may pay service fees to another for t he extension of sewer or water services.
For the construction of new improvements to be jointly financed, the parties might resort to the issuance of debt obligations provided for in the statute.
Municipal corporations may also enter into agreements with each other for the joint construction or management of public works and improvements under R.C. 715.02.
The section authorizes a municipal corporation to issue bonds for any joint improvement for which it could have issued bonds if it were acting alone.
Counties may enter into agreements with each other for joint road improvement projects pursuant to R.C. 5555.21 through 5555.34.
The improvement may be paid for through a combination of tax levies for road purposes and special assessments.
R.C. 5555.25, 5555.41.
Townships may also engage in joint road projects and pay for them in similar fashion.
R.C. 98
5573.15.
A township having a improvement agreement with a agreed- upon share of the cost through a combination of taxes,
road improvement district may enter into a cooperative road county under R.C. 5573.22, with ea ch subdivision paying its of the improvement.
The improvement may be financed bonds, and assessments.
Chapter 5540.
of the Revised Code provides for the creation of transportation improvements districts by boards of county commissioners.
A district's board of trustees may include members of the legislative authorities of certain municipal corporations and townships within the district.
R.C. 5540.02(C).
However, a district does not have to ob tain the consent of a subdivision through which certain highways built or improved by the district pass.
Chapter 5540.
is intended to provide the means for major bridge and highway projects.
Although the chapter is to be liberally construed (R.C. 5540.16), it might be a stretch to say that masstransit projects fall within its ambit.
The powers of a district related to financing include the power to issue revenue bonds and bonds pursuant to section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution (R.C. 5540.03(A)(5), 5540.06), to accept federal, state, and local governmental funds (R.C. 5540.03(A)(10)), to establish tolls or user charges for projects (R.C. 5540.03(A)(12)), and to levy special assessments (R.C. 5540.031), The Revised Code includes other sections a uthorizing intergovernmental cooperation for other purposes, such as the construction of sports facilities (R.C. 307.696) or the improvement of parks (R.C. 755.16), which may incidentally involve some road or bridge improvement.
Authority to Use Private M oneys for Transportation Purposes Section 6 of Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution prohibits local governments from lending their aid or credit to individuals or private businesses.
Section 13 of Article VIII creates an exception to Â§ 6 for aid to "ind ustry, commerce, distribution, and research."
In most situations, the aid addressed in these sections runs from the government to private parties.
Section 13, however, expressly authorizes Ohio corporations to lend or contribute money to the state or its subdivisions, "on such terms as may be agreed upon," to further the purposes of the section.
The Ohio courts have not addressed the question of whether roads, bridges, and mass- transit projects fall within these purposes, but the General Assembly has passed laws pursuant to Â§ 13 for the development of rail service (R.C. 4921.85) and in connection with port authorities (R.C. 4582.01) and transportation improvement districts (R.C. 5540.03).
If the General Assembly's understanding of the purposes of Â§ 13 is correct, then subdivisions may accept and use money from private corporations for any road, bridge, or mass- transit project that could be connected in some way to the development of industry, commerce, or distribution.
Private parties are always free to donate money to the government unconditionally, but a conditional donation might be unconstitutional.
The Ohio Supreme Court has held that "partnerships" between local governments and private entities are forbidden.
See David M. Gold, Public Aid to Private Enterprise Under the Ohio Constitution: Sections 4, 6, and 13 of Article VIII in Historical Perspective, 16 U. TOL. L. REV. 405 (1985) (in the LSC library).
A donation of private funds for the purpose of improving a road in front of the donor's home could be viewed as a prohibited partnership.
99
R.C. 5709.40- 5709.43 and 5709.73- 5709.75 permit municipal and township tax increment financing (TIF) of private economic development projects that meet certain criteria.
A TIF plan grants tax exemptions to the developers for improvements to real property other than public improvements.
(The exclusion of public improvements is explicit in R.C. 5709.40(A)(2).
It seems to be implied in R.C. 570973(A)(2).)
However, the municipality or township may require service payments in lieu of taxes, and such payments may be used to finance public improvements associated with a TIF project.
R.C. 5709.40(D), 5709.42, 5709.75, 5709.75.
There are no reported court decisions that consider whether TIF plans constitute prohibited "partnerships" under the Ohio Constitution.
Authority to Use Fine or Fee Revenue for Transportation
The Revised Code has numerous provisions related to the disposition of fines and civil penalties.
In many instances, the fines and penalties must be credited to particular funds.
For example, fines collected under R.C. 955.44 are deposited in the county dog and kennel fund; most of the fines paid pursuant to R.C. 3719.21 (controlled substances) go to the occupational licensing and regulatory fund; civil penalties paid under R.C. 3704.06 (pollution) are credited to the (state) environmental education and air pollution funds.
A political subdivision may spend money it collects as fines or penalties on roads, bridge, and mass- transit systems if that money has been properly credited to the subdivision's general fund or to a special fund dedicated to the purpose.
The Revised Code provides for several such special funds.
R.C. 4513.35 provides that, with certain exceptions, all fines collected under Chapters 4511.
and 4513.
"Shall be paid into the county treasury and . . . placed to the credit of the fund for the maintenance of the highways within that county."
Under R.C. 5577.99 and 5589.13, fines collected for the violation of statutes related to weight loads on highways and the maintenance of property along roads are paid into the county treasury and credited to the fund for road maintenance and repair.
Fines paid by a railroad for the obstruction of a public road are paid to the township in which the obstruction occurred and must be used for road improvement.

Appendix A Local Government Survey Instrument
TRANSPORTATION SURVEY Assessing local government needs and funding for roads, bridges, and mass transit
Section 10 of Am.
Sub. H.B. 163 of the 123rd Ohio General Assembly states: "The Legislative Budget Office...shall to meet the local construction and maintenance identify possible alternative sources of revenue state and distributed to local governments.
The of funds to local projects could be done in ways conduct a study to determine the needs for additional resources needs for highways, bridges, and mass t ransit.
The study shall that could be imposed by local governments, or imposed by the study also shall consider whether and how the state's allocation more responsive to local needs...."
This survey is an important part of the study the Legislative Budget Office is undertaking on behalf of the state Legislature.
The survey is broken into four self-contained parts a contains both budgetary and local policy nd questions designed to meet the General Assembly's goals (as stated above) for the transportation study.
The information obtained from this survey will be incorporated into the final report to the Ohio General Assembly.
