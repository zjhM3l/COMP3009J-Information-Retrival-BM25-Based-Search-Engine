COMPREHENSIVE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PLANNING GUIDELINES for the Post Oak Savannah Ecological Region of East Texas and the Blackland Prairie Ecological Region of Central Texas (Prepared in partial fulfillment of the requirements of HB 1358 - Wildlife Management Property Tax Valuation) The Texas Constitution and the legislature now provide those with a current 1-d-1 Agricultural Valuation (often known as an Ag Exemption) an opportunity to change at an equal tax value from primarily ag use to primarily wildlife use through a Wildlife Management Tax Valuation.
To immediately determine if you may qualify for the Wildlife Use Valuation, please refer to Appendix A, the 1-d-1w Wildlife Use Appraisal Checklist, or call or visit your County Tax Appraiser.
HB 1358 by Representative Clyde Alexander provided that the landowner must implement and complete at least one management practice from at least three of the seven wildlife management activities listed in Appendix B. Most landowners interested in wildlife can meet this requirement, and implement several practices beyond the minimum required.
A Sample Wildlife Management Plan for 1-d-1w is attached in Appendix C.
This provides a quick review and example of how a landowner may go about preparing a wildlife management plan for their property.
It is highly recommended that the landowner prepare a wildlife management plan, and almost every county appraiser requires a wildlife and habitat management plan to review the context, extent and time-frame of selected practices.
The "plan" must address a separate practice in at least three of the seven wildlife management categories.
The following is intended to provide the landowner with information to develop their own plan.
The plan may be as simple or as extensive as the landowner chooses.
These practices are intended as guidelines.
Certain site-specific situations may necessitate changes that can be allowed, if based on trained resource professionals' recommendations.
A wildlife management plan describes historic and current land use practices, establishes landowner goals and objectives (also family goals if desired) for the property, and describes specific activities and practices designed to benefit wildlife species of interest and their habitats.
This is the landowner's plan, designed by the landowner, with the possible assistance of a wildlife biologist of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department [TPWD], Texas Agricultural Extension Service [TAEX]
Efforts to perform activities identified in the plan are completely voluntary on the part of the landowner, except those practices that are necessary to maintain the agricultural appraisal for wildlife management use.
A complete plan will likely include elements of all seven listed wildlife management activity categories.
4
Landowners of smaller properties that cannot by themselves meet intensity requirements for wildlife management use may choose to be an active member of a Wildlife Management Association (wildlife co-op) that is actively working under a cooperative wildlife management plan and participating in key practices.
For more information about forming or joining a Wildlife Management Association, contact Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (800/792-1112) or your county extension agent.
General Habitat Management Considerations/Recommendations: Fundamental requirements that must be considered when managing wildlife habitat include food, cover, water and the proper distribution of these elements.
Wildlife and habitat management should be directed at maintaining a productive and healthy ecosystem.
The ecosystem consists of the plant and animal communities found in an area along with soil, air, water and sunlight.
All management activities should be aimed at conserving and improving the quantity and quality of soils, water and vegetation.
Managing for plant diversity is essential.
A diverse habitat has a good mixture of various species of grasses, forbs (weeds), and browse (woody) plants.
Many of these plants will be at various stages of growth, which adds another element of diversity.
The diversity of vegetation increases the availability of food and cover for wildlife species.
A greater diversity of range plants results in more food being made available during different periods of the year.
The volume and diversity of plants protects the soil from erosion.
Also, the decomposition of vegetation helps restore needed minerals to the soil to sustain plant life.
Vegetation improves the water cycle by increasing water infiltration into the soil and reducing surface runoff.
An ecologically based habitat management program serves to improve water cycling, mineral cycling, and energy flow and manipulate plant succession.
These processes enhance vegetative quantity, quality and diversity.
A greater diversity of all life forms, including microorganisms, insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals may be achieved under sound management.
The land's long term health is improved and conserved for future generations to utilize as a source of income, recreation and for aesthetic enjoyment.
Plant communities with a diversity of grasses and native broad-leaved weeds (called forbs) are more productive than those comprised primarily of grasses.
The climax plant community of most rangelands is comprised primarily of perennial grasses with a relatively low forb component.
While this may be suitable for livestock and some grassland wildlife, most species are dependent on the seeds and foliage of forbs.
Periodic disturbances such as fire, soil disturbance, livestock grazing, and mowing can set back plant succession and maintain a diverse plant community, simulating conditions under which plants and animals evolved within ecosystems in Texas.
Below is Blackland objectives presented an example of a plan format that many landowners in the Post Oak Savannah and Prairie may find applicable to their property, depending on their particular goals and .
A fill-in-the-blank plan following this format is attached in Appendix T.
This is to help landowners develop a Wildlife and Habitat Management Plan.
To meet the
5
requirements of the wildlife management tax valuation, a landowner must annually implement and complete at least one management PRACTICE from at least three of the seven wildlife management ACTIVITIES (i.e. Habitat Control, Erosion Control, Predator Control, Providing Supplemental Supplies of Water, Providing Supplemental Supplies of Food, Providing Shelter, and Making Census Counts to Determine Population).
Again, a complete plan will likely include more than three activities, and may include several practices under each activity.
Space is provided throughout the plan [ ] for the land manager to designate the management practices that will be implemented.

Specific Habitat Management Practices, By Activity
A.
HABITAT CONTROL
[
] GRAZING MANAGEMENT
(Refer to Appendix D - Livestock Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific grazing proposal for the plan.)
Grazing management is the planned manipulation of livestock numbers and grazing intensities to increase food, cover, or improve structure in the habitat of selected species.
Grazing management includes: 1) kind and class of livestock grazed, 2) determination and adjustment of stocking rates, 3) implementation of a grazing system that provides planned Continuous grazing without rest is detrimental to wildlife.
periodic rest for pastures by controlling grazing intensity and duration, and/or 4) excluding livestock from sensitive areas to prevent trampling, allow for vegetative recovery, or eliminate competition for food and cover.
Planned deferments can be short or long term up to 2 years.
Extended rest from grazing (two years or more, if necessary) may be required on some ranges.
Seasonal stocker operations may be appropriate to manipulate habitat.
Supplemental livestock water (earthen tanks, troughs, wells, piping) to facilitate deferred-rotation grazing of livestock and disperse grazing pressure may be incorporated into planning to improve wildlife habitat.
Similarly, it is important to plan and design fence construction to facilitate deferred-rotation grazing of livestock.
Fencing can also be used to enhance or protect sensitive areas, woodlands, wetlands, riparian areas and spring sites as designated in plan.
Activities should be reviewed annually.
Select the type of grazing system to be implemented.
Also attach an initial grazing schedule as an addendum to the plan.

Briefly describe and show on a map: ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ [ ] PRESCRIBED BURNING
(Refer to Appendix E - Vegetation Management Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific burning proposal for the plan.)
Using a drip torch to create a prescribed fire is an excellent management practice that simulates the natural cycles that these ecosystems evol ved under, and enhances habitats and plant diversity.
Prescribed burning is the planned application of fire to enhance habitat and plant diversity, increase food, manipulate cover, or improve structure in the habitat of selected species.
Plans should indicate a minimum percent of acreage and general burning cycle (eg., minimum of 15 percent of acreage annually burned over 7 years in the Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie).
Attach a written burning plan as an addendum to the Wildlife and Habitat Management Plan (burn plans and prescribed burning
12
should only be attempted with aid of professionals).
The plan should include a map that shows the areas to be burned and the planned dates (month and year) that each area will be burned during the burning cycle.
It should also designate areas to be protected from burning, and should incorporate flexibility during periods/ years when conditions are not favorable.
Planned acreage to be burned__________ Date to be burned_________ Completed acreage burned__________ Date burned__________ Specific areas (eg., sensitive sites) to be protected from burning.
Briefly describe and show on a map: ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________
[
] RANGE ENHANCEMENT (Range Reseeding)
Establish native herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) that provide food and cover for wildlife or erosion control benefits.
Plant species selected and methods for establishment should be applicable to the county (non-native species are generally not recommended, but if required for a specific purpose, non-native species should not exceed 25 percent of the seeding mix).
If nonnative species must be used to achieve a specific goal, species used must not be invasive or aggressive.
Seeding mixtures providing maximum native plant diversity are recommended.
Many herbaceous broadleaf plants (known as forbs - weeds and wildflowers) are beneficial to wildlife for forage and/or seed production.
A list of key species adapted to the Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie are: little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, sideoats grama, switchgrass, native sunflower, tick clovers, three-seeded mercury, ragweeds, crotons, vetches, dayflower, cutleaf primrose, bur clover, sweet clovers, smartweeds, lespedezas, partridge pea, sensitive briar, snow-on-the-prairie, Illinois bundleflower, and Engelmann daisy.).
Encourage "weed and wildflower" species by selective application of chemical, biological (eg., grazing management) and/or mechanical means on native rangelands, Conservation Reserve Program lands, and tame grass pastures (eg., coastal bermuda).
Some periodic weed control may be needed in fields converted to native rangeland to assist in the establishment of desirable vegetation.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan and designed to reestablish native habitats within a specified time frame.
Range Enhancement should annually affect a minimum of 10% of the total area designated in the plan, or a minimum of 10 acres annually, whichever is smaller, until the project is completed.
Show the designated areas where Range Enhancement is to be implemented on a map.

[
] BRUSH MANAGEMENT
(Refer to Appendix E - Vegetation Management Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific brush management proposal for the plan.)
Brush management may be the removal or establishment of woody plants.
It can be the selective removal or suppression of target woody species, including exotics, to allow the increased production of desirable trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs for forage and nesting or protective cover for selected species.
Brush Management practices should annually affect a minimum of 10% of the total area designated in the plan, or a minimum of 10 acres annually, whichever is smaller.
This practice includes retaining the proper kind, amount, and distribution of woody cover for selected species.
Brush management planning must consider wildlife cover requirements, soil types, slope angle and direction, soil loss and erosion factors, and subsequent planning to control re-invasion.
This practice also includes retention of snags to provide cover and nesting sites for cavity nesting animals.
When used, herbicides should be applied in strict accordance with label directions.
This practice shrub species and/or shelter be a part of an can include the planting of a minimum of 150 individuals of native tree and per acre per year for the area designated in the plan to provide food, corridors using species and methods as described in appendices.

Annually and seasonally protect the vegetation and soils in riparian areas (low areas on either side of stream courses) from mismanagement, such as caused by excessive, long-term livestock trampling or caused by poor timber harvest practices.
Riparian management and enhancement can include providing livestock with alternate watering sites, deferring livestock grazing in pastures with riparian areas during critical periods of the year, total exclusion of livestock from pastures with riparian areas, and fencing riparian areas to exclude or provide short duration grazing by livestock.
Establish trees, shrubs, or herbaceous vegetation along streams or water courses to provide food, cover, and travel corridors, and to reduce erosion.
Corridors should be at least 100 yards wide.
Restore important forested habitats including bottomland hardwoods and turkey roost sites.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
A minimum of one Riparian Management and Enhancement project must be implemented every 5 years to qualify.
Show the planned project(s) on a map.

Annually provide seasonal or permanent water for roosting, feeding, or nesting habitat for wetland wildlife.
This practice involves shallow wetland management, creation or restoration, greentree reservoir creation or management, and other moist soil management such as rotational grazing or exclusion (fencing out) of livestock from wetlands, especially during the growing season.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
Annual management as described in management plan, such as water level manipulation, is required to qualify.
Construction of a new project will qualify for 5 years.
Briefly describe the proposed Wetland Enhancement project(s) and identify on a map: ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________
Over 50% of Texas' wetlands have disappeared.
Wetland management, restoration or creation is extremely important for wetland dependent wildlife.
16
[
] HABITAT PROTECTION FOR SPECIES OF CONCERN
Planned protection and management of land or a portion of land to provide habitat for an endangered, threatened or rare species, such as fencing off critical areas, managing vegetation structure and diversity within species parameters, establishing and maintaining firebreaks to protect critical overstory vegetation, and annually monitoring the species of concern.
This practice includes the management/protection of nesting sites, feeding areas, and other critical habitat limiting factors, and the development of additional Houston toads occur in the southern post oak on certain soil types.
areas.
(Refer to Appendix I for information on the management of the federally endangered Houston Toad and federally threatened Southern Bald Eagle, both of which may occur in portions of the Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie).
The broad-scale management of habitat for migrating/wintering/ breeding neotropical birds (primarily songbirds) should follow guidelines in appendix for zones of importance (See Appendix J).
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
A minimum of one project must be implemented every 5 years to qualify.

[
] PRESCRIBED CONTROL OF NATIVE, EXOTIC AND FERAL SPECIES
Use legal means to control the number of grazing and browsing animals.
Maintain the population density of native wildlife (particularly white-tailed deer -- see Appendix F) at the carrying capacity of the habitat to prevent overuse of desirable plant species and enhance habitat for native wildlife species.
Populations of Feral hogs compete dir ectly with native wildlife, and very destructive of habitats. exotics, feral animals, and wildlife should be strictly controlled to minimize negative impact on native wildlife and habitat.
This should incorporate harvest and vegetative monitoring over time to assess control intensity and impact on habitat to meet plan objectives.
Remove or control exotic vegetation impacting native habitats and wildlife populations (eg., large stands of Chinese tallow tree, kudzu, weeping lovegrass, etc.).
Convert tame pasture grasses (such as large areas of coastal bermuda, klinegrass, old world bluestems) to native vegetation.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
The removal or control of exotic vegetation or the conversion of tame grass pastures must affect a minimum of 10% of the area designated in the plan, or 10 acres annually, whichever is smaller.
Briefly describe the proposed Prescribed Control of Native, Exotic, and Feral Species project(s) and show on a map as applicable: ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________

EROSION CONTROL
[
] POND CONSTRUCTION AND MAJOR REPAIR
Construction or major repair of a permanent water pond for the purpose of preventing, stopping, or controlling erosion as part of an approved NRCS erosion control structure.
The project must provide habitat diversity and wildlife benefits.
Creation/restoration of shallow water areas as primary production wetlands, and associated water level control and management, should be associated with ponds at every opportunity.
A minimum of one project must be completed every 5 years to qualify.

19
[
] GULLY SHAPING
Reducing erosion rates on severely eroded areas by smoothing with top soil to acceptable grades and reestablishing vegetation, primarily native vegetation, with sensitivity to existing wildlife cover and woody vegetation that provides travel corridors.
Area must be interseeded with species that provide food and/or cover for wildlife to be applicable (see range enhancement guidelines).
This practice may include the feeding of large numbers of cattle on gully sites to contour the eroded areas by way of hoof action to aid in the recovery of the site.
Practice must be a part of the plan.
A minimum of one project must be completed every 5 years to qualify.
Proposed Gully Shaping Project(s) and show on a map as applicable: Total acreage to be treated__________ Acres treated annually __________ Seeding mix used for reestablishment of vegetation__________ Planned date of construction__________
[
] STREAMSIDE, POND, AND W ETLAND REVEGETATION
Re-vegetating areas along creeks, streams, ponds, and wetlands to reduce erosion and sedimentation, stabilize stream banks, improve plant diversity, and improve wildlife value of sensitive areas.
This practice can include: (a) the construction of permanent or temporary fences
20
to exclude, limit, or seasonally graze livestock in order to prevent erosion; (b) the use of native hay to slow and spread water runoff, in areas where vegetation has been recently reestablished (seeds in the hay aid in re-vegetation); (c) establishing vegetative buffer areas or filter strips along water courses or other runoff areas; (d) establishment of 3:1 upland buffer to lake basin/wetland acreage in diverse grass/legume/forb mixture to prevent sedimentation; (e) the installation of rip-rap, dredge spoil, or other barrier material - placement of material along erodible embankments to prevent erosion and protect wildlife habitat; (f) the establishment of stream crossings to provide permanent low water crossings in order to reduce or prevent erosion.Refer to Agroforestry Notes - "A Riparian Buffer Design for Cropland"? This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
A minimum of one project must be completed every 3 years, affecting a minimum of 5 acres per project.
Proposed Streamside, Pond, and Wetland Restoration Project(s) and show on a map as applicable: Techniques to be used: [ ] native hay bales [ ]
[
] PLANT ESTABLISHMENT ON CRITICAL AREAS (erodible)
Primarily for erosion control, the establishment of native woody or herbaceous vegetation can also provide food and/or cover for wildlife and restore native habitat.
This practice can include: (a) establish and manage wind breaks/shelter-belts by planting multi-row shelter-belts (at least 4 rows in 120' width by1/4 mile in length), renovate old shelter-belts (re-fence, root-prune, and replace dead trees), and establish shrub mottes, improve plant diversity, and improve wildlife habitat; (b) establish perennial vegetation on terraces and field borders (30 yard minimum width) to reduce erosion, improve plant diversity, and improve wildlife habitat; (c) conservation tillage/no-till farming practices by leaving waste grain and stubble on the soil surface until the next planting season to provide supplemental food or cover for wildlife, control erosion, and improve the soil tilth; (d) manage Conservation Reserve Program cover by maintaining perennial cover established under the Conservation Reservation Program (expired contracts) on erodible sites using proper management techniques such as haying, prescribed grazing or prescribed burning.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
A minimum of 150 seedlings per acre must be planted annually on 10 acres or a minimum of 10% of the total designated area treated annually.
Briefly describe the proposed Plant Establishment on Critical Areas projects(s) and show on a map:
21
________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________
[
] DIKE/LEVEE CONSTRUCTION/MANAGEMENT
To establish/maintain wetlands or slow runoff to control or prevent erosion, and to provide habitat for wetland dependent wildlife.
Levee management may include reshaping or repairing damage caused by erosion, and re-vegetating levee areas to reduce erosion and sedimentation, and stabilize levees.
This practice may include fencing to control and manage grazing use, or installation of water control structures.

PREDATOR CONTROL
[
] PREDATOR MANAGEMENT
The management of predator populations to increase survival of target species.
Key native predator species may include coyote, raccoon, bobcat, mountain lion, and rat snakes, while exotic predators may include feral house cat, feral dog, and feral hogs (see imported red fire ants in separate paragraph).
Predator Control alone will not be an applicable practice unless it is part of an overall plan to manage the habitats and populations of the target species.
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department advocates elimination of feral/exotic predators, with the thoughtful management of native predators as an integral part of functioning natural systems.
The predator control plan should be prepared or approved by a competent professional and include the list, duration and intensity of methods to remove the target species annually.

The establishment of locally adapted annual (spring and fall) or perennial forages on suitable
soils to provide supplemental foods and cover during critical periods of the year.
Livestock should be generally excluded from small food plots.
The shape, size, location, and percentage of total land area should be based on requirements for the target species (eg., 2-5% of area for white-tailed deer) and should meet goals of a comprehensive wildlife plan.
A minimum of 1% of the acreage should be planted in both winter and summer food plots.
Managing the habitat for proper nutrition should be the primary management goal.
Supplemental feeding and /or planting of food plots are not a substitute for good management.
These practices should only be considered as "supplements" to the native habitat, not as "cure-alls" for low quality and/or poorly managed habitats.
Supplemental feeding should always be combined with population
Cowpeas are an excellent summer forage for white-tailed deer.

Mow/shred 1/3 of open areas per year, preferably in strips or mosaic types of patterns, to create "edge" and structural diversity.
A wide bar should be placed on the front of the tractor at a height of 1' when mowing to help flush wildlife using this cover.
Weeds are an important source of food for many wildlife species, therefore minimize weed control practices.
Use no till/minimum till agricultural practices to leave waste grain and
32
stubble on the soil surface until the next planting season to provide supplemental food or cover for wildlife, control erosion, and improve soil tilth.
Other forms of supplementing and providing shelter include roadside right-of-way management for ground-nesting birds, establishing perennial vegetation on circle irrigation corners, levees, dikes, terraces, fencerows and field borders, establishing multi-row shelterbelts or renovating old shelterbelts, and protecting and managing old homesites, farmsteads and Conservation Reserve Program cover.
