EXECUTIVE S Committee Charge
UMMARY
Pursuant to Section 26-2-722, Colorado Revised Statutes, the Legislative Welfare Oversight Committee (consisting of all members of the Senate Health, Environment, Children, and Families Committee and all members of the House Health, Environment, Welfare, and Institutions Committee) has the responsibility of overseeing the Colorado Works Program and its implementation by the counties.
The report summarizes the aspects of the Works Program that have been considered during the 2002 interim and any legislation recommended by the committee.
Committee Activities The committee held four meetings during the 2002 interim.
Meetings focused on the current status of the Colorado Works Program and issues affecting low-income individuals and families in Colorado.
The1996 federal welfare reform law, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), changed the focus of welfare to a work-first approach and granted states and counties flexibility in implementing programs according to their unique needs.
Although TANF has been successful in reducing caseloads overall, there continues to be issues affecting low-income individuals and families who are seeking self-sufficiency.
The committee took testimony from representatives of the Department of Human Services and various stakeholders to gain their perspective on the Program and to identify possible approaches for helping low-income families achieve self-sufficiency across the state.
The committee also heard from Berkeley Policy Associates, the organization providing an ongoing evaluation of the Colorado Works Program.
One issue that garnered attention was the need for more child care services for low-income families.
The impact of the downturn in Colorado's economy on low-income families was also discussed.
The committee heard from a national research organization and the National Conference of State Legislatures regarding the effects of alternative welfare policies and welfare trends and policy issues across the states.
The committee was also provided information on alcohol and drug use among public assistance recipients and a grant program that is helping increase the participation of faith-based and community-based organizations in the state's workforce development system.
In addition, two nongovernmental organizations discussed their approaches in helping low-income individuals and families achieve self-sufficiency.
The third meeting of the committee provided an update on the federal reauthorization of welfare reform.
Â­ xi Â­
Committee Recommendations As a result of committee discussion and deliberation, the committee recommended 11 bills for consideration in the 2003 legislative session.
Three of the recommended bills were approved by the Legislative Council.
Bill A -- Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons Eligible for the Colorado Works Program who are Enrolled in Medicaid..
This bill requires the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to work with the Department of Human Services in applying for a federal Medicaid waiver to provide substance abuse treatment services to Medicaid populations who are eligible for the Colorado Works Program.
The bill requires the State Auditor to submit a report five years after the implementation of the waiver analyzing the cost and savings to the state of providing alcohol and drug addiction counseling and treatment.
Bill B -- Domestic Violence Extensions Under the Colorado Works Program.
This bill makes a technical change to the Colorado Works statute to ensure that the usage of domestic violence extensions for persons who have reached the 60-month lifetime limit for receipt of TANF assistance is consistent with federal law.
Bill C -- Changes to the Colorado Works Program as a Result of the Reauthorization by the United States Congress of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
The purpose of this bill is to implement any changes to the Colorado Works Program that may be necessary if reauthorization of TANF is passed by the Congress during 2002 or 2003.

AUTHORI
TY AND
RESPO
NSIBILITIES
The passage of federal and state welfare reform legislation in 1996 and 1997 provided three significant changes: 1) it changed cash assistance for poor families with dependent children from an "entitlement" to a "block grant" subject to an annual appropriation process; 2) it created a "work-first" model of welfare reform in contrast to the previous Family Support Act model that emphasized education and training; and 3) it created definitive time limits, 24 cumulative months in which to find a job or be judged job-ready; and a 60-month lifetime limit in which assistance can be received.
The Colorado Works Program, effective July 1, 1997, replaced the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and the JOBS Program.
The Colorado Works Program provides the state the authority it needs to meet federal welfare reform requirements.
The program also creates a work-first approach to reform that delegates most of the decision-making responsibility and authority for designing welfare reform in Colorado to the county level.
Pursuant to Section 26-2-722, C.R.S., the Legislative Welfare Oversight Committee has the responsibility to oversee the Colorado Works Program and its implementation by the counties.
The committee consists of the members of the House Health, Environment, Welfare, and Institutions Committee and the Senate Health, Environment, Children, and Families Committee.
The statute directs the oversight committee to: Â· Â· Â· submit an annual report; summarize the aspects of the Colorado Works Program that have been considered and propose any recommended legislative changes; and make recommendations concerning how to allocate any funds that the state receives as an illegitimacy bonus reward from the federal government.
In making its recommendations on this issue, the committee shall consider how to make allocations based upon individual counties' success in reducing illegitimacy.

COMMITTEE ACT
IVITIES
During the 2002 interim, the Welfare Oversight Committee heard testimony regarding the status of the Colorado Works Program and issues affecting low-income individuals and families.
In addition, the committee heard about the effects of alternative welfare policies and welfare trends and policy issues across the states, as well as the status of the federal reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program.
Three bills are recommended pertaining to the Colorado Works Program.
Background The Colorado Works Program started July 1, 1997, as required by federal and state statute.
The Welfare Oversight Committee has since met 15 times.
Initially, the focus was on county implementation of welfare reform.
Meetings also focused on the history of welfare reform in Colorado as well as the status of the Colorado Works Program.
Testimony was taken from the Colorado Department of Human Services, county departments of social services, non-profit organizations, and other interested individuals.
Similarly, this year the committee received updates on the status of the Colorado Works Program and heard testimony from various stakeholders to gain their perspective on what issues were being encountered as the program continues its development.
A focus of the testimony was the continuing need to assist Colorado Works clients become less dependent on public assistance and to address concerns about barriers to finding and maintaining employment.
Two non-governmental organizations discussed their approaches for helping low-income families achieve self-sufficiency.
One such organization partners with area employers to help their low-income employees meet basic needs and eliminate barriers to working, such as access to affordable housing and child care.
Status of the Colorado Works Program The committee heard about the effects of the downturn in Colorado's economy on lowincome families and the Colorado Works Program.
In Colorado, the basic cash assistance caseload increased approximately 16 percent since October of 2000.
The rising caseload and the program's responsibility for covering the cost of support services such as child care has caused an increase in expenditures statewide.
Consequently, county reserves for the Colorado Works Program have declined and some counties have had to limit access to services.
Testimony indicated that total county reserves have diminished from a high of $84 million in 2000 to a low of $14.7 million at the end of the 2002 state fiscal year.
Seventeen counties currently do not have any money in their reserves.
Because the Colorado Works Program began in 1997, long-term clients in the Program may be approaching their five year limit for receiving TANF benefits.
However, out of the Â­3Â­
state's total TANF caseload, only a small number of clients have requested extensions to their benefits.
In addition, state and county diversion programs which provide immediate one-time assistance to individuals and families in the form of payments or services have been effective in helping recipients achieve self-sufficiency.
Barriers to Self-Sufficiency Testimony indicated that 85 percent of survey respondents in the evaluation of the Colorado Works Program conducted by Berkeley Policy Associates reported one or more barriers to work.
Employment increases as the number of work barriers decreases.
These barriers include substance abuse, domestic violence, lack of child care, lack of transportation, mental or physical health problems, and lack of education and work skills.
Between 17 and 20 percent of the recipients who leave Colorado Works return within the first year, possibly due to some of these work barriers.
Substance abuse.
According to a Colorado Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division survey of families receiving some type of public assistance, 14 percent of the respondents were identified as having substance abuse or dependence problems at some point in their lifetime and six percent during the past year.
Further, only 27 percent of the survey respondents with a substance abuse problem reported receiving treatment in the prior year.
Access to substance abuse counseling and treatment was noted as one of the Colorado Works Program challenges by the Berkeley Policy Associates evaluation.
Currently, there are limited Medicaid benefits available for substance abuse treatment in Colorado.
Child care.
Access to child care is one of the most serious issues facing low-income families.
Testimony indicated that better access to child care results in increased work rates and benefits families who are trying to achieve self-sufficiency.
Counties are required to provide child care assistance to Colorado Works clients trying to find work.
However, some clients are having difficulty finding child care providers.
In addition, low-income families who are transitioning off the Colorado Works Program are also having difficulty finding child care.
The evaluation of the Colorado Works Program found that 41 percent of respondents stated that a lack of child care was a barrier to work.
Further, due to a lack of funding, some counties have suspended enrollment and changed income eligibility levels for child care programs.
Three potential approaches that were identified to increase access to child care involve increasing the amount of money to the state match for child care funding to draw down more federal dollars, seeking alternative funding sources, and providing incentives for employers to offer a benefit that helps eligible employees pay the parental share of child care costs.
Many grandparents and relatives assume the care of children of Colorado Works clients which may require financial and other assistance to help them in their caretaker role.
Education and work skills.
Testimony on alternative welfare policies and issues across the states indicated that a mixture of education and work-oriented programs have the Â­4Â­
greatest impact on personal incomes.
However, only a small number of Colorado Works clients who lack a high school diploma are participating in basic education activities.
The evaluation of the Colorado Works Program did find that occupational training programs are helping clients improve their earnings capacity.
Other issues.
According to testimony, earned income tax credits and other financial incentives can have a positive impact on low-income individuals' and families' ability to obtain self-sufficiency.
However, awareness and use of both the state and federal earned income tax credits is relatively low among Colorado Works clients.
The committee also heard testimony on other approaches for assisting low-income individuals and families obtain self-sufficiency.
Programs for the promotion of marriage and for the use of community- and faith-based organizations will likely be debated as welfare reform continues.
Testimony indicated that more study is needed to determine whether programs to promote marriage are effective.
In addition, the committee was provided information on a federal grant program that is helping increase the participation of community- and faith-based organizations in the state's workforce development system.
Recommendations.
As a result of the committee's discussions on substance abuse, Bill A requires the state to apply for a federal Medicaid waiver to provide substance abuse treatment services to Medicaid populations who are eligible for the Colorado Works Program.
Bill B makes a technical change to ensure that the usage of domestic violence extensions for persons who have reached the 60-month lifetime limit for receipt of TANF assistance is consistent with federal law.
Federal law allows Colorado to extend more than 20 percent of its TANF caseload beyond the limit of 60 months for clients who face domestic violence.
Federal Reauthorization of TANF The committee was provided an update on the federal reauthorization of TANF.
Testimony centered on the possible outcomes of the reauthorization debate and what the debate may mean for Colorado.
For instance, increased work requirements being considered by Congress may require the state to find new ways to move more TANF recipients into work.
At the end of September, Congress enacted a continuing resolution to extend welfare programs and funding until December 31st.
Without this action, authorization and some of the funding for TANF would have expired on September 30th.
Some of the unresolved issues of the reauthorization debate include work participation rates and hours, defining activities that should be classified as work, child care funding issues, and programs for the promotion of marriage.
If these issues are not resolved, Congress could extend TANF without making substantive changes to the program for another year or more.
A multi-year extension of the TANF program would give Colorado and other states funding and programmatic certainty while extending the program for only one year could impact Colorado's ability to plan its programs.
Â­5Â­
Recommendation.
Bill C would implement any changes to the Colorado Works Program that may be necessary if reauthorization of TANF is passed by Congress during 2002 or 2003.

S
UMMARY OF
RECOMMENDATI
ONS
As a result of the committee's activities, 11 bills were recommended to the Colorado General Assembly.
The Legislative Council reviews each interim committee's recommendations and determines whether the bills fall within the charge of the interim committee.
In the 2002 interim, Legislative Council approved three of the Welfare Oversight Committee's 11 recommended bills.
Bill A -- Concerning Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons Eligible for the Colorado Works Program Who are Enrolled in Medicaid This bill requires the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to work with the Department of Human Services in applying for a federal Medicaid waiver to provide substance abuse treatment services to Medicaid populations who are eligible for the Colorado Works Program.
Once enacted, the waiver cannot be implemented until it is approved by the Joint Budget Committee.
In addition, the bill requires the State Auditor to submit a report five years after the implementation of the waiver analyzing the cost and savings to the state of providing alcohol and drug addiction counseling and treatment to this population.
Bill B -- Concerning Domestic Violence Extensions Under the Colorado Works Program Under federal law, states are allowed to provide a certain number of extensions to the 60-month lifetime limit for receipt of TANF assistance.
This bill makes a technical change to the Colorado Works statute to ensure that the usage of domestic violence extensions for persons who have reached the 60-month lifetime limit for receipt of TANF assistance is consistent with federal law.
Bill C -- Concerning Changes to the Colorado Works Program as a Result of the Reauthorization by the United States Congress of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families The federal welfare reform debate was still ongoing as the 2002 Welfare Oversight Committee finished its work.
The purpose of this bill is to implement any changes to the Colorado Works Program that may be necessary due to any new provisions or changes to the federal law if reauthorization of TANF is passed by the Congress during 2002 or 2003.
