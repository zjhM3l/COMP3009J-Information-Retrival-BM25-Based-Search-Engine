THE VIRGINIA REGISTER INFORMATION PAGE THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is an official state publication issued every other week throughout the year.
Indexes are published quarterly, and the last index of the year is cumulative.
THE VIRGINIA REGISTER has several functions.
The new and amended sections of regulations, both as proposed and as finally adopted, are required by law to be published in THE VIRGINIA REGISTER OF REGULATIONS.
In addition, THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is a source of other information about state government, including all emergency regulations and executive orders issued by the Governor, the Virginia Tax Bulletin issued periodically by the Department of Taxation, and notices of public hearings and open meetings of state agencies.
period; (ii) the Governor exercises his authority to require the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment; (iii) the Governor and the General Assembly exercise their authority to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or (iv) the agency suspends the regulatory process, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the 30-day public comment period.
Proposed regulatory action may be withdrawn by the promulgating agency at any time before the regulation becomes final.
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT, AND REPEAL OF REGULATIONS An agency wishing to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations must first publish in the Virginia Register a notice of intended regulatory action; a basis, purpose, substance and issues statement; an economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget; the agency's response to the economic impact analysis; a summary; a notice giving the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal; and the text of the proposed regulation.
Following publication of the proposal in the Virginia Register, the promulgating agency receives public comments for a minimum of 60 days.
The Governor reviews the proposed regulation to determine if it is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and if it is clearly written and easily understandable.
If the Governor chooses to comment on the proposed regulation, his comments must be transmitted to the agency and the Registrar no later than 15 days following the completion of the 60-day public comment period.
The Governor's comments, if any, will be published in the Virginia Register.
Not less than 15 days following the completion of the 60-day public comment period, the agency may adopt the proposed regulation.
The appropriate standing committee of each branch of the General Assembly may meet during the promulgation or final adoption process and file an objection with the Registrar and the promulgating agency.
The objection will be published in the Virginia Register.
Within 21 days after receipt by the agency of a legislative objection, the agency shall file a response with the Registrar, the objecting legislative committee, and the Governor.
When final action is taken, the agency again publishes the text of the regulation as adopted, highlighting all changes made to the proposed regulation and explaining any substantial changes made since publication of the proposal.
A 30-day final adoption period begins upon final publication in the Virginia Register.
The Governor may review the final regulation during this time and, if he objects, forward his objection to the Registrar and the agency.
In addition to or in lieu of filing a formal objection, the Governor may suspend the effective date of a portion or all of a regulation until the end of the next regular General Assembly session by issuing a directive signed by a majority of the members of the appropriate standing committees and the Governor.
The Governor's objection or suspension of the regulation, or both, will be published in the Virginia Register.
If the Governor finds that changes made to the proposed regulation have substantial impact, he may require the agency to provide an additional 30-day public comment period on the changes.
Notice of the additional public comment period required by the Governor will be published in the Virginia Register.
The agency shall suspend the regulatory process for 30 days when it receives requests from 25 or more individuals to solicit additional public comment, unless the agency determines that the changes have minor or inconsequential impact.
A regulation becomes effective at the conclusion of the 30-day final adoption period, or at any other later date specified by the promulgating agency, unless (i) a legislative objection has been filed, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the 21-day extension
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS If an agency demonstrates that (i) there is an immediate threat to the public's health or safety; or (ii) Virginia statutory law, the appropriation act, federal law, or federal regulation requires a regulation to take effect no later than (a) 280 days from the enactment in the case of Virginia or federal law or the appropriation act, or (b) 280 days from the effective date of a federal regulation, it then requests the Governor's approval to adopt an emergency regulation.
The emergency regulation becomes operative upon its adoption and filing with the Registrar of Regulations, unless a later date is specified.
Emergency regulations are limited to addressing specifically defined situations and may not exceed 12 months in duration.
Emergency regulations are published as soon as possible in the Register.
During the time the emergency status is in effect, the agency may proceed with the adoption of permanent regulations through the usual procedures.
To begin promulgating the replacement regulation, the agency must (i) file the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action with the Registrar within 60 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation; and (ii) file the proposed regulation with the Registrar within 180 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation.
If the agency chooses not to adopt the regulations, the emergency status ends when the prescribed time limit expires.
STATEMENT The foregoing constitutes a generalized statement of the procedures to be followed.
For specific statutory language, it is suggested that Article 2 (Â§ 9-6.14:7.1 et seq.) of Chapter 1.1:1 of the Code of Virginia be examined carefully.

EDUCATION STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Notice of Intended Regulatory Action Notice is hereby given in accordance with Â§ 9-6.14:7.1 of the Code of Virginia that the State Board of Education intends to consider amending regulations entitled: 8 VAC 20-131-10 et seq.
Regulations Establishing Standards for Accrediting Public Schools in Virginia.
The purpose of the proposed action is to incorporate new language as required by Â§ 22.1253.13:4 F of the Code of Virginia (enacted by the 1998 Session of the General Assembly) which requires the State Board of Education to develop criteria for recognizing exemplary performance in vocational studies by students who have completed the requirements for a standard or advanced studies diploma and to award seals on the diploma of students meeting such criteria.
The agency intends to hold a public hearing on the proposed action after publication.

No. R99-17; Filed September 9, 1998, 10:46 a.m.
(DGIF) has informed the department that the amendment classifying the section as a stockable trout water which became effective in December 1997 is incorrect.
Intent: The intent of the amendment is to protect the aquatic life expected to inhabit the Jackson River.
Need: The amendment is necessary in order to correctly classify the stream to protect the aquatic life which is expected to inhabit the stream and ensure that Westvaco's point source discharges to the stream are not required to install additional treatment capability.
Alternatives Available to Meet the Need: Water quality standards are regulations; therefore, a regulatory action is necessary to meet the need of the intended regulatory action based on DGIF advising the department that the current regulatory classification is incorrect.
There may be options as to the specific designation of stockable trout water, if any, within this stretch of the Jackson River.
These will be developed in conjunction with the DGIF based on their technical data on the designation and public comment received in response to this notice.
Comments: Comments are requested on the intended regulatory action, including any ideas to assist the department in the development of the proposal.
Comments are also requested on the costs and benefits of the stated alternatives or other alternatives.
Participatory Approach and Public Meeting: The State Water Control Board has authorized the department to develop the proposed regulation without using the participatory approach and without holding a public meeting.
Public Hearing: The State Water Control Board will convene a public hearing on the proposed regulation after publication of the proposal.
This has not been scheduled yet.
Statutory Authority: Virginia.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Â§ 9-6.14:7.1 of the Code of Virginia that the State Water Control Board intends to consider amending regulations entitled: 9 VAC 25-260-10 et seq.
Water Quality Standards.
The purpose of the proposed action is to consider whether the board should amend the Upper James River Basin section tables to correct the stream classification of a small section of the Jackson River in Alleghany County.
The rulemaking, if adopted, will correctly classify the section from a Class V, stockable trout water, to a Class IV, mountainous zone water.

Water Quality Standards: Designation of Nutrient Enriched Waters.
The purpose of the proposed action is to
Virginia Register of Regulations 106
Notices of Intended Regulatory Action consider whether the board should amend the regulation to designate Stony Creek in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water.
Intent: This designation could have a significant impact on both point and nonpoint source activities in the watershed of this creek and the department intends to provide the public every avenue of public participation, beginning with this Notice of Intended Regulatory Action, in order to ensure the amendment is necessary to protect aquatic life and human health and provide for the maintenance of water quality in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Need: The department's evaluation of agency in-stream nutrient monitoring data for Stony Creek for the period of July 6, 1994, through May 6, 1997, indicates nutrient enriched conditions.
Consequently, the department proposes that the watershed (Stony Creek and its tributaries) qualifies for regulatory designation as a nutrient enriched water.
The basis for this determination was monitoring data for total phosphorus, which is one of three indicators of nutrient enrichment used for regulatory designation of waters as nutrient enriched.
If the water is designated nutrient enriched, a companion regulation, the board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq.) requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less.
Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a flow of 1.005 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus.
The other three point source dischargers in the watershed, Stony Creek Sanitary District, Shrine Mont, and Edinburg Sewage Treatment Plant, have design flows below that covered in the policy and thus would not be required to install phosphorus controls.
If Stony Creek is designated a nutrient enriched water, the Department of Conservation and Recreation would be required to target control measures for nonpoint source nutrient inputs.
Alternatives Available to Meet the Need: In compliance with the State Water Control Board's Public Participation Guidelines, 9 VAC 25-10-10 et seq., the department will consider all alternatives which are considered to be less burdensome and less intrusive for achieving the essential purpose of the proposed regulation and any other alternatives presented during the proposed rulemaking.
Several alternatives have already been considered.
One alternative was to leave the regulation unchanged.
This may appear to be the least intrusive approach; however, such an alternative would not provide a control strategy for the potential water quality degradation in Stony Creek from a documented excess of phosphorus.
There may be other less intrusive alternatives to consider.
For example, other alternatives would be to designate only the mainstem or a portion of the mainstem of Stony Creek as a nutrient enriched water.
Volume 15, Issue 2 107 Request for Comments: Comments are requested on the intended regulatory action, to include any ideas to assist the department in the development of the proposal.
Comments are requested on the costs and benefits of the stated alternatives or other alternatives.
The Department of Environmental Quality also requests comments as to whether the department should use the participatory approach to assist in the development of the proposal.
The participatory approach is defined as a method for the use of (i) standing advisory committees, (ii) ad hoc advisory groups or panels, (iii) consultation with groups or individuals registering interest in working with the agency, or (iv) any combination thereof.
Public Meeting: A public meeting will be held on Tuesday, November 17, 1998, at 7 p.m. in the Shenandoah County Brick Building, 3rd Floor Courtroom, 112 South Main Street in Woodstock.

Regulations for the Repacking of Crab Meat.
The purpose of the proposed action is to adopt regulations establishing criteria by which the Virginia crab industry can safely repack both domestic and imported crab meat.
Repacking involves the removal of crab meat picked and packed at another location and placing it in another container bearing the name of the local packer or distributor.
Virginia is one of the leading blue crab producers in the nation and has established a reputation for a high quality, high value product.
The proposed action may provide for the safety of consumers of crab meat processed in Virginia by (i) establishing minimum processing and shipping standards for the facility originally packing the product to be repacked in Virginia; (ii) establishing minimum product quality standards for crab meat to be repacked in Virginia; (iii) outlining procedures necessary to protect the product from contamination during processing in the Virginia facility; and (iv) establishing labeling and record keeping requirements necessary to maintain the source identity of the repacked Monday, October 12, 1998

collect child support debt from legally obligated parents, using a new technique of seizure and sale of the individual's automobile via the use of a "boot."
The boot is a device which, following proper due process notification, is applied to the wheel of the vehicle by a sheriff or policy officer, thus disabling the vehicle from moving until the boot is removed.
Removal results from the individual's completing full payment of the outstanding child support debt, or reaching a payment agreement plus the payment of at least $500 or 10% of the outstanding balance, whichever is greater.
This procedure has already been used with distinct success in one locality in Virginia, Fairfax County, where local ordinances allow the procedure.

Regulations Pertaining to Horse Racing with Pari-Mutuel Wagering: Participants (amending 11 VAC 10-60-10, 11 VAC 10-6020, 11 VAC 10-60-40, 11 VAC 10-60-70, 11 VAC 10-60-120, 11 VAC 10-60-130, 11 VAC 10-60-140, and 11 VAC 10-60150; adding 11 VAC 10-60-15, 11 VAC 10-60-290, 11 VAC 10-60-300, 11 VAC 10-60-310, and 11 VAC 10-60-320; repealing 11 VAC 10-60-30 and 11 VAC 10-60-60).
Statutory Authority: Â§ 59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: November 18, 1998 - 9:30 a.m.
Public comments may be submitted until December 11, 1998.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: The Virginia Racing Commission derives its statutory authority to promulgate regulations from the provisions of Â§ 59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia.
The section states, in part in subdivision 3, "The Commission shall promulgate regulations and conditions under which horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering shall be conducted in the Commonwealth, and all such other regulations it deems necessary and appropriate to effect the purposes of this chapter."
Purpose: The commission has promulgated this regulation to achieve its statutory purpose of maintaining horse racing in the Commonwealth of the highest quality.
The proposed regulation reflects more closely the intent of the statute regarding the consideration of applications for participation in horse racing thereby eliminating the provisional permit.
Furthermore, the regulation takes into account changes in the standard operating procedures found at most racetracks in the mid-Atlantic region since the current regulation was promulgated seven years ago.
The proposed regulation amends the existing regulation pertaining to participants in horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering to promote the public health, safety and welfare.
Substance: The proposed regulation repeals the sections pertaining to provisional permits and clarifies the procedures under which applications for permits shall be considered by the commission.
The regulation also clarifies the responsibilities of participants regarding alcohol and drug testing, provision of workers' compensation insurance coverage for employees, disorderly conduct and unwarranted objections.
The regulation also specifies that permit holders shall provide a current mailing address.
Further, the regulation incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions, primarily Maryland, regarding the responsibilities placed upon owners of racehorses.
These amendments were necessitated by the demise of the thoroughbred ownership registry of The Jockey Club.
The proposed regulation also incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions as to the responsibilities placed upon jockeys and apprentice jockeys.
It also introduces an apprentice certificate which has been instituted among the racing states in the mid-Atlantic region.
It also establishes a multiple engagement regulation for jockeys which parallels regulations in other jurisdictions.
Finally, the proposed regulation more appropriately shifts four categories of permit holders from the chapter pertaining to racing officials to the chapter pertaining to participants.
Issues: The proposed regulation was promulgated with the input of counsel from the Attorney General's Office as well as the commission's experience in administering the initial race meeting at Colonial Downs.
Furthermore, representatives of the horse industry, primarily the Jockeys' Guild and racing officials from Colonial Downs, were intensely involved in the revision of the regulation.
The proposed regulation essentially updates the previous regulation by eliminating outmoded procedures.
The proposed regulation further creates the advantage of providing uniformity among neighboring jurisdictions while not creating a disadvantage for the Commonwealth or the public.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Â§ 9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 13 (94).
Section 9-6.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic effects.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
This proposed regulation amends existing regulations regarding the qualifications, duties, and responsibilities of participants in pari-mutuel horse racing.
Specifically, the proposed regulation incorporates changes in standard operating procedures for racetracks in the mid-Atlantic region; allows licensees reciprocity if licensed in another state with similar regulatory requirements; and clarifies sections dealing with
Virginia Register of Regulations 116
Proposed Regulations permit application procedures, including the repeal of provisional permits.
According to the Virginia Racing Commission (VRC), these changes are not expected to have an effect on the number of permits issued.
Several sections which previously listed specific requirements (e.g., illegal alcohol content levels for participants, individuals covered under workers' compensation) are replaced with references to the Code of Virginia.
This change would eliminate the need to update the regulations each time there is a statutory change.
Estimated economic impact.
The majority of the proposed changes are essentially technical in nature and are intended to streamline the regulation and bring Virginia's regulations in line with those of other regional racing authorities.
Individually, these changes would not have significant economic consequences, but their overall effect will be to facilitate Virginia's ability to fully participate in the regional horse racing industry.
Fuller participation is likely to result in a small, net economic gain for Virginia's horse racing industry.
Businesses and entities affected.
This proposal will affect all participants in the horse racing industry.
Currently, the commission licenses approximately 5,000 individuals each year, including owners, trainers, jockeys, and grooms.
Localities particularly affected.
The benefits of this proposal will most likely be concentrated in the areas around the Colonial Downs racetrack and regions of the Commonwealth where racehorses are bred and trained.
Projected impact on employment.
This regulation is not expected to have a significant impact on employment in Virginia.
Effects on the use and value of private property.
This regulation is not expected to have a significant effect on the use and value of private property.
Summary of equal footing regulation is of the horse to result in a analysis.
By placing Virginia's regulations on with those of neighboring states, the proposed likely to enhance the potential for development racing industry in Virginia and can be expected small, net economic gain for that industry.
Department of Planning and Analysis: The Virginia Racing the economic impact analysis of Planning and Budget, and the in general agreement with the compensation) are replaced with references to the Code of Virginia.
This change would eliminate the need to update the regulations each time there is a statutory change.
