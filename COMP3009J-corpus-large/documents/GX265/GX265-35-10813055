HISTORY An effort that began in early 1982 has resulted in the construction and operation of a Central Treatment and Recovery Facility (CTRF) in Roseville, Minnesota.
The CTRF receives, treats and recycles inorganic wastes from metal finishing, electroplating and printed circuit board manufacturing industries.
A key part of the concept is the ability to receive and regenerate spent ion exchange resins.
Other waste types handled include acids, alkalis, metals and cyanide solutions as well as metal hydroxide sludges.
The CTRF is called U.S. Filter Recovery Services, Inc.
(USFRS), formerly MRS.
The project was developed jointly by the Metropolitan Recovery Corporation (MRC), a company made up of over 20 metal finishing firms, and Lancy Recovery, Inc., a subsidiary of Lancy International who has commissioned thousands of industrial waste treatment and recovery systems all over the world.
The $11 million project was funded primarily by equity contributions from Lancy and MRC as well as an industrial revenue bond.
A small portion of the project was funded by government grants.
A site for the CTRF was selected in the city of Roseville, Minnesota.
Roseville is a suburb centrally located between the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
A RCRA Part B Permit was sought and obtained and the site was purchased.
With help from the Roseville City Council, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission and several other regulatory agencies, the construction of the facility was underway in September of 1987.
Ten months later, the facility was fully operational and accepting wastes.
Effective July 1, 1992, U.S. Filter Corporation of Palm Desert, California announced that it had completed the major acquisition of METRO RECOVERY SYSTEMS, now known as U.S. Filter Recovery Services, Inc.
USF also stated that USFRS has received a five-year renewal of its Part "B" Permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, and that it was one of only 14 hazardous waste facilities nationwide to win the 1991 Environmental Compliance Award for 100% compliance with regulations.
USFRS was granted this award in 1995 and 1996 as well.
The award was given by Environmental Information Ltd.
With technical and manufacturing support from the other U.S. Filter subsidiaries, USFRS intends to maintain a leadership position by introducing new technologies for metals recovery, effluent polishing, waste treatment and hazardous sludge stabilization.
United States Filter Corporation is a leading global provider of industrial and municipal water and wastewater treatment systems, products and services, with an installed base of systems that the company believes is one of the largest worldwide.
The Company markets a broad line of water distribution, sewer and storm water equipment and supplies.
In addition, the Company sells, installs and services a wide range of water treatment and bottled water products for the residential and consumer markets.
To learn more about United States Filters' 468 sales, service and manufacturing offices in 29 countries and over $2 billion in assets, visit http:// www.usfilter.com.
United States Filter is traded under the ticker symbol, "USF" on the N.Y.S.E.
The CTRF has grown from serving 23 firms to well over 800, and from a one-shift operation to an around-theclock operation.
The CTRF can provide single source responsibility to handle all of a firm's waste or can be used to augment or enhance existing treatment.
Extensive analysis undertaken during the planning stages as well as operations to date have indicated that centralized recovery and treatment of industrial waste is cost effective for most of the area's surface finishing and electronics manufacturing plants.
Member firm benefits are not confined to reduced capital and operating costs.
Individual plants are also benefiting from professional waste management and technical support provided by USFRS, waste minimization, reduced floor space and manpower requirements, and decreased potential for liability associated with disposal of hazardous wastes.
USFRS provides additional liability protection by insuring that, with the exception of a small percentage of offsite remediation debris, all residuals from our processes are also recycled or recovered, not disposed.

XL PROJECT US FILTER RECOVERY SERVICES, INC. Roseville, Minnesota
1.0 XL Background U.S. Filter Recovery Services, Inc.
(USFRS) is proposing to conduct a "Project XL priority action item outlined in President Clinton's and Vice President Gore's March 16, 1995, document titled, Reinventing Environmental Regulation and noticed in the May 23, 1995 Federal Register.
Project XL provides an exciting opportunity to test new and innovative ways to protect our environment.
We will use the XL project mechanism to change the way we conduct our business, resulting in a "cleaner, cheaper, and smarter" approach to environmental regulation.
This innovative approach will be beneficial for the following reasons: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Superior Environmental Performance Regulatory Flexibility Stakeholder Involvement Innovative/Multi-Media Pollution Prevention Transferability Feasibility Results are Measurable Avoids Shifting of Risk Burden
2.0 Project Theme USFRS proposes to increase recycling, promote recovery, reduce PBT (Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxins) discharge to the environment, and reduce the need for the production of hazardous chemicals.
This will be achieved by removing regulatory and financial barriers to legitimate recycling and recovery.
At this time, there are portions of the regulations, which create obstacles to higher levels of waste management.
It may be less costly, draw less regulatory oversight, and avoid the rigors and stigma of the Resource Conservation 
This can be done by neutralizing and sewering corrosives on-site, rather than recycling through USFRS and conserving this resource.
Or, rather than treat and recycle rinse water, discharge the effluent along with its associated PBTs to a wastewater treatment facility.
In choosing to recycle acids and water treatment resins, the user moves from the Clean Water Act (CWA) to RCRA.
This requires the use of a hazardous waste manifest, a hazardous waste transporter, reporting, and other appropriate RCRA standards, which may serve as barriers to choosing recycling.
It also adds the stigma of being a hazardous waste generator to the facilities operation.
Something many green-minded companies spend significant additional resources to avoid.
Many proactive companies have internal goals that require them to minimize hazardous waste generation.
This, because corporate has decided that hazardous waste generation is an affront to their reputation as an environmentally responsible company.
This proposal seeks to test removing selected RCRA requirements that USFRS and its customers believe are obstacles to legitimate recycling and recovery.
This, while retaining RCRA's environmental safeguards for these environmentally hazardous materials.
If successful, this project can offer new pathways for US EPA and states to encourage legitimate recycling and recovery where they currently do not exist.
4
3.0 Proposal Overview By participating in Project XL, USFRS will have the opportunity to promote advanced recycling and recovery options.
The regulatory relief provided to both USFRS and its customers through Project XL will make it more attractive to take advantage of recycling and recovery as an option.
USFRS also proposes to spearhead a cooperative effort among USFRS customers, regulatory agencies, and pertinent trade organizations to provide business with both the regulatory and technical resources to increase environmental compliance and pollution prevention.
The success of this project will be transferable to similar waste management scenarios at both USFRS and other facilities.
These successes will outline new pathways to the MPCA and US EPA to refine regulations and streamline procedures that would conserve resources while utilizing superior environmental performance.
The primary immediate environmental benefit would be moving the management of materials up the pollution prevention hierarchy ladder, resulting in source reduction, increased recycling and recovery, as well as, water conservation.
Superior environmental performance will be accomplished by raising the level of management of the participating wastes from treatment and disposal to recycling and recovery, as well as, adding significant pollution prevention.
Because final management of these materials will be at a RCRA Part B permitted facility; waste management will be conducted by a smaller number of more highly trained individuals.
This will reduce overall worker exposure.
The XL Project will only include materials where advanced recovery is involved.
An example of advanced recovery is USFRS's hydrochloric acid recovery system, which is one of only three in the world.
Environmental Justice will not be an issue for this project.
No disadvantaged or minority populations reside in the vicinity of USFRS.
The closest residential area is 2,500 feet from the facility.
It is a middle class, primarily white, neighborhood.
The regulatory flexibility of this project involves exempting selected wastes from certain RCRA requirements that discourage recycling.
For example: a facility presently meeting CWA requirements for a vessel holding acid waste that wanted to recycle the waste acid would have to significantly upgrade the tank to meet the more stringent RCRA hazardous waste requirements.
These costs are added on top of the economic disadvantage that recycling and reuse already face, widening that gap.
USFRS is requesting that materials processed as part of this project be exempted from the manifesting and reporting requirements under RCRA, and be given additional flexibility within the storage requirements.
We believe the removal of the RCRA stigma, manifesting, reporting and storage requirements, will be adequate to encourage legitimate recycling and recovery.
Potential customers of USFRS during recent facility audits have stated that this relief from RCRA is a significant incentive.
The flexibility provided to XL participants would minimize additional generator operating requirements when switching to legitimate recycling and recovery under USFRS's Project XL.
Alternate management requirements have been established for the management of wastes in this project).
These alternate requirements will increase the environmental protection over their current status by removing participating hazardous materials from the original generators facility to a fully permitted, Part B facility, with all its built in environmental safeguards.
All shipments of XL materials will be carried by a permitted hazardous waste transporter.
The risk burden will be reduced by this project by shifting the handling of these hazardous materials to a smaller number of more highly trained and equipped individuals, under a more highly restrictive and protective regulation.

See Appendix A for a detailed rule matrix.
Measurable Results will be provided by the direct HCL and resins recycled in 1997 will be used as a base line year will be used as the measurement of agent, the volume of wastewater recycled, and the tracked.
measurement of recycled waste volumes.
The volumes of base line and the increase in volumes recovered over that success of this project.
The reduced need for a neutralizing reduction of metals loading to the environment will also be a
Although this project would slightly increase transportation of hazardous waste, both the overall volume and distance hazardous materials are shipped would decrease.
This, because of the much greater distance replacement chemicals are currently shipped.
This is discussed further in Appendix D, under Hydrochloric Acid Recovery System benefits.
4.0 Projects The following are the two initial projects included in this implementation plan.
Both promote legitimate recycling and/or recovery of valuable resources by removing regulatory disincentives to higher forms of environmental management.
This will test these new approaches within the scope of this project, limiting the opportunity for misuse or risk to the environment.
In addition to the two projects, USFRS will serve as a regulatory resource for both the customers involved in this project, as well as others in those general industry sectors.
Concepts embodied in the USFRS proposal includes product stewardship / life cycle management and the centralized treatment and recovery facility.
The primary environmental benefits of the USFRS XL proposal include increased recycling, a reduction in virgin chemical purchases, increased environmental compliance and protection, as well as, significant pollution prevention.
As a commercial facility, USFRS is able to extend the opportunities of Project XL to smaller businesses that do not otherwise have the resources to take advantage of these technologies.
4.1 Project - Product Stewardship/Life-cycle Management This project involves materials USFRS can recycle, reclaim, or extend their life cycle.
USFRS proposes to take on the responsibility of tracking these wastes and reporting to the appropriate agencies the amount received from each generator.
USFRS and the appropriate regulatory agencies will have approval authority over all materials that are included in the product stewardship program.
6
There are 352 potential customers (i.e. metal platers, coaters, semiconductor, and finishers) in Minnesota that could take part in this project.
As this project shows success, USFRS and the agencies may identify additional materials that may be appropriate to add.
This would further expand the potential number participants to this project.
This project will have both enforceable and voluntary commitments.
Materials that are not handled under the criteria established for this project, including the tracking and reporting requirements, would not be covered under its protection.
These commitments would be enforceable and would fall under the authority and potential penalties of RCRA.
The success of the project at diverting spent materials from treatment to recycling and recovery will be a voluntary commitment.
The success of the voluntary commitments will be limited by the cost competitiveness of recycling vs. treatment 
US EPA requires verification of the success of a project through a two Tier process.
USFRS will document its success by using the following: Tier #l Verification 1.
Documentation of recovery, track pounds of recovered materials and quality 2.
Track volume of incoming waste by generator 3.

PROJECT 4.1.A - HYDROCHLORIC ACID RECOVERY SYSTEM Waste Source Electroplaters use hydrochloric acid to pickle metal parts prior to electroplating.
The pickling process dissolves rust from the parts and results in an activated surface, which ensures good metal adhesion.
When hydrochloric acid is spent, it contains high levels of metals (up to 100 grams per liter of copper, zinc, nickel, chromium, cadmium, and iron) and free acid (5 to 15 percent by weight).
Although there is no such thing as an average generator, the most common would be a "job shop metal finisher".
They would probably be located within 20 miles of USFRS and have 50 or more employees.
They would generate approximately 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of waste hydrochloric acid a year.
7
Typical Treatment Typical treatment for spent hydrochloric acid is to neutralize the free acidity with a sodium hydroxide or lime and precipitate the metals into a sludge.
The resulting liquid is then polished and discharged to the sewer.
This treatment results in a great deal of chemical usage (caustic) and wasting of free acidity.
This method of treatment is legal and well established.
It is regulated under the CWA under most circumstances.
Current Disincentives to Recycle Currently, a facility can neutralize spent hydrochloric acid (HCl) on-site and discharge the effluent to a wastewater treatment facility and avoid regulation under RCRA.
Recycling moves this spent HCl from regulation under the CWA and places it under RCRA.
Under RCRA, the facility must then meet all the corresponding requirements that include the storage, treatment, tracking and reporting as a hazardous waste generator.
Cost is also a disincentive to recycling.
The average on-site neutralization treatment cost to a generator is about $ 0.95 per gallon.
Bulk cost of recycling is about $1.00 per gallon.
For drum quantities, because of the increased cost of handling, the cost is about $2.00 per gallon.
Any RCRA requirements added to a generators operation (i.e. tank or storage area upgrades) would further widen this gap.
Making recycling even less economically competitive with treatment and disposal.
This cost and the RCRA stigma have been described by potential USFRS customers as sufficient to discourage them from recycling their spent HCl.
One major customer, who had accepted the higher cost of recycling, reverted back to treatment and disposal when they recognized the increased requirements that RCRA added.
Hydrochloric Acid Recovery System USFRS has a vacuum fractional distillation system to recover the free acidity from spent acids.
The acid is distilled (under vacuum conditions) which drives off hydrochloric acid and water vapors.
The hydrochloric acid vapors are condensed into an 18-20% hydrochloric acid product, which contains less than 10 mg/L metals.
This product is sold back to metal finishing clients for use in their pickling processes.
USFRS also uses hydrochloric acid internally for ion exchange regeneration.
Distilled water is also recovered from the process and reused in the USFRS facility.
The metals are concentrated in the distillation bottoms product.
They are precipitated and recovered and reused at an off-site smelter that recovers the lead, zinc, and cadmium.
The mixed metal residue from that smelting process is then used as a feedstock curing agent in cement manufacturing.
This project would work on a similar principal to the Feedstock definition given to about one-third of USFRS current business.
A major portion of our operation is involved in recycling copper containing etchant.
These etchants are a hazardous waste, however, because of their value they are sold back to generators after processing.
The recovered copper is also sold as a product.
The Feedstock classification allows for these materials to have a reduced set of RCRA requirements.
Projected Benefits: USFRS projects that, if approved, this portion of the project over the three years of the project will: a) Reduce discharge of neutralized effluent to the POTW by 2.6 million gallons.
b) Reduce the discharge of salt by approximately 2.3 million pounds to the POTW. c) Reduce the purchase of caustic for neutralization by participating facilities by 3.5 million pounds.
d) Reduce the purchase of virgin acid by 5.4 million pounds.
A more detailed discussion of benefits is located in Appendix D.

PROJECT 4.1.B -WATER REUSE RESIN Waste Source Electroplaters, metal finishers, and other industries use large volumes of water to wash and rinse materials during the manufacturing process.
This high use of water puts an unnecessary burden on water supply and wastewater treatment resources.
For this type of service, there is no typical generator.
It could include any industry that generates heavy metal contaminated wastewater.
However, the average generation rate per customer is about 1,100 gallons of resin per year.
Typical Treatment In most manufacturing processes today; wash and rinse water is used once, then discarded.
This "single-use" waste water is directed to an on-site waste water treatment plant where it is treated to levels required by the CWA prior to discharge to a POTW or surface waters.
This single-use of water is very wasteful.
A great amount of effort and cost is expended to produce potable water for this single use.
Additional costs are incurred in treating these lightly contaminated wastewaters prior to discharge.
Current Disincentives to Implement Water Reuse System To minimize water use, a water treatment system that utilizes an ion exchange resin can be installed.
One gallon of resin can treat anywhere from 500 to 2,000 (average 1,000) gallons of rinse.
Because of RCRA's "derived from rule", most metal finishing and electroplating operations, water reuse systems generate a listed hazardous waste (F006).
This, even though there is only a negligible hazard.
As above, this moves a company from the CWA to RCRA, with the corresponding regulatory obligations, i.e. paperwork and reporting burden, as well as hazardous waste storage and transportation requirements.
Resin Regeneration Process at USFRS Three types of ion exchange resins are used to provide systems which allow water to be reused.
Cation resin removes positively charged ions, such as copper, nickel and zinc, from rinse water and replaces these ions with hydrogen ions.
Anion resin removes negatively charged ions, such as chromate, sulfate, and nitrate, from rinse water and replaces these ions with hydroxide ions.
The third resin type is called a mixed bed resin and contains a mixture of both cation and anion resins.
Mixed bed resin is most often used in water reuse applications because it totally deionizes the water, removing all cations and anions and producing highly purified water.
The regeneration process is essentially a reverse of the loading process.
Contaminant ions are removed from the resins using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solutions.
Mixed bed resins are first separated from each other before regeneration.
Cation resin is placed into a tall column.
The first step of regenerating is to backwash the resin by flowing water up into the resin from below.
The resin beads fluidize, allowing debris and other adhering dirt to be washed off the resin.
The next step is to flow a hydrochloric acid solution through the resin.
This process strips metals and other cations from the resin and replaces them with hydrogen ions.
The final step is flowing water through the resin to remove excess acid.
Anion resin is regenerated in the same manner except that sodium hydroxide is used to strip the anions from the resin, leaving hydroxide ion on the resin.
The chemicals used by USFRS in the regeneration process are further recovered as follows: 1) The recovered acid is sold either to a user or used over again by USFRS in the resin regeneration process; 2) Hydroxide is recovered and used for neutralization of acid metal wastes received at USFRS; and 3) The metal hydroxide sludge's produced in this process are recovered for reuse by a secondary metals recovery company.
9
Projected Benefits.
In 1997, USFRS recycled 46,000 gallons of mixed bed resin.
By evaluating the potential market, the cost effectiveness of water reuse, and the incentives offered by the XL Project, USFRS has projected an increase in the volume of Ion exchange units that will likely be placed in service through this project.
It is projected that this project will result in an increase of 202,000 gallons of resin used over the three years of the Project.
With an estimated average of 1,000 gallons of water being treated per gallon of resin used, this would reduce the need for potable water and the discharge to the POTW by 202 million gallons each.
A more detailed discussion of benefits in located in Appendix D. 4.1.X.
General Project Qualifications For a waste to qualify for the USFRS Project XL, it must satisfy all the following requirements: 1) The material has a current, definable, regulatory barrier to its legitimate recycling or reuse.
2) The material must have a value or use as a feedstock or recyclable material for the generation of a salable or useable product that replaces a current commercial product.
3) The material must be able to be handled, treated and processed at USFRS.
4.2 Regulatory Resource In addition to the environmental benefits provided by this project, USFRS will also assist with the development of an outreach program which will serve as a technical and or regulatory resource for the target industries.
The focus will be in the metal finishing sector.
This is one of US EPA's targeted industries for the reinvention of environmental regulation and is currently participating in the Common Sense Initiative.
According to the MPCA's records, this sector also makes up the largest portion of large quantity generators in Minnesota.
USFRS is currently planning to work with the Minnesota Metal Finisher Association in developing a self-audit program which will include a self-audit book and periodic participation in actual 3rd party audits.
This will be used to assist participants with regulatory compliance requirements.
It will also include P2 where appropriate.
USFRS projects that this self-audit form will be useful for approximately 360 Minnesota companies.
5.0 XL Participant Approvals Appendix B includes a copy of the participant agreement form to be used as part of this project.
This will require the signature of the customer and USFRS.
The MPCA and appropriate counties responsible for RCRA compliance of the participants will receive copies of this agreement.
This contract includes: Â· Description of all XL requirements.
Â· Identifies all responsible parties.
Â· Identifies all wastes that are a part of this project.
Prior to inclusion into this project, USFRS will provide each of the appropriate regulatory agencies the opportunity to reject a company or its particular waste stream from participation in this project.
The agencies involved would include: US EPA, MPCA, MCES, Ramsey County, and the county agency of participating customers.
This would be done by issuing a letter to the designated agency contact listing the company and waste streams.
If one of the agencies vetoes their participation, the company will be dropped from consideration.
If additional factors come to light at a later date, the agencies will have the authority to remove that facility from the project.
A letter requesting the company's removal would be sufficient.
10
6.0 Monitoring/Record Keeping/ Accounting To track XL Project Materials, USFRS will use a special bill of lading that contains comparable information held on the Uniform Minnesota Hazardous Waste Manifest.
A copy of this bill of lading will be provided for agency approval prior to use.
Including the parameters used to determine the success of this project, all information normally required on a biannual hazardous waste report will also be collected.
This will be provided to the agencies on a to-bedetermined schedule.
USFRS will maintain records from this project for the length of its XL permit and, at a minimum three (3) years 7.0 Stakeholder Involvement As of October 9, 1998 USFRS had conducted 6 Project XL Stakeholder meetings.
These have been held at both public buildings and at the USFRS facility.
This has allowed participants an opportunity to tour our operations, as well as, meet at local neutral sites.
Statements of Substantial Consensus from the participating Stakeholders are attached to the submittal cover letter to US EPA.
A list of the participants and a description of the Stakeholder Involvement Plan is attached as Appendix C.

8.0 Permit Duration The XL Permit is intended to remain in effect for 5 years.
As well as having the authority to discontinue this project, the MPCA or USFRS also have the option of extending this project if appropriate.
This project will be reviewed at the 4-year mark to determine if this project has been a success.
Project extension or termination will be evaluated at that time.

APPENDIX C U. S. Filter Recovery Services Project XL Stakeholder Involvement Plan I. Introduction U. S. Filter Recovery Services (USFRS) is a part of U. S. Filter, the World's leading provider of water and wastewater treatment equipment and services.
USFRS products and services are among the most environmentally advanced in the inorganic wastewater treatment industry.
The USFRS decision to pursue a Project XL initiative is an extension of that position.
Environment Excellence has always been the credo at U.S. Filter Recovery Services.
The "XL" in Project XL stands for Excellence and Leadership.
Project XL is a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiative to enable companies to achieve greater environmental benefits by implementing new approaches to existing regulations in the operation and expansion of existing and new facilities.
USFRS' Project XL initiative will achieve greater environmental benefits while affording our customers more flexibility in achieving increased recovery from their manufacturing processes.
An important requirement of Project XL is the involvement of stakeholders throughout the process of developing the technical and legal framework for a Final Project Agreement or FPA. USFRS has established a Project XL Stakeholders group representing and involving individuals of various backgrounds with a direct interest in the project.
The USFRS Stakeholder Involvement Plan (SIP) establishes a process for informing and involving these individuals in the company's development of a Project XL initiative.
The SIP is designed to be modified to respond to and meet changing conditions throughout the Project XL process.
II.
Goals and Objectives The SIP is directed to facilitating communications among the people and organizations (the Stakeholders) involved in USFRS' Project XL initiative.
The goal of the Plan is to obtain substantial consensus on the development and implementation of a Project XL Final Project Agreement that provides enhanced protection to the environment and human health while at the same time providing regulatory flexibility to USFRS' customers.
The objectives of the SIP are as follows: Ã€ Ã€ Ã€ Ã€ Identify stakeholders and their roles in the project.
Develop a system to communicate the project development process to stakeholders.
Create an environment that will allow effective participation by stakeholders.
Foster meaningful communications and dialogue among all stakeholders and USFRS.
III.
Stakeholders As noted in the most recent EPA guidance document on Project XL published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1997, "Stakeholder involvement is critical to the success of each XL project.
Stakeholders provide information about the preferences of the community.
They may identify issues that have escaped the notice of project sponsors and regulators."
Further, EPA noted in the May 23, 1995 Federal Register notice defining the XL program that an important factor in the agency's approval of projects is "the extent to which project proponents have sought and achieved the support of parties that have a stake in the environmental impacts of the project."
19
EPA divides stakeholders into three categories: "Direct participants in project development work intensively' with project sponsors to build a project from the ground up.
The views of direct participant stakeholders will strongly influence the details of the project as well as EPA's ultimate decision to approve or not approve the project."
"Commentors have an interest in the project, but not the desire to participate as intensively in its development.
The project development process should inform and be informed by commentors on a periodic basis.
The views of informed commentors are a strong indicator of the broad potential for wider applicability of the innovation being tested in a project."
"Members of the general public should have easy access both to the project Development process and to information about the environmental results of the project once it is implemented, and should have the ability to participate more actively if they so choose."
USFRS' stakeholders are many and varied and certainly cut across all three EPA categories.
The Stakeholder group begins with USFRS employees, both management and line workers.
Stakeholders also extend beyond the immediate geographic area and include those interested and/or involved in USFRS in a variety of ways.
These broader stakeholders include government officials and regulators, environmental groups, the community and other businesses throughout the region.
A. Direct Participants: Success for the USFRS project development process will be measured by obtaining a substantial consensus on a Final Project Agreement.
The direct participants involved in the project development process are those with interests likely to be affected by the project.
The following are stakeholder groups that have been identified and are currently direct participants in USFRS' Project XL initiative.
Ã€ USFRS as the project sponsor Ã€ USFRS employees Ã€ Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Ramsey County Public Health, Metropolitan Council Environmental Services, Anoka County and US EPA Ã€ Roseville residents Ã€ Local public officials Ã€ Environmental groups If additional groups are identified, they will be added with a consensus vote by the current parties.
B. Commentors: There are a variety of people and organizations who are not direct participants in the USFRS Project XL development process but who have an interest in and wish to be informed about progress on the project.
As an important part of the SIP, USFRS will share information about Project XL and seek input from a number of interested parties.
C. General Public:
20
The broader category made up of people and organizations who do not have a significant interest in USFRS' Project XL initiative deserve to be kept informed of progress on the project.
An increasingly important means of reaching the public is through Internet access.
Information about USFRS' Project XL initiative will be posted on Company and EPA/MPCA Web sites to facilitate access by the general public and those more directly interested in the project.
Additional mechanisms will be used as they are identified.
To date, the communications outlets to be used in the process include: Ã€ Ã€ Ã€ Ã€ Roseville Focus Ramsey County Bulletin St. Paul Pioneer Press EPA/MPCA and U.S. Filter Web sites
IV.
USFRS SIP Protocols A. Strategies and Tactics: The USFRS SIP is designed to ensure every stakeholder category - direct participant, commentor and member of the general public - will be appropriately informed about and involved in the USFRS Project XL process.
This design is accomplished through a set of strategies and tactics designed to compliment and reinforce one another.
For example, the Stakeholder group will meet regularly, giving members the opportunity to consider and provide input about Project XL progress.
Residents, the news media and other interested parties will have the opportunity to attend meetings.
Residents and others on the USFRS mailing list will receive a USFRS Project XL Update (described later).
Taken together, the combination of communications is designed to provide meaningful information and an opportunity for involvement for all parties.
B. Membership: Membership will be given to all parties interested in participation.
Direct Stakeholder membership will be controlled by a consensus vote of the current Direct Stakeholder Group.
C. Member Roles: The member roles will be defined by the current Direct Stakeholder Group.
The Direct Stakeholders Group will do this through a group discussion and consensus vote.
D. Meetings: In its initial stages of operation, the Stakeholders group will meet monthly to ensure all members are fully briefed and that all represented interests are heard.
Eventually, the Stakeholders and communication needs will dictate meeting frequency.
Meetings will take place at various sites.
Meetings will begin promptly at 4:00 p.m. and end no later than 6:00 p.m. in order to facilitate participation.
Meetings will be scheduled well in advance to help ensure attendance.
Meetings will be open to members of the public, should they wish to attend.
21
E. Management and Staffing: The workings of the Stakeholders group will be managed by the General Manager of USFRS who will chair the proceedings, with the Director of Environmental Compliance as his/her back-up.
A noncompany co-chair will be designated (Joe Carruth of the MPCA as of 5/1/98) to assure that the group is not company dominated.
The group will be supported by USFRS representatives.
In consultation with the chair, USFRS representatives will prepare and distribute meeting announcements, agendas and materials.
USFRS representatives will make arrangements for tours, briefings, etc.
Meeting summaries will be prepared and distributed by USFRS representatives to Committee members for review and comment to ensure an accurate record of Committee proceedings is kept.
F. Substantial Consensus: While it may not be possible to achieve full consensus on all matters that come before the Stakeholders group, it is the intent to achieve substantial consensus on the Final Project Agreement as a key measure of project success.
Substantial consensus means that, as the advisory body to the project, most members of the group agree on a particular position.
When the Final Project Agreement is to be submitted, each Stakeholder will have the option of one or both of the following: 1) Sign the letter of submittal (to the EPA) of the FPA 2) Provide a statement of support or concern as an addendum to the letter of submittal G.
The USFRS Project XL Update: USFRS will create and publish a USFRS Project XL Update on an as-needed basis as work on Project XL moves forward.
The publication will employ a simple, easy-to read newsletter format of two pages containing articles, graphics and/or photos to clearly and concisely describe progress on Project XL.
The Update will be published on a timely basis when there is useful information about the project to convey.
A mailing list of interested parties will be established for the Project XL Update.
Copies of the Update will be posted on company bulletin boards and company and EPA/MPCA Internet Web sites.
H. Media Relations: The news media outlets listed in the Commentors section will be kept informed about work on Project XL by being placed on the mailing list for The USFRS Project XL Update.
When warranted, news releases, interviews and other media relations techniques will be used.
Additional matters will be brought to the media's attention by USFRS, just as it does in its regular media relations program.

APPENDIX D Project Benefits Hydrochloric Acid Recovery System Project: System Facts: Capacity: 1.85 million gallons of acid annually Current Rate: 16,000 gallons of waste annually PROJECTED BENEFITS: If USFRS achieves its target goals, the following benefits will be realized: 1.
Reduction of an approximate 2.6 million gallons of neutralized effluent discharged to a POTW over the first three years of the Project.
This would be accomplished by eliminating the need for on-site neutralization and the volume of water involved in its discharge.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 580,000 gallons.
b. Second year: 920,000 gallons.
c. Third year: 1,200,000 gallons These numbers are calculated by combining the volume of HCl expected to be removed from treatment by the XL Project, along with the corresponding quantity of NaOH required for neutralization, and the average volume of water in the discharge.
2.
Reduction of approximately 2.3 million pounds of salt, usually sodium chloride, discharged to a POTW over the three years of the Project.
This results from the acid and neutralizing agent reacting, and the resulting solution being discharged.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 500,000 pounds.
b. Second year: 800,000 pounds.
c. Third year: 1,000,000 pounds.
These figures are developed by calculating the molar weight of the sodium chloride salt generated by neutralizing HCl with NaOH. 3.
Reduction of 3.5 million pounds of purchased caustic for neutralization at the facilities participating during the first three years of the Project.
This quantity is the calculated weight of sodium hydroxide needed to neutralize the corresponding volume of Hydrochloric acid that has been recycled.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 750,000 pounds.
b. Second year: 1,200,000 pounds.
c. Third year: 1,500,000 pounds.
26
4.
Reduction of 5.4 million pounds of virgin acid purchased over the three years of the Project.
This would be replaced by the 5.4 million pounds of HCL recycled, then reused in its place.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 1,200,000 pounds.
b. Second year: 1,900,000 pounds.
c. Third year: 2,400,000 pounds.
These estimated quantities were developed by USFRS's management.
The key parameters used in making these estimates were the potential market and the incentives offered by the XL Project.
5.
Reduced hazardous materials transport.
For those materials brought into the XL Project, there will be a net reduction in the volume and number of miles hazardous materials will be transported.
When recycled, waste acid will be transported the average distance of 20 miles to USFRS for recycling.
It will then be shipped back the average distance of 20 miles to the generator for reuse.
The current (nonXL) scenario requires both acid and a caustic neutralizing agent to be transported from distant chemical manufacturers.
For caustic, the Gulf States (1,200 miles), and from the Gulf States (1,200 miles) or Wisconsin (180 miles) for acid.
After its use, more acid and caustic then has to be shipped from these distant locations to resupply the user.
CURRENT SCENARIO: Acid---180 or 1,200 mi. Ãˆ Acid---180 or 1,200 mi.Ãˆ Generator Caustic -----1,200 mi.---Ãˆ Caustic-----1,200 mi.---Ãˆ XL SCENARIO: Acid---180 or 1,200 mi.ÃˆGenerator---20mi.ÃˆUSFRS---20mi.ÃˆGenerator (caustic not required) 6.
Reduced energy consumption.
I do not have access to all the energy requirements for the following steps.
However, when comparing the two processes for energy use, the attributes of recycling are overwhelming.
To manufacturer HCL and caustic soda, a NaCl brine is heated to the point that Chlorine gas is generated.
This is very energy intensive process.
A caustic soda is also generated through that process.
The chlorine is then burned with Hydrogen to generate Hydrochloric acid.
These materials are then transported the 1,200 miles to the user.
Again, I do not have access to the energy requirements of this process.
The energy costs to recycle Hydrochloric acid are approximately 5 cents per gallon.
This includes all steam, electricity, and air required to recycle the water and acid.
The transportation distances average of 20 miles to USFRS for recycling, and 20 miles back to the user.
These distances were obtained from our Transportation Manager.
7.
Reduced metals loading to the waste water treatment facility.
This can be crudely calculated through the following scenario, assuming both the generator and USFRS have the same discharge limits.
Generator produces 100 gallons of acid: --- If approximately 15 gallons of caustic (concentrated) is required to neutralize this 100 gallons of solution.
Then 115 gallons of water is discharged to the WWTP. --- If this 100 gallons of acid is recycled at USFRS; 30 gallons of acid, 30 gallons of distilled water, and 40 gallons of wastewater are produced.
Only the 40 gallons of wastewater is discharged to the WWTP. 27
That is a net reduction of 75 gallons, or 65%, discharged to the WWTP per 100 gallons of acid treated on-site.
If this project involves a reduction of 2.6 million gallons of discharge, it would lead to the following reduction in metals loading (assuming discharge limits are matched) at the WWTP: Discharge Limit 2.0 8.0 6.0 1.0 6.0 8.0 mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l Cd Cr Cu Pb Ni Zn = = = = = = 39.8 pounds 159.4 pounds 119.9 pounds 19.9 pounds 119.5 pounds 159.4 pounds
These figures are rough estimates.
The Metropolitan Council Environmental Services, the agency that operates the regional wastewater treatment facility, strongly supports the services that USFRS provides.
The MCES credits USFRS with a large part of its 81% reduction in metals loading to their facility since the startup of this operation.
Sludges generated from either treatment on-site by the generator, or through recycling by USFSR, would probably be comparable.
Although the most common management practice by a generator is land disposal, USFRS ships its sludges to a metals recovery facility.
Recovery is more expensive, but long-term environmental concerns are reduced by this method.
Waste acids that would enter this project are highly contaminated with heavy metals.
They would not be appropriate for on-site neutralization of caustics.
However, if these acids could be used for that purpose, the significant cost savings of on-site use over recycling would exclude them from this project.
The facilities that USFRS believes will participate in this project generate far more acid than caustic waste.
Water Reuse Resin Project The following benefits are anticipated: 1.
An estimated reduction of 202 million gallons of water discharged over the three years of the Project to a POTW.
This would be realized if additional canisters with ion exchange resins totaling 202,000 gallons of resin, were brought into service.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 45 million gallons.
b. Second year: 67 million gallons.
c. Third year: 90 million gallons.
2.
An estimated reduction in the demand for the production of potable water by 202 million gallons.
This would be realized if additional canisters with ion exchange resins totaling 202,000 gallons of resin were brought into service.
USFRS's projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 45 million gallons.
b. Second year: 67 million gallons c. Third year: 90 million gallons.
28
3.
An additional 202,000 gallons of resin recycled over the three years of the Project.
This is the anticipated increase in resin regeneration at USFRS generated by this project.
USFRS;s projected progress involves meeting the following goals: a.
First year: 45,000 gallons of resin.
b. Second year: 67,000 gallons of resin.
c. Third year: 90,000 gallons of resin.
These numbers will come from direct measurement of resin recycled, minus the level achieved in 1997, 4,600 gallons.
If expectations are exceeded, USFRS will evaluate expanding its capacity to accommodate even higher volumes.
