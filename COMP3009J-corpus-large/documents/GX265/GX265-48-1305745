Topics include: Â· Problem-Based Learning and Classification Â­ The Fine Art of Sorting Things Out: Classroom activities and multi-episode teleconference lessons with the Zoo.
The curriculum provides a guideline for teaching classification in a relevant context and depends upon the classroom teacher's commitment to a 2-3 week problem based unit.
At the elementary level (best for grades 3-6, adaptable for grades 1-2), students advise the Zoo whether 10 potential new animals could live in the Zoo's current exhibits.
At the M.S./H.S. levels, students use bugs as indicators of stream quality.
Â· Problem-Based Learning and Zoo Careers (M.S./H.S. levels): Inquiry focusing on a real-world project undertaken by the zoo.
For example, the Asian elephant is pregnant.
We want to facilitate a successful birth and prepare for the care and public viewing of the new baby.
Students discover a variety of jobs needed to run the Zoo and accomplish the project.
Students meet Zoo employees (via videotape) who would do the work, and learn day-to-day tasks, education/skills needed for a particular job, and how academic school subjects are applied in the workplace.
