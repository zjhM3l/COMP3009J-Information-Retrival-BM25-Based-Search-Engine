A c kn ow l e dge m e n t s Overall responsibility for planning and coordinating the content of this Chartbook rested with the Division of Health Resources in the Maryland Health Care Commission, under supervision of Pamela W. Barclay and Linda Cole.
The Chartbook was prepared by Meredith Frost, with a great deal of assistance from Colleen Lates, Tia Delly, Tracey Payne, Brian Ray, and Cathy Weiss of the Division of Health Resources.
Additional programming support was provided by Joyce Zhang, Leslie LaBrecque, and Norm Ringel of the Division of Data Systems and Analysis.
The cover of the Maryland Long Term Care Chartbook 2000 was designed by Leslie LaBrecque.
The Maryland Long Term Care Chartbook 2000 would not have been possible without the contributions of numerous staff members of several State and Federal Agencies.
These people gave generously of their time and knowledge, providing data from their programs and analysis.
Their cooperation and assistance are gratefully acknowledged.
