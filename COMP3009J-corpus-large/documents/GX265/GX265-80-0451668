The theme of the school would be: WORLD Community Learning Center: The Center for World Cultures, Languages and Communication Arts The need for interdistrict magnet schools has been established through research, study and discussion.
Through a series of meetings that started with the Planning Committee in March of 1998 and continued with combined Planning and Feedback Committees, the Cuningham Group directed the Design-Down process to create the framework of educational specifications that have guided the development of the educational program and facilities for the Southwest W MEP School.
Community meetings and focus groups with residents in St. Louis Park began in June 2001 have further supported this need for this Southwest Voluntary Integration Magnet School Project.
Simply stated, the goals for the project are to improve the educational opportunities and academic achievement of learners, promote an integrated education for students and increase mutual understanding.
W MEP commitment to voluntary metropolitan school integration is most visibly demonstrated in its successful implementation of two interdistrict magnet schools, the Interdistrict Downtown School (IDDS) in Minneapolis, the Northwest Fine Arts Resource School (FAIR) in Robbinsdale and finally this proposal to secure funding for the third Southwest Magnet School in St. Louis Park.
Plans for these magnet schools have been developed by design teams composed of parents, teachers and administrators from member districts.
Communities across the country are addressing these issues of integrating pubic schools.
In many cases, lawsuits have been filed, judges have dictated what actions should be taken or state legislatures have issued mandates.
Many communities have struggled with the issues of integration, yet it has been difficult to make any real progress.
Locally, the Minneapolis school district and nine neighboring suburban school districts have established a voluntary effort to address the issues of integration.
The WMEP was formed in 1989 to cooperatively address the integration issues in the west metropolitan area.
W MEP completed its comprehensive four-year desegregation plan in December 2000.
The plan was submitted to and approved by the Minnesota Department of Children Families and Learning (CFL).
The goals include the creation of integrated learning settings where all students can attain high academic achievement, enhance community involvement and prepare communities for increased interracial interaction and to design magnet schools to be regional resources.
This project is intended to partner with the "Children First" Initiative in St. Louis Park and the Search Institute of Minneapolis to design a school around the 40 developmental assets.
Search Institute, a nationally recognized research group, developed the 40 developmental assets model which is the research base for the AGENCY PROJECT PRIORITY: 1 of 1 (W est Metro Joint Powers Board) PROJECT LOCATION: St. Louis Park PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND RATIONALE: This request is for $27,714,000 in state funding to acquire land, predesign, design, construct, furnish and equip the third W est Metro Education Program (W MEP) voluntary integration Southwest Magnet School for the purpose of addressing the issues of integration, student success and acceptance of diversity in the western metropolitan communities.
The W MEP Joint Powers Board is submitting this request.
The W est Metro Education Program (W MEP) is a consortium of 10 urban and suburban school districts that formed in 1989 to cooperatively address integration issues in the west metropolitan area.
Member districts share a mutual commitment to promoting a racially integrated metropolitan area, equal educational opportunities for all children, and enhancement of opportunities through interdistrict educational options in integrated settings.
The School District membership in W MEP includes: Brooklyn Center Columbia Heights Edina Hopkins Minneapolis Richfield Robbinsdale St. Anthony-New Brighton St. Louis Park Wayzata
W MEP is a voluntary interdistrict integration initiative committed to advancing both student achievement and professional development.
This W MEP Southwest Integration Magnet School is to be located within the boundaries of and in the community of St. Louis Park.
There is one school district owned site that is under consideration.
There are also two privately own sites that are being considered.
Final site selection will be contingent upon negotiating a final price for the land.
Selection criteria generated by the "W MEP Southwest Metro K-8 School St. Louis Park Draft Site Investigation Study" and community meetings will be used in the site selection process.
This capital project is a voluntary integration magnet school building project for kindergarten through eighth grade students.
This school will have a student Grants to Political Subdivisions WMEP Southwest Integration Magnet School AGENCY CAPITAL BUDGET REQUEST Fiscal Years 2002-2007 Project Narrative "Children First" initiative.
St. Louis Park was the first community in the nation to transform the assets into community action.
More than 600 communities across the United States have started similar initiatives.
IMPACT ON STATE AGENCY OPERATING BUDGETS (FACILITIES NOTE): The facility will be owned by the W MEP, which consists of the Joint Powers Board of W MEP.
The facility will be operated by the Joint Powers Board of the W est Metro Education Program.
The fiscal agent of the W MEP is the Robbinsdale District #281 School District.
There will be a need for $500,000 additional dollars for operation of the project.
These funds allocated at $250,000 for the FY 2005 and $250,000 for FY 2006.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: West Metro Education Program was established in 1989 to cooperatively address integration in the west metro area.
Our focus is to provide voluntary integrated learning options for families living in Minneapolis and its neighboring suburbs.
W MEP currently operates two interdistrict magnet schools--one in downtown Minneapolis and one in the Robbinsdale school district.
The third magnet school proposed for development in St. Louis Park would provide increased access to a voluntary interdistrict integrated school for families in the southwest metro area.
This school would further our mission to promote student success and community acceptance of differences by providing opportunities for students, families and staff from diverse backgrounds to learn from and with each other.
As a member district of W MEP, St. Louis Park School District #283 has a history of supporting voluntary integration efforts as demonstrated by the successful implementation of two interdistrict magnet schools, IDDS in Minneapolis and the FAIR in Robbinsdale.
As a member of W MEP, the St. Louis Park District #283 and the St. Louis Park School Board have shared a mutual commitment with the W MEP school districts in promoting racially integrated metropolitan school attendance areas, equal education for all children and the enhancement of opportunities through interdistrict educational options in integrated settings.
The implementation of the Southwest W MEP School will bring to fruition the legislative and governor support of voluntary, metropolitan-area desegregation/integration initiatives (Magnet School and Planning Grants) formulated and approved in 1998.
The School Board of the St. Louis Park District #283 is confident that successful funding of the Southwest W MEP School will meet the goal established by the CFL in 1998 to establish voluntary desegregation/integration efforts across district boundaries.
