The Oil Industry Alaska's oil and gas industry is a large pillar in the economy, a small one in the workforce
by Neal Fried and Brigitta Windisch-Cole Labor Economists
il has played central roles in Alaska's economy and psyche since 1957, when the Kenai fields were discovered.
The economic implications of this find were important in the statehood movement and Alaska's admission to the Union.
In 1968, the discovery of the massive Prudhoe Bay field ushered in a new era of prosperity for Alaska.
The jobs directly created by the oil industry have never been great in number, but they remain some of the most sought after in the state's labor market.
A highly skilled workforce commands the highest wages in Alaska.
A certain mystique is associated with oil patch employment, evoking visions of hard physical work performed in a harsh arctic environment.
These jobs are the Alaska equivalent of Seattle's software workforce, Detroit's auto industry or New York's financial sector.

Industry is a major force in the economy Seventeen percent of the state's gross product flows from oil.
Revenues from the industry consistently bankroll 80 percent of unrestricted dollars in the state general fund.
Alaska's Permanent Fund is based on oil.
The industry is a major source of local property taxes in communities where it is present.
The oil industry is, in short, a mainstay of the economy of the state of Alaska.
In this article, a direct oil and gas industry employer is defined as a company primarily engaged in oil and gas extraction, drilling or support activities for

industry employment stood at 8,800, and represented only three percent of all wage and salary employment in Alaska.
If this definition were broadened to include pipeline transportation (mostly Alyeska), petroleum refineries and other downstream operations, the percent of total wage and salary employment would climb to nearly four percent.
Because oil industry earnings are nearly three times Alaska's average earnings, payroll impacts are more impressive.
(See Exhibit 2.)
Oil industry employment represents seven percent of all wage and salary payroll, and if pipelines and downstream operations are included the share grows to nine percent.
Thousands of other jobs service this industry, but they are not classified as oil industry employment.
For example, in 2002 of the more than 6,000 jobs in Prudhoe Bay, 27 percent were not associated with oil industry employers.
Jobs directly created by the oil industry, but not identified as oil industry employment include catering, security, construction contracting, transportation, engineering, and other support services.
In Anchorage, Alaska's headquarters for the industry, the size of the workforce directly attached to the oil and gas industry but not identified as oil industry employment is probably even larger.
According to the University of Alaska Anchorage, nearly a quarter of all jobs in the state can be attributed to petroleum.
If the Permanent Fund and the Constitutional Budget Reserve were included in the aggregation, the share would move closer to a third of all jobs.

the changing size of the industry's workforce.
Over the decade dramatic improvements in technology affected employment levels.
Major oil producers increasingly relied upon contractors, consultants, outside suppliers and temporary workers to perform tasks previously performed by their permanent staff.
Because these employers were not identified as oil producers, employment gains and losses caused by oil related work were increasingly attributed to other industries.
In 1991-1992, British Petroleum and other oil industry employers and contractors responded to declining oil prices with major restructuring and consolidation.
For the next three years employment remained relatively stable.
Weak oil prices and other factors eventually caught up with the industry in late 1994 and 1995 when Atlantic Richfield made major cuts in the workforce.
The downsizing cost the industry 1,800 jobs between 1991 and 1995, a record loss.
These losses were spread among the major oil producers and oil field service companies.
Smaller losses continued through 1997.
In 1998 employment in Alaska's oil patch began a strong recovery with the development of Alpine, Tarn, Note: and Badami, complemented by drilling at West Source: Sak and preliminary work at North Star, Liberty and other fields.
This new investment led to an optimism captured by Atlantic Richfield's mantra "no decline after 1999".
In fact, as a result of these developments, overall North Slope production stabilized in 2001 for the first time in 2.5 about a decade and should remain relatively stable for a number of years.

Oil Production Has Fallen Faster

While oil production shows signs of stability, oil prices continue to fluctuate, sometimes widely, driven by world markets.
Changes in the price per barrel can affect employment levels in the 1.5 state.
As an example, oil prices plunged from nearly $19 per barrel in 1997 to $12.55 in 1998.
Near-record employment losses followed in 1999 1.0 when oil industry employment fell below the 8,000 level for the first time since 1983.

year of sub-par employment growth in the overall economy over the past decade coincided with weak years in the oil patch--evidence of the multiplier effect the industry has on the state's economy.
By late 2000, recovery was in full swing and in 2001 employment reached a tenyear high.
This peak was nearly 1,600 jobs higher than the industry's nadir in 1999, a recovery which most observers had not thought possible.
The near concurrent development of both the Alpine and North Star oil fields was the major reason for this strong upswing.
A factor contributing to the resurgent employment involved the Alaska construction of large oil modules.
Historically these had been built in the lower 48 states or overseas but now were being fabricated in Kenai and Anchorage.
The year 2000 was momentous for another reason: Alaska's largest oil industry employer and the discoverer of the Prudhoe Bay fields, Atlantic Richfield, disappeared from the scene when it sold its assets to British Petroleum and Phillips (now ConocoPhillips).
Work on the Alpine and North Star projects was nearing completion by late 2001 and employment began to fall steeply.
By 2002, oil industry employment had declined by eight percent and by June of 2003 it has reached near 1999 levels.
While high oil prices have prevailed over the past four years, employment has continued this downward trend.
Few new projects are underway and little is on the horizon that would change this pattern in the near term.
Most job losses have been in oil field services and the contractor share of the industry.
British Petroleum trimmed its workforce by moving the exploration department out of the state, but contractors, drillers and other supporting employers account for more than 90 percent of the reductions.
On the brighter side, a number of independents have entered the market in recent years, and Cook Inlet has experienced some resurgence in activity.
The new players include Anadarko, XTO Energy, Forest Oil Corporation, Evergreen, Pioneer, Winstar, the French company Total, and a number of others.
Winstar was formed by a group of Alaska investors.
Arctic Slope Regional Corporation recently announced plans to expand their oil service contracting operations to include exploration and production.
The phenomenon of independents' moving into what were considered mature fields by larger producers and breathing new life into them has happened in other places in the country, such as the Gulf of Mexico.

Most of the workforce is in the North Slope, Anchorage, and Kenai Three of Alaska's boroughs, Anchorage, the North Slope, and the Kenai Peninsula, account for over ninety percent of oil patch employment.
(See Exhibit 7.)
Production facilities are based in the latter two while management headquarters are typically located in Anchorage.
The North Slope has the largest concentration of oil industry workers.

state--oil and gas production, pipeline transportation, a liquid natural gas facility (LNG), an oil refinery and a urea-ammonia fertilizer plant.
These players represent 10 percent of the Peninsula's wage and salary employment and 18 percent of the payroll.
Most oil industry employment in Valdez and Fairbanks involves the transport of North Slope oil.
Approximately 15 percent of Valdez's direct employment is tied to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
Although direct oil industry employment is relatively small, Fairbanks is a major logistic and supply center for the North Slope.
Valdez and Fairbanks are also home to oil refineries.
Although most of the jobs in the industry are located in a limited number of geographic areas, the workforce is drawn from all around the state and nation.
This is particularly true for the North Slope, where very few oil workers reside.
For example, there are only a handful of oil industry jobs in the Mat-Su Valley but three percent of the borough's labor force commute to the North Slope to work.
Many residents of the Kenai Peninsula, which has the second highest concentration of oil industry related jobs, work in the oil industry elsewhere.
According to the 2000 Census, 755 Kenai Peninsula residents worked on the North Slope, a figure exceeded only by Anchorage (1,541) and the Mat-Su Borough (813).
Over the past decade, between 22 and 29 percent of Alaska's oil industry workers have been nonresidents.
(See Exhibit 8.)
In places like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Valdez and Kenai, local residents make up a much larger percentage of the oil industry workforce.
There is probably not an area in the state that does not send some of its workforce to Alaska's oil fields.

How does Alaska compare to other oil producing states? Since 1979, Alaska has been the nation's number two oil-producing state but one would not know it from the size of its workforce.
In 2002 Texas produced 15 percent more oil than Alaska employing an oil industry workforce of 133,802, 15 times larger than Alaska's.

Firms like Alaska Petroleum Contractors, VECO, Winstar, and Houston/NANA are home grown and headquartered in the state.
But nearly all the Alaska oil industry workforce is dedicated to the production of Alaska oil, and is not involved in worldwide development.
There are, of course, exceptions.
Some Alaska based firms have used their arctic expertise to perform work in places like Sakhalin Island.
Not only does Alaska have a relatively smaller oil extraction workforce, it also has a relatively smaller transportation infrastructure and fewer downstream operations, such as refineries.
While the state has an 800-mile pipeline and a number of shorter ones, they do not compare to the thousands of miles of pipeline that snake through other states.
There are a number of reasons why there are fewer downstream-type operations.
Alaska is distant from consuming markets and it is more cost effective to ship crude oil long distances than refined products.

only local demand, which is relatively small.
These refineries include Williams and Petro Star in Fairbanks, Tesoro in Kenai, and Petro Star in Valdez.
There are two downstream operations that are exceptions--the Phillips LNG operation and Agrium's urea plant on the Kenai Peninsula.
Both of these operations export their products to national and international markets.
It is a high skill industry The industry's workers are known not only for their high pay, but also for their expertise and endurance.
Workers are often very specialized and hold occupations that exist only in the oil industry.
They are part of a global workforce and many Alaska workers have worked in oilfields in other parts of the world.
In general, the industry employs careful and selective hiring practices.
Potential workers undergo thorough scrutiny.
According to industry employers, hiring, training, transportation to and accommodations at remote sites are high cost expenses, and careful personnel selection plays a pivotal role in business success.
Usually the oil industry can hire employees from a large candidate pool.
Job seekers face stiff competition from other applicants attracted by the high wages.
In 2002, nine oil producer firms formed the core of the Alaska oil industry while 65 businesses contracted with these producers to perform oil
Earnings in the oil industry are high The oil industry provides the highest annual average wages in Alaska, $96,158 in 2002.
(See Exhibit 2.)
This was nearly 160 percent above the all-industry average of $37,101.
Several reasons underlie this large pay differential.
Some significant ones include the profitability of the industry, the high skill and experience level of its workforce and the demanding work schedules.
Overtime, mostly stemming from scheduled shift rotations on the North Slope or on the platforms, plays a big role and significantly enhances annual earnings.
The most common shift rotations are based on a schedule of one week on/one week off or two weeks on/two weeks off.
Often employees on remote sites are scheduled to work 84 hours a week, which would translate into 40 hours of straight time and 44 hours of overtime.
Other reasons for the higher pay include remote work sites, the hazards of some occupations, and the extreme climate encountered in Alaska's oilfields.
Moreover, an incentive premium is most likely inherent in the hourly pay to compensate workers for the prolonged periods of separation from their families.
Long tenure in the industry is also reflected in hourly pay rates.
Wages in oil producer companies tend to be higher than those in oilfield or drilling support firms.
Producer firm employment also provides greater job security.
Work in support firms is more project-oriented, and often terminates upon completion of the project.
This partially explains the dramatic variance in employment levels that characterizes oil support industries.

A Distinct Staffing Pattern Underlies Alaska oil industry Business/ Financial 4% Production 13%
The occupational mix in the oil industry changes with the nature of the work being done at the time.
The occupational staffing pattern in the following discussion reflects conditions in year 2000, when large oil development projects such as Alpine and Northstar were under way.
The sorting of occupations according to the Standard Occupational Classification system revealed that construction and extraction related jobs formed the largest group, (34 percent) in the oil industry.
(See Exhibit 11.)
Roustabouts, operating engineers and construction equipment operators were the most frequently occurring occupations.
Production occupations formed the second largest work group, claiming 13 percent of all jobs.
Within this group the highly specialized occupation of petroleum pump system operator was the most numerous.
Welders were the second largest production occupation.
Architecture and engineering occupations made up the third largest group with 10 percent of all occupations.
This group included several engineering specialties with petroleum engineers the largest.
Drafters, engineering and mapping technicians were included in the second most prevalent occupation group.

Office support and administrative jobs formed a nine percent share of the industry's workforce.
The three most common occupations were secretaries, office clerks, and human resource assistants.
Among transportation and material moving personnel, who claimed seven percent of all jobs, the occupation of pump operator dominated.

shifts in production levels and industry restructuring and consolidation, the one constant has been oil's dominant economic influence on the state.
Revenue from oil industry taxes is essential to both state and local governments and oil jobs command some of the state's highest salaries.
More change for the industry can be expected in the coming years.
Oil industry employment levels and workforce skill requirements will fluctuate as the industry develops new projects and technologies.
Oil field production, which has declined steadily over the past decade, is difficult to predict, but the potential for development is strong, whether through drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the construction of a gas pipeline, or the development of new oil finds in mature basins.
The extent to which this potential is realized will have a lot to do with Alaska's economic future.
Note: The companies listed in Exhibit 1 are all engaged primarily in the oil industry, although they may also employ workers in other industries.
The employment numbers listed show the companies' total employment, and not just that part strictly defined as being in the oil industry.
In other words, a portion of VECO's employment of 1,127 may be classified under another industry.
Exhibits 4 and 7, on the other hand, display only the employment of these and other companies that are classified as part of the oil industry.
Therefore, Exhibit 1 should not be compared to Exhibits 4 and 7.
For example, it would be incorrect to say that VECO represents 13 percent of all oil industry employment (VECO total empoyment of 1,127 from Exhibit 1 divided by total oil industry employment of 8,800 from Exhibit 4.)

or education level for individual workers by gender, nor determine their relative effect on differences in average total earnings.
The "gap" in earnings narrowed gradually from the 1998 level of 61.7 percent to the 1999 rate of 66.8 percent, but increased slightly in 2001 due in part to changes in Alaska's industry and occupational mix.
Earnings differences exist, to varying degrees, across all industries and age groups, almost all geographic areas, and most occupations.
The "gap" was wider in the private sector than the public sector, with women making an average of 62 percent as much as men in Alaska's private sector and 76 percent as much in state and local government.
Women earned an average of $11,000 less than men, up from the $10,000 difference in 1988.
(See Exhibit 1.)
Why are the average total earnings of Alaska men so much greater than women's? Although some have argued that discrimination plays a role in these earnings differences, there is insufficient data to support that claim.
Many other factors affect total earnings: career choices, differences in full time versus parttime work, level of education or training, and years of work experience.
Most of these factors cannot currently be measured.
No Alaska data is currently available to measure wage rates, hours worked
On the national scene While nationwide figures are not directly comparable to Alaska's, the U.S. Census Bureau median income data for full time year round workers for 2002 showed the gender gap at 76 percent nationally.

Comparison by industry group In 2001, women in Alaska continued to earn less than men in all industries.
Men's average earnings were $32,618 and women's were $21,644.
The natural resources and mining industry paid the highest average wages to both sexes.
Women employed in natural resources and mining (which includes the oil industry) were well paid with average annual earnings of $43,305, but women's representation in the industry was small, 14 percent.
(See Exhibits 2, 3 and 4.)
Natural resources and mining, together with construction, is an example of a heavily male dominated industry.
Manufacturing is another industry dominated by males.
Manufacturing at 57 percent and trade, transportation and utilities at 56 percent show the broadest differences between men's and women's earnings.
The earnings differential was smallest in local 80% government, where women earned approximately 82 percent as much as men in 2001.
Close behind in ratio of women's to men's wages are Section other services and financial activities.

real wages, industrial sectors with above average female income are state government, and information, which now includes everything from traditional publishing companies to computer related businesses.
Exhibit 4 displays a side-by-side comparison of women's participation in the workforce by industry, with their average annual earnings in the industry.
Educational and health services is the industry most heavily dominated by females, at 77 percent.
The industry ranks fifth in average annual earnings for females, at $25,904.
In 2001 as in 1999, women held the large majority of jobs in educational and health services, financial activities and local government.
teacher assistants.
For men the top occupations include construction laborer, material mover, retail salesperson, carpenter, and janitor.
The list is virtually unchanged from prior years.
Gender-dominated occupations Occupations with five percent or fewer women included: carpenters, operating engineers, heavy truck drivers, plumbers, electricians, welders, auto mechanics, construction managers, roustabouts, and aircraft mechanics.
Another seven occupations on the male top 50 list have between five and 10 percent female workers, for a total of 17 occupations (34 percent of occupations on the list) with 10 percent or fewer females.
The top female occupations, on the other hand, show only eight occupations with 10 percent or fewer males.
While males have made inroads into traditionally female occupations, females have entered traditionally male occupations to a far lesser degree.
Comparison by occupation The 50 occupations with the greatest number of male and female employees are shown in Exhibits 8 and 9.
The top five occupations for women include retail salesperson, office clerk, cashier, bookkeeping, accounting

Female workers earn more in some parts of Alaska Average earnings for females ranged from $12,659 to $30,256 depending upon the area of the state in which they worked.
Females earned the most if they worked in the North Slope Borough, including Prudhoe Bay.
Females were 25 percent of the North Slope workforce.
(See Exhibit 10.)
Juneau and Anchorage had relatively high average earnings for females in 2001.
In Juneau where females comprised nearly 50 percent of the workers, they averaged $24,238 and the Anchorage average was $23,962.
Men and women in Dillingham made up equal proportions of the workforce and earned nearly identical earnings at about $21,800.
Denali Borough females made up 38 percent of the workers, and earned 38 percent as much as men, with average annual wages of only $13,960.
Denali has many visitor related service jobs which are highly seasonal and pay relatively low wages.
Sitka and Haines are the only locations where females make up more than half the workforce.
An analysis using 1999 data from the U.S. Census on full time year-round workers placed the Aleutians East Borough third among eleven very small, rural counties in the United States where women out-earn men.
Women's annual earnings in the Aleutians East were $3,484 more than men's.
In these small, rural counties, men's earnings are typically depressed.
In Aleutians East, fisheries, where most men work, are in decline, and about 25 percent of women work in health care, education and government.

Methodology All private sector, state and local government worker unemployment insurance wage records were aggregated to obtain total worker wage and salary earnings for 2001.
The data show workers' total earnings, not wage rates.
Occupation, industry and place of work data were obtained from the employer for whom the worker earned the most money in 2001.
Age and gender information was obtained by matching with historical Permanent Fund Dividend applicant files.

June has Good News and Bad News Over-the-year job growth is positive in June, and unemployment is high
Alaska Employment Scene by Neal Gilbertsen Labor Economist
n June, much of the country's economic news was disappointing.
The national unemployment rate increased to 6.5 percent, the highest recorded since April 1994.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, (BLS), total nonfarm employment payroll fell by 30,000, leaving 9.4 million job seekers without
I
work.
Since March 2001, total nonfarm employment has declined by 2.6 million.
In Alaska, the news was more mixed.
June's unemployment rate jumped to 7.4 percent from May's 7.1 percent.
(See Exhibits 1 and 3.)
This came as a mild surprise because the seasonal nature of much of the Alaska economy usually produces a slight decline in the unemployment rate as the state approaches the peak employment months of July and August.
It should be remembered that this rate is subject to revision.
Still, a 7.4 percent rate is not unusual for June, having occurred in 1993, 1994, and 2002, and being somewhat lower than the June rates of 1996 and 1998.
While the unemployment rate was one of the highest in the country, Alaska was also among the fastest growing states in terms of over-the-year job growth.
More Alaskans are working in 2003 than were working in 2002, but more are also actively seeking employment than a year ago.
In short, while the Alaska economy continues to grow and to produce jobs, the labor force is growing slightly faster than jobs are being created.
Across the nation, 28 states experienced overthe-year declines in employment.
Alaska, by contrast, ranked fourth in over-the-year increases, showing a job growth rate of 1.5 percent.
(See Exhibit 2.)
Nevada was first at 1.9 percent followed by New Mexico at 1.8 percent and Vermont with 1.7 percent.

ALASKA ECONOMIC TRENDS
SEPTEMBER 2003
A possible explanation for this seeming contradiction in Alaska's economic performance involves the high unemployment rates in Oregon (8.4 percent), Washington (7.6 percent), and California (6.7 percent.)
When these other western states experience high unemployment, job seekers are more likely to migrate north to look for work in Alaska.
While the numbers involved are insignificant in relation to those states' larger economies, a small increase in the number of non-resident workers in the Alaska labor force would register as a noticeable increase in the state's unemployment rate.
Since transient and non-resident job seekers traditionally fill many seasonal jobs, a slightly larger than usual influx could result in the simultaneous growth of employment totals and unemployment rates.
Alaska's relative success in job creation may have provided an additional attraction and therefore be related to the increased rate of unemployment.
the lowest mortgage rates in recent memory have apparently contributed to increased private construction activity in Alaska, especially in the Anchorage/Mat-Su area.
Overall, Construction employment is up 2.7 percent from June 2002, which amounts to an increase of 500 jobs.
The Education 
(See Exhibit 3.)
Most of this increase of 1,700 jobs was in health care, much of it associated with Native health care programs.
The remarkable growth of this sector over the last several years is partially due to the privatization of federal programs that once served Alaska Natives.
It also reflects the fact that a more stable, aging Alaska population requires more health care than the younger, more mobile population that characterized the state in earlier years.
Between 1990 and 2000, Alaska's senior (over 65) population increased by nearly 60 percent, and continues to grow faster Overall the state has gained 3,400 jobs since June than the national counterpart.
Over the same 2002.
(See Exhibit 3.)
Anchorage/Mat-Su, the period technological advances have added to the Interior and Southwest regions all posted gains (continued on page 26) collectively totaling 4,400, while Southeast, Northern, and Gulf Coast regions experienced job losses, which reduced the overall rate of Western States Â­June 2002 to June 2003 growth.
Just as the gains and losses in employment 2.0% were not evenly distributed geographically, neither were they in terms of industry.
Employment Growth
2
The Natural Resources 
In large part this was due to the elimination of 700 jobs in the oil industry.
Northern Alaska was particularly hard hit, losing 400 oil-related jobs.
Southwest Alaska and the Gulf Coast both showed slight reductions in seafood processing employment.
The Construction sector, by contrast, posted significant over-the-year employment gains.
While oil industry construction is down this year, the cutbacks have been more than matched by increased employment on public projects and private housing starts.
Federal spending on the Missile Defense Site is largely responsible for the sector's high employment in the Interior, while

Many health care needs that formerly resulted in trips to Seattle or elsewhere are now met locally.
These trends are expected to continue for the rest of the decade.
(See Alaska Economic Trends, April 2003.)
The Leisure 
Most of the gain was accounted for by increased employment at eating and drinking establishments.
In part, this is explained by a number of new restaurants and hotels, especially in the Anchorage area.
Government employment also increased, although at the much slower rate of 1.2 percent.
The growth of the Transportation Security Administration and the federalization of airport security jobs explain most of the increase in federal employment.
While the major population centers of Alaska, especially Anchorage/Mat-Su, continue to manifest growth in jobs and population, many rural areas have been stagnant or have even experienced losses.
Continued erosion of what were once core industries in rural areas, such as timber in Southeast and the salmon fisheries of all coastal Alaska, is contributing to an increasingly urbanized state, as Alaskans move to areas offering greater employment opportunities.
While other factors, such as births, deaths and new arrivals affect total population growth, in terms of the movement of Alaskans within Alaska over the 20002002 period, only Anchorage/Mat-Su, the Kenai Peninsula, and Juneau have gained population.

The official definition of unemployment currently in place excludes anyone who has not made an active attempt to find work in the four-week period up to and including the week that includes the 12th of the reference month.
Due to the scarcity of employment opportunities in rural Alaska, many individuals do not meet the official definition of unemployed because they have not conducted an active job search.
They are considered not in the labor force.
