INTRODUCTION If Delaware's gifted and talented students are to reach their potential, they must receive educational services appropriate to their individual abilities.
This document, Recommendations for Excellence in Gifted 
The guidelines herein were developed cooperatively by members of the Statewide Advisory Council on Programs for the Gifted and Talented, educators who have responsibilities for gifted and talented programs throughout the state, and under the leadership of the Education Associate for Gifted and Talented Programs at the Delaware Department of Education.
The following principles guided the group in their work: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gifted and talented students are special needs students.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Public schools must provide for their needs as well as encourage and support gifted and talented students to reach their potential.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gifted and talented students require early identification and intervention, which should be provided by the public schools.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gifted and talented students should have appropriate curriculum adapted to meet the pace and depth of their learning needs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Public schools and agencies must provide viable curriculum modifications and services for gifted and talented students to meet both their cognitive and affective needs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Local school districts are best able to determine the needs of the gifted and talented students within the communities they serve and are best positioned to ensure that gifted and talented programs and services are coordinated and articulated in a continuum of services with the regular school program.
Given the above, local school districts should be responsible for providing appropriate programs and services for their gifted and talented students.
Current and best research on programming dictates that local school district programs for the education of gifted and talented students should consist of the following elements, at minimum, that are addressed in the document: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A clear statement of the programs offered that includes different types of services provided in a variety of settings to meet the diversified needs of gifted and talented students.
Selection/identification procedures, including modifications for identifying gifted and talented students from traditionally underserved populations.
A system for delivering differentiated services to gifted and talented students reflecting a continuum of services, including, but not limited to, adaptations such as acceleration, grouping and enrichment as well as pull-out classes; cluster grouping in the subject areas of the pupils' strengths across grade and age levels; flexibly grouped classes for students who have been identified as gifted and talented; special schools, such as magnet schools; mentor-ships; acceleration programs; and seminars.
A professional development program for all staff significantly involved in the education of gifted and talented students.
A plan to involve the school community and parents in the ongoing implementation of the local plan, including a public information component.
An evaluation process to monitor the success of programs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ This document is intended as a vehicle through which the local education agencies, the Delaware Department of Education, and the State Board of Education reaffirm their commitment to gifted and talented students the young people who will assume significant roles in the leading us into the future.
FOREWORD This document delineates both requisite and exemplary recommendations or EXPECTATIONS for gifted education programming and provides a range of minimal, or requisite, and exemplary, or visionary, levels of program development.
These expectations may serve as any of the following: benchmarks for measuring programming effectiveness; criteria for program evaluation; guidelines for program development; and/or recommendations for minimal requirements for high-quality gifted education programming.
For the sake of clarity, the following definitions have been utilized throughout: Gifted learners are "children and youth with outstanding talent who perform or show the potential for performance at remarkably high levels of accomplishment when compared with others of their age."(United States Department of Education, 1993, p. 3) Gifted education programming is a coordinated and comprehensive structure of informal and formal services provided on a continuing basis intended to effectively nurture gifted learners.
Minimum expectations include requisite conditions for acceptable gifted education programming practice.
Exemplary expectations designate desirable and visionary conditions for excellence in gifted education programming practice.
The expectations listed herein represent professional consensus on best practice in gifted education and were synthesized by the National Association for Gifted Children in their 1999 document, Gifted Program Standards.
The recommendations or expectations are observable aspects of educational programming and are directly connected to the continuous growth and development of gifted learners.
The exemplary expectations establish a level of performance to which all local school districts and agencies should aspire.
