2 4 4 7 3 6 8 2 6 6 5 08-2003.pmd 1 8/12/03, 7:17 AM The Ethics of Outsourcing Client Tax Returns Business process outsourcing--contracting business processes to outside service vendors--is not a new concept and the accounting industry has long taken advantage of the benefits of outsourcing.
However, a growing trend among CPA firms is causing concern among regulators.
A number of CPA firms, both multistate and local, have begun using the burgeoning outsourcing and technology markets in India to process client tax returns.
According to Kevin Robert, Chief Executive of CCH Tax Compliance, a tax software company that provides software for an India-based outsourcer, the work being performed is not simple data entry.
"We're taking in raw tax-source information and there are going to be levels of interpretation," he said in an interview with the Seattle Times.
Although the North Carolina Accountancy Statutes and Administrative Code do not expressly prohibit the practice of outsourcing the preparation of client tax returns, there are several rules a CPA must consider when outsourcing services.
One prime concern is maintaining the confidentiality of client records.
Pursuant to 21 NCAC 8N .0205, Confidentiality, a CPA shall not disclose any confidential information obtained in the course of employment or a professional engagement except with the consent of the employer or client.
To process a tax return, the preparer must have sensitive client information such as the client's Social Security Number, date of birth, bank and brokerage statements, credit card information, salary, etc.
In short, much of the information that can be used to perpetrate identity theft.
Although some outsourcing centers promise to protect financial information by eliminating the workers ability to download, print, scan or copy financial data, critics of outsourcing question how tax returns can be processed without workers being able to perform those tasks.
Ultimately, the CPA firm has the responsibility to ensure the confidentiality of its clients'information.
In addition, CPA firms, like banks and brokerage firms, are covered under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which governs financial privacy.
Under the Act, the mandatory annual privacy notice must state with whom a company shares its clients' non-public information, how the company protects or safeguards that information, and how a client may opt out of having that information shared with other companies like outsourcing centers.
The competence of the workers at the outsource centers is also of concern to regulators; the workers may have minimal training and may have no background in US tax law.
21 NCAC 8N .0212, Competence, requires that a CPA shall perform professional services competently and shall exercise due professional care in the performance of an engagement.
Pursuant to 21 NCAC 8N .0301, Professional Judgment, a CPA shall not subordinate the CPA's professional judgment to non-CPAs.
Although some of the companies that offer outsourcing in India promise to hire only Chartered Accountants with an education that is as least equivalent to a CPA's education and training in US tax law, the CPA firm using the outsource center must be diligent in selecting a company in which the workers are properly educated and trained.
If your CPA firm has professional liability insurance coverage, you should check with your insurance carrier to see if your policy covers the firm when using an outsource center.
The accuracy of the tax return remains the ultimate responsibility of the CPA firm and all returns prepared by an outsource center must be reviewed by the CPA firm and the signing CPA.
Consolidations in the accounting industry have created unprecedented change--competition is more intense than ever.
As the pressure for better bottom line results increase, outsourcing is seen as one solution.
If your CPA firm is considering outsourcing the preparation of client tax returns, remember that a North Carolina CPA is responsible for ensuring that any partner, shareholder, officer, director, unlicensed principal, proprietor, employee or agent, including outsource personnel comply with the Board's rules on Professional Ethics and Conduct.
If you have questions regarding the Board's rules as they relate to the outsourcing of client tax returns, please contact Robert N. Brooks, the Board's Executive Director, by telephone at (919) 733-4222 or by e-mail at rnbrooks@bellsouth.net.

She especially took pleasure in helping find alternatives for meeting the exam application requirements for those one or two percent of the applicants who didn't fit the mold.
Judie felt that it was important that each applicant be given the information that he or she needed so that each individual could be one step closer to attaining his or her goal of becoming a CPA. Judith Ann Eastwood Macomber 1942 - 2003 It is with great sadness that the North Carolina State Board of CPA Examiners announces the death of Judith Macomber, the Board's Examinations Manager.
Judie, as she was known to friends and family, passed away July 24, 2003, as the result of injuries she received in a fall on July 20, 2003.
A Service of Remembrance was held on July 27, 2003, at Brown-Wynne in Raleigh.
Judie was born October 9, 1942, in Huntington, NY, to Frances R. Eastwood and the late James W. Eastwood.
Raised in Rhode Island, Judie graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science in Home Economics Education with a minor in English.
She later continued her education by taking graduate-level classes at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC.
In October 1986, Judie joined the Board staff as Examinations Manager, and one month later, she administered the November 1986 Uniform CPA Exam in Raleigh--the first time the exam had been given at the Raleigh Convention and Conference Center.
Judie was an avid and eclectic reader who enjoyed solving crossword and jigsaw puzzles.
She also enjoyed traveling, and in recent years, had visited Italy, England, and Scotland.
Diagnosed with diabetes as a child, Judie refused to let the disease put a damper on her zest for living--she became a certified SCUBA diver when she was in her 50s.
In 2000, the Joslin Center for Diabetes recognized Judie for living courageously with diabetes for 50 years.
Judie will best be remembered for her sense of humor, unflagging energy, and tenacious drive.
She gave her friendship unconditionally, and as result had hundreds of friends not only across the United States, but also around the world.
To the Board staff, Judie was more than a co-worker, she was family, and we will miss her greatly.
Judie is survived by her beloved mother, Frances R. Eastwood, of Raleigh, NC; her brother, David R. Eastwood, of Port Washington, NY; her daughter, Lisa Macomber Pauer, of Brevard, NC; her son, Steven E. Macomber, of Charlotte, NC; and her grandchildren, Barrett, Erica, and Zoe; and her great love, David McLemore, CPA, of Clinton, NC. Memorial contributions may be made to the Joslin Diabetes Center, One Joslin Place, Boston, MA 02215.
One of Judie's favorite poems was James Leigh Hunt's, Abou Ben Adhem, which was written in 1834: Abou Ben Adhem Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!) Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, An Angel writing in a book of gold: Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the Presence in the room he said, "What writest thou?" The Vision raised its head, And with a look made of all sweet accord Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord."
"And is mine one?" said Abou.
"Nay, not so, " Replied the Angel.
Abou spoke more low, But cheerily still; and said, "I pray thee, then, Write me as one who loves his fellow men."
The Angel wrote, and vanished.
The next night It came again with a great wakening light, And showed the names whom love of God had blessed, And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest! 3 08-2003.pmd 3 8/12/03, 7:17 AM Do Not Call Registry The Federal Government has created the National Do Not Call Registry to make it easier and more efficient for you to stop getting telemarketing sales calls you don't want.

Several large businesses--including banks, Internet service providers and on line merchants--have been targeted recently by people who send out "spoofed" e-mail masquerading as messages from the companies' accounting or customer service departments.
The scam artists send out unsolicited e-mail that typically tells recipients their account information is incomplete or expired and provides a link to fake web pages called "phishing sites," where the victims are asked to type in their data.
The spam e-mail looks like it came from the legitimate company.
When people plug their personal information into the phishing Web sites--often near-perfect replicas of real sites--the data is sent to thieves, not legitimate companies.
"Bogus e-mails that try to trick customers into giving out personal information are the hottest and most troubling new scam on the Internet," Jana Monroe, assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division, said in a recent statement..
The FBI says web spoofing scams are contributing to a rise in identity theft, credit card fraud and other Internet scams.
The agency's Internet Fraud Complaint Center has seen a steady increase in complaints from consumers who were directed to phony "customer service" web sites by unsolicited e-mail.
The number of on line fraud complaints the agency received rose 67% last year to more than 75,000, and consumers reported losses from on line fraud totaling $54 million, the agency reports.
The Federal Trade Commission reported earlier this year that cases of identity theft increased about 88% last year, with 161,800 identity theft complaints, up from 86,200 in 2001.
Identity theft accounted for 43% of all its fraud complaints, according to the report.
Any company doing business on the Internet -- and any person using their services -- could get hooked.
"Before March, we had not seen anything like this, but from March until now, we have seen five or six a month," said Susan Getgood, a senior vice president at SurfControl in Scotts Valley, Calif., which makes web and e-mail filtering software.
Getgood said that scammers use phishing to cast a wide net because "they just need to get a few of you."
"Spam is the organized crime of the Internet, and this is the ultimate crime to date because it damages the victim, and it is also damages the brand of the companies."
