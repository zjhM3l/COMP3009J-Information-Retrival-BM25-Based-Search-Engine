Idaho City uses its Safe and Drug-Free Schools (SDFS) grant money to help fund a variety of prevention programs, leadership trainings, tutoring and staff prevention education.
Adult supervised tutoring begins at the end of the first quarter and is provided after school in the library.
Recreational activities are provided after school during the winter to keep kids busy after they finish their homework and while waiting for the activity bus home.
The last day of school is a traditional affair in Idaho City.
Parents and kids gather at the football field for games, food and entertainment.
Red Ribbon Week activities, Celebrate Graduation, and support group incentives are also funded.
Idaho City has no youth center so school extracurricular sports and activities are the only organized prevention program for the community.
Student government organizes and runs Red Ribbon Week; participation doubled from 2000 to 2001.
Celebrate Graduation was a first this year; 17 of 23 graduating seniors participated in the all night party with no substance abuse incidents.
For the 2001-2002 school year, Basin School District had no expulsions, no weapons violations, and only four students were caught using alcohol or drugs.
Attendance was up by 6 percent and tardies were down by 20 percent.

Bear Lake County School District has implemented some programs and activities over the past few years that have been very beneficial to our students.
Our middle school has had great success with their Natural Helpers program.
We have approximately 48 students who are trained as Natural Helpers in our school each year.
In the past, they have brought several important student problems to our counselors attention.
Some of these have included threats of suicide, alcohol-related problems, bullying, sexual harassment, tobacco use, and various other student problems.
By putting our students through this Natural Helpers training, we feel that we are providing a good foundation for students and offer a resource to student in need of this time of service.
We are also very proud of our Idaho Drug-Free Youth (IDFY) programs both at the middle school and high school levels.
We have approximately 80 students who are members and participate in monthly random drug testing at the middle school, and approximately 50 members at the high school.
Students voluntarily submit to a baseline drug test at the time they become a member and must remain drug free to stay an active member.
We have had no IDFY students test positive or disclose drug or alcohol abuse problems since the program was first implemented in our district.
We are also very proud of the service projects our groups have done to benefit our valley.
We also have the Student Assistance Program (SAP) in place at our high school at all grade levels, and a Juvenile Corrections youth companion who administers Drug and Alcohol Assessments and can make the necessary referrals.
Several programs and curricula have been offered at our elementary school such as Project Alert, No More Bullies, Second Step Violence and Here's Looking at You 2000.
We feel that all of these programs help in empowering our youth to make responsible choices and learn what is expected of them to maintain a healthy and safe lifestyle.

The Boise School District has taken current K -6 counseling curriculum and realigned it using the Idaho's Achievement Standards.
The curriculum has been reorganized using a combination of the Idaho Comprehensive School Counseling Model and state standards.
The 2002-2003 school year will be a pilot year for testing our new curriculum.
Currently we are aligning the 79th grade counselors curriculum.
We plan to pilot the junior high curriculum for the 2003-2004 school year.
This fall, our district hosted an in-service for all elementary counselors.
The Mentor Training was a collaborative training with the Mentoring Institute of Idaho.
Last year 22 of our 34 schools offered a mentor program.
This year to date we have 25 elementary schools participating in a mentoring program.
We continue to offer a strong parent education component.
Last year we started a new program entitled Student Parent Survival Training.
This class is designed as a prevention/intervention strategy for secondary students struggling with substance abuse violations or behavior/academic indicators for substance abuse.
Last year, for the 2001- 2002 school year, 138 students completed the class and 80 parents participated.
For the first semester of the 2002-2003 school year, 57 students completed the class and 30 parents participated.

The Caldwell School District has been working toward a comprehensive K-12 Safe and DrugFree Schools Program.
For the past two years, the district has worked hard to re-evaluate our K12 prevention program/curriculum to align it with the state standards.
For the last year and a half, a committee has been evaluating and updating our elementary prevention curriculum which was taught in the winter of 2002.
The post testing showed a 15% increase in retention of information from the previous year.
Meaning the students understood the concepts and process for resisting drugs/alcohol.
The Caldwell School District experienced a 5% reduction in the number of students referred to the district's Board of Reviews for violence/behavior/drug/alcohol use.
During the 2001- 2002 school year the district also had 10% less students referred to the Alternative School in regard to behavior/substance abuse problems.
One of our very successful at-risk programs, Gaining Responsibility After School Program (G.R.A.S.P.), saw a 45% increase in enrollment.
Spring 2002 the Caldwell School District gave the 7th, 9th and 11th graders the Safe School Climate Survey.
These results will give the Caldwell School District Safe and Drug Free Schools Advisory Committee and the local School Board important information.
The results will help us continue its evaluation and curriculum/program implementation for the prevention/education of the K-12 comprehensive program in the Caldwell School District.

Following is a list of some programs at Culdesac High School that are funded by the Safe and Drug-Free Prevention Program.
Second Step - The curriculum is designed to reduce impulsive and aggressive behavior and increase the level of social competence.
This is achieved through teaching skills in empathy, impulse control, and anger management.
Juniors in our Health Class research the harmful effects of drugs and alcohol, and then present the findings to students in grades 5 and 6.
As the counselor, I conduct several guidance activities (healthy living) in the classroom during Red Ribbon Week and throughout the school year.
Finally, every year the freshman participate in a ropes course trip.
Students learn the value of teamwork, cooperation, and developing trust.
Statistics show that what we are doing at Culdesac School is working.

Our best achievement this past school year is zero incidents of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, possession, or sale on school property.
Employees feel the reason for this achievement is our strict enforcement of drug policies.
This school year our major goal is to focus on our prevention program in the middle school .
We are adding In My House curriculum to the 6th and 8th grade.
We will continue the use of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program in the 5th and 7th grade.
For school year 2001-2002, the reported overall student usage of alcohol and other drugs is the same (12%) as school year 2000-2001, but overall usage of tobacco has gone from 10% to 8% and hewing tobacco has gone from 8% to 4%.

As part of Gooding's Safe and Drug-Free Prevention Program, an all night alcohol/drug-free graduation party has been sponsored in cooperation with staff and parents of graduating seniors and class officers at both the high school and the alternative high school.
These parties have nearly 100 percent participation from graduating seniors, and have resulted in accident-free graduation nights in our community.
Last spring, seniors participated in a simulated driving intoxicated experience that was funded by the grant and provided through the local sheriff's department.
All participating students attended a follow-up assembly to learn more about the dangers of driving while intoxicated.
None of these students have, to this time, been arrested for drunk driving.
Another positive program of our drug-free program has been the random drug testing, which is required of all student athletes and participants of extra-curricular activities, etc.
Ten percent of the student's names are drawn each week and these students are tested.
This school year 20022003, 241 tests have been completed and only 3 have tested positive, one of which was dismissed.
This fall, district and building administrators have volunteered to add their names for random drug testing.
We feel these are just some of the positive results for our Drug-Free Prevention Program.

With the funding available, our Natural Helper group has been the most successful, ongoing program.
Every year new Natural Helpers are selected by their peers and trained.
Throughout the school year, new and previous members assist as well as gain new information in the substance prevention trainings.
The Natural Helper provide valuable knowledge and assistance to help guide leaders in developing activities and existing programs for the school that will enhance the 40 assets so our students will be more resilient to substance abuse.
This group of Natural Helpers provides the leadership that assists in Teen Issue Day activities, rope course activities, big screen pre and post activities in classes for Motivational Medial programs, and other peer teaching activities.
They develop and schedule activities for students by using feedback from their own peers, staff, and parents.
Our State survey and incident data from our school records during the school year and other school years show the success of the main program by showing low percentages in substance use, violence, conflict, and other areas surveyed during the last three school years.
There has been a low percentage of incidents in all areas of our student population for several years.
Peers teaching others and continued education are so important to the success of prevention.
Having funds available every year helps create consistency in the program and helps develop important assets for all our students.
Funds make possible the trainings, the activities, staff development and education, community education.
We want to continue the excellent track record of low incidents in our schools.

Since many students are at risk of becoming involved with illegal substances, as well as other risky behaviors, the Kimberly School District has developed a comprehensive plan that interrelates substance abuse problems with the Federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program.
Our district has developed over the past five years a sound policy and plan that supports the implementation of substance abuse programs, aids students who are at risk due to tobacco or substance abuse, and permits effective and efficient use of taxpayer funded prevention dollars.
Supported by an Advisory Board and Steering Committee, the Kimberly School District developed a program designed to meet the needs of all students.
Through the Youth Behavior Survey and the 40 Assets Survey, the board and steering committee successfully addressed the issues at hand.
In 1998, the incident tracking form reported 5 tobacco violations, 9 alcohol violations, coupled with one firearm on campus.
By the year 2001 - 2002, the tracking form found 1 tobacco use with 3 possession of tobacco, and no alcohol violations on campus.
However, 3 possessions of other drugs were tracked.
elimination of these drugs from our campus.
Along with these statistics, the Kimberly School District has maintained programs that assist with these issues.
Even though the district has seen budget restraints from the grant, the district has maintained the Natural Helpers program, an elementary mentoring program, a District Intervention Specialist who has several groups throughout the district coupled with a School Resource Officer.
Evaluation of the program success is measured through program participation and decrease in atrisk behaviors indicated by the incident reporting system.
A key component in determining program effectiveness is based on student, faculty, parent and community involvement.
The Kimberly School District submits an annual evaluation of the program to the State Department of Education as to the effectiveness of the program.

Kuna School District (KSD) has developed a comprehensive and successful Safe and Drug-Free Program.
Led by the district's Drug Education Coordinator, the program includes a comprehensive drug/violence prevention education curriculum for grades K-12, non-curricular activities and peer-delivered programs, special events, Student Assistance Program (SAP) in all grades, parent, community and volunteer programs, and staff development and training.
Each year grades K-12 receive at least 3 class lessons on drug/violence prevention.
KSD uses Here's Looking at You 2000 (HLAY), Violence Prevention and a Character Development curriculum designed and approved by the district curriculum committee.
Student surveys indicate that following these lessons, students show decreased favorable attitudes toward tobacco, alcohol, drugs and violence.
Every school in the Kuna School District has a care team consisting of staff members who coordinate non-curricular activities, peer-delivered programs and special events.
Some of these activities include Red Ribbon Week, noontime mentoring, monthly after-school field trips, assemblies and manners classes.
Last year 3,041 students were provided several types of special events.
In terms of peer -delivered programs, KSD has adopted the Natural Helpers (NH) program at the High School and plans to expand it to the Middle School this year.
Since implementing NH, there has been a decrease in anti-social incidents and a significant decrease (75%) in substance abuse incidents.
In order to maintain decreased favorable attitudes toward tobacco, alcohol and other drugs and to continue to decrease anti-social and substance abuse incidents, Kuna School District has a district-wide Student Assistance Program (SAP).
This program provides identification and intervention at early stages of substance use/abuse and educational and counseling support for those students affected.
Ten different support group topics were offered last year, and a total of 288 students were referred to the SAP.
Out of those referrals, 166 students received individual or group support.
Over 90% of these students commented on evaluations that group "helped me to make better, healthier choices."
All staff involved in the SAP program receives annual training on SAP, recognizing and identifying early stages of use, intervention strategies, mentoring and building rapport and respect.
KSD believes it is very important to involve parents and community in its Safe and DrugFree Schools Program.
Each year we offer 3 types of parenting classes and several community programs.
PAYADA and Kuna's Alliance for a Cohesive Team (A.C.T.) are two community programs that consistently educate and promote community awareness.
Last year 305 community members participated in one or both of these programs.
In addition, many community members and parents volunteer their time to help with the SDFS Program in areas such as SDFS Advisory Board, mentoring, Senior Graduation Night Party and Kuna Summer Fun Days.
Having an involved community promotes healthy beliefs, sets clear community standards for behavior, and establishes pro-social relationships.
Last year there was a 3% decrease in anti-social incidents, which can be attributed, in part, to community and parental involvement.
Due to the importance and power of community involvement, the SDFS Program plans to continue its outreach to the parents and community members of Kuna.

Working to create Safe and Drug-Free Schools continues to be an area of focus for Lakeland School District.
Students receive support and prevention programs from Kindergarten through Senior High.
At the Elementary level, students are taught curriculum from "Here's Looking at You 2000", (HLAY) learn to be self-managers to develop personal responsibility and good decision making skills, participate in team building activities within grade levels, learn about the dangers of drugs and alcohol through the health curriculum, benefit from mentor relationships with select Junior and Senior High students, and participate in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program at the 6th grade level.
At the Junior/Senior High level, students have the opportunity to participate in the Idaho Drug Free Youth (IDFY) program and through those clubs serve the community in volunteer service and outreach.
Students have IDFY meetings on a frequent basis with opportunities to participate in fun, rewarding activities.
IDFY members are tested for drug/alcohol use on a regular basis.
In addition to IDFY, all students benefit from a comprehensive health curriculum and receive education regarding drug, alcohol, and tobacco use.
Red Ribbon Week is celebrated at all grade levels.
At the Elementary level students typically have an all school assembly with a message regarding making healthy choices and being drug free.
Classroom activities include making posters, writing assignments, and putting on plays for the other classes.
Often Junior High students visit the Elementary schools to perform a skit with a drug free message.
At the Junior and Senior High level, Red Ribbon Week is typically recognized through the wearing of Red Ribbons and special activities such as "Grim Reaper" Day.

There are actually three things I would mention regarding our Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program (SDFS) that we are particularly proud of.
The first two items deal with a reduction in the number of discipline problems we have experienced.
Through the use of the Fred Jones Discipline Program and emphasis on Safe and Drug-Free Schools, we have reduced the number of discipline referrals by over 200 in the past three years.
Emphasis is being placed on student responsibility and academic standards and the students are "getting into it" to the point they don't have time for behavior that is inappropriate.
We are also in the process of implementing Growing Healthy.
This curriculum will be used with our K-6 students for the first time this fall.
Through a tribal grant we have been able to purchase $16,000 in curriculum.
This will be a great shot in the arm for continuity in the SDFS program at the elementary level.
We also implemented a new mentoring program last year and will continue it this year.
We trained 24 mentors last fall and those people worked with 18 students last year.
Students were referred if they had records of failure, bad attendance or large number of discipline referrals.
Using the previous year's data we found the following improvements: Â· Â· Â· Average number of days between detention went from 13 to 19.
Average grade point went from 1.96 to 2.06.
Number of classes failed was reduced significantly.

This district is very fortunate to have relatively few serious drug reports.
The last district drug data shows only two alcohol usages along with 22 tobacco possessions.
There were no other drug possession violations.
Our District has had success in educating students about the harmful effects of drugs by teaching the students to be positive about themselves.
Programs such as Lion's Quest, Here's Looking at You, Renaissance, and Conflict Managers have given students a positive self-worth and allowed them to develop the necessary assets needed to overcome the danger of drugs.
At the secondary level, we do have mandatory drug testing for all students involved in any extracurricular activity.
This gives students a reason for wanting to be drug free.
There is a 10 percent random sampling per week for grades 7-12.
Fortunately, we have only had two positive reports in two years.
We feel this is a proactive approach to discouraging drug usage.

One of the notable successes of our Safe and Drug-Free Program was our district's involvement in Red Ribbon Week.
Participation in Red Ribbon Week activities, particularly at the middle school, improved over the previous year.
We keep track of the number of students involved each year in the activities offered, and we have a competition among our advisory groups to see which group has the most students involved on a daily basis.
The Great Body Shop was taught on a weekly basis to students in grades K -5, and the Drug Awareness Resistance Education (DARE) program was also presented to the 5th graders.
This year there continues to be no incidences of tobacco, alcohol or other substance use, possession, and/or distribution in the elementary grades.
The total number of insubordination incidents in the district decreased from 510 in 2OOO-2001 to 169 in 2001-2002.
The number of harassment incidents decreased from 124 to 75 (includes bullying incidents).
There may be several factors influencing this decline: 1) School Resource Officer was employed for the first time in a number of years; 2) The expansion of our Natural Helper program.
We now offer an elective class each quarter that is required for students who wish to participate in the Natural Helper program.
3) The offering of more student support groups by the Owyhee County Probation Department.

We are beginning our fourth year of providing counseling services through an independent contractor.
The data shows that from 2000-01 to 2001-02 we had a decrease from seven to one in-school suspensions.
We also saw truancies drop from two to zero.
Fights were reduced from 3 to 2 incidents and individuals involved reduced from three to one.
We also saw an increase from 25 to 37 students who took advantage of the counseling services.

Among the highlights of Meridian's good news is that our incident report numbers for tobacco, alcohol and other drugs over the last six years have remained under a tenth of 1% of our district student population.
The Relapse Prevention Course, a daily support group to help students maintain sobriety that was begun at Eagle High five years ago, has been expanded to two other high schools.
For the school year 2001-02, data shows that the average grade point for participating students went up from 2.2 to 2.49, the daily average attendance improved by an average of 4 days, and the contact time with students went up 80%.
The school district revised policy during the school year of 2001-02 to expand the definition of harassment, and differentiate between harassment and bullying.
One hundred percent of administrators and counselors have been provided in-service training and in turn will train teachers and support personnel to specifically address the needs in their buildings as to bullying and harassment prevention.
Second Step Violence curriculum has been expanded in the elementary school.
At the high school, the drama and video classes are preparing videos on preventing bullying and harassment.
Parenting classes have also been added on how to bullyproof your child.
The Idaho Statesman recently had an article that highlighted one of our many anti-bullying programs; this is one at Seven Oaks, entitled "Buddies not Bullies."

A year ago the Middleton School District revamped its prevention programs both in personnel and philosophical goals.
In that tobacco and being overweight kills a lot more people than illegal drugs, that is where we placed the emphasis -both in the classroom and in the community.
A total of 19 citations were issued at Middleton High School or in town during school days last year (10 for tobacco, 8 for marijuana, 1 for alcohol) and three for tobacco at the Middleton Middle School.
The 22 citations nearly tripled the citations from the previous year.
However, we believe we were successful because the increase in numbers reflected a more aggressive approach, not necessarily more use.
Overall, 79 students participated in programs from anger management to diversion - nearly four times the number of students cited.
We had 318 student contacts; a number of the students were seen multiple times.
Already this school year, six citations have been issued for tobacco.
I also "walk the streets and back alleys" of Middleton during the lunch hour in hopes it will make it more difficult for students to use.
I also do Beginning Awareness Basic Education Studies (B.A.B.E.S.) puppet presentations to first graders in an effort to head off abuse problems at the earliest stage by assisting young people to develop positive living skills.

The schools in the Minidoka District developed a Student Assistance Program (SAP) in the school year 1999-2000.
Incidence reports for the past four years indicate a 49% improvement in decreased fights on school campuses and a 90% decrease in drug use.
The statistics are as follows: YEAR 1998-99 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 FIGHTING INCIDENTS 257 242 104 132 INCIDENTS OF DRUG USE 17 3 4 2
It is interesting that in the 2001-02 school year one of the schools dropped the SAP program, which resulted in a slight increase in fights.
That school has now reinstated the SAP program.
Another successful program in this district is our drug testing of athletes.
This contributes in part to the reduction in drug use.
Our continuing goal with the Safe and Drug Free Celebrate Graduation party is to increase the number of seniors who attend the all night alcohol/drug-free party on graduation night.
This is a very effective way to keep them safe and sober.
Since 1998-99 the percentage of seniors attending has steadily increased.
The percentage of attendance in 1998- 99 was 75%, in 2001-02 attendance reached 92%.

With Murtaugh School District being so small it is hard to assess how well our Safe and DrugFree Program is influencing students.
I can report that last year we had no weapons violations, fight numbers were down and only one incident of possession of a substance on campus.
Two students failed the drug test and they both received treatment and one was reported clean midyear.
Our District's number one Safe and Drug-Free goal this year is to reduce harassment.
We have many students that are "picked on" in a "joking way," however, kids do not know when to stop and must be taught.
As always we plan to have a successful Red Ribbon Week and promote safe and drug-free schools throughout the school year.

Nampa School District's Safe and Drug Free Schools Program (SDFS) is both comprehensive and collaborative.
Its foundations (education, prevention, intervention, etc.) form a framework for many program extensions throughout the District.
In addition, 100% of the SDFS programs also meet the mission and goal statements of the Healthy Nampa Healthy Youth Coalition and, as such, have developed State and Federal granted programs in collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club of Nampa, the City of Nampa and Nampa Police Department.
No Nampa School District Student Advocacy Program (previously Student Assistance Program) activity stands alone.
Every program addition must link to another and, specifically, to the comprehensive Safe and Drug Free Schools guidelines.
One collaborative program within the District that exemplifies this philosophy in action is the Alpha I Alternative Program, specifically the Suspension School.
This Program, new in 2001-02, is funded by Nampa School District and SDFS with in-kind contributions from private citizens and the City of Nampa as well as the Office of Juvenile Justice Department of Corrections (OJJDC) partnership grants with the City of Nampa and Healthy Nampa Healthy Youth.
This is an intervention program which interrupts students' unacceptable behavior with required work in cognitive self-change (compatible with the Canyon County Juvenile Probation).
Students who are suspended for 3-5 days from their middle school or high school are required to spend an equivalent number of days at Suspension School.
In addition to work on their behavioral issues, they also receive work in law related education, career development and work ethics.
Site-based drug and alcohol interventions and education are also on-going.
A community involvement piece, Careers-at-Lunch, brings local business and industry people to the site to discuss their work, how they got their jobs and the potential for students in their field.
This has had the mutual benefit of acquainting the students with their community as well as acquainting community members with teenagers in Nampa.
The results of the Suspension School Program have been outstanding.
The repeat suspension rate, which was 71% in 2000-01 when there was no Suspension School, was reduced to 24% last year.
Students keep from being suspended by changing their behavior.
If they can change their behavior at school, what effect will this have on the street in the form of juvenile arrests? Both Nampa Police Department and Nampa School District are developing correlations.
We have also learned that the proportion of juvenile arrests coincides with the proportion of suspensions for certain behaviors: Nampa Police Department (2000 statistics) showed 4% of their juvenile arrests were for weapons, 24% for acts of aggression and 10.4% for drug related crimes.
Suspension school statistics (200102) were 3% for weapons, 28% for fighting and 10% for drug related incidents.
These statistics will help both agencies in developing future programming as well as refining programs currently in place, another example of the effectiveness of collaborative programming across community entities.

Even though we are small in size with limited resources, New Plymouth School District feels that the Safe and Drug-Free prevention programs are successful.
At the elementary level, our goal has been to decrease the number of playground timeouts.
In 2000-2001 there were 95.
In 2001-2002 there were 77.
We believe this is due to several programs offered at the school: Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), School Resource Officer (SRO), adult and student mentors, elementary Student Assistance Program (SAP) groups, Positive Action, and Here's Looking at You 2000 (HLAY).
At the middle and high school level our goal has been to decrease tobacco usage.
Student daily tobacco use has decreased as measured on the Idaho Substance Use and School Climate Survey from 2001-to 2002.
Tobacco citations have decreased from 10 in 2000 to 3 in 2001.
We believe this is due to: DARE, School Resource Officer, Tobacco Coalition and SAP groups.

The Malad Renaissance Program is a voluntary program in which students are acknowledged for excellence in three different areas: academics, attendance and behavior determines who is eligible.
Because of the Renaissance Program our motto at Malad High School has become "Preparing Students For the Future-A Team Effort."
Educators, parents, business and community leaders are working together to help motivate students toward success in these three areas.
A work team is made up of all elected vice-presidents in the school, volunteer staff members, parents and community members.
The Malad Renaissance Program began in January 2002.
Fall of 2003 is the first time for the .5 improvement to apply.
A student who does not qualify with all A's, B's or C's can become eligible if they show a .5 improvement in their GPA.
Thirteen students qualified by showing either this improvement or by improving their grades enough to qualify in 2003.
Bug Awards are also handed out on Fridays.
Students who are doing something a teacher would like to see reinforced may be given a Bug Award by that teacher; BUG meaning "Being Unusually Good."
Recipients of the awards receive a Snickers candy bar at a drawing held each Friday.
The improvement and the Bug Awards are especially keyed to motivating At Risk students.
This program also promotes a positive climate in our school.
All groups are recognized and take part.
A total of 180 students are currently members of the Renaissance Program and "Celebrating Success".
The Mustang After School Program (ASP) served a total of 92 youth that attend either elementary, middle, or high school in Oneida School District.
Elementary aged children made up the majority of participants and the middle and high school students attended as youth mentors.
The Program was held 4 days per week during the school year with 84% of the children participating receiving either free or reduced cost lunches.
Many of the children are considered 'at risk', which includes lower income families, single-parent families, English as a second language, and latch key children.
During the course of the program, the children participated in a variety of character building activities.
Although we had not yet developed a pre test, we did use a survey to help us evaluate the program.
The results indicated that the program was beneficial to the children.
We feel that many of the youth had an increase in both their knowledge and skills involving positive peer interaction and their own individual self worth.
The skills they learn, practice and develop while attending the After School Program will help the children feel good about themselves and their friendships as they grow.
Children that grow up with a good sense of self and a positive regard for others are less likely to become involved with drugs.
In conjunction with the After School Program, the District's Community Resource Worker offered Family Fun Night for the families whose children attended the ASP.
Once a month families came to the school and shared a meal together.
The parents participated in a parenting group and the children participated in another activity.
Through the use of a survey, we found that the families enjoyed this activity and that their parenting skills knowledge had increased due to participation in the program.

Over the last five years, the Snake River District has developed strong Safe and Drug-Free School programs.
Peer Delivered Programs such as Peer Helpers provide students with leadership training and a class on working one-on-one with needy students in providing support and appropriate direction.
Idaho Drug Free Youth (IDFY) has grown over the years and provides leadership training and a positive support group that has a strong influence over many students.
We have also developed a strong peer -modeling program for older students.
These students go to the elementary schools and work with the younger children.
We have a Student Asset Development Team that goes out to elementary and middle schools and teaches the younger students concepts of positive assets in their lives.
The high school student council has taken asset development as one of their projects to help improve the school.
Curriculum materials and concept activities have been integrated into other class curricula to enhance prevention.
Health class curriculums have been significantly improved with effective materials to support all areas of prevention instruction.
Parenting programs are being taught, and the number of parents taking the class increases every year.
Red Ribbon activities have been organized and planned at appropriate grade level curriculum.
Junior and senior high activities are different and the students to enhance student participation provide ideas.
All teachers get some training in awareness and are provided activities that can be integrated into their regular curriculum.
Student intervention has been a positive influence for students who have problems.
It includes a student evaluation to assist the student and parents to understand the student's problem level.
The second part of the intervention is an education class to help the student understand the consequences of use.
Staff student advisors are selected along with parents who relate well with students and have the ability to promote positive outcomes in the students.
Statistics from the Safe and Drug-Free School Grant Reports 1997-98 to 2001-2002 show: Â· In the first four years we were using the SDFS Grant, the number of Snake River students arrested, or students ticketed for use on school grounds, or referred to our program by Bingham County reduced 62% .
Â· In the last five years the number of home suspensions has decreased by 82%.
Â· The number of in-school suspension reduced by 68%.
Â· In last five years the number of school truancies has decreased by 60 %

Our first objective is to maintain the same 2001-2002 school year level of zero drug use on our campus for the 20022003 school year.
The Council's second objective iss to continue to provide a curriculum and have special events that educate our students about the importance of remaining drug free.
The primary emphasis of the plan this year is to target the primary grades K-4, with decisionmaking skills related to how to effectively say no to drug use.
In the grades 5-8, the emphasis will be on "It's Cool To Be You" drug free program.

Curriculum was based on the age of the groups and interest level.
Topics that were addressed were Tobacco Free, Drug and Alcohol Prevention, and Bullying.
For the whole school, kindergarten through 12th grade, we had a Health Fair, Fun Run, Red Ribbon Week, and a musical group "The Standards."
All of these activities were based on a Drug-Free and Healthy Life Style.
We will carry these programs through the 2002-2003 school year.

The Twin Falls School District Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a comprehensive primary prevention and early intervention program for students in K-12 grades.
Programs include a systematic effort to educate, identify, assess, refer and support students with drug abuse problems and other high-risk behaviors, which are or may interfere with their education and life development.
Direct Services are provided by two full-time and two half-time Student Assistance Specialists (Master Level Counselors/Social Workers) who provide services to two junior high schools, one high school and two alternative schools; and four para-professional mentors who provide services to four elementary schools.

Our prevention program did not take on new programs this year.
We continued to target the elementary grades with programs such as McGruff, Here's Looking at You 2000, Conflict Resolution and Kids Care.
Our Drug Awareness Resistance Education (DARE) program targets the fifth grade.
At the secondary level we use our Health and Child Development classes as the main avenue for drug education; however, all classes are involved in discussions and other process activities with Red Ribbon week, guest speakers, and special topics.
With other area schools we were involved in bringing Dave Pelzer to speak to the students and staff.
Our after school and summer program provide a variety of alternative activities for students.
This program is primarily funded by a national grant.
During this time they work toward setting goals and are provided training in drug education, conflict resolution, and refusal skills.
In examining our current programs activities and their effects; we found activities for all grade levels, all risk factor areas from individual to community, and all internal and external asset area categories.
We have met our goals to remain or decrease alcohol and drug use incident with less than ten incidents.
Our Student Assistance Program was used 128 times during the 1999-2000 school year and by helping students resolve their problems, the Student Assistance Program was only needed 90 times last year.
Our expulsions from 1999 to the past year dropped from three to one and our fights have dropped almost 30% over that time period.

The Vallivue School District is committed to developing and implementing policies and procedures promoting and encouraging safe and drug free schools for Vallivue patrons and staff.
Vallivue annually reviews current drug and alcohol policies, analyzes and uses data from drug and alcohol survey results, researches and implements effective best practice programs, is developing and implementing a comprehensive K-12 drug, alcohol and violence prevention program, supports staff development, and encourages parental involvement through community outreach.
Some highlights at each level include: Vallivue elementary schools implement a variety of curriculums including character development, TRIBES, and the best practice Lifeskills Training Program, which teaches social skills, social management and drug prevention.
One of the goals of the program is to increase the number and percentage of students who decrease or avoid use of alcohol, tobacco and/or other drugs.
Of the 5% who reported using drugs, 100% reported ending drug use.
Other elementary activities include a student mentoring program, student peacemakers, and individual and small group counseling for issues such as low self esteem, friendship and divorce.
Vallivue Middle School is also implementing the Life Skills Training Program for students in grades six through eight.
Success Club, an after-school tutoring program, served ninety students and out of the 45 students who attended regularly, 6% improved their reading grades, 38% improved their math grades, 87% improved reading achievement levels, 56% improved math achievement levels, and 53% improved their school attendance.
Vallivue High School has a Student Support System for students who are new to the district, as well as a tutoring program, and the peer-counseling program, Natural Helpers.
Support groups are offered to students for anger management, grief and loss, and drug and alcohol issues.
The Student Resource Officer teaches A "Street Law" class.
Vallivue High School also offers a "Not on Tobacco" class, a Students Against Drunk Driving Club and a Alcohol and Drug Free Night for graduating seniors.

Since implementing the mandatory drug testing for our high school extra-curricular programs (sports, band, cheerleading), we are proud that the last two years there were no positive results compared to the 3 positives the year before.
In the elementary schools, there has been a reduction of tobacco incidents.
In 2000, there were three (one including a second grader) and in 2001 and 2002, we had zero incidents.
