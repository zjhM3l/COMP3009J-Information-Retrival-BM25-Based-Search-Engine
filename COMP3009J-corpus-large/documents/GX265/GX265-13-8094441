The couple had been living in Asia for 13 years, but they wanted to return to Montana.
They viewed the purchase of the hotel as the ticket.
Jim, a former bank executive, handled the financial side of the project, while Cheryl, an accomplished commercial designer, created the hotel's interior and furnishings.
According to Cheryl, the three-story brick hotel was built in Victorian manner.
"What we tried to do here is keep the Victorian charm and add a western flair.
We still want guests to know they are in Montana."
For example, Cheryl explains, visitors will find western leather-studded furniture and western art on the walls.
But don't let the age of the building fool you.
The hotel's 27 rooms are equipped with computer modems, voice mail and private modern baths, as well as a meeting room for business retreats and receptions.
The Gagnons plan to have a chef aboard by spring to handle the restaurant and bar.
Cheryl says most people who have come to stay have a story associated with the hotel.
"One couple spent their wedding night here in 1942 and came back to spend their second honeymoon," says Cheryl.
"It's been rewarding to hear that people appreciate what we have done."

The Grand Union, built in 1882, was the resting-place for wealthy traders who came by steamboat to Montana's oldest town.
Today, the newly renovated hotel continues to offer travelers a comfortable home on the legendary Missouri River.

The Teller Wildlife Refuge Birds of a Feather: Medicine Lake Refuge Chico Hot Springs' 4 R's
A Picture Paints a Thousand Words At Trail's End: The Bozeman Trail
Every spring, the staff at the Medicine Lake Refuge wait for some regular guests to flock in--10,000 white pelicans, that is.
C
ome April this mighty bird, with a wingspan of nine feet, migrates from the Gulf of Mexico to its home in northeastern Montana.
According to Refuge Manager, Ted Gutzke, Medicine Lake has one of the largest white pelican rookeries left in the United States.
More than 2,000 pelicans are produced each year.
But pelicans are not the only birds that find respite here.
Double-crested cormorants, California and ring-billed gulls and great blue herons also nest at this 49-square-mile area.
"A lot of avid birders travel to the refuge so they can add birds to their life lists," says Gutzke.
"The refuge is home to the rare Baird's sparrow and the threatened piping plovers."
Another unique aspect of the refuge, he says, is the attached 11,360-acre wilderness area.
Gutzke says opportunities for wildlife observation and photography are plentiful.
A self-guided 14-mile scenic auto tour is open from late April through September.
A 100foot observation tower is available year-round.
Gutzke suggests the best months to view wildlife are May and October.
Portions of the refuge are open to hunting and fishing.

Refuge in Southwest Montana inspires feelings of "refuge" for human visitors as well as for the bir ds and wildlife that use the area.
The Teller Refuge is one of the first privately owned and managed wildlife refuges in Montana.
The area is comprised of farmland and river bottom environments which host a remarkable variety of species including moose, elk, beavers, foxes, geese, ducks, herons, ospreys and eagles.
A spring creek also seeps from the refuge, where fisherman may be challenged by its population of wily brown and rainbow trout.
The refuge is dedicated to maintaining and improving its riparian resources, and in fact, habitat improvement projects for fish and birds are ongoing.
Mary Stone explains that the refuge is a secluded spot where one can observe wildlife all day and relax in one of the five charming farmhouses at night.
Two of the homes were originally built in the 1870s.
Guests may choose to be pampered with full dining and maid service or cook their own meals in a well-furnished country kitchen.
Mary says the staff doesn't push the refuge philosophy on guests, but if they are interested in listening there is plenty to share.
However, she adds, "Many visitors feel that by coming here, their vacation money is going towards something beneficial for all people."

Chico Hot Springs' 4 R's

elax, rejuvenate and recuperate--these were the three R's that Chico Warm Springs provided guests in 1900.
One hundred years later, a fourth R, romance, adds to the charm at Chico Hot Springs Lodge.
"Memories are made at this `historically romantic' resort," says Colin Davis, Chico's General Manager.
"Chico is a destination in itself, a quintessential Montana experience."
Located in the Paradise Valley corridor between Livingston and Yellowstone National Park, Chico first opened its doors 100 years ago as a therapeutic lodge with a hospital wing.
Today, the resort provides a unique blend of rustic rooms with shared bathrooms to log homes and private cabins.
Guests can choose to dine on filet mignon or burgers.
Chico is upper class without being pretentious.
Locals garbed in blue jeans and cowboy boots may sit next to movie stars.
In fact, actor Steve McQueen came to Chico wanting peace and quiet so he checked into the resort under an assumed name.
After a week of non-notoriety, a local rancher started a
friendly conversation with him.
When the rancher asked him his name he replied, "Steve McQueen."
The rancher responded, "Pleased to meet you.
What do you do?"
T
Besides the year-round, outdoor mineral pools, Chico offers visitors fly fishing, horseback riding and mountain biking.
In the winter, guests can take a dog sled trek or cross-country ski at nearby Yellowstone National Park.
Chico will kick off its 100th birthday bash with its annual summer series that brings in multicultural events for locals and visitors alike.

A Picture Paints A Thousand Words
T
he only physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark Expedition is Captain William Clark's signature at Pompeys Pillar.
Almost 200 years later the town of Whitehall, Montana, is leaving its own mark of the upcoming Lewis and Clark Bicentennial on downtown buildings.
Four brightly colored murals depicting scenes from the expedition were completed last summer.
The Whitehall Chamber of Commerce is the principal sponsor of the mural project.
The group decided that something needed to be
done to give Whitehall a sense of pride.
"This project was a complete community effort," says Renea Cassidy, Director of the Chamber.
"Local artists volunteered their time to create and paint the murals and many of the town's businesses donated money to pay for paints and supplies."
She adds that even the area's children helped with the painting.
The murals depict actual events that members of the expedition experienced as they passed through this area during their 1803Â­1806 journey.
Cassidy explains that the murals have brought a sense of warmth and welcome to this town located along the Jefferson River in southwest Montana.
The chamber is creating a brochure that outlines a walking tour for visitors to view the creations.
Whitehall hopes to have eight more murals completed by this fall.
Want to discover Whitehall? Contact Renea Cassidy at the Whitehall Chamber of Commerce at (406) 287-2260.
he Bozeman Trail dates from 1863 to 1868.
The trail stretched from current-day Casper, Wyoming, north to Billings and west to Bozeman, Montana.
The trail began as a shortcut route to Montana's gold fields in Virginia City.
While only about 3,500 emigrants traveled the trail from 1864-1866, its most significant consequence was that it cut through the best hunting grounds of the Northern Plains Indians.
This ultimately led to a military presence in the region and Indian wars.
The Frontier Heritage Alliance, a nonprofit organization with members in Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota and Nebraska, is helping to coordinate and promote cultural heritage sites, events and themes along the trail.
The group has joined with Indian tribes, government agencies, historic organizations and towns on this project.
One organized project is a traveling exhibit of the recently discovered diaries, drawings and paintings of Major Robert Dunlap Clarke, the paymaster on the Bozeman Trail from 1867 to 1868.
The exhibit is being prepared at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming.
In Montana the display can be viewed at Hardin's Big Horn County Museum from July 15 through August 15, the Yellowtail Dam Museum near Fort Smith, August 16Â­31, and Chief Plenty Coups State Park in Pryor, September 1Â­15.
