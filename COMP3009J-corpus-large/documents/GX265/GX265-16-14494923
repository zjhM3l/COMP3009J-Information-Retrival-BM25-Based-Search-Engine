Anchorage case puts cold chill on dual agency by Blanche Evans Reprinted with permission from the July 30 and 31 issues of RealtyTimes at www.realtytimes.com Part One isclose, disclose, disclose may soon become a more important real es tate catchphrase than location, location, location.
An Ala sk a n ju dg e h a s a wa rd e d $200,000 to a buyer whose dual agent failed to provide proper disclosure of her agency status which resulted in the buyer overpaying for his home.
And that was only one misdeed in a long list of behaviors by Realtor Bonn i e M e h n e r t h at t h e j u dg e c al l e d "outrageous."
But failure to disclose agency is a problem that could keep haunting Mehner long after she and her broker pay their civil fines.
She could face industry sanctions as well.
Joe Columbus, Jr. and his agent Robert Holbrook and McAlpine Investments, Inc. sued Mehner and her broker Prudential Jack White when Columbus discovered that he overpaid for his new home.
Columbus made a full-price offer of $585,000, because the listing agent, Mehner, had tricked him into using her services to buy the home from her ins t e ad o f h is o w n ag e n t .
S h e w as successful because she failed to disclose what h er role as a dual agent would mean to Columbus as the buyer.
From the findings of the court, Anchorage RealtorÂ® Bonnie Mehner: Â· Poached the buyer from her agent: Â· Tricked him into believing that he could not secure the home without her help: Â· Told the buyer that his initial offer was too low, and then failed to tell the seller of the buyer's offer.
The buyer's first of fer was closer to comparables than what the buyer ultimately paid for the home Â· Told the buyer there were multiple o ffer s o n t he hom e when t her e were not to encourage him to pay more for the home Â· Failed to show him existing comparables that would have illustrated t hat h e wa s ove rp ay in g for th e home Â· admitted in court that she did not follow state law with regard to dual representation.
The court ruled in April that Mehner behaved unethically and vio lated state law by not informing the seller of Columbus' initial offer, misleading him about other offers on the house, failing to properly inform him about her dual agency status, and unfairly leading him to believe he could buy the house only if he made his offer through her, said an account of the story in the Anchorage Daily News when the ruling became public on Sunday, July 28th, 2002.
Columbus' broker also benefited f rom the rulin g.
A s a state-li censed agent, but not a member of the Anc h o r a g e B oa rd o f R e a lt o r s , a g e nt Holbrook and the firm he represents McAlpine Investments, Inc., were able to collect half of the $35,040 commission paid to Mehner and her firm for the dual representation of both the buyer and seller in the transaction.
If Holbrook had been a member, he would not have been able to collect commissions via a civil suit.
Realtors are precluded in their codes of ethics from suing one another.
They instead have to petition their boards in "procuring cause" hearings to collect disputed commissions.
Mehner was a 27-year veteran, an award-winning agent whose earnings topped $600,000 a year.
However, between 30 and 60 percent of her earnings came from sales in which she performed as a dual ag ent, a cco rding to co ur t records, and that's the real crux of the case--not the rogue behavior of one agent, but the impli cations for du al agents at large.
The real estate industry has so far been protective of the dual-dip transaction, because brokers and agents can work half as hard to get results - one tr ansaction closed; two c om mi ssion sides collected.
This as evidenced by the development of alternative business models to dual agency such as transactional brokerage and designated agency.
But as cases such as Mehner's come to light, how will the industry and large brokers such as hers continue with the practice if it means the expense of consumer goodwill? "Agents are going to have to do a better job in complying with their disclosure requirements and obligations to the consumer," says Charlie Sandb e r g , br o ke r fo r E R A R e a l E s t a t e Center, in Anchorage.
Sandberg is a national director of the National Association of Realtors and a mem ber of the NA R's pro fessio nal standards committee.
He also served a s an ex pert witness for the plaintiff.
Sandber g believes this case will resonate with consumers.
"This is a big story," says Sandberg.
"The point is that it is important that the consumer understand and agents understand who they work for and that the agent has the obligation to tell the consumer who they are working for and un der what ci r cu msta nc es ch ang es might take place.
"What we'll see is consumer awareness over representation," continues Sandberg.
"Buyers will want their issues represented, and you'll see more buyers being represented to minimize conflicts of interest and that could pose some economic challenges for offices dependent on dual transactions, not to mention the liability issues and statutory liability."
Mehner's worst misstep could be one of timing.
In an increasingly intol e r a n t -o f - m i s cr e a nt s p o l i t i ca l a n d economic environment, she could become the next "example."
Mehner could face a hearing and disciplinary actions from her board's professional standards committee.
According to insiders, the Alaska Real Estate Commission is already looking into her case as well.
While a variety of sanctions could apply, in the worst case, Mehner could lose her license to practice real estate.
Part Two Why Dual Agents Are Reluctant To Disclose Their Agency Status An Anchorage judge has laid the gavel down on the head of a dual agent wh o faile d to p ro per ly d i scl ose her client and causing him to overpay for his home.
Yet statistics across the country show that other agents are doing the same thing.
Why aren't some double-dip agents providing proper disclosures? Agent Bonnie Mehner could not be reached for comment, but she defended some of her actions in court with the following statement: "I'm afraid that I' m o ne of a th o u s an d (r eal e st at e agents) who don't quite live up to the standard because it is not practical."
Practical for whom? Mehner or her customers? Alaska state law clearly says that a licensee should "disclose in writing the licensee's agency relationship with the seller to each prospective buyer at the time that the licensee begins to provide sp eci fic assistance to lo cate or Continued on page 11

News From The Commissioner Jerry Holt
Education Rule Changes The initial response from the Arizona Real Estate Educators Association (AZREEA) to proposed changes in rules addressing education matters was quite negative.
We agreed with many of the suggestions and have published a revised draft of the proposed rules.
The new draft is available on the Late Breaking News page on the Department's web site.
At the request of AZREEA, the deadline for the comment period has been extended to October 1.
We encourage you to review the draft and send your comments to Cindy Wilkinson at cwilkinson@re.state.az.us or by mail to Cindy at the Department's Phoenix office.
Progress in Sonora The Legislature of the State of Sonora, Mexico, has passed a law to establish a State Registry of Real Estate Agents.
This is the first step in creating real estate regulation in Sonora that mirrors Arizona's real estate regulatory structure.
The law requires agents to register in the State Registry of Real Estate Agents.
To register, agents must: Â· Present personal identification and information relating to their business and its location; Â· Accredit their professional training, specialized knowledge and experience in real estate sales; Â· Agree to enroll in training programs on a regular basis and provide proof of completion; and Â· Prove they have not been convicted of any crime of fiscal malfeasance or of any other serious crime.
Registry information created by
the new law will be available to the public.
I've been working on this project along with about 15 Mexican experts and 15 fellow Gringos since 1991 so it is particularly gratifying to see our efforts come to fruition before my departure as Commissioner now scheduled for December 30, 2002.
Thanks also to Governors Symington, Beltrones, Lopez Nogales and, of course , Jane Dee Hull without whose diligent support victory would have not happened.
And then came the tough part Asking for and accepting the resignations of three of the Department's key people to comply with budget cuts imposed by the State Legislature, was one of the toughest things I have ever had to do in my 22 years in public service.
"It's a hellava way to run a railroad," but it was the lesser of about three "evils" (choices) with which I was presented.
So, the deed has been done, the budget cutting orders have been carried out and we're still here.
Of the people still standing at the Department, all are doing what they can to fill in the gaps and three, in particular, Ira Feldman, Cindy Wilkinson and Rose Fraze, are taking on directly the jobs of Acting Deputy Commissioner, Acting Director of Education and Acting Director of Licensing, respectively, and doing admirably at this juncture.
The irony is that A .R.S. Â§ 322103(B) requires the Commissioner to lower all fees because the projected revenue generated will likely exceed 110 percent of the amount of the final appropriation granted the Department by the Legislature for the budget year be-
ginning Jul y 1, 2002 and ending June 30, 2003.
The only "saving graces" are that nobody can read, understand and interpret A.R.S. Â§ 32-2103(B) (because of the word "anticipated"--read it and you'll see what I mean.)
[See be low.
Ed.] Secondly, the Legislature is scheduled to convene in January 2003 and that provides an opportunity for someone to propose a new way of funding the Department's operation.
As the general said to the troops about to climb over the side into landing craft headed for the beachhead, "I had hoped to be with you boys as you hit the beach under heavy enemy firepower, but unfortunately I'm needed elsewhere...."
Congratulations to Terry Zajac for being selected as the nation's "Instructor of the Year" by the Real Estate Educators Association.
He's clearly one of the best real estate educators in the nation and an all-around nice guy to boot.
[This is the text of A.R.S. Â§ 32-2103(B) Ed.]
"Each year the commissioner shall revise all fees collected under this chapter within the limits prescribed by this chapter in such a manner that the revenue derived from such fees equals at least ninety-five per cent but not more than one hundred ten per cent of the anticipated appropriated budget for the department for the succeeding fiscal year.
If the revenue derived from the fees exceeds one hundred ten per cent of the anticipated appropriated budget for the department for the succeeding fiscal year, the commissioner shall lower the fees in the succeeding year in proportion to the

Things you should know k A.A.C. R4-28-502(B) states that "any salesperson or broker advertising the salesperson's or broker's own property for sale, lease, or exchange shall disclose the salesperson's or broker's status as a salesperson or broker, and as the property owner in the advertisement."
We see advertising where "owner/agent" is abbreviated "O/A."
This is not satisfactory and might not be interpreted by a reasonable person to mean "owner/agent."
"Owner/Agent" must be spelled out in all advertising.
k We understand that some licensees believe it is acceptable to use or recommend a home inspector who has not applied for certification by the Board of Technical Registration as long as the fact that the person has not applied for certification is disclosed to all parties to a transaction.
Wrong.
A person who conducts home inspections and has not applied for certification could face a $2,000 civil penalty.
A licensee who recommends or uses such a home inspector could face disciplinary action by the Department.
For more information about home inspector certification, see www.btr.state.az.us k The Home Buyer's Guide to Geologic Hazards in Arizona is now available from the Arizona Geological Survey.
This new publication can assist those who are considering buying a house or raw land.
The publication describes the most widespread and common geologic hazards such as floods, earthquakes, mass movement (landslides), subsidence and fissures, radon and other factors to consider before buying or building.

unlicensed employees.
Th e rule iden tif ies th e areas in which a policy is required under statute and requires that it be in writing.
Besides providing guidance for brokers and their employees, it provides a standa r d f o r t he D ep ar t me n t t o u s e i n evaluating complaints of a broker's negligence or lack of supervision.
In addition to minor changes to existing Sections to be consistent with current rulewriting standards and to improve clarity, this rulemaking amends A.A.C. R4-2 8-1101 to describe a lice n s e e ' s s t a n d a r d o f c a r e a nd disclosures that may be required.
Clarifying what types of disclosures are required to be made by a broker or salesperson will have a positive impact on both consumers and the licensees.
Behavior that previously fell short of the expected standard but was merely deemed unethical will now clearly be a violation of the rules.
Brokers and salesp e r s o n s w i ll ha v e a be t t e r understanding of what disclosures they must make, as well as how and when they are to make them.
Consumers will benefit from the additional disclosures they are entitled to receive.
Misunderstandings will be reduced, and disputes that lead to expensive and time-cons u m in g l i t ig a t i o n a re e x pe c t e d t o decrease.
A minor change to R4-28-1101(E) will r equire a salesperson or brok er with an interest in a transaction to disclose that interest to consumers up front, and not merely require disclosure when the licensee is acting as a principal.
Consumers will have this inf or ma t io n w h e n e v a lu a t in g th e a d va n ta g es a n d d isa d v ant a ge s o f a prospective transaction, which will allow them to make more informed decisions.
The new Section, R4-28-1103, identifies the areas a broker is to address with licensed and unlicensed persons in the broker's employ in order to demonstrate that the broker has taken or is taking reasonable steps to supervise these persons in the course of their employment with the broker.
This responsibility to supervise is not new.
What is new is setting out in one Section the areas over which the broker is expected to supervise licensees and other employees, and the requirement that off i c e p o l i c i e s an d p r o c e du r e b e established in writing.
Here is the text of the amended

Arizona Real Estate Bulletin Â· August 2002
New Substantive Policy Statement allows brokers to operate `Service Centers' he Department has published Substantive Policy Statement No. 29 which allows a broker to establish "Service Center" offices.
Here is the text of the statement: As provided by A.R.S. Â§ 32-2127, a branch office is a place of business, in addition to the principal office, maintained by a broker and sta ffed by licensed and unlicensed employees, has a branch manager and is usually open during what are considered regular business hours.
Consumers can determine from required signage that it is one of a broker's places of business.
In recognition of the continuing population growth of Arizona, some brokers wish to establish "service centers" in different parts of the cities or counties which they serve.
In contrast to a branch office, these offices
T
are unstaffed offices which will usually contain a desk, telephone, fax, copier, and perhaps a computer for limited use on an as-needed basis.
Having a satellite service center can reduce time and fuel used by licensees, their clients and customers that would otherwise be spent driving to the main or a branch office in another part of the ci ty to prep are or fax a co ntr act , download new listings, preview available homes on-line, prepare and copy documents, or meet with clients.
These service centers a re no t deemed to be branch offices within the meaning of A.R.S.Â§ 32-2127, providing that none of the service centers is t he pri nc ip a l plac e of bu si ne ss (main or branch office) for any of the broker's employees, and is an unstaffed facility used on an as-needed basis for transient activities such as
those described above.
If one or more employees begins to utilize the service center as a principal place of business, the broker must immediately establish it as a branch office.
If signage at the service center identifies the emplo ying broker, it should also contain the designated broker's name and telephone number.
Signage at a service center is not required.

Widow awarded $30,000 from Recovery Fund
A
n order entered on June 14, 2002, in Maricopa County Superior Court gave $30,000 to 85-year old Georgia Anderson as partial reimbursement for damages awarded to her and the estate of her late husband in a judgment for breach of contract and fraud.
The judgment included $75,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages against defendants Jacob Stahlecker, a licensed real estate broker, and his wife Becky of Mesa.
On September 15, 1998, before Becky became a licensed real estate salesperson, the Stahleckers entered into a purchase contract to buy the Anderson's property located on Broadway in Mesa, Arizona,.
They agreed to pay $5,000 as earnest money.
Seventy-five thoursand dollars was to be paid to the Andersons.
Mr. Stahlecker prepared the purchase contract which provided that Stahleckers would record a first deed of trust against the property in favor of the Andersons, and make monthly interest payments of $629; a $10,000 payment on September 1, 1999; and a balloon payment of the balance due on September 1, 2000.
The contract also provided that Stahleckers could extend the loan by making an additional payment of $20,000 by September 1, 2000.
The Andersons intended to use money from the sale as retirement income.
Mr. Anderson, who has worked as a real
estate agent until 1980, was in failing health.
He and Mrs. Anderson trusted Stahleckers to execute the necessary documents to carry out the intent of the purchase contract, and to protect their security interest.
The loan was risky because there was a low down payment and the Stahlekers were not going to occupy the property.
Stahlecker did not go through a title company and did not record a note or first deed of trust to protect Andersons' security interest, as a title company would have.
Instead, Stahlecker recorded a quit-claim deed from Andersons and an Affidavit of Property Value on or about December 21, 1998 which stated that the property would be purchased with a loan from seller that was "secured by other security."
Stahleckers did not explain what that meant, and did not disclose that they intended to borrow $78,000 from other persons, and would be in first position because Stahleckers never recorded the necessary documents to secure Anderson's purported first position security.
On June 1, 1999, Mr. Anderson passed away at the age of 87.
After his death, Mrs. Anderson, who was counting on the proceeds from the sale of their Mesa property to support her in her senior years, attempted to collect the delinquent monthly payments and the $10,000 payment due on September 1, 1999.
Mrs. Anderson learned that, in
November 1999, Stahleckers obtained a loan for $78,000 secured by her property from another lender.
Stahleckers represented to the mortgage broker involved in that transaction, who was also a real estate broker, that they owned the Mesa property free and clear and wanted to borrow money against it to rehabilitate another property they owned on West Van Buren in Phoenix.
Stahleckers defaulted on that loan and a notice of trustee's sale was recorded on July 27, 2000.
When Mrs. Anderson could not collect anything and discovered that Stahleckers had not secured her interest in the property, she filed a lawsuit against Stahleckers.
Anderson obtained judgment against the Stahleckers in April 2001, but was unable to collect anything from them.
She filed application for payment from the Arizona Real Estate Recovery Fund in November 2001.
An order for payment was entered in January of this year.
However, the Stahleckers had filed for bankruptcy just before payment was ordered from the Recovery Fund, so Mrs. Anderson had to appear in bankruptcy court to have her judgment declared nondischargeable and to get permission to pursue her civil lawsuit.
It took five months for the bankruptcy court to declare Stahleckers' debt nondischargeable.

Dual agency Continued from page 2
acquire real estate for the buyer, and obtain from each prospective buyer a signed acknowledgement that the buyer is aware of the agency relationship between the licensee and the seller."
When acting as a buyer's agent the licensee may "act as an agent for both a prospective seller and a prospective buyer of real estate only after the licensee informs both the seller and the buyer of the dual agency and obtains written consent to the dual agency from both principals."
When a chan ge o cc urs, such as when Mehner went from being the seller's agent to a dual agent, "during a transaction that makes a prior written disclosure required by this section incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate, the licensee shall make a revised disclosure, in writing, to all parties to the transaction as soon as possible."
Mehner did not disclose her buyer (or her seller, for that matter) until after she had shown him several homes, two of which were her own listings.
The buyer had presented a contract o nc e t hr ou gh a n ot h er age n t whi c h Mehner declined to show her seller, an acti on w hic h got her in de eper hot water.
But, it was only when the buyer, thinking he could not secure the house otherwise, presented a contract through her, did she disclose the nature of her dual agency.
For these actions and more, Mehne r a n d h er br ok er w er e f in e d o v er $200,000.
In addition, Mehner may face statutory and professional standards sanctions.
In the worst case, she could lose her license to practice real estate.
Risk of sanctions may appear remote to agents who feel that "everybody does it."
A ccor di ng t o a pr evi ou s Rea lty Times story by Broderick Perkins, fewer than 10 percent of Massachusetts' real estate agents fully comply with agency disclosure law, according to a study by the state's real estate regulatory agency, the Board of Registration of Real Estate.
"Likewise, John Pinto, a real estate broker and expert witness in San Jose, CA says nearly all real estate agents violate California's disclosure laws by not fully disclosing to consumers who they r epr es ent --th e bu yer, the s ell er or both," writes Perkins.
"And the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Federation of America says because many consumers aren't even
aware they have a r ight to k now by whom and how they are represented, they are underrepresented to the tune of $10 billion a year in higher home costs."
In these agents defense, are disclosure laws not written clearly enough or is the concept of dual agency simply too risky to properly explain to consumers? According to AS 08.88.396 .
Disclosure of Agency to Pro spective Buyers and Sellers, click here, agency disclosure should be given to a consumer "at the time the licensee begins to provide specific assistance to locate or acquire real estate...."
If you are an agent who bends the rules to get both sides of a sale, that all depends on when "begins" begins and what "specific assistance" is.
Sandy Forrest, executive officer of the Anchorage Board of Realtors, says, "We do have a state law and an agency s t atu t e .
T h e A nc h o r ag e B oa rd h as formed an agency task force to review this particular statute to decide if something needs to be changed.
We're still meeting with the committee to see if the statute needs to be rewritten.
I did put in a request to NAR to get some infor mation from them, so we are trying to see what other states are doing."
Says Charlie Sandberg, a director of the NAR and an expert witness in the Mehner trial, "When you read the def inition of informed consent, you have to present all of the risks and give the consumer an understanding of the risks of a dua l a gen cy arr an geme nt.
Our obligation is to give the consumer a knowledge of what alternatives are open if they don't want to enter into it (dual agency agreement) and one alternative is go get another agent.
"Losing income is a powerful issue," h e c o n t i n u e s .
" W h e n y ou m a k e $600,000 a year as in Mehner's case, 30 to 60 percent of her incom e was dual agency income.
She would have to statistically work twice as hard to make the same income.
The other issue is that by nature real estate agents are marketing properties and get it purchased for their buyers and sold for their sellers.
Their focus isn't their legal issues under agency, they just want to do the best job for their people, and sometimes you lose sight of how to get from beginning to closing."
The real estate industry, so far, has been protective of the dual-dip transaction.
This case asks the question will the industry continue to protect dual agency at the expense of consumer goodwill? A lot depends on how much
consumers latch onto cases like Mehner's and wha t the risk/reward is f or brokers who condone practices such as Mehner's.
Before she landed in court, Mehner was acknowledged as the top agent in her brokerage.
One observer noted that the indu st ry ma y h av e be ne fi t te d w i th a temporary reprieve.
The Mehner case was settled before punitive damages were awarded by the judge.
"There is no errors and omissions insurance payoff for fraud," says the observer.

If fees exceed 110 percent of the appropriation, fees must be reduced.
Because the Legislature has cut $297,000 from the Department's 20022003 appropriation of $3,115,000, fees are projected to easily exceed 115 percent.
This means the new real estate commissioner, who will be appointed by the new governor in January 2003, will have to reduce fees to compensate for the reduction in the appropriation unless the law is changed during the 2003 legislative session.
