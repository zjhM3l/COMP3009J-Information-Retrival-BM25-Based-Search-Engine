Homeless Service Providers Survey Summer 1997 Results Summary For More Information: James Wiedle, Research Analyst Planning 
The survey is conducted by asking homeless providers to collect demographic information, such as gender and marital status, from their homeless clients on a predetermined day.
The information collected from participating agencies is then constructed into a report that describes characteristics of their homeless clients.
The Homeless Service Providers Survey is an attempt to study a population not easily accessed, nor understood.
Homeless individuals do not have permanent residence.
They change locations frequently throughout the day.
They move across communities and service providers.
It is extremely difficult to implement a survey that characterizes the entire homeless population.
This survey is not intended to be a definitive count or description of the homeless population in the State of Alaska.
Because the survey is conducted through participating homeless service providers, it does not sample the homeless who do not seek services on the day of the survey, or in general.
Furthermore, the survey does not sample the homeless who receive services from agencies who choose not to participate in the survey.
The survey does, however, provide the community with a demographic profile of the homeless who receive services from Alaskan agencies.
This information is useful for participating agencies that want to analyze, plan, and coordinate their response to the homeless problem.
