CONTINUING CARE COMMUNITIES/RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES (CCRC's) Program Description:
Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) provide residents, through contractual agreements, lifetime shelter and a wide variety of services, including longterm health services.
Each resident pays a substantial entrance fee and monthly fees in exchange for a living unit and services.
Entrance fees and monthly service fees vary significantly by community and can be considered costly.
The amount of long term care included in the contract, the type of living unit chosen and whether one person or a couple occupies the unit can also have an effect on costs.
Communities have different policies regarding the availability and terms of entrance fee refunds.
Various levels of care such as independent living, assistance with daily activities and nursing home care are typically provided on CCRC campuses.
As their needs change, residents are usually able to move from one level of care to another without leaving the community.
If a CCRC does not have a health center on campus, it will often have an arrangement with a nearby healthcare facility to admit its residents on a priority basis.
CCRCs are not licensed by the state.
Specific components of each CCRC's health care package such as skilled nursing and assisted living services are licensed as health services.
A CCRC is not allowed to offer or enter into a continuing care contract unless it is registered with the Department of Social Services and meets certain disclosure requirements.
The continuing care contract is a legal agreement between the resident and CCRC that specifies the rights and obligations of both parties.
Potential residents should obtain professional advice before signing this agreement.
Ã¾ Eligibility Requirements: Eligibility requirements vary from community to community.
Individuals must contact each facility for specific eligibility requirements.

REVERSE ANNUITY MORTGAGE PROGRAMS Program Description:
Reverse Annuity Mortgage (RAM) programs are loans which allow homeowners, who need extra money, to tap the equity in their homes.
Unlike regular home-equity loans, there is no need for the borrower to make monthly payments to the lender.
Repayment may either be made on a pre-determined date or the date when the homeowner ceases to occupy the home.
The lender generally makes monthly payments to the borrower, although lump sum loans and lines of credit can sometimes also be arranged (and the borrower will still not need to make monthly payments).
RAM involves important decisions and can be quite complicated.
It is important that homeowners consider their plans carefully and get appropriate advice from an attorney, accountant or other, reliable professional source before making decisions.
In cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Social Services, Elderly Division, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority [CHFA] has set aside funds to make such RAM loans.
Note that borrowers for CHFA's loan must be seventy [70] years or older and at least one borrower must have costs associated with long-term care.
"Long -Term Care" describes a wide range of supportive services provided to individuals who have lost some or all capacity to function on their own due to chronic illness, and are expected to require such services for an extended period.
