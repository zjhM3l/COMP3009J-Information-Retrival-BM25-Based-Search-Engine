7.
12 AAC 52.480 LABELING, amended to alter what is required to be printed on a prescription label.
Ms. Soden summarized the history of this generic labeling regulation and the pending parallel HB 51.
She noted that changes in rules on labeling requirements would be more appropriate in 12 AAC 52.480, the labeling regulation section.
The board discussed the public comments received regarding changes in labeling regulations and noted the following concerns: The proposed regulation is inflexible in requiring generic labeling even if there is no generic drug available.
Changes in pharmacy software systems to accommodate changes in labeling requirements would be costly, especially to small pharmacies.
BR/dgl479br
ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 6 OF 21 Concern was expressed that the regulation may cause patient confusion when the drug is a multi-ingredient, compounded medication.
How would the regulation apply to generic drugs with multiple ingredients? How would this regulation be enforced? Concern was expressed that the board has not communicated clearly to the HB 51 sponsors their concerns with the wording of the bill introduced in the last legislative session.
On a motion duly made by Ms. Bueler, seconded by Mr. Bohrer, and approved unanimously, having considered public comment and any cost to private persons, it was RESOLVED to table discussion of regulation 12 AAC 52.480 as amended in the May 9, 2003 "Supplemental Notice of Proposed Changes in the Regulations of the Board of Pharmacy" and to address this at the next meeting.
Mr. Altland, who suggested that the National Association of Software Vendors could provide information and guidance, volunteered to contact the Association and report back at the next meeting.
The licensing examiner will post a question through the NABP pharmacy board's web mail asking about other state's regulations for generic labeling.
Senator Dyson commented that the board should clearly communicate its position to HB 51 sponsors.
Senator Dyson suggested that board has two strategies for addressing the problems in HB 51: the board could make a recommendation to him so that he could request that the rules committee and senate president refer the bill back to Senator Dyson's committee for further changes, or Senator Dyson could present the board's suggested amendments on the Senate floor.
Ms. Soden stated that the board would work on changes to the generic labeling regulations and present them at the next meeting, so there would be time to communicate with legislators prior to the next session.
8.
12 AAC 52.990 DISPLAY OF LICENSE CERTIFICATE, amended to alter application requirements for a licensee to post their license certificate.

The board discussed the suggestion by David Brower of the Department of Law to define "regularly" as used in AS 08.80.158 REGISTRATION OF PHARMACIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF STATE.
The board felt that current regulations address the frequency of service that requires licensing.
12 AAC 52.130 REGISTRATION OF PHARMACIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF STATE says: "A pharmacy located outside of the state that ships, mails or delivers prescription drugs more that twice annually to individual patients in the state shall register with the board.

SENATOR DYSON: HB 51 Â­ Senator Dyson reiterated that he would be working with the board on the HB 51, Generic Labeling.
SB 156 Â­ Senator Dyson noted that Alaska leads the nation in cases prenatal alcohol poisoning of children and that SB 156 would require labeling of pregnancy related products and requires posted warnings in locations where pregnancy related products are sold.
Senator Dyson asked the board for their input and support of SB 156.
SB 138 Annulling Collaborative Practice - The Alaska State Medical Association (ASMA) has expressed concerns to Senator Dyson that the Pharmacy Collaborative Practice regulations have allowed for a collaboration that breaks the link between a specific patient and a specific physician.
Senator Dyson presented an example of emergency contraception dispensed at a pharmacy involving minimal communication with the physician.
He expressed concern that without the physician in the loop, there is a potential danger to the patient.
Senator Dyson noted that he does not want SB 138 to go forward as currently written, but the bill needs to address the concerns of the medical profession and the pharmacy board without dismantling the entire collaborative practice regulation.
He wants the bill to BR/dgl479br

Nancy Davis, Alaska Pharmacist Association, joined the meeting at 11:35 a.m. and noted that the Association has been meeting with physicians and discussing collaborative practice concerns.
Ms. Bueler thanked Senator Dyson for clearly presenting his position, and noted that the Board of Pharmacy needs to be actively working with physicians to come up with wording that will be satisfactory to physicians, preserve collaborative practice, and protect the patient.
Nancy Davis, Alaska Pharmacist Association asked Senator Dyson if he would withdraw SB 138.
Senator Dyson replied that HB 138 is a club to force the issue of correcting the problems with current collaborative practice.
Senator Dyson stressed that he would go forward with HB 138 as currently written, only if the parties are unwilling or unable to fix the problem.
Senator Dyson noted that his goal is to have this resolved by beginning of the next session in February, and he requested that the board keep him in the loop as to progress on fixing current collaborative practice regulations.

Senator Dyson left the meeting at 11:45 a.m.
SCOTT TAGUE, TELEPHARMACY SOLUTIONS: Mr. Tague reported that there continues to be a great deal of interest across the state in telepharmacy.

BR/dgl479br
ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING JULY 25, 2003 PAGE 14 OF 21 Ms. Bueler noted that the wording of the pharmacy regulations needs to be crystal clear on maintaining the patient Â­ physician relationship.
It was stressed that the overwhelming consideration for the board is patient safety.
In order to proceed with collaborative practice relationships between pharmacists and physicians, the regulations need to be clarified and the board needs to inform and educate the medical community.
In addition, it was suggested that the pharmacy regulations need to include wording on "oversight" that would require Medical Board approval of collaborative protocols before they are presented to the Board of Pharmacy for approval.
Ms. Davis proposed that a pharmacy board member meet with Jim Jordon, AMA Director.
Ms Davis requested a written statement from the board that could be presented at discussions with the AMA.
Mr. Bohrer and Ms. Bueler volunteered to write the letter and email a draft to other board members.
