A method for automatically segmenting and recognizing Chinese character strings continuously written by a user in a handwritten Chinese character processing system, wherein said handwritten Chinese character processing system records Chinese character strings continuously written by a user in strokes and associated timing information thereof, said method comprising the steps of:
creating a geometry model which describes geometric characteristics of stroke sequences of handwritten Chinese character strings and a language model which describes dependency among Chinese characters or words; determining potential segmentation schemes in the Chinese character strings continuously written by a user based on said associated timing information and said geometry model; recognizing groups of strokes as defined by each of the potential segmentation schemes and computing a probability characterizing the exactness of the recognition result;
correcting the probability characterizing the exactness of the recognition result by said language model; and selecting the recognition result having the maximum probability value and the corresponding segmentation scheme as the segmentation and recognition result of the Chinese character strings continuously written by a user.
