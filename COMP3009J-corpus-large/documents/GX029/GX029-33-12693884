Revitalizing Urban Environments
Protecting and improving our environment, our parks and wildlife refuges, and natural resources have been among my highest priorities since I was first elected to the Congress.
I have fought for, and helped enact, every major piece of legislation to enhance environmental quality -- including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and Superfund, to name only a few.
In the past few years, I have sponsored a number of measures and initiatives to improve the environment and quality of life in Maryland and in our region.
These efforts are set forth in the following pages, and I hope you find them of interest.
