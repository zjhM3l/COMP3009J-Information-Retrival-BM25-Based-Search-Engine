Accomplice in Church Arsons Sentenced to 16 Years, 8 Months in Prison
Timothy M. Morrison, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, announced that ANGELA WOOD, 25, was sentenced to 16 years, 8 months imprisonment today by U.S. District Judge Sarah E. Barker following her November 9, 1999 guilty pleas to one count of conspiracy to commit arson and church arson, one count of arson of a building in interstate commerce, four counts of church arson, and one count of use of fire to commit a federal felony .
This case was the result of a nationwide investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, investigators from the Indiana State Fire Marshal's Office, and numerous state and local fire investigators around the United States.
WOOD previously plead guilty to the above charges relative to her participation with Jay Scott Ballinger in the following church arsons: Concord Church of Christ, Boone County, Indiana, on January 10; Hawcreek Missionary Baptist Church, Hope, Indiana, on April 21, 1998; Grace Baptist Church, Coatesville, Indiana, on June 10, 1998; Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Fillmore, Indiana, on November 20, 1998; and Christian Liberty Church, Sheridan, Indiana, on November 27, 1998.
According to Assistant United States Attorney Susan Heckard Dowd, who prosecuted the case for the government, Judge Barker also imposed 5 years supervised release following WOOD's release from imprisonment.
WOOD was also ordered to make restitution in the amount of $362,297.
Ballinger was sentenced by Judge Barker yesterday to 42 years, 7 months imprisonment yesterday for committing 26 church arsons in 10 judicial districts throughout the United States.
Ballinger still faces federal charges in the Northern District of Georgia and the Middle District of Georgia for setting five church fires in Georgia in December 1998 and January 1999, including one in which a firefighter was killed while fighting the fire.
As part of WOOD's plea agreement with the government, she has cooperated with the government in the prosecution of Ballinger, and has agreed to continue to cooperate against Ballinger and testify against him in the Georgia prosecutions.
In another related case, Donald Puckett, Lebanon, Indiana, plead guilty and was sentenced in September 1999 to an arson charge for assisting Ballinger and WOOD in setting the Concord Church of Christ fire in January 1999.
Puckett is currently serving a 27 month sentence of imprisonment for his conviction.
He is also cooperating with the government in the prosecution of Ballinger.
