Since September 11, 2001, Islam in the United States has become a major topic of discussion.
Shortly after the terrorist attacks President Bush emphasized that the war against terrorism was neither a religious war, nor a war against the Muslim or Arab communities in the United States.
He visited a mosque and reminded the American public of the importance of the Muslim Community in the United States and the first Amendment.
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."
The above text of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, in a mere 45 words, lays out four of the most important fundamental rights of American citizens.
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES
The Muslim community in the United States is not only made up of Arabs, and neither is the Arab community made up of only Muslims.
An estimated three million Arab Americans live in the United States.
Though they live in all 50 States they tend to be concentrated in California, Michigan and New York.
One must be careful to distinguish religion and culture.
It is a common mistake to think that Islam unifies all Arabs.
Most Arab Americans are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, but this is not true in all parts of the U.S.
In some areas the majority are Muslims who came to the United States during a second wave of Arab immigration after 1940.
The American Religious Survey published by the Graduate Center of the City University of New York identifies approximately 1.2 million Americans who identify themselves with Islam.
Other figures suggest that the Muslim population exceeds 5 million.
It is almost impossible to generalize about American Muslims: there are converts, immigrants, factory workers, doctors - all making a contribution to America's future.
The Islamic community is very diverse, made up of approximately 25% Arab, 35% Asian, 33% African American and 7% other, including a large number of Latinos.
This community is unified by a common faith, underpinned by a countrywide network of a thousand mosques.
Muslims from Africa were early arrivals in North America.
Today many African American Muslims play an important role in the Islamic community.
The nineteenth century, however, saw the beginnings of an influx of Arab Muslims, most of whom settled in the major industrial centers where they worshipped in hired rooms.
The early twentieth century witnessed the arrival of several hundred thousand Muslim from Eastern Europe: the first Albanian mosque was opened in Maine in 1915.
Others soon followed.
In 1947, the Washington Islamic Center was founded during the term of President Truman.
Several nationwide organizations were set up in the fifties.
Most Muslims in the United States participate in the general American lifestyle.
Muslim women and men attend universities and become professionals.
Some choose to adhere to traditional dress while others do not.
In some social gatherings, men and women meet separately for conversation but join together for meals; in other social gatherings there are no separations.
