The classical hypothesis (2R) for vertebrate genome duplications postulates two successive polyploidizations prior to the origin of fishes, which is being seriously challenged.
Since the debate is mostly between the big-bang mode (large-scale duplication) vs. the continuous mode (constant creation by small-scale duplications), we address this issue by testing whether a significant portion of paralogous genes in the contemporary human genome was indeed generated in the early stage of vertebrates.
After extensive search in major databases, we have dated 1,739 gene duplication events from the phylogenetic analysis of 749 vertebrate gene families, which shows a pattern characterized by two waves (I, II) and an ancient component.
While Wave I represents a recent gene family expansion by tandem or segmental duplications, Wave II, a rapid paralogous gene increase in the early stage of vertebrates, supporting the notion of genome duplication(s) (the big-bang mode).
Further analysis indicates that large and small-scale gene duplications both have significant contributions during early stage of vertebrate evolution to building the current hierarchy of human proteome.
