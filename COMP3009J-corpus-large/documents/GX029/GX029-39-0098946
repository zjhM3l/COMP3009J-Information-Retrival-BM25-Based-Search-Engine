Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Landmine Bibliography Introduction The following table contains a bibliography of key print and electronic publications concerning the global landmine problem.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has compiled this list as an aid to persons seeking information on the landmine problem and its potential solutions.
In identifying items to be included, LLNL sought only those materials that contributed significant information toward defining the medical, social, economic and political consequences of the landmine problem.
LLNL hopes that you will find this list useful, and asks your help in keeping it up-to-date.
This bibliography was created by the LLNL Library under the sponsorship of the Center for Global Security Research (CGSR).
See also the Landmine Who's Who for a table of organizations involved in solving the global landmine problem.
Table Details
The table is divided into three columns: Bibliographic reference, Content, and Internet source.
The first column lists the bibliographic citation including author, title, source, publisher and date.
The list is sorted by this column, so it is primarily in alphabetic order by author.
The second column is an attempt to describe the general focus of each publication.
This Content column is divided into five categories: Background, Demining, Humanitarian, Political, and Statistics.
"Background" items describe some aspect of the landmine problem in detail.
"Demining" materials describe demining processes, efforts, or technology.
"Humanitarian" items discuss humanitarian or medical details.
"Political" publications are focused primarily on political solutions.
"Statistics" items provide numeric data about the landmine problem.
The final column contains a link to electronic versions of publicationsthat were located on the Internet.
Table Maintenance
LLNL will make every effort to keep this page up-to-date.
You can help with that task by telling us about important materials that are not listed and by notifying us of any changes or corrections to the data that we currently list.
Please contact Rich Hunt of the LLNL Library with any additions or corrections.
