Mars Exploration Program SCIENTIFIC GOALS, OBJECTIVES, INVESTIGATIONS, AND PRIORITIES Edited by R. Greeley, 16 August 2000
This document is the result of a series of meetings and workshops (Table 1) collectively involving more than 110 individuals from the Mars community with representatives from universities, research centers and organizations, industry, and international partners for Mars exploration.
Although the effort was focused through activities of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG, chaired by R. Greeley), participation has been much wider, as indicated in Appendices 1-3, and builds on the work of the Mars Exploration Science Group led by D. McCleese.
Initial discussions and earlier drafts of this document were centered on Mars Program goals related to Life, Climate, and Resources, with the cross-cutting theme of "follow the water."
It generally has been recognized that geological sciences and investigations which would lead to exploration by humans were incorporated in the "Resources" goal.
The consensus reached in August 2000 was that the program goals should be recast as Life, Climate, Geology, and Preparation (for Human Exploration), with "water" remaining a cross-cutting theme.

The objectives and the investigations needed to meet the objectives have been formulated and prioritized by subgroups of participants focused on the four broad goals as now proposed.
It should be noted, however, that there has been little opportunity for interaction among the subgroups for intercomparisons and integration.
Nonetheless, individuals were free to participate in more than one group during workshops and there were intergroup critiques of the goals, objectives, and investigations, the results of which are reflected here.
Within each Objective, the investigations are listed in a priority order as best determined from the point of view within that discipline.
There was no attempt to synthesize the overall set of investigations, but it was recognized that synergy among the various Goals and Objectives could alter the priorities in an overall strategy.
Completion of all the investigations outlined here will require decades of effort.
It is recognized that many investigations will never be truly complete (even if they have a high priority) and that evaluations of missions should be based on how well the investigations are addressed.
While priorities should influence the sequence in which the investigations are conducted, it is not intended that they be done serially, as many other factors come into play in such strategies.
A mechanism for integrating priorities and sequences has been developed by the Mars Ad hoc Science Team (MAST, led by D. McCleese).
Called an "investigation pathway," this mechanism shows how the results from specific investigations lead to the next step in exploration, all within the framework of the goals and objectives outlined here.
The integration of the goals, priorities, and objectives among the several disciplines will be a focus of future MEPAG meetings.
I. GOAL: DETERMINE IF LIFE EVER AROSE ON MARS
A. Objective: Determine if life exists today (investigations in priority order) (investigations in priority order)
1.
Investigation: Map the 3-dimensional distribution of water in all its forms.
Zones of liquid water in the subsurface provide the most likely environments for extant life on Mars.
In the absence of life, such environments could also sustain pre-biotic chemistry of interest for understanding the origin of life on Earth.
Requires global remote sensing of water in all its forms to identify the locations, phases, and, if possible, temporal changes in near-surface water budgets.
2.
Investigation: Carry out in situ exploration of any areas suspected of harboring liquid water in the subsurface.
These studies will be used to validate remote sensing observations from orbit and to explore for life or prebiotic chemistry.
Requires subsurface drilling (depths of meters to km's), in situ instrumentation to detect water in all its forms and to analyze rocks, soils and ices for organic compounds or to detect life.
3.
Explore high priority candidate sites (i.e., those that provide access to near-surface liquid water) for evidence of extant (active or dormant) life forms.
Although the problem of in situ life detection is the subject of ongoing controversy and debate, basic measurement requirements are likely to include both in situ analysis, as well as laboratory-based analysis of returned pristine (uncontaminated or altered) samples to search for the presence of both organic and inorganic biosignatures, metabolic activity, isotopic fractionation, dis-equilibrium chemistry and etc. 4.
Investigation: Determine the array of potential energy sources available on Mars to sustain biological processes.
Biological systems require energy which can come from a variety of sources, including chemical, geothermal and incident radiation (sunlight).
Requires 1) orbital remote sensing to map the mineralogy and geochemistry of Martian surface deposits, to detect localized geothermal "hot-spots" in the shallow crust, and to locate point sources of reduced volatiles (e.g. gas-emitting vents, or "fumeroles") and 2) the in situ characterization of surface mineralogy, elemental chemistry (including volatiles and organic compounds) of soils, rocks and ices at the most favorable sites (i.e. those that had prolonged hydrological activity) and sample returns for more detailed characterization in Earth labs.
5.
Investigation: Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon in soils and ices of the Martian crust.
Carbon is a fundamental building block for life.
It may exist within soils and ices of the Martian crust in a variety of heretofore undetected biotic and abiotic forms.
Its distribution would exert a primary control on where and how life could develop.
Requires in situ exploration of surface and subsurface soils and ices using instrumentation that can detect a wide range of carbon compounds and sample returns for more detailed characterization.
6.
Investigation: Determine the distribution of oxidants.
Results from Viking suggest that unknown oxidation processes in modern soils on Mars are responsible for the selective destruction of organic compounds.
The distribution of oxidants in the Martian crust is likely to have been a controlling factor in determining where, when and how life may have developed.
Requires instrumentation for determining the geochemistry and mineralogy of surface and subsurface samples.
B. Objective: Determine if life existed on Mars in the past (investigations in priority order) 1.
Investigation: Determine the locations of sedimentary deposits formed by ancient surface and subsurface hydrological processes.
Such deposits provide the best repositories for preserving a fossil record of ancient Martian life.
Requires global mapping of surface geomorphology and mineralogy, followed by the in situ characterization of surface mineralogy and geochemistry in order to provide "ground truth" for orbital observations and to assist in the selection of the best sites and samples for return to Earth.
2.
Investigation: Search for Martian fossils (morphological and chemical biosignatures of ancient life).
Life leaves behind a variety of fossil bio-signatures in water-deposited sedimentary rocks, providing a record of its former presence.
Based on studies of the fossil record on Earth, we know that only certain environments and types of deposits provide favorable settings for the long-term preservation of fossil biosignatures.
These include environments where fine-grained, clay-rich deposits are laid down in lakes and streams, or where minerals precipitate rapidly from water in the presence of organisms.
Locating the most favorable deposits for preserving fossil biosignatures requires orbital mapping of geomorphology and mineralogy, complemented by in situ microscopic imaging, mineralogy, organic and inorganic chemistry (inclusive of isotopic and trace element) and targeted sample returns.
3.
Investigation: Determine the timing and duration of hydrologic activity.
To assess the potential for the origin and evolution of life on Mars during the planet's history, we need to know when, where, and for how long liquid water environments were present at the surface and in the subsurface.
This is a historical question that requires the development of stratigraphic (age) frameworks for deposits based on orbital mapping and surface in situ measurements, followed by sample returns from key sites and radiometric age dating of rock and mineral samples in Earth-based labs.
C. Objective: Assess the extent of prebiotic organic chemical evolution on Mars (investigations in priority order) 1.
Investigation: Search for complex organic molecules in rocks and soils of the Martian crust.
The steps in pre-biotic chemistry that lead to the first living organisms on Earth are presently unknown.
On the Earth the record of those early events has been largely destroyed by plate tectonics and weathering.
If life arose on Mars, it would have probably consumed and transformed much of the original organic inventory present.
However, if life subsequently died out in surface/near surface environments, then new pre-biotic chemical processes would be expected to arise.
The record of pre-biotic chemistry in an Earth-like setting on early Mars is considered fundamentally important in developing our understanding of the basic chemical steps that preceded the appearance of life on Earth.
Because Mars lacks plate tectonics and a pervasive weathering cycle, it may provide an unrivaled record of early pre-biotic chemical events in an Earth-like setting.
The exploration for pre-biotic chemistry ultimately requires a different approach than the search for the extant biochemistry.
Thus, it is important to distinguish between the two activities.
The search for pre-biotic chemistry will require studies of both modern aqueous environments (e.g. groundwater, ice-brine transitions, hydrothermal systems, etc.), as well as the record of aqueous paleoenvironments preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks.
Targets for in situ studies must be first identified from orbit based on geomorphology and mineralogy (see I.B.1) and then mobile platforms (rovers) used to determine mineralogy, geochemistry, and organic chemistry and to select samples for detailed analysis in Earth-based labs.
2.
Investigation: Determine the changes in crustal and atmospheric inventories of organic carbon through time.
Changes in the atmospheric and crustal carbon inventories over geologic time would have greatly affected the pre-biotic chemistry and climate of the Martian surface, and hence, the potential for life to develop.
This objective parallels investigation I.A.4.
(determine the crustal inventory of carbon) but seeks to integrate that information over time.
Thus, this objective is posed in a historical way that requires a stratigraphic (temporal) framework for sampling (established through detailed geological mapping from orbit) and the return of samples to Earth for detailed organic chemical analysis and radiometric age-dating.
II.
GOAL: DETERMINE CLIMATE ON MARS
A. Objective: Characterize Mars' Present Climate and Climate Processes (investigations in priority order)
1.
Investigation: Determine the processes controlling the present distributions of water, carbon dioxide and dust.
Understanding the factors that control the present annual variations of volatiles and dust on Mars is a necessary first step to determining to what extent today's processes have controlled climate change in the past.
Requires, in priority order: 1) global mapping of the time-varying three-dimensional distributions of dust, water vapor, carbon dioxide, thermal state, and radiative forcing of the atmosphere, surface and near-subsurface over at least one annual cycle; 2) landed observations of the exchange of volatiles and dust between the surface and atmosphere on daily and seasonal time scales.
2.
Investigation: Determine the present-day stable isotopic and noble gas composition of the present-day bulk atmosphere.
These provide quantitative constraints on the evolution of atmospheric composition and on the source and sinks of the major gas inventories.
Requires, in priority order: 1) Single in situ, high-precision measurement of atmospheric isotopic composition; and 2) return of pristine atmospheric samples for detailed analysis, including age dating.
3.
Investigation: Determine long-term trends in the present climate.
Seasonal variations and annual budgets of volatiles and dust are known to vary from year-to-year.
Determining long-term trends will test to what degree the Martian climate is changing today.
Requires: 1) Extension of the measurements of (A1) to multiple Mars years, and 2) long-term monitoring of key atmospheric variables (e.g., pressure, temperature, dust opacity, water) at globally representative sites (network science).
4.
Investigation: Determine the rates of escape of key species from the Martian atmosphere, and their correlation with solar variability and lower atmosphere phenomenon (e.g. dust storms).
Requires: Global orbiter observations of species (particularly H, O, CO, CO[2] and key isotopes) in the upper atmosphere, and monitoring their variability over multiple Martian years.
5.
Investigation: Search for micro-climates on Mars of special interest.
Detection of exceptionally or recently wet or warm locales and/or areas of significant change in surface accumulations of volatiles or dust would identify prime locations for detailed in situ exploration.
Requires global search for anomalous locales, as compared to typical planetary values, or changes in, volatile distributions and surface properties (e.g., temperature or albedo).
B. Objective: Characterize Mars' Ancient Climate and Climate Processes (investigations in priority order)
1.
Investigation: Find physical and chemical records of past climates.
These provide the basis for understanding the extent and timing (e.g., long-term gradual change or abrupt transition) of past climate change on Mars.
Requires: 1) targeted remote sensing of stratigraphy at higher spatial resolution than currently planned (goal: 15 cm/pixel for stratigraphy) and of the presence of acqueous weathering products (goal: regional at 100m; targeted locales at 
2.
Investigation: Characterize history of stratigraphic records of climate change at the polar layered deposits, the residual ice caps, and elsewhere on the planet.
The polar regions have surface morphologies indicating repeated climate change, possibly in the geologically recent past.
A key to understanding their histories is good relative dating of polar layering and volatile reservoirs.
Requires: 1) In situ observation of surface and near-surface morphology and composition; and 2) Returned samples of layered materials for detailed analysis, including age dating.
3.
Investigation: Characterize the contributions of volcanic activity and meteoritic bombardment to enhancement or erosion of atmospheric volatiles and the emplacement of layered material over time.
The keys are the quantity of materials involved and the rates of their emplacement or removal.
Requires: 1) In situ and remote sensing of the composition of volcanic and igneous rocks/deposits; and 2) Returned samples of materials to determine their gas content and ages.
III.
GOAL: DETERMINE THE EVOLUTION OF THE SURFACE AND INTERIOR OF MARS ("Geology")
A. Objective: Determine the nature and sequence of the various geologic processes (volcanism, impact, sedimentation, alteration etc.) that have resulted in formation of the Martian crust and surface (investigations in priority order)
1.
Investigation: Determine the present state, distribution and cycling of water on Mars.
Water is the critical limiting resource for the development and sustenance of life and for future human exploration.
Requires global observations using geophysical sounding (radio or radar), gamma ray spectroscopy, image interpretation and geologic mapping, observations and geophysical sounding from landers, drilling.
2.
Investigation: Evaluate sedimentary processes and their evolution through time, up to and including the present.
Fluvial and lacustrine sediments are among the most likely sites to detect traces of past or present life and sediments record the history of water processes on Mars.
Eolian sediments record a combination of globally-averaged and locally-derived fine-grained sediments and weathering products.
Sediments are also likely past or present aquifers.
Requires knowledge of the age, sequencing and composition of sedimentary rocks (including chemical deposits), as well as the rates, durations, and mechanics of weathering, cementation, and transport processes.
Techniques include global imaging and spectroscopy, topography, returned samples, in-situ chemical and mineralogical analyses, geologic mapping, geochronology, drilling.
3.
Investigation: Calibrate the cratering record and the absolute age scale for Mars.
The evolution of the surface, interior, and surface environments of Mars, as well as possible evolution of life, must be placed in an absolute timescale, which is presently lacking for Mars.
Requires absolute ages on at least one returned rock (not soil) sample from a well-characterized terrain of intermediate age.
4.
Investigation: Evaluate igneous processes and their evolution through time, including the present.
This study includes volcanic outgassing and volatile evolution.
Volcanic processes are the primary mechanism for release of water and atmospheric gasses that support past and present life and human exploration.
Sites of present day volcanism, if any, may be prime sites for the search for life.
Requires knowledge of the age and composition of igneous rocks using global imaging, returned samples, chemical analyses, geologic mapping, geochronology, and techniques for distinguishing igneous and sedimentary rocks, and evaluation of current activity from seismic monitoring.
5.
Investigation: Characterize surface-atmosphere interactions on Mars, including polar, eolian, chemical, weathering, and mass-wasting processes.
Timescales for this investigation are the last million years and the upper 1m to 1 km of geological materials.
Understanding present geologic, hydrologic, and atmospheric processes is the key to understanding past environments of Mars and possible locations for near-surface water.
This study also has strong implications for resources and hazards for future human exploration.
Requires orbital visual and thermal imaging, spectroscopy, and geophysical and topographic sounding, remote analysis of surface sediment composition and mineralogy, lander studies of boundary layer processes, analysis of returned samples, drilling.
6.
Investigation: Determine the large-scale vertical structure of the crust and its regional variation.
This includes, for example, the structure and origin of hemispheric dichotomy.
The vertical and global variation of rock properties and composition places constraints on the distribution of subsurface aquifers and aids interpretation of past igneous and sedimentary processes.
Requires interpretation of global imaging and topography, geophysical sounding from orbiters and landers, geologic mapping, analysis in-situ lander data on mineralogy and composition of surface material, returned samples, and seismic monitoring.
7.
Investigation: Document the tectonic history of the Martian crust, including present activity.
Understanding of the temporal evolution of internal processes places constraints on release of volatiles from differentiation and volcanic activity and the effect of tectonic structures (faults and fractures in particular) on subsurface hydrology.
Requires geologic mapping utilizing global topographic data combined with high-resolution imaging, magnetic and gravity data, and seismic monitoring.
8.
Investigation: Determine the bulk composition and spatial/temporal evolution of the crust.
This provides information on how the planet differentiated and the formation of the planet, with implications for the volatile composition and rate of release to the surface.
Requires returned sample of windblown dust and composition of major stratigraphic units, remote analysis of surface mineralogy and composition, analysis of returned samples.
B. Objective: Characterize the structure, dynamics, and history of Mars' interior (investigations in priority order)
1.
Investigation: Characterize the configuration of Mars' interior.
This is needed to understand the origin and thermal evolution of Mars and the relationships to surface evolution and release of water and atmospheric gasses.
Requires gravity, topography, rotational dynamics from landers with direct-to-Earth communication, magnetics, long-term seismic network
2.
Investigation: Determine the history of the magnetic field.
Evidence that Mars had a magnetic field early in its history has important implications for the retention of its early atmosphere and for the shielding of the surface from incoming radiation and the possible evolution of life.
Requires measurements of the strength and spatial variation of remanant magnetism from low orbit or aerial platform with global coverage and correlation with information on internal structure and temporal evolution of the Martian interior.
3.
Investigation: Determine the thermal evolution of the planet.
Knowledge of the thermal evolution places constraints on the composition, quantity, and rate of release of volatiles (water and atmospheric gasses) to the surface.
Techniques: in-situ heat flow measurement, results from B1.
4.
Investigation: Determine the chemical and thermal evolution of the mantle.
Knowledge of the thermal and chemical evolution places constraints on the composition, quantity, and rate of release of volatiles (water and atmospheric gasses) to the surface.
Requires composition of surface rocks from remote analysis and returned samples as a probe into the interior, and results from B1.
