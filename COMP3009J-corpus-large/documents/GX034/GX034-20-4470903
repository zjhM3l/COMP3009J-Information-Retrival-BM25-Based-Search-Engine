By 1992, more than 1 million students successfully completed their first university degrees in natural sciences or engineering (NS
The total number of NS
* The size of the college-age population declined in the industrialized countries of Western Europe, Asia, and North America.
This demographic trend did not result in a decline in the number of NS
However, such a decline did occur in the United States.
Participation rates in university education, and in the number of NS
* The United States remains one of the leading countries in the world in its creation of a system of higher education that reaches a broad cross section of citizens.
The ratio of total bachelor's degrees to the 24-year-old population reached 31 percent in the United States in 1992.
Although access to higher education has greatly expanded in European countries during the past 20 years, the ratio of university degrees to their college-age populations still do not exceed 10 to 20 percent.
However, compared with other countries, a relatively small percentage of U.S. college students major in NS
The ratio of NS
For several major European and Asian countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea), the ratios of NS
Characteristics of U.S. Higher Education Institutions
* In 1993, there were 3,611 (1,566 public and 2,045 private) institutions of higher education in the United States.
These institutions enrolled 14.7 million students in that year, more than double the number enrolled in higher education in 1967.
Two-year colleges experienced the highest growth rates in student enrollments.
* U.S. higher education institutions awarded more than 2 million degrees, one-quarter of which were in S
The majority of these S
The largest proportions of these S
Taken together, these institutions account for more than 50 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded in the natural sciences and 80 percent of the engineering degrees.
Undergraduate Students and Degrees
* Minority students are becoming more interested in S
By 1994, underrepresented minorities, especially women in these groups, accounted for a substantial portion of the freshmen planning to major in physical sciences (15 percent), biological fields (16 percent), social sciences (20 percent), and engineering (18 percent).
* The number of S
The number of degrees awarded in engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences has leveled off after several years of decline.
Graduate Students and Degrees
* Graduate enrollment of women and minorities accelerated in the 1990s.
By 1993, women represented 38 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of all graduate students in natural sciences and engineering.
The large increases in graduate enrollments of minority students, however, are from a low base.
Minority student representation, with respect to total S
* Doctoral degree production has continued to increase in S
The number of doctoral S
However, the number of these degrees obtained by U.S. citizens increased only slightly.
The ratio of doctoral degrees earned by U.S. citizens to the 29-year-old U.S. population was about 0.4 percent in 1993.
* The European region produces more NS
In 1991, European countries for which data were available produced more than 25,000 NS
* Other countries also educate a considerable number of foreign students.
In 1993, foreign students obtained 40 percent of the NS
In France, foreign students earned one out of three doctoral degrees in all fields of science.
Foreign students also earned one-half of the engineering and social science doctoral degrees, and more than one-quarter of the natural science doctoral degrees awarded in the United Kingdom.
Foreign Students in U.S. Graduate Schools
* Foreign students have accounted for a steadily increasing proportion of doctoral degrees awarded in S
By 1993, foreign students on temporary visas obtained 44 percent of the mathematics and computer science doctoral degrees and 50 percent of the engineering doctoral degrees.
In that same year, total doctoral degrees earned by non-U.S. citizens, including both permanent residents and foreign students on temporary visas, reached 57 percent in engineering fields and 47 percent in mathematics and computer science.
* About 30 percent of foreign students earning S
Of the 8,000 foreign doctoral recipients in 1993, about 400, or 5 percent, received firm offers for academic employment; almost 500, or 6 percent, received firm offers for industrial employment; and a larger group, almost 1,500, or 18 percent, obtained a postdoctoral research appointment for 1 year.
* Fewer foreign students are entering U.S. universities for advanced training in S
After a decade-long steady increase, the percent of graduate enrollment of foreign students decreased by 4 percent each year in 1993 and 1994, mainly in engineering and computer science.
Foreign students currently represent slightly fewer than one-third of graduate students in engineering.
Major Sources of Financial Support
* Research assistantships are still the dominant mechanism of support for S
In 1993, almost 90,000 students, representing 27 percent of all graduate S
About one-half relied on Federal sources; the other half relied on nonfederal sources.
These assistantships are particularly significant in the support of graduate students in fields of physical sciences, geosciences, biological sciences, and engineering.
The long-term trend of a 5-percent annual growth rate in the numbers of these assistantships being offered continued until 1992.
From 1992 to 1993, however, the growth rate was less than 1 percent.
* Non-U.S. sources account for the majority of funding support for foreign students at all levels of higher education.
In 1993, two-thirds of the foreign students in the United States cited their families as their primary source of support; 7 percent of funding came from their home governments, universities, and foreign private sponsors.
U.S. sources are the primary funding support for 25 percent of foreign students.
* U.S. sources are the primary funding mechanism for almost 80 percent of all foreign S
More than three-quarters of foreign S
Only 3 percent of their funding comes from Federal fellowships or traineeships.
