Statement of Merrill Leutung, Missouri Federation of Chapters, National Association of Retired Federal Employees, Columbia, Missouri Mr. Chairman, I am Merrill Leutung of Columbia and I am an officer in the Missouri Federation of Chapters of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE).
I thank you for scheduling this hearing on the Social Security.
I am grateful to Congressman Hulshof for inviting me to make a few comments on an issue of such great importance to the 4,600 federal annuitants who live the 9^th Congressional District and the 50,272 federal retirees and survivors who call Missouri home.
As a federal annuitant, I would be remiss if I did not raise the issue of the Government Pension Offset (GPO) in the context of the dialogue you are holding on Social Security reform today.
In 1935, when the Social Security Act was originally enacted, it provided the same benefits to workers, with and without spouses, and no survivors' benefits.
The amendments of the Social Security Act, enacted in 1939, added spousal and survivor benefits to provide extra protection to workers with families.
The GPO Social Security Act amendment, originally enacted in 1977, went into effect in 1983, and since then, has affected over almost 285,000 federal, state, and local retirees.
It reduces or eliminates the Social Security spousal benefit (wife, husband, widow, or widower) to which an affected retiree may be eligible.
Two-thirds of the amount of the monthly government annuity that the retiree has earned, is used to offset whatever Social Security spousal or survivor benefit might be payable.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, "about 145,000 retirees from federal, state, and local governments had their Social Security auxiliary benefits reduced or eliminated as a result of the GPO in December 1991."^1 Since then, that figure has almost doubled.
The Social Security Administration states that the number of social security beneficiaries affected by GPO as of December 1997 was 270,975^2.
That number increased by December 1999 to 284,3833^3.
Of the 284,383 affected beneficiaries, 229,941 or 80 percent are fully offset, which translates into no benefit.
It is crucial for you to note that 104,137 or 38 percent of the total number of affected beneficiaries are widows or widowers and 71,175 or 68 percent of them are fully offset.
Mr. Chairman, I understand that there are members of this committee who have concerns regarding "means testing".
I am led to believe that these concerns specifically relate to H.R. 664 and the provision of a $1200 per month threshold before GPO would be applied.
When Congress enacted GPO in 1983, it set a means test precedent by introducing a means test provision into the Social Security program by denying the full application of spousal benefits to persons receiving government pensions.
This application of denial is not applied to those persons who are the recipients of annuities or other retirement benefits from the private sector.
We, as federal annuitants, share you and your colleagues' concerns over the impropriety of "means testing" in Social Security and believe that Congressman Jefferson's bill H.R. 664 is the most pragmatic approach to the modification of the GPO, in lieu of repealing it.
Public Law 106-182, introduced as H.R. 5 by Congressman Sam Johnson, was passed in both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President on April 7, 2000.
This law "eliminates the earnings test for individuals who have attained retirement age".
The estimated cost of the earnings repeal is projected to be $8 billion in the first year and $22.7 billion over the next ten years.
The projected estimate for H.R. 664 is about $300 million in the first year and $4.4 billion over the next ten years.
These preliminary projections for H.R. 664 are based on a threshold of $1200, and indexed by the Social Security COLA over ten years, retroactive to December 31, 1999^4 Social Security Administration actuaries have determined that, just as with the earnings test repeal, enactment of H.R. 664 would "increase the OASDI long-range actuarial deficit by an amount that is estimated to be negligible (i.e., less than 0.005 percent of taxable payroll)."^5
Members of this committee were able to expeditiously change the Social Security Act to benefit older workers through Public Law 106-182.
We are now asking you to expend that same effort to effect change through H.R. 664 for government retirees.
In fact, since repeal of the earnings limit, government workers 65 and older can receive full social security benefits based on their own work or as spouses or survivors.
However, as soon as they retire, their social security is cut or ceases altogether.
Therefore, a benefit counted on for retirement is paid while one is working, only to disappear when needed most --- at retirement.
We urge you to support H.R. 664, a proposal to modify the Social Security Government Pension Offset, supported by the millions of federal, state and local government employees and retirees across the United States.
We also urge you to publicly ask President Bush's Social Security Reform Commission to include a recommendation in favor of GPO reform it its final report.
Thank you for the opportunity to express our concerns about this important issue.

I also want to call your attention to another inherently unfair provision of the Social Security Act which denies Social Security benefits to almost 600,000 retired public servants.
That is the so-called Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), which was enacted as part of the 1983 Social Security Amendments.
In short, this provisions denies as much as $262 per month of earned social security benefits to former government workers who did not have at least 30 years of substantial earnings taxed by Social Security.
In short, the WEP establishes different eligibility and entitlement rules for different folk, dependent solely upon their career time spent as public servants.
Correction of this inequity is almost 20 years overdue, but certainly "better late than never".
To ask for an end to the WEP is only asking for an end of the current inequity!!!
It is also difficult for us to believe that giving workers the option of putting some money in the stock market would be helpful.
It would keep some money out of Social Security System.
Also they may not put it in stocks.
We oppose it.

A Social Security tax was raised to 85% on people that had incomes above $25,000 single or $32000 married on the basis to help correct the Deficit.
I appreciate the tax cuts that were made but this one was not addressed.
Since we do not have a deficit this should be lowered back to the 50% level.
Another thing that could be considered is to double this $25,000 and $32000.
This level is way too low.
Thank you for hearing me.
