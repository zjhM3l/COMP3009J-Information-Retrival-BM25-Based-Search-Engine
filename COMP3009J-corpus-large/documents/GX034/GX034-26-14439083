Welcome to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA), an agency which oversees programs that serve virtually all New Jersey citizens.
Of course, one of the department's major priorities is to promote, protect and serve the Garden State's diverse agriculture and agribusiness industries.
But in addition to the programs we offer to support production agriculture, NJDA also manages programs that feed schoolchildren, distribute surplus federal foods to soup kitchens and pantries that serve our needy citizens, conserve precious soil and water resources, protect farmland from development and preserve it for future agricultural use, expand export markets for fresh and processed agricultural products, and promote our commercial fishing industry.
NJDA is also the nation's first state department of agriculture to house the State FFA association.
The following brief overview of agriculture in the Garden State will acquaint you with this extremely diverse industry and the work of this agency.

Overview of Agriculture in the Garden State
The $62.5 billion food and agriculture complex is one of New Jersey's largest industries, ranking after pharmaceuticals and tourism in the economic benefits it brings to the state.
In FY01, the state's 9,600 farms generated cash receipts totaling $812,246,000.
The nursery/greenhouse/sod industry remained the leading commodity group with cash receipts of almost $297.4 million.
Cash receipts for vegetables totaled more than $$192.9 million, followed by equine at $116 million and fruit at nearly $82.6 million.
Field crops brought in just over $46.2 million while the dairy industry generated $33.4 million.
Sales of poultry and eggs were valued at $25.2 million.
Retaining productive, taxpaying farmland is critically important to all New Jersey residents since agriculture is the largest single source of the scenic vistas we all enjoy throughout the year.
Productive farmland covers nearly one million acres, about 20 percent of New Jersey's land area.
Virtually all of New Jersey's farms are family-owned and operated with an average farm size of 86 acres.
The average per acre-value of New Jersey farmland in FY01, including land and buildings, was $7,400 the highest average value in the nation.
Farmers in the Garden State produce more than 100 different kinds of fruits and vegetables for consumers to enjoy either fresh or processed here in New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast, in Canada and in many countries around the world.
In the Northeast, New Jersey ranks third in farm product sales.
Nationally, New Jersey is one of the top ten producers of cranberries, blueberries, peaches, asparagus, bell peppers, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, sweet corn, tomatoes, snap beans, cabbage, escarole/endive and eggplant.
In addition, growers also produced hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of specialty crops that added a unique flavor to the Garden State's bounty.
Vineyards, for example, are a growing segment of the industry, enabling the state's 17 vintners to develop a wide variety of award-winning New Jersey wines.
Fish and seafood are also a valuable commodity with tons of bluefish, tilefish, flounder, hake, shellfish and other species harvested annually.
With its catch sold here at home and in foreign markets around the world, the commercial fishing industry adds another $100 million to the value of agriculture in New Jersey.

Department of Agriculture Programs and Services
The mission of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture is to develop, promote, conserve and support the agricultural and agribusiness industry of the state and those natural and renewable resources that are associated with agriculture and other open lands for the benefit of all its citizens.
NJDA works year round with and for farmers to support the overall economic viability and profitability of the Garden State's agriculture industry through innovative grant and loan programs, programs for beneficial insects that reduce the need for chemical pesticides and herbicides, far-reaching commodity promotion and marketing efforts and a wide variety of other programs designed to keep New Jersey's agriculture industry thriving.
One of the key ingredients in the formula to retain this valuable industry is the preservation of irreplaceable farmland.
The State Agricultural Development Committee (SADC) administers the state's Farmland Preservation Program.
The SADC is in, but not of, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.
Begun in 1983 and now considered a national model, the program has been instrumental in the permanent preservation of nearly 65,000 acres of farmland.
The department's marketing efforts include the nationally-recognized Jersey Fresh marketing program which works throughout New Jersey's growing season to remind shoppers that the freshest, locally-grown products are waiting for them at supermarkets, farmers' markets and roadside stands around the state.
In addition, the department's export development program organizes trade missions and trade show exhibits to promote agricultural products grown and processed in New Jersey to both domestic and foreign buyers.
The commodity regulation side of the department oversees the Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program and the numerous commodity inspection and grading programs offered by the department to help ensure a constant supply of high quality, properly labeled fruits, vegetables, eggs, poultry, fish and seafood products for consumers in New Jersey.
The department has also made New Jersey a national leader in the research and application of biological control programs through which natural predators of crop-destroying weeds and insects are found and released in the field.
These "beneficial" insects enable producers to lower their pesticide and herbicide costs while reducing the amount of these agricultural chemicals which are released into the environment.
In addition, through its plant pest detection, inspection, eradication and control programs, the department helps to ensure that farmers and others who buy and sell plants and plant products enjoy high quality, pest-free products; certifies plant stock for interstate and international shipments; protects forested communities from defoliation and tree loss caused by the gypsy moth; inspects honeybees for harmful bee diseases and pests; and regulates the quality of plant seeds.
The department implements a number of programs aimed at promoting the economic viability of the agriculture industry.
The department also oversees the implementation of policies and programs to conserve and develop the state's soil, water and related natural resources and works closely with other federal, state and local agencies on a variety of issues, including nonpoint source pollution control, sludge application, recycling, waste management, water resources and farm conservation activities.
New Jersey's dairy industry is an important segment of its agricultural economy, supplying almost one-fifth of the fluid milk and dairy products used by over 7.5 million residents in New Jersey.
The industry includes more than 150 dairy farmers, animal breeders, dairy cooperatives, milk handlers, processors, distributors and retail stores.
In keeping with the mandate to maintain competition among New Jersey milk marketers, the department licenses milk dealers, milk processing plants, and retail stores and collect license fees and penalties.
The department also licenses and bonds milk dealers to assure payments to producers, disseminates information needed by the milk industry and mediates disputes within the industry.
Among the many segments of production agriculture NJDA serves is the state's livestock industry, offering educational and promotional programs as well as animal health services.
The department's equine development program promotes educational and recreational activities during the year to acquaint children and adults alike with the Garden State's burgeoning equine industry and its importance to the state's economy and scenic beauty.
The Sire Stakes program, which promotes the breeding of world-class Standardbred trotting and pacing horses, highlights another facet of this segment of the agriculture industry.
To help maintain the health of New Jersey's livestock, department works closely with dairy farmers, horse breeders, swine farmers, poultrymen, veterinarians and others to stay abreast of the current needs of New Jersey's diverse livestock industry.
The department's programs focus on limiting the introduction and spread of infectious diseases to livestock and humans.
In addition, the department runs programs of disease prevention and control, performs epidemiological investigations of animal disease and animal health issues, and maintains an information base accessible to veterinarians and allied professionals.
Among the special efforts now under way is a voluntary Johne's disease program, recently hailed as a national model by the United States Animal Health Association, that is helping New Jersey dairy farmers prevent the herd devastation this disease can cause.
Other department programs protect New Jersey farmers and other consumers from unfair trade practices; insure that animal feed, fertilizers and liming materials are of high quality and properly labeled; and monitor prompt payments to farmers who sell perishable commodities on credit.
The department also coordinates the distribution of federally-donated commodities to school lunch program participants, state institutions, soup kitchens, hot meal feeding sites and food pantries serving hundreds of thousands of New Jersey's neediest citizens around the state.
