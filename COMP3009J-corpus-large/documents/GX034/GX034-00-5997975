Briefing Room sugar and sweetener: trade
The United States ranks among the top producers of sugar in the world, vying with the European Union for second position behind Russia, the largest global importer of sugar.
The United States has imported an average of 2.23 million short tons, raw value (STRV) of sugar annually since 1996, accounting for 6 percent of global sugar imports.
Yet, U.S. sugar imports have declined significantly over the past 25 years.
In FY1974, the United States imported more than 5.96 million STRV of sugar, but, in FY2000, imports were only 1.64 million STRV.

Sugar imports under tariff-rate quotas.
The United States imports sugar under a system of tariff-rate quotas (TRQ).
A TRQ is a two-tiered tariff for which the tariff rate charged depends on the volume of imports.
A low-tier (in-quota) tariff is charged on imports within the quota volume.
A high-tier (over-quota) tariff is charged on imports in excess of the quota volume.
Almost all raw cane sugar, refined sugars and sugar syrups, and sugar-containing products are imported under TRQs for those products.
Imports under the raw and refined sugar TRQs for FY2000 are estimated at 1.12 million STRV, the lowest level since FY1994.
The USDA has established TRQs at lower levels in recent years to offset increasing domestic production.
Increasing imports since 1996 of certain sugar syrups containing molasses under HTS 1702.90.40 also have contributed to greater supplies of sugar and reduced the TRQ levels.
ERS analysts project that TRQ imports through 2011 will continue at levels that are consistent with U.S. commitments under international agreements.
Most U.S. sugar imports are raw cane sugar.
The raw cane sugar TRQ is allocated to 40 countries based on patterns established during the relatively unrestricted free trade period of 1975-81.
The Dominican Republic, Brazil, and the Philippines hold the largest shares, approximately 17, 14, and 13 percent, respectively.
Declines in the overall quantity of the quota have reduced imports from all suppliers with the exception of the ten small suppliers whose allocations are limited to 7,258 metric tons, a quantity considered to be equal to a minimum boatload of sugar.
Mexico's access to the United States for sugar has expanded from a historical minimum boatload quantity of 7,258 metric tons prior to NAFTA to 116,000 metric tons in FY2001.
Mexico exported close to 27,954 metric tons of raw and refined sugar to the United States within the raw and refined sugar TRQs in 1999, but also exported a small amount of sugar (about 5,000 STRV) to the United States at the higher, over-quota tariff level in 1999.
(For further discussion, see Policy section.)
Mexico also exported some sugar syrups and sugar-containing products to the United States under special NAFTA quotas.
Imports and exports under the sugar re-export programs.
USDA administers two re-export programs to help U.S. sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugar-containing products compete in world markets.
The Refined Sugar Re-Export Program establishes a license against which a refiner can import world-priced sugar for refining and export as refined sugar or for sale to licensed manufacturers of sugar-containing products.
The Sugar-Containing Products Re-Export Program allows U.S. participants to buy sugar from any of the refiner participants for use in products that will be exported onto the world market.
Imports under the two programs are not subject to the sugar tariff-rate quotas.
U.S. sugar imports under the two Re-Export Programs averaged 390,000 STRV from FY1995 through FY1999.
Imports ranged from a low of 230,000 STRV in FY1995 to a high of 530,000 STRV in FY1996.
The Refined and Sugar-Containing Products Re-Export Programs are the chief source of U.S. sugar exports.
Exports under the 2 programs averaged 288,200 STRV from FY1995 through FY1999.
Over the same 5-year period, exports under the 2 programs ranged from a low of 211,000 STRV in FY1997 to a high of 444,000 STRV in FY1995.
USDA also administers the Polyhydric Alcohol Program, which provides world-priced sugar to U.S. manufacturers of polyhydric alcohols.
Participating U.S. manufacturers purchase world-priced sugar from licensed refiners or their agents for use in the production of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols that are used as a substitute for sugar in human food consumption.
Imports under this program averaged 12,000 STRV from FY1995 through FY1999.
Corn sweetener imports and exports.
The United States imports and exports high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).
Imports, comprised of mostly HFCS-42 and solid HFCS-55, averaged 134,000 tons annually from 1992 through 1999.
Most imports come from Canada.
HFCS exports grew from 100,000 tons in 1992 to 388,000 tons in 1998.
U.S. exports of HFCS to Mexico dipped in 1999 to 350,000 tons after Mexico's Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development (SECOFI) imposed antidumping tariffs on HFCS imports from four companies in the United States in January 1998.
Despite the higher import duties in Mexico, U.S. HFCS exports are expected to increase in 2000 to 368,000 tons as exports to other countries increase.
