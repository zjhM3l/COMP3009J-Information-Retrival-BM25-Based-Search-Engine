Introduction
This booklet was developed as a result of legislation (House Bill 630) enacted by the Missouri General Assembly in 1997.
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Bill Boucher of Kansas City and Rep. Bill Ransdall of Waynesville.
The law is now found in state statutes as Section 161.104, RSMo.
The intent of this law and the State Board of Education's accompanying regulation is to encourage local schools to provide appropriate instruction for young people about the United States flag and flag etiquette.
Local schools have discretion, however, in deciding how and when such instruction will be provided.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education acknowledges the encouragement and assistance of Representatives Boucher and Ransdall in developing this material.
The Department also is grateful to the following statewide organizations for their assistance and support in developing this booklet for local schools:
* The American Legion * Disabled American Veterans * Veterans of Foreign Wars * The Missouri Association of Veterans' Organizations
Except for the cover, the illustrations used in this publication were originally created by The American Legion and are used here with permission.
Statutory Authority
Here is the complete text of the 1997 state law concerning instruction about flag etiquette.
Section 161.104 - State board to adopt rules on instruction of etiquette concerning the U.S. flag.
1.
The state board of education shall provide by rule for a program of instruction relating to the flag of the United States of America and instruction in etiquette and in its correct use and display and such other patriotic exercises as may be expedient.
Such instruction, at a minimum, shall include sections 36 U.S.C. 170 to 177.* 2.
No rule or portion of a rule promulgated pursuant to the authority of this section shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of section 536.024, RSMo.
*Note: Throughout this material, reference is made to "The Flag Code" and to different sections of Title 36 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) or the United States Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.).
The Flag Code was adopted into federal law by Congress on July 7, 1976 (Public Law 344).
In this publication, all references to The Flag Code are based on this source.
The Missouri State Board of Education adopted a regulation, as required by this statute, in June of 1998.
The rule became effective October 30, 1998.
It may be found in the Code of State Regulations (CSR) under 5 CSR 50-865.400 and in Appendix B of this publication.

Ideas For Instruction In Flag Etiquette
Activities * At the first assembly of the school year, have the principal, a faculty member, a student, or a person from the community show students how to stand during the playing of the national anthem.
At future assemblies, have someone on stage model the proper way to stand, with teachers and Student Council members reinforcing what that person does.
* In elementary classes, discuss the meaning of the words in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Discuss what this or any other country would be like if it did not have liberty and justice and if its people were so divided that they could not live peacefully with each other.
Students could show what they learned by dramatizations or by making drawings to illustrate their ideas.
* Have older students create posters, using newspaper articles they find, that show examples of liberty, justice, and people living peacefully together as opposed to other examples showing those conditions not being present in different parts of the world.
Maps could show the locations of the sites where the stories took place.
* Have a group of students, perhaps Student Council members or Scouts, together with a student who plays a trumpet, lead a dignified flag-raising ceremony and a flag-lowering ceremony each day at the flagpole by the front of the school.
If such a ceremony is not conducted each day, it could be conducted in connection with national and state holidays, special school or community events, or on the first day of the week.
Prior to such ceremonies, students need to be instructed on how to behave during the ceremony.
(See Sections 174d and 177 of The Flag Code, Appendix A.) * Have students study and then demonstrate proper displays of the flag using flags and The Flag Code as resources.
(See Section 175 of The Flag Code, Appendix A.) * As a follow-up to Activity 5, have students discuss the rationale for the code, i.e., why flags are sometimes flown at half staff, or why flags of two or more nations are flown from separate staffs of the same height and are approximately the same size.
* Have students conduct research on the flag as a symbol that evokes strong feelings among many of our citizens, such as those who have fought for this country and those who have immigrated from other nations.
* Have students discuss the ideals the flag represents, such as liberty and justice, and even the right of some citizens not to pledge allegiance to it.
There was a controversy over students in school saluting the flag, which resulted in two Supreme Court decisions in the 1940s.
Those cases are Minersville v. Gobitis (1940) and West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943).
Students could conduct research about these cases and present reports to the class in a variety of creative ways.
* Have students collect or make pictures of the various forms the U.S. flag has taken since our nation's beginnings.
Have them investigate and explain the symbolism in the various forms of the flag, how and why it has changed, and how it has stayed the same.
* Have students investigate and identify arguments concerning a constitutional amendment that would outlaw desecration of the United States flag.
Resources To assist in conducting research about the flag, its history, and etiquette concerning its use, schools should consider the following sources:
1.
School and Public Libraries
2.
Organizations
There are many organizations who may be contacted by teachers and/or students for assistance with flag-related activities and patriotic observances.
Many of these organizations have offices or local affiliates throughout the state.
Only a few of them are listed here.
* The American Legion, State of Missouri, P.O. Box 179, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0179 (Phone: 573-893-2353, Fax: 573-893-2980) * Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, VFW Building, 406 West 34th Street, Kansas City, MO 64111 (Phone: 816-756-3390, Fax: 8169681157).
The VFW has a curriculum entitled Citizenship Education Programs for School and Youth Groups - Curriculum Guide for Educators, which it provides to schools at no cost.
3.
Resources on the Web
There is a wealth of flag-related information and resources available to students and teachers on the World Wide Web.
Here are just a few currently available sites: * American Embassy, London * The American Legion * Betsy Ross Homepage * Fort McHenry National Monument and Historical Shrine, which includes all sorts of interesting information in the Guided Tour of the fort one can take by clicking on the fort's logo.
* National Flag Foundation * Surfing the Net With Kids * A site by Duane Streufert * A site on the history of the U.S. flag * A site on vexillology, the study of flags * The Star-Spangled Banner Project * Information on the U.S. flag at the site of Smithsonian's National Museum of American History
