[News from Congressman Chris Smith - 4th New Jersey Smith Slams Spam Legislation Would Allow Consumer Lawsuits Against Unwanted E-mail Washington, D.C.
Rep. Chris Smith (NJ-4), who was the first member of the House to offer substantial legislation blocking unsolicited commercial e-mail, commonly known as spam, today submitted testimony to the Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection backing legislation he introduced to cut down on spam.
Spam is an unfortunate by-product of the information superhighway.
Anyone with an e-mail address is familiar with the hucksters who clutter electronic mailboxes with pitches for everything from get-rich-quick schemes, to weight loss pills, to pornography.
Despite some perceptions, spam is not free.
It may be inexpensive for the spammer, but because spamming shifts the majority of costs to the recipients, it is a costly burden on consumers.
Internet Service Providers (ISP) are forced to invest in screening software and extra band width to handle spam, and these costs are inevitably shifted to consumers the very targets of the spam, said Smith.
Smiths bill, The Netizens Protection Act of 1999 (H.R. 3024), builds on legislation he offered in the last session of Congress to protect e-mail subscribers and providers against spammers.
The new bill includes provisions allowing Internet Service Providers (ISP) to take action against spammers who abuse their networks, protects innocent individuals by allowing consumers to sue the authors of messages sent to 50 or more people, and requires senders to provide an electronic means to the recipient of removing themselves from the list.
My bill empowers consumers by permitting them to take individual action against their spammer.
It would allow someone harassed by spam to seek up to $500 for each unsolicited e-mail message, plus the cost of damages.
Someone could seek treble damages if a spammer sent them additional e-mail after being requested to stop.
This provision will provide real penalties to stop spammers, and eliminate any fiscal gain they hope to incur, said Smith.
Smiths legislation would require ISPs to make their unsolicited electronic mail messaging policies known.
This would include any option that providers have to allow customers to elect to receive or not receive unsolicited e-mail.
Therefore, spammers would be forewarned and users could make an informed decision about what ISP to use, and whether to block unsolicited e-mail.
The decision to send or receive spam would be up to consumers and the marketplace.
While several anti-spam bills have been offered, Smiths is the only one to contain provisions allowing both the ISP and the consumer to sue for damages, thus providing a true disincentive for chronic spammers.
H.R. 3024 would not impact people who have a prior business relationship; in other words, a retailer or catalogue company would not be prohibited from e-mailing prior customers.
The goal of the legislation is to eliminate the junk mail that takes time and effort to sort through, and can contain damaging viruses.
It is my hope that by requiring bulk e-mail to conform to common business guidelines, those who have abused this new frontier will be pushed into a corner where they are unable to continue sponging off individuals and businesses who use the Internet and e-mail for legitimate purposes, said Smith.
