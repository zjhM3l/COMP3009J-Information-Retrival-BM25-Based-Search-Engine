File No.
51191 Petitioner: Respondent: XXXXXXXXXXXXX Central Reserve Life Insurance Company
Issued and entered February 10, 2003 by Frank M. Fitzgerald, Commissioner
ORDER
I PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On December 5, 2002, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, filed a request for an external review with the Commissioner of Financial and Insurance Services under the Patient's Right to Independent Review Act ("PRIRA") MCL 550.1901 et seq.
Mr. XXXXXX filed the request on behalf of his wife XXXXXXXX.
After a review of the material submitted, the Commissioner accepted the request.
The issues involved include medical questions.
For that reason, pursuant to section 11(6) of the PRIRA, an independent review organization ("IRO") was asked to provide a review of the medical questions.
The IRO provided its report to the Commissioner on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
II FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On XXXXXXXXXXXX, Petitioner underwent gastric bypass surgery.
This surgery is considered elective/cosmetic surgery and is not covered by Petitioner's health insurance.
Petitioner subsequently developed complications and was placed in intensive care with a prolonged hospitalization and period of rehabilitation.
During hospitalization it was determined Petitioner had a very large tracheal diverticulum which became infected and required additional medical services.
Petitioner now seeks coverage for treatment of the tracheal diverticulum.
Petitioner's insurer, Central Reserve Life, denied coverage stating that the treatment was related to complications arising from, or connected with, a surgical procedure not covered under the terms of the policy.
III ISSUE
Did Central Reserve comply with the terms of its certificate of insurance when it denied coverage for Petitioner's treatment?
IV ANALYSIS
Petitioner's Argument
The Petitioner's position is set forth in a statement from her physician, Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXX:
...I had the opportunity to take care of XXXXXXXXXX.
XXX underwent open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on XXXXXXXXX, 2001.
She subsequently developed a leak and ended up in the Intensive Care Unit with a prolonged hospitalization and rehab phase
.
During the course of her hospitalization however, XXX was found to have a very large tracheal diverticulum....The clinical significance of this is that the large sac off the trachea has caused the patient to have significant coughing throughout her life.
In addition, during the course of her hospitalization she developed an infection in this large diverticulum which required her to be re-intubated, go back on the ventilator, and subsequently require a tracheostomy.
We know that the infection was directly related to this congenital diverticulum because of the fact that the specimens obtained lower in the lung revealed no infection and the infection was noted at the site of the large diverticulum....
I strongly believe, the diverticulum has significantly impacted XXXXX care and resulted in a significant increase in the procedures and studies required for optimal care.
This finding and its consequences are completely unrelated to the gastric bypass surgery and should be covered by insurance.
Respondent's Argument
In its final adverse determination, Central Reserve stated in pertinent part:
The terms of the policy under which you are insured under excludes the payment of benefits for the treatment of complications arising from or connected in any way with a surgical or medical treatment or procedure that is not a covered surgical or medical treatment or procedure under the terms of the Policy, whether or not the Insured Person was insured under the Policy at the time the non-covered Treatment or procedure was performed.
Respondent pointed out that medical notes refer to a "continued leak from the original surgery and secondary infection."
Respondent says this shows that the treatment following the cosmetic surgery was connected to that surgery, and therefore should not be covered by the policy.
IRO Recommendation
The IRO's analysis, based on a review of the hospital records, states:
Mrs. XXXXXXXX tracheal diverticulum is rarely mentioned in these records.
When it is, it is always treated as an incidental finding of no or undetermined significance.
Mrs. XXXXXXXX tracheal diverticulum was not a result of the bariatric surgery and played no role in the extensive and unfortunate complications she experienced following her surgery.
Commissioner's Review
Petitioner's initial surgery on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was cosmetic surgery not covered by her policy.
The question to be decided is whether her subsequent treatment should be covered.
Under her certificate of coverage,
No benefits will be paid for charges:
* * *
43.
For the Treatment of complications arising from or connected in any way with a surgical or medical Treatment or procedures that is not a covered surgical or medical Treatment or procedure under the terms of the policy, whether or not the Insured Person was insured under the Policy at the time the non-covered Treatment or procedure was performed.
It was the opinion of Petitioner's physician that the subsequent treatment was not related and should be covered.
Respondent's medical director concluded that the later treatment was related.
To assist the Commissioner in resolving this medical question, the matter was referred to an independent review organization.
This case was reviewed for the IRO by a general surgeon who is a Diplomate of the American Board of Surgery and a Fellow in the American College of Surgeons.
The reviewer concluded that the Petitioner's post-surgery problems were cause by her cosmetic surgery.
The IRO reviewer had no conflict of interest in this matter.
The reviewer had the benefit of reviewing Petitioner's medical records.
The reviewer's analysis is persuasive.
The IRO's review is adopted and incorporated by reference into this Order.
A copy of that review is attached.
The Commissioner finds that the post-surgery complications Petitioner suffered were caused by, and connected with, the initial surgery.
Therefore, medical services subsequent to that surgery are not payable under Petitioner's certificate of coverage.
V ORDER
The final adverse determination of Central Reserve Life Insurance Company is upheld.
This is a final decision of an administrative agency.
Under MCL 550.1915, any person aggrieved by this order may seek judicial review no later than sixty (60) days from the date of this order in the circuit court for the county where the covered person resides or in the Circuit Court of Ingham County.
A copy of the petition for judicial review should be sent to the Commissioner of the Office of Financial and Insurance Services, Health Plans Division, Post Office Box 30220, Lansing, MI 48909-7720.
