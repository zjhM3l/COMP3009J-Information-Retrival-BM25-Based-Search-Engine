COUNTRIES WITH UNITED STATES BASES OR FACILITIES, ACCESS RIGHTS, DEFENSE COMMITMENTS OR DEFENSE RELATIONS US military bases, facilites and activities overseas fall into three general categories: - Larger bases or installations with a permanent US military presence, usually comprising combat-capable forces (Attachment A).
- Lesser or technical facilities, again with a permanent US military presence, which may be largely civilian contractor personnel (Attachment B).
- Access rights for US forces to use host country facilities for visits, exercises or training, without a significant permanent US military presence (Attachment C).
Most of these arrangements were established through securing prior approval from the host countries concerned, and negotiating formal agreements with them.
In the NATO area, Japan and Korea, host nations generally made state-owned land and structures available without cost.
Following Congressional approval, new facilities were then constructed, either by the U.S. at its own expense, or through multilateral infrastructure funding in NATO countries.
As a matter of international law, title to those improvements vests in the host nation, which grants use rights to the U.S.
With respect to larger bases or installations, no rent is paid as a matter of principle, and the following considerations apply: (1) Japan, Korea and Germany absorb a significant proportion of the local support costs of U.S. forces.
Other wealthy Allies also make a burdensharing contribution, but to a lesser extent.
(2) U.S. security and economic assistance programs for such countries as Greece, Turkey and Egypt reflect in part their provision of basing or access rights.
The U.S. does pay rent for certain lesser facilities and access rights in Antigua, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Oman and Seychelles.
Attachments D and E respectively list those countries with formal U.S. defense commitments, and those having defense relations with the U.S., but not a formal defense commitment.
