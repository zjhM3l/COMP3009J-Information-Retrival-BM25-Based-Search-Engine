Table of Contents Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE): History and New Concerns James Howell, DVM, MPH ISDH Epidemiology Resource Center [image607.gif] The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of diseases that cause neurological dysfunction in animals and people.
Clinical characteristics of these diseases are loss of motor control, dementia, wasting, paralysis, and eventually death.
They have generated a great deal of interest and concern in the last 10-15 years because of the recent identification of a TSE in British cattle (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE) and its linking in 1996 with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) in several young adults in the United Kingdom.
Diagnosis is made at autopsy by the histological changes in the brain that makes the brain tissue appear sponge like. [goat.gif]
[cow.gif] Animal species in which a TSE has been identified include sheep and goats (scrapie), cattle (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), mink (transmissible mink encephalopathy), mule deer, white-tailed deer and elk (chronic wasting disease), and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Gerstmann-Straussl [sheep.gif]
These diseases are thought to be caused by a controversial agent that does not contain any genetic material (DNA or RNA), but consists only of protein.
The agent has both an infectious and a hereditary component.
There is some evidence that the disease agent is a modified form of a normal cellular protein involved in synaptic function.
The normal protein is protease sensitive.
The modified form is relatively resistance to protease and accumulates in the cytoplasmic vesicles of affected individuals.
The abnormal protein may also occur as the result of a gene mutation that causes the production of the modified form and is passed to the next generation as an autosomal dominant trait.
Experimentally prions from infected animals have been injected to mice and subhuman primates, which in turn developed a TSE.
All TSE agents are resistant to heat and normal sterilization practices.

Scrapie is the oldest recognized TSE, having been recognized in Great Britain and other Western European countries for over 250 years.Scrapie was first recognized in the United States in 1947, in a Michigan sheep flock.
Scrapie is primarily reported in the Suffolk breed but also reported in other breeds.
The name is derived from the behavior of infected sheep to scrape their wool off against fixed objects apparently to relieve itching.
Other predominant features of the disease are related to motor control with loss of coordination and gait abnormalities.
Transmission is thought to be from ewe to lamb and to other sheep through contact with the placenta and placental fluids.
In laboratory settings, the agent has been transmitted to laboratory animals including monkeys.
There is no evidence that scrapie has been transmitted to humans.
The USDA has launched an effort to identify infected flocks and eradicate the disease.
Indiana has three infected Suffolk flocks.
Recently an experimental test has been developed to test asymptomatic animals for presence of the agent.
[image609.gif] Transmissible mink encephalopathy was first observed in the United States in 1947 is a rare disease of farm raised mink.
Since then, it has been reported in the Canada, Finland, Germany, and the former Soviet Union.Clinical signs of the disease are changes in behavior, incoordination, jerking of hind limbs, circling, compulsive chewing, and clenching of the teeth.
Cases were seen at several mink ranches in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Idaho.
Epidemiological studies suggest that contaminated feed is a likely source.
The diet at one ranch consisted of "downer cattle"(nonambulatory cattle due to a metabolic disease, broken limbs or a neurological disease), fish, poultry, and cereal.
Since 1993 the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service has examined the brains of over 8,400 downer cattle for BSE or other TSE and has not found a single case.
[image610.gif] Chronic wasting disease (CWD) was first recognized as a clinical syndrome in 1967 and has continued to occur infrequently in limited areas of Colorado and Wyoming.
Since 1981, less than 200 cases have been documented.
Cases have occurred in both free ranging animals as well as in farmed elk and other confined herds of deer or elk.
The disease is characterized by chronic weight loss leading to death.
Behavioral changes such as decreased interactions with other animals, listlessness, repetitive walking in set patterns, and in elk, hyperexcitability and nervousness are seen also.
In spite of many opportunities for exposure to other ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats, there have been no cases of CWD have been reported in these species.
The route or transmission is not known, but is thought to be lateral and maternal.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as "mad cow disease" was first recognized as a central nervous system disease of cattle in the United Kingdom in 1986.
It has since been seen in 10 other European countries.Approximately 180,000 cases have occurred worldwide with 95% of those in the United Kingdom.
The disease is thought to have been introduced into cattle through feed containing meat and bone meal (from dead sheep) that had not been heated sufficiently to destroy the prion.
The disease is referred to as "mad cow disease" because of afflicted cow's clinical presentation of behavior changes of nervousness or aggression.
Other clinical features are abnormal posture, incoordination and difficulty in rising, decreased milk production, and loss of body condition in spite of continued appetite.
The incubation range is six to eight years and following onset of clinical signs, animals die in 2 weeks to 6 months.
In 1988, the epidemiology of the outbreak was sufficiently understood that the United Kingdom banned the feeding of ruminant proteins to other ruminants and instituted other steps to eliminate BSE in cattle.
The number of cattle cases in the United Kingdom peaked in 1993 and continues to decline.
In March 1996, it was announced that 10 cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) had been diagnosed in 1994 and 1995.
This new CJD differentiated from classical CJD in several ways.
Affected individuals were younger (average age 28 versus 60+); the course of the disease was longer (13 months versus 6 months), the electroencephalograph activity was different, and there was a different brain histopathology, yet recognizable as CJD.
Recently reported research in mice supports the theory that BSE and nvCJD are caused by the same agent.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has taken several steps to ensure that BSE does not occur in the United States.
The use of ruminants in meat and bone meal was stopped.
Importation of cattle from the United Kingdom was stopped and those animals that had been imported were traced and identified to ensure they did not go into the food chain.
Most recently, the USDA has been attempting to destroy a herd of sheep imported from Belgium that may be infected with BSE.
The farm and its animals have been under quarantine to ensure than none of the animals enters the food chain.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) was first described in 1920 by a German neurologist named Creutzfeldt followed by the description of four more cases by A. Jakob the following year.
Clinically CJD is a profound dementia with ataxia and diffuse myoclonic jerking.
This disease is uncommon, generally occurring in late middle age at a rate of one case per million population worldwide.
The disease occurs most frequently as a sporadic event, but has been transmitted iatrogenically by the use of dura mater grafts, corneal transplants, human growth hormone, and brain depth electrodes.
A familial occurrence has been recognized but the pathway of transmission is not known.
Since the identification of nvCJD in the United Kingdom, increased attention has been paid to CJD in the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is studying the 1979-1997 nationwide CJD deaths.
During that time period, 4,471 CJD deaths were identified.
The average age-adjusted death rate was 0.97 deaths/million persons.
Whites accounted for 94.9% of the deaths and the median age was 68 years (64% of the nvCJD deaths in Europe died at less than 30 years of age).
Males had a slightly higher death rate than females.
Clinical and/or neuropathology records for 77 of 87 patients who died of CJD younger than 55 years of age revealed no evidence of nvCJD.
Brain tissue from 269 suspected CJD deaths did identify pathology distinctive nvCJD.
The rate of CJD deaths in the United States has remained stable from 1979 to 1997 and no nvCJD deaths have been identified.
Indiana incidence of CJD is very similar to the national statistics with the exception that 60% of the cases were females.
Figures 1 and 2 provide a graphic description of the Indiana CJD deaths by year and age.
The mean and median age of cases was 68.8 years, and 80% of the cases were 60 years of age or older (more than 50% of the vCJD deaths in the United Kingdom were less than 30 years of age).
Since 1990, the number of cases has ranged from 2 to 9, but the mean number has been 5.1 cases/year.
Indiana's death rate (0.87cases/million population) is slightly lower than the national average (0.97cases/million population).
From all appearances Indiana's CJD deaths are typical of CJD.
Health care workers should be aware of the potential for iatrogenic transmission, and other citizens should be aware that CJD is not easily transmitted and is not communicable in ways normally associated with infectious diseases.

Another human spongiform encephalopathy known as Kuru was identified in the early 1900 in a New Guinea tribe that practiced mortuary ritual acts of cannibalism.
With the stopping of the cannibalism practices, Kuru has disappeared.
