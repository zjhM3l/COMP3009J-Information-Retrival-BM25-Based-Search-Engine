OCEANS: AN AGENDA FOR ACTION
At the National Ocean Conference in Monterey, California, President Clinton and Vice President Gore are launching a series of major initiatives to explore, protect and restore Americas vital ocean resources.
These measures will provide new scientific insight into the oceans, promote sustainable use of fisheries and other marine resources, open new opportunities for jobs and economic growth, preserve national security and freedom of the seas, and help preserve our oceans for all time.
The President and Vice President are proposing an additional $224 million through 2002 to support these efforts.
Protecting our Oceans from Offshore Oil Drilling.
To protect our oceans and coasts from the environmental risks of offshore oil and gas drilling, the President is issuing a directive extending the moratorium on offshore leasing for an additional ten years, and permanently barring new leasing in national marine sanctuaries.
Building Sustainable Fisheries.
To restore Americas fisheries, and sustain the coastal communities that depend on them, the Administration is announcing measures to reduce overfishing and protect essential fish habitats -- including a ban on the sale or import of undersized Atlantic swordfish.
The Administration is proposing an additional $194 million over five years to speed implementation, and is calling on other nations to undertake similar efforts.
Ports for the 21st Century.
To maintain competitiveness and ensure Americas ability to safely handle the increase in ocean vessel traffic expected in the 21st century, the Administration is launching a ports modernization program financed by a proposed new Harbor Services Fund.
The fund would raise $800 million over the next five years to deepen and maintain shipping channels, improve navigational safety, and undertake other port projects.
Joining the Law of the Sea Convention.
To maintain Americas leadership in international ocean affairs, the President is calling on the U.S. Senate to recognize the breadth of support among all sectors of the U.S. ocean community for the Law of the Sea Convention, and to clear the way for the United States to join the Convention as a fitting celebration of the Year of the Ocean.
Protecting Coral Reefs.
To strengthen protection of natural coral reefs in U.S. waters, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing Federal agencies to expand research, preservation and restoration activities.
The President is proposing an additional $6 million through 2002 to speed these efforts and complete restoration of 18 damaged reefs in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific.
Exploring the Last U.S. Frontier.
To unravel deep-sea mysteries, discover new opportunities in the ocean, and better understand how to protect marine resources, the Administration is launching a program to map and explore U.S. ocean waters with advanced underwater technology.
A proposed $12 million through 2002 will be used to expand two shallow-water observatories, build two new deep-sea observatories, and develop two high-tech submersibles to explore exotic sea life.
A new initiative will be launched in partnership with the National Geographic Society and Goldman Foundation to explore our National Marine Sanctuaries.
Protecting our Beaches and Coastal Waters.
To help protect the Nations beaches and coastal waters as well as public health the Vice President is announcing a new website listing beach advisories and closings, and a coordinated strategy to respond to toxic algal blooms.
He and President Clinton also are calling on Congress to fully fund the Administrations Clean Water Action Plan.
Monitoring Climate and Global Warming.
To better understand the role of the oceans in shaping our weather and climate, and to help address the threat of global warming, the Administration is announcing an expanded ocean monitoring system.
The Administration is proposing an additional $12 million through 2002 to place hundreds of monitoring buoys in the North Atlantic and North Pacific to measure critical ocean data.
Public Access to Military Data and Technology.
To help increase our understanding of marine life, and to enhance weather forecasting and climate change research, and identify valuable ocean resources, the Administration is announcing the declassification and release of secret and restricted Navy data.
The Department of Defense also will produce computer-based nautical charts replacing the paper charts used by mariners for centuries a significant advance in marine safety.

PROTECTING OUR OCEANS FROM OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING
To protect our oceans and coasts from the environmental risks of offshore oil and gas drilling, the President is issuing a directive extending the moratorium on offshore leasing for an additional ten years, and permanently barring new leasing in national marine sanctuaries.
Some portions of the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of the United States contain oil and gas reserves.
Over the years, some areas have been leased to private industry for oil and gas development.
Offshore drilling, however, poses the risk of oil spills and other environmental damage.
To guard against such risks, many citizens oppose new leasing off the coasts of their states.
Through a combination of executive and legislative action, many coastal areas are now closed to new leasing.
The Department of Interiors latest five-year plan for the Outer Continental Shelf, adopted in 1997, effectively prevents new leasing in federal waters off most of the U.S. coast through 2002.
In addition, the particularly sensitive areas encompassed by Americas 12 national marine sanctuaries are protected from oil and gas drilling only to varying degrees.
To strengthen protections against the risks of offshore oil and gas development, the President is:
* Issuing a directive under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that prevents leasing of any area currently under moratorium prior to 2012.
This extends by 10 years the protection currently provided by the Department of the Interiors leasing plan.
The moratorium covers virtually all of the coasts of the North Atlantic, California, Washington, Oregon, southwest Florida, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and southern Alaska (the North Aleutian Basin).
* Permanently placing off limits all areas of the Outer Continental Shelf contained within existing marine sanctuaries.
They include the Channel Islands and Monterey Bay sanctuaries in California, the Florida Keys sanctuary, Grays Reef sanctuary in Georgia, and the Olympic Coast sanctuary off Washington.
The Presidents Directive prevents consideration of any of these areas for either exploratory or production leasing for any resource development in the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf.
It does not cancel or interfere with existing leases.
The 10-year moratorium covering most of the coast is consistent with the Administrations policy of allowing future review based on new science and technology that could allow safer development of the Outer Continental Shelf.
The President has decided that because of their unique and sensitive ocean resources, the marine sanctuaries should be permanently protected from new leasing.

BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
To restore Americas fisheries, and sustain the coastal communities that depend on them, the President is announcing measures to reduce overfishing and protect essential fish habitats -- including a ban on the sale or import of undersized Atlantic swordfish.
The President is proposing an additional $194 million over five years to speed implementation, and is calling on other nations to undertake similar efforts.
In the past, oceans were thought to be inexhaustible sources of food.
Today, most of the worlds commercial fisheries are being exploited at or beyond their ability to sustain themselves.
Apart from overfishing, many species are suffering from pollution, habitat destruction and wasteful by-catch -- the indiscriminate capture of noncommercial species, which usually are thrown back and die.
Marine fisheries support millions of U.S. jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity each year.
The collapse of major fisheries in New England demonstrates the devastating impacts of overfishing on coastal communities and economies.
With the help of federal efforts, New England fisheries now are beginning to rebound.
To rebuild and sustain Americas marine fisheries, the President is proposing an additional $194 million in fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 to:
* Acquire three state-of-the-art research vessels to increase the frequency and accuracy of fisheries assessments, providing better data on the health and abundance of fish stocks so management decisions are based on sound science.
* Develop measures by October, 1998 to meet the goals of the Sustainable Fisheries Act -- restoring depleted fish stocks within 10 years, protecting essential fish habitats, and reducing the by-catch of noncommercial species.
* Implement a ban on the sale or import of undersized Atlantic swordfish (under 33 pounds) to help restore and sustain this important fishery.
* Increase research and promote public-private partnerships to develop environmentally-sound aquaculture -- commercial fish production -- to ease pressure on ocean fisheries.
In addition, the President is calling on other nations to help reverse the decline in the worlds fisheries by vigorously implementing measures to stop overfishing, eliminate the use of destructive fishing practices, and protect and restore essential fish habitats.

PORTS FOR THE 21st CENTURY
To maintain competitiveness and ensure Americas ability to safely handle the increase in ocean vessel traffic expected in the 21st century, the President is launching a ports modernization program financed by a proposed new Harbor Services Fund.
The fund would raise $800 million over the next five years to deepen and maintain shipping channels, improve navigational safety, and undertake other port projects.
More than 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade by tonnage (excluding Mexico and Canada) passes through U.S. ports and harbors.
In 1996, U.S. ports handled approximately 2.3 billion tons of cargo and supported nearly 16 million jobs.
As we head into the 21st century, international trade will continue to grow.
Unless our ports are prepared for instance, by deepening channels to accommodate larger cargo ships -- American consumers will pay more for imported goods, and American businesses will pay higher export costs.
These efforts must be undertaken in a way that protects the ocean environment.
This includes a continued commitment to environmentally sound dredging and safe disposal or reuse of dredged material.
Ports must also take full advantage of new navigation technology, such as the Coast Guards new Vessel Traffic Services system and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations prototype Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System.
These computer-based systems provide ships with up-to-the-minute weather and oceanographic data to help move cargo more efficiently and avoid collisions that cost lives and harm the environment.
To continue to prepare our ports for the new millennium, the President is proposing to:
* Establish a new Harbor Services Fund to hold revenues from a new user fee on shippers that would replace the existing harbor maintenance fee.
Revenues would be used to finance harbor dredging, port construction activities, and navigation safety improvements.
* Enhance federal partnerships with industry to commercialize government-developed PORTS technology and make it available to ports across the U.S. and around the world.
* Combine the capabilities of PORTS and the Vessels Traffic Services system to place powerful new navigation safety tools in the hands of the harbor pilots who guide ships into port.

JOINING THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION
To maintain Americas leadership in international ocean affairs, the President is calling on the U.S. Senate to recognize the overwhelming support expressed at the National Ocean Conference for the Law of the Sea Convention, and to clear the way for the United States to join the Convention.
The Law of the Sea Convention provides the international legal framework that supports activities at sea, including fishing, international trade, military operations and environmental protection.
With 125 member nations, including virtually all of the industrialized countries, the Convention is the central force in international ocean policy.
The United States, however, risks losing its leadership role if it does not join the Convention.
For instance, the United States will lose its provisional membership in the International Seabed Authority, which will establish international rules for potential sea-bed mining, if it does not join the Convention by November.
If the United States does not join, it also will not be represented on the Continental Shelf Commission and the Law of the Sea Tribunal.
All of these bodies will make important decisions affecting U.S. interests.
The United States launched the Convention negotiations in 1972 and, by 1982, achieved most of its fundamental objectives.
Concerns over deep seabed mining remained, however, and President Reagan declined to sign the Convention.
Most of the industrialized world followed.
However, President Reagan committed the United States to honor all of the Conventions other provisions while attempting to reform the deep seabed mining provisions.
Negotiations led by the United States resulted in the 1994 Deep Sea-Bed Mining Agreement that resolved all outstanding issues.
The United States signed the agreement, and again the rest of the industrialized world followed.
The Convention balances economic, strategic and environmental concerns.
Joining it will:
* Preserve freedom of navigation and overflight through, for instance, international straits like Hormuz and Malacca and sea lanes in the strategically located archipelagoes of Indonesia and the Philippines.
* Support U.S. maritime drug interdiction activities.
* Secure open and efficient trade routes and prevent unwarranted restrictions by coastal nations.
* Enhance fisheries management, protection of whales and other marine mammals, and global ocean protection, especially the control of land-based sources of pollution.
The National Ocean Conference is the first of its kind because it involves all sectors of the U.S. ocean community federal, state and local governments, science, industry, academia, environmental and other public interests.
All have expressed the critical importance of U.S. membership in the Law of the Sea Convention.

PROTECTING CORAL REEFS
To strengthen protection of natural coral reefs in U.S. waters, President Clinton is signing an executive order directing federal agencies to expand research, preservation and restoration activities.
The President is proposing an additional $6 million through 2002 to speed these efforts and complete restoration of 18 damaged reefs in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific.
Coral reefs are among the most exquisite -- and most endangered -- ecosystems on Earth.
As a foundation of the tourism, recreation and fishing industries, coral reefs sustain billions of dollars in economic activity.
Often described as the marine equivalents of the rainforest, coral reefs support a stunning diversity and abundance of undersea life.
Thousands of species have yet to be catalogued, so their potential value -- as life-saving medicines, for instance -- remains undiscovered.
Yet around the world, coral reefs are suffering the effects of pollution, development, overfishing and rising ocean temperatures brought on by global warming.
This degradation threatens both the reefs and the economies they sustain.
In 1994, with leadership from Vice President Gore, the United States founded the International Coral Reef Initiative to mobilize efforts to protect and restore these fragile reefs.
Global attention was further heightened in 1997, which was declared the International Year of the Coral Reef.
To strengthen U.S. efforts and encourage similar action by other nations, the new Executive Order on Coral Reef Protection:
Directs agencies to ensure that no action they authorize or fund will degrade coral reefs in U.S. waters.
* Creates an interagency Coral Reef Task Force, headed by the secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, to coordinate implementation of coral reef policy.
* Directs the task force to coordinate a comprehensive program to map, monitor and assess the health of U.S. coral reefs; research the major causes and consequences of coral reef damage; and develop strategies to reduce damage and restore ailing reefs.
* Directs the State Department and other agencies to take action to promote conservation and sustainable use of coral reef resources, building on the success of the International Coral Reef Initiative.
The Executive Order and proposed funding increase, together with ongoing efforts, will allow the completion of 18 restoration projects -- nine in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, two elsewhere in Florida, two in the Virgin Islands, three in Puerto Rico, one in Guam, and one in Hawaii.

EXPLORING THE LAST U.S. FRONTIER
To unravel deep-sea mysteries, discover new opportunities in the ocean, and better understand how to protect marine resources, Vice President Gore is launching a program to map and explore U.S. ocean waters with advanced underwater technology.
A proposed $12 million through 2002 will be used to expand two shallow-water observatories, build two new deep-sea observatories, and develop two high-tech submersibles to explore exotic sea life.
Oceans cover most of the Earth, yet only five percent of the ocean and sea floor have been explored.
Until recently, we knew more about the surface of the moon than the ocean floor.
Recent exploration of deep-sea vents, which spew hot water from deep within the Earth, have led to the discovery of life forms never thought possible.
And advanced technology now allows researchers to go, and to send unmanned submersible vehicles, to greater and greater depths.
Dramatic visits to the sunken Titanic offer a glimpse of the exciting discoveries that are now possible.
To protect the oceans, and particularly our marine reserves, we must know more about them, and how human activities affect them.
Information gleaned from the sea can also help identify new sources of minerals, life-saving pharmaceuticals and other materials.
It also will provide a clearer picture of the oceans enormous contribution to our economy.
The Administration is proposing an additional $4 million a year in fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 to:
* Develop two new unmanned deep-sea observatories -- on the Juan de Fuca ridge off the West Coast, and in the Gulf of Mexico -- to monitor unusual life forms.
* Expand existing shallow-water observatories -- such as the Leo in New Jersey, and the Aquarius in Florida -- to enable researchers to stay underwater for several days at a stretch to directly observe biological, chemical and physical processes in the ocean.
* Develop, in partnership with industry, two state-of-the-art submersibles -- an unmanned undersea vehicle remotely operated from a ship, and a manned self-propelled mini-submarine.
These systems will be leased by the government and made available to the scientific community.
* Assess the contribution of ocean resources and activities to the nations economy.
A panel of economists, scientists and ocean experts, to be named by the President, will complete the assessment by the year 2000.
* Contribute $250,000 a year to support the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a public-private partnership spearheaded by the National Geographic Society and the Goldman Foundation to explore undersea life in Americas marine sanctuaries.
Strengthening Protection of Our Marine Reserves.
The Sustainable Seas Expeditions will help complete a comprehensive inventory of biodiversity in Americas 12 National Marine Sanctuaries; revise management plans for the sanctuaries by 2002; and develop science-based recommendations for stronger protections, such as the no-take zones in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

PROTECTING OUR BEACHES AND COASTAL WATERS
To protect the nations beaches, bays and coastal areas, the Vice President is announcing a new website strategy to protect our beaches, and a coordinated response system among federal, state, and local governments to reduce polluted runoff in coastal areas.
These new actions will preserve our oceans and protect the people and economies that depend on them.
The time has come to move forward and increase our efforts to protect our ocean and coastal waters for the children of the 21st century.
While we have made significant progress in protecting our beaches, bays and coastal areas over the past quarter century, the job is not done.
Our beaches and coastal areas remain threatened from bacterial contamination from sewage overflows, polluted runoff from city streets, lawns and rural areas, toxic algal bloom and ocean dumping.
Each year, thousands of beaches are closed to swimming due to high levels of disease causing microorganisms.
Approximately 2.3 trillion gallons of treated sewage are discharged into coastal waters annually causing dead zones and forcing the closure of shellfish beds and swimming areas.
The public is now more concerned about toxic algal blooms because it threatens their food supply, disrupts are economies, and generally disturbs the quality of life for millions of Americans who depend on the ocean everyday.
The Clean Water Action Plan provides an excellent basis for addressing these important issues.
New actions include:
* The Administration is making important public health information easily available to the public: The new Beach Watch Program internet site, available at http://www.epa.gov/ost/beaches, contains important information for 1000 beaches, including information on which beaches are monitored for microbial pollution, which have advisories issued because of pollution, and how to find out more.
Similarly, an internet site is also being developed to provide access to national fish advisories.
* In conjunction with the Beach Watch Program, the Administration is announcing the Beach Action Plan, a new five-year strategy to develop stronger, faster and more accurate beach monitoring programs for states, to strengthen beach water quality standards, to improve public access to information on beach water quality, and to increase research to address problems related to skin, upper respiratory tract, as well as eye, ear, nose and throat infections in swimmers.
* Federal agencies will develop a coordinated response system that supports state and local efforts in coastal waters for major events, to address toxic algal blooms such as Pfiesteria, red and brown tides, and other harmful organisms.
As part of this, agencies will work with states, academia, and others to implement the National Harmful Algal Bloom Research and Monitoring Strategy.
* Federal agencies will work with coastal states and territories to ensure that, by December 1999, they have developed programs to reduce polluted runoff in coastal areas and have put in place appropriate state-enforceable policies and mechanisms.

MONITORING CLIMATE AND GLOBAL WARMING
To better understand the role of the oceans in shaping our weather and climate, and to help address the threat of global warming, Vice President Gore is announcing an expanded ocean monitoring system.
The Administration is proposing an additional $12 million through 2002 to place hundreds of monitoring buoys in the North Atlantic and North Pacific to measure critical ocean data.
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet, and their interaction with the atmosphere has a profound influence on climate patterns and our daily weather.
For instance, the recent El NiÃ±o, which caused severe flooding and drought worldwide, began with unusually warm temperatures in the South Pacific.
Despite significant advances in forecasting, severe weather events inflict a costly toll on agriculture, industry and communities.
One of the most significant factors shaping our future climate is the oceans response to global warming.
The oceans are a major sink absorbing carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.
How much carbon dioxide the oceans can store, and how that ability changes over time, will heavily influence how quickly the Earth warms.
The rate of global warming, in turn, may have serious ramifications for fisheries and other marine life.
Finer measurements of ocean data are needed to better track climate shifts, understand the interaction of the oceans and the atmosphere, and predict severe weather and the regional impacts of global climate change.
To fill these data gaps:
* The Administration is proposing an additional $4 million a year in fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 so the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) can place a vast array of floating buoys in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, which now are largely unmonitored.
Instruments on the buoys, which can sink and rise on their own, will measure temperature, salinity and currents at different depths.
Data from the buoys, part of an expanded Global Ocean Observing System, will complement shipboard and satellite measurements to refine climate prediction models.
* NOAA, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Navy will continue observations and research on the interaction of oceans, the atmosphere, the polar ice caps, marine ecosystems and the movement of carbon through the oceans.
* NASA also plans to develop, launch and operate a series of new satellites to provide extremely accurate measurements of biological productivity in the oceans, as well as wind, currents and temperature at the seas surface.

PUBLIC ACCESS TO MILITARY DATA AND TECHNOLOGY
To help increase our understanding of marine life, and to enhance weather forecasting and climate change research, and identify valuable ocean resources, Vice President Gore is announcing the declassification and release of secret and restricted Navy data.
The Department of Defense also will produce computer-based nautical charts replacing the paper charts used by mariners for centuries -- a significant advance in marine safety.
Declassifying Secret Data.
In support of its military missions, the U.S. Navy has long gathered vast amounts of ocean data.
Much of this data is of important scientific and commercial value.
It can be used to track the migration of fish and marine mammals, uncover illegal fishing activities, forecast underwater earthquakes and tsunamis (tidal waves), and understand long-term climate patterns.
In response to the Environmental Task Force launched by Vice President Gore while in the U.S. Senate, the Navy is reviewing and releasing large quantities of data:
* The Navy has signed an agreement with a private foundation to create a mechanism to declassify secret data from the Sound Surveillance Systems, an array of underwater listening devices used to hunt submarines.
The acoustical data can be used to track whale migrations, predict natural catastrophes and support climate change research.
* The Navy also is releasing data on ocean temperature and salinity levels collected by Navy submarines on patrol under the Arctic ice cap.
Combined with declassified data from other oceans released by the Navy in recent years, this new information completes a global data set that will be a valuable tool in researching long-term climate change.
Computer-Age Nautical Charts.
Over the next five years, the Defense Departments National Imagery and Mapping Agency will prepare for military use purposes a series of computer-based charts for most of the worlds oceans and coastal waters.
Digital Nautical Charts covering virtually all areas of commercial shipping activity worldwide will be available by 2002.
Used in conjunction with the Defense Departments Global Positioning System, this new technology is considered by many the greatest advance in safety at the sea since the introduction of radar.
It will allow mariners to move cargo more efficiently through ports worldwide while minimizing the risk of collision and environmental harm.
Supercomputer Weather Forecasts.
The Navy employs one the nations ten largest supercomputers to provide highly accurate and localized forecasts of battleground weather conditions.
Under a new agreement, the Navy will work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess whether these techniques can be used to improve the prediction of severe weather over the United States.

Protecting the Oceans
President Clinton and Vice President Gore
Oceans sustain life on earth and provide us with many vital resources.
They are a source of food, energy, commerce, medicine, and recreation.
They shape our weather, link us to other nations, and are critical to our national security.
In the 21st century, we will look increasingly to the oceans to meet our everyday needs.
From restoring our beaches, bays and coastal areas to leading international negotiations to protecting migratory fish stocks, President Clinton and Vice President are committed to protecting our oceans.
International Oceans Protection
Ocean Dumping of Low-Level Radioactive Waste - Led the world in calling for a global ban on ocean dumping of low-level radioactive waste at the London Convention in 1993.
The U.S. was the first of the nuclear powers to advocate the ban, and successfully convinced our allies and the rest of the world to follow our lead.
Endangered Right Whales - Sought strong measures to protect the remaining 300 North Atlantic right whales.
Under the U.S. proposal, commercial ships will be required to report when they enter a right whales habitat and will receive advice on avoiding collisions.
Coral Reefs - Founded International Coral Reef Initiative with seven other nations in 1994 to mobilize efforts to protect and restore the worlds fragile reefs.
The effort has led to joint research, information sharing, and enhanced awareness of the state of reefs around the world.
Dolphin Protection - Led negotiations resulting in a multilateral agreement to protect dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
Helped shape consensus legislation that the United States Senate passed 99-0.
The Act became law in August 1997.
Migratory Fish Stocks - Worked with other nations to secure a legally-binding international treaty to protect migratory fish stocks.
Over-fishing in the worlds oceans has put thousands of Americans out of work and depleted a major source of food for people around the world.
The United States ratified the agreement in August 1996.
Land-Based Source of Marine Pollution - Hosted Washington Conference and led negotiations to shape a global plan of action to address land-based sources of marine pollution.
Maritime Security Act of 1996 - Supported the enactment and implementation of the Maritime Security Act of 1996 which signaled the beginning of a new era for Americas maritime industry.
Under the Act, a merchant fleet comprised of modern, efficient, and militarily useful commercial vessels will maintain a competitive U.S. flag presence in international commerce.
Persistent Organic Pollutants - Led the international call to address dangerous persistent organic pollutants because they threaten health and safety around the world.
Because of the Administrations leadership, all parties agreed to develop a legally binding treaty to phase out 12 of the most dangerous persistent organic pollutants.
Release of Classified Documents - Released formerly classified ocean data collected by the Navy during the Cold War, giving scientists valuable new information about the worlds oceans.
Clean Oceans
Clean Water Initiative - Launched a $2.3 billion clean water initiative to restore the 40 percent of waters that remain too polluted for fishing or swimming.
Set tougher public health and environmental standards to protect coastal waters from polluted runoff and children from unsafe beaches.
Polluted Runoff in Coastal Areas - Worked with states to approve 29 state management programs for controlling nonpoint sources of pollution in coastal areas.
Required programs to include enforceable mechanisms to control polluted runoff -- one of the greatest sources of water problems in the United States today.
Wetlands Protection - Adopted an ambitious goal of achieving a net gain of 100,000 wetland acres per year by 2005 to restore the natural filters for the oceans and the waters that feed them.
This includes extensive coastal restoration work through the Senator Breaux's Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act.
The Administration also has made the wetlands regulatory process more protective, phasing out a nationwide permit that had resulted in tens of thousands of acres of wetlands loss annually.
Historic Bay-Delta Accord - Signed a landmark agreement restoring the Bay-Deltas 1,600 square miles of river and bay which meets the needs of agriculture, urban areas, and hundreds of species of fish and wildlife.
102 species of fish and countless other plants and animals will benefit from the improved water quality.
Sediments - Completed the first comprehensive survey of contaminated sediments that threaten our oceans and fisheries, and President Clinton issued an executive order broadening the authority of Federal natural resource agencies to order cleanup of sediments contaminated with hazardous substances.
Harmful Marine Organisms - Responded with direct aid and support for affected states when Pfiesteria closed several rivers in Maryland and Virginia in 1997.
Federal agencies developed a coordinated research strategy, as part of a broader interagency to address harmful algal blooms and other marine organisms that cause "dead zones," red tides, brown tides, and other threats to the help of our oceans.
Oil Spill Prevention - Worked proactively, both nationally and internationally, to prevent the accidental release of oil from all sources, especially from vessels.
We have negotiated with the International Maritime Organization to require higher construction standards for new tankers.
Domestically, we have vigorously implemented the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, resulting in dramatic reductions in U.S. oil spills from all sources.
We continue to strengthen our response and prevention capabilities among Federal and State government and industry to ensure that accidental releases of oil will be rapidly stopped and controlled, and that damage to the environment is minimized.
Promoting Commerce
Navigation - Resolved a decades-old controversy over harbor dredging in New York Harbor, while closing and using dredge material to remediate an ocean dump site that had endured a century of contamination and created decades of concern among the region's fishermen.
The Administration also has helped link harbor dredging to environmentally beneficial reuse of dredged material in the Port of Oakland and Ports throughout the Nation.
New England Groundfish Crisis - Took emergency action in 1994 to close portions of U.S. waters of Georges Bank and southern New England to commercial fishing to save cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder from severe depletion and economic extinction.
Provided $60 million in federal aid to fishermen and their families, and also conducted a $24 million fishing vessel buyout.
Since then, all but one of the groundfish populations has shown signs of rebuilding and many fishing families were able to obtain job assistance or low interests loans with the help of the federal government.
El NiÃ±o - Successfully predicted the onset and associated impacts of one of the strongest El NiÃ±o events on record.
Forecasts that El NiÃ±o conditions were developing and would have significant impact on global weather patterns were issued more than six months in advance.
The extent of use and the confidence of the users were unprecedented.
Protecting Ocean and Coastal Habitat
National Marine Sanctuaries - Established three new National Marine Sanctuaries in Washington, Florida and Hawaii protecting one of the most diverse marine mammal faunas in North America, a critical link in the Pacific flyway, and the winter breeding home of the largest Pacific population of endangered humpback whales.
Salmon Habitat - Negotiated groundbreaking agreements with Oregon, Maine and California to develop state conservation plans to protect dwindling populations of salmon.
The agreements provided additional protections for the majestic fish to prevent them from being listed under the Endangered Species Act.
Atlantic Striped Bass - Developed successful program to rebuild populations of Atlantic striped bass.
After years of decline and low abundance, the number of striped bass have reached an all-time high, resulting in a fourfold increase in angler participation in the last six years.
Whale Sanctuaries - Fought for and achieved the creation of a new 12 million square mile whale sanctuary off the coast of Antarctica-which, combined with an adjacent Indian Ocean sanctuary, is home to three-quarters of the worlds whales.
Restoring the Everglades - Undertook, with the State of Florida, the most ambitious environmental restoration plan in history.
Since 1993, over $700 million in Federal funding has been secured for Everglades restoration.
The project has utilized innovative and flexible restoration approaches to protect and restore the water quality of South Florida.
Coastal Wetland Restoration - Working with the State of Louisiana to restore lost or altered coastal wetlands.
Currently there are 14 restoration projects underway in the state that total to over 65,000 acres (100 square miles).
The projects range from freshwater diversions, hydrologic restoration, barrier island restoration, shoreline protection and wetland creation.
Gray Whales - Removed the North Pacific gray whale from the Endangered Species list in 1999, one of the Endangered Species Acts success stories.
The gray whale was listed as endangered throughout its range in 1970.
As a result of ESA protection, the species has fully recovered.
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary - Established the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which includes 2,800 square miles of ocean off the Florida Keys, in cooperation with the State of Florida.
To protect the biodiversity of Americas most significant coral reef ecosystem, the Sanctuary used an innovative marine zoning approach, designating 21 areas free from consumptive use.
Already, we are seeing more fish and increased biodiversity in the area.
Sea Turtle Protection - Developed, with the shrimp fishing industry, a device that allows sea turtles to escape from shrimp nets.
This device, called a Turtle Excluder Device, or TED, has reduced the number of turtles captured by this fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts by an estimated 40,000 per year.
We have also provided technical expertise and training to over 40 nations on installing and using TEDs in their shrimp nets to reduce accidental drowning of sea turtles in foreign shrimp trawl fisheries.
