"Today, we stand before a monument to heroism, bravery and compassion," said Fire Chief James Sewell, during the dedication ceremony.
"We stand before a tribute to men and women who thought it was more important to serve others, than themselves, who believed in risking their lives so that others could live."

Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, Luther Fincher of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, Local 27 President Paul Harvey and other dignitaries were present.
Chief Wesley Goss, who has worked on the project for more than three years, hosted the program.
Lt. Bill Elleby, who tirelessly worked for months planning the memorial dedication, rang the bell as Chief Sewell read the names of the 34 firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty.
The names of the fallen firefighters are etched in the slabs of granite that make up part of the memorial.
Dedication of the $225,000 memorial was the high- light of this year's Fire Festival, which included entertainment, crafts, food and a parade of fire apparatus.

NEW EMS TEXTBOOKS
By Training Division Staff
The Fire Department recently distributed new EMS textbooks to all companies and divisions.
Prehospital Emergency Care, Fifth Edition, published by Brady was suggested by King County EMS.
The book was reviewed and approved by the Fire Department and Dr. Copass.
In addition to containing updated information, Prehospital Emergency Care meets the standards for the U.S. Department of Transportation's Basic EMT curriculum.
The May-June Bi-Monthly EMS Test will be postponed to give members an opportunity to get acquainted with the new EMS book.
The old Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured (the orange book) will remain in the library for a short time.
This will allow members to compare information between the old and new books.
If you have any questions about the new book, please call Lieutenant Thaddeus Z. Mercer at 6-1774.
Lt. Mercer is available Tuesday through Friday during normal business hours.

SAFETY OFFICER CERTIFICATION
By Leslie Jackson (with assistance from Chief David Daniels)
The Health and Safety Office has been busy during the past two months.
In addition to the Pre-Incident Survey Program, the Health and Safety Officers are hard at work on several other projects, including Health and Safety Officer Certification.
Chief David Daniels has set up a Health and Safety Officer Certification project team, which includes representatives from Local 27 and Labor and Industries.
The team's ultimate goal is to make the Seattle Fire Department the first in the nation with certified Health and Safety Officers.
This process includes the following: * Reviewing NFPA 1521 Standard for Fire Department Safety Officer, to assure that the Department meets the highest possible state and national standards * Reviewing and modifying the existing Safety Officer Operating Instructions * Establishing curriculum to meet these standards and developing written policies to support the qualification process
When this team is finished, our Health and Safety Officers will have city, state and national certification, as well as International Fire Service Accreditation Congress approval.
This is just another step that the Health and Safety Office is taking to emphasize further education and awareness of safety issues, which ultimately benefits the entire Department.

BUSIGN
LEARN NOT TO BURN
By Lisa Van Horn
The summer season brings with it a rise in child-set fires.
Children are out of the structured school environment and spend more time in unsupervised activities.
FireStoppers, the Department's Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Program, is busy during the summer months helping children who have used fire inappropriately.
Referrals to the program come from parents, fire incident reports, police reports, social service agencies, schools and the juvenile court.
Last year, the program assisted over 30 families to put an end to their children's fire-setting behavior.
In an effort to raise awareness among parents about the importance of keeping fire-starting materials out of the reach of children, the Department is participating in a regional campaign entitled "Kids Can Have a Burning Curiosity."
Using materials developed under a grant from St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma, the campaign includes television Public Service Announcements which will run through the months of July and August on local and national affiliates.
A media event is set to kick-off the campaign on June 30, at Fireman's Park in Tacoma.
Parents of high-risk children are also being targeted through Seattle preschools, day care centers and Head Start programs with a combined approach of awareness activities and prevention materials.
Funding is being sought for an accompanying bus sign campaign to run in the fall.
Any questions or referrals about children and fire should be directed to the Public Education Section of the Fire Marshal's Office.
Lisa Van Horn, Fire-Stoppers Program Administrator, can be reached at 386-1335.

HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION: SERVICE AWARDS
By Ginger James
The Human Resources staff has been working hard to do a better job of recognizing the dedication and commitment of employees by making timely presentations of service awards.
About two years ago, several things came together that made it possible to dramatically reduce the time involved in recognizing employees for their years of service.
The HR Division was given control over ordering and stocking the actual service awards, eliminating the lengthy process of ordering through City Personnel.
In addition, the Department's improved access to database software made it possible for the HR Division to use new procedures and to contact members directly june#4 regarding their service awards preference, rather than going through the Battalions.
(photo) A Valuable Resource: Tricia Connolley and Colleen Lafferty are responsible for making sure SFD members are recognized for their years of dedicated service.
Colleen Lafferty noted that the pins came from the City rather than the Department.
If anything, it was more important to us as a Department to do something to recognize our own employees.
To address this problem, Colleen designed a beautiful certificate and certificate holder from the Department.
Tricia Connolley, a Temporary Employee in the Human Resources Division, has done an excellent job of maintaining the new program.
Here is how the process works right now: About a month before a five year anniversary, you will receive a memo from Human Resources asking you about your choice of award.
In the month in which your anniversary occurs, we prepare a certificate and give both items - the pin and the certificate to the appropriate Chief Officer for his or her delivery to you.
(If you fail to send us back the memo indicating your preference, we pick an award for you).
If the award is for 25 or 30 years of service, Chief Sewell presents the award.
Assistant Chiefs recognize employees for 15 or 20 years of service, and Battalion Chiefs make the presentation for 5 or 10 years of service.
Remember, service breaks impact the calculation of years of service.
At this point, the system is working well, except that it is often hard for the Chief Officers to present the awards.
Particularly in Operations, it is difficult to schedule the delivery of the awards due to disabilities, vacations, etc.
This is complicated by emergency responses during the lunch hour (the time we try to schedule the presentations).
We are working to make continuous improvement in the system because PEOPLE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE.
Recognition and appreciation are basic to putting this value into action.
One final note, if you have been waiting for a service award for longer than two months, you should check with your Chief Officer to see if the award is enroute to you.
If it is not, please contact us in Human Resources so that we can arrange sending the award to you.

phoneweb What I would like to ask is why the Department has two different scenarios for transfers? I read the letter in the last newsletter from Chief Ramsey and I would like to know why it is different for specialty units than it is for other units.
Chief Brown told me that it should be the person with the letter in first, then the seniority in that position.
I put in a letter for 10's and got denied and I think it is bad precedence that you are going to promote somebody into a position instead of allowing the Depart-ment to put in for that spot.
I was one of only two people who put in for that position and I just don't think it is a fair practice or good for morale when you ask for transfer letters and then deny people before the process is even started.
Thanks and hopefully, you will answer my question.
Response from - Steven Brown, Assistant Chief, Administration
The Department and Local 27 are presently working with an "Employee Involvement Committee" in regard to transfers.
The process is focusing on developing criteria for two different types of transfers: Specialty Teams and Regular Assignments.
This issue is being reviewed because of the very problems that you have identified.
When the committee finishes its recommendations, these issues should be resolved.
The specific answer to your question is that the committee, Local 27 and the Department will agree upon a transfer policy that will make transfers as objective as possible.
This may or may not have different scenarios for different types of transfers.
The policy on transfers should be finalized within the next few months.
If you were given conflicting information, I apologize and hope that this issue will be resolved shortly.

frontline news from THE FRONT LINES...
BATTALION 2
By Chief Michael Johnson
Battalion 2, Platoon B, has been planning a series of multiple company drills.
Captain James Hargett, L4/B, is planning a drill at the old Naval Reserve Building on the south shore of Lake Union.
Lt. Joel Andrus, L10/B, is setting up a drill at the old Craftsman Press Building off Fairview Avenue North.
The emphasis of the drills will be to train less experienced Acting Battalion Chiefs on the basics of Incident Command, crew rotation, running a staging area and performing the duties of a Division Supervisor.
Hopefully, other Platoon Chiefs will put emphasis in this area as a great deal of experienced Chief Officers are eligible to retire.
Senior Operations Chiefs need to share their experience and know-how with the Incident Commanders of the future.
What better way is there to do this than by allowing the Captains and Junior Battalion Chiefs the opportunity to manage realistic training exercises.
BATTALION 3
By Scott Andersen
Chief Pritchard has just returned from Las Vegas, attending the first annual International Association of Fire Chiefs EMS sectional meetings.
Issues relating to Fire Base EMS and managed care highlighted the event.
Physio Control has donated two Lifepac 500 Automatic External Defibrillators to the Medic Two program.
Our Medic Two instructors are familiar with public access defibrillator training and are available to teach the general public with the new chain of survival line which is early defibrillation.
Medic One is about to initiate a Bike Medic Program.
An evaluation of other bike medic programs throughout the country has shown that there is a place for such a program in Seattle.
Quicker access to potential victims of medical emergencies at outdoor events and good public relations will, without a doubt, benefit the Fire Department.
BATTALION 4
By Captain Randy Hansen
Pier 91 Update: As many of you are aware, Pier 91 has been undergoing substantial demolition and renovation, the latest of which is the removal of rotting timber decking and pilings along the west wall (closest to the new marina).
The majority of the bad decking has been removed and exposed pilings will be removed beginning June 15th after the fish closure.
For those with pre-fires on this structure, this pertains to Berths K, L, 
Should we have a fire at this portion of the pier, utmost caution should be observed as there are still condemned portions of the pier to the South (sprinkler area #23) where the decking is still in place, but very structurally unsound.
Under no circumstances should anyone be allowed inside the condemned areas.
Smoke conditions and prevailing winds may make easy recognition of these areas difficult so "watch out."
BATTALION 5
By Chief Richard Schultz
Battalion 5 Companies in several platoons have been working on developing procedures for establishing decontamination corridors at emergency incidents, as well as outside of hospital emergency rooms.
They were challenged initially to construct decontamination corridors using only the equipment currently carried on the standard apparatus in-ventories.
Additionally, they were encouraged to recommend any additional equipment which would enhance our ability to do this more efficiently.
One suggestion, the addition of 50 rafter hangers and some smaller tie ropes, has met with a very positive response.
We are continuing to evolve the ideas into a standard method for not only decontamination corridors, but also a number of other uses.
Lt. Greg Bennett, E28/B, and some other department members have forwarded a suggestion to create another SFD yearbook.
In addition, they are willing to form a committee to get the project started.
Call Greg with ideas or to volunteer your services to help with this worthwhile project.
BATTALION 6
By Chief Kenneth Tipler
Community Involvement: Battalion 6 is the home of much community involvement.
Recently, B6 and members of Station 17 visited the Fremont Neighborhood Association monthly meeting.
During the meeting, Mayor Paul Schell acknowledged the fire department's participation and invited citizens to visit their local fire stations as he, himself, has.
E39 and FIU investigator Tony Little attended the Lake City Neighborhood Block Watch Association.
Both organizations expressed their satisfaction with the SFD and overall delivery of city services.
Family Day: Sundays have evolved into family day at Station 17.
Each Sunday, the families of the on-duty shift are invited to have dinner at the station and each Sunday, the groups seem to grow larger.
It appears that the neighborly attitude of the community has spilled over into the Fire Stations.
Training: As the equipment and methodologies for our first line units change, it is becoming increasingly important to emphasize cross training.
It is not unusual to find B6 Truck Companies giving Engine Companies refresher training on such equipment as the Amkus rescue tool, air bags or operating the PPV fans.
Engine Companies are in turn giving refresher training to truckies on Forward and Reverse lays and coupling drills.
This is typical of the cohesiveness of the Firefightin' Sixth.
BATTALION 7
By Chief Robert Davis and Chief Brian Lord
Battalion 7 and particularly E36 just completed another successful year with our P.I.P.E. partner, Gatewood Elementary School.
We transported 182 students and 13 adults to tour the Fire Boats, Station 5 and the Fire Alarm Center.
These were students who excelled academically and earned these trips as rewards.
june#5 Holy Rosary Rededication: Chief Brian Lord, B7/D, and Rex Guichard, E29/A, represented the Seattle Fire Department at the re-dedication ceremonies of Holy Rosary Church in West Seattle on May 31.
Holy Rosary suffered a long smoldering fire in the attic area of the church one Sunday evening last summer.
All of the Chief officers at the scene that evening felt that the firefighters responding on this alarm did a yeoman's job.
Chief Lord wanted to relay to those members of A platoon and any others working at the fire that day the gratitude of the members of Holy Rosary Church.

letter dude WE LIKE TO RECEIVE
The following are excerpts of recent letters to the Seattle Fire Department:
"We would like to thank Captain Raul Angulo, Chris Quinlen and Mike Bastrom for preventing the raging fire next door from doing any serious damage to our house...
After the fire had been put out, Raul and his crew were very concerned about the neighbors and checked up on us a number of times.
We would like to say thank you for saving our house and showing concern for the neighborhood..."
--Craig and Betty Leonard
"I am writing to let you know about the terrific firefighters we met at Station 5 on a tour...
Our group provides support for families of children struggling with childhood cancer.
Due to the health concerns facing our kids, I couldn't give your people a head count until a few days before the event...
Your crews handled it in stride and gave each one of our little ones the personal attention they deserve...
Please extend to them our gratitude for making this event a wonderful experience for our kids...
--Kathleen A. Barry, Seattle Candlelighters CCF
"...We know the Seattle Fire Department brought their world class expertise to bear on the situation.
At this point, Craig will pull through but we lost Teresa early this morning.
You did everything in your power at the scene and succeeded in bringing her back for two precious days.
Teresa's family all live in the Midwest and it meant a great deal to come to Seattle to say goodbye before she passed on.
Thank you for your professionalism and dedication to a tough job.
We are so grateful.
--The Family and Friends of Teresa and Craig
"I wish to express my appreciation and admiration for the firefighters and paramedics at Station 10 who recently hosted me for dinner and allowed me to accompany them on an emergency call...
I witnessed this crew engage in extraordinary efforts to assist a man who had been shot repeatedly...
At all times, these firefighters were professional and focused on the task of helping the victim.
My experience reminded me of what a hard job (both mentally and physically) we as a City ask our firefighters to do.
The staff on duty during my visit deserve any accolades and commendations that come their way...."
