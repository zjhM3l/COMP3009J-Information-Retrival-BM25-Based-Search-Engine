Waterways Our waterways and seaports are a critical part of our nation's transportation infrastructure.
Important not only to the shipping and recreation industry, waterways have also played a crucial role in the development of settlements, and later, cities.
Floridas waterways provide an efficient and economic corridor for moving more than 2 billion tons of the nation's domestic and foreign commerce.
They also serve as a vital link in the industrial production process by providing a low-cost method of shipping and receiving goods.
In Northeast and Central Florida, the stability and continued maintenance of the St. Johns River, Ponce de Leon Inlet and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway have been important priorities for Congressman Mica.
Currently, Rep. Mica is working with both State and federal agencies to ensure that these channels maintain appropriate water depth levels.
