Serving America in Iraq and on the Homefront (Texas) -- National Park Ranger Jason Lott is anxious to get back to work.
He is the Integrated Resource Management Specialist at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park in Texas.
In January of this year, Captain Jason Lott of the Army Reserves out of Fort Polk, Louisiana accepted another job - defending his country.
Jason went on active duty in January and then to Iraq where he has been since this past March.
Captain Lott recently notified his wife that " I should be home in the next week or two and I'm very anxious to return to you, the kids AND my job."
Jason's wife Wendy worked seasonally for the park as an interpretive park ranger and has the same academic credentials as her husband.
The park was able to convert her to a part time position as Interpretation and Resource Management Specialist.
She has done a masterful job filling in for Jason during his military leave...while being both mommy and daddy to two very energetic children.
The historical symmetry for the park was provided by Mrs. Johnson who ran her husband's Congressional office during his active duty in the Navy Pacific campaign during WWII.
A small story, but one that reflects the substance of many people who still fill the ranks of the National Park Service.
Jason is one of several National Park Service employees who have been called up to active duty and put their careers on hold to defend this nation.
In addition to protecting and defending our natural and cultural resources here at home, dedicated NPS professionals like Jason are doing their part in the war on terrorism abroad.
For more information about Jason Lott, contact Leslie Hart at (830) 868-7228.

Public Opinion Sought on Options for Commemorating Gullah People (Georgia) -- The NPS is seeking public comments on a study outlining options for commemorating the Gullah culture that has survived on the southeastern U.S. coast since colonial times.
"Congress authorized this special study three years ago to identify ways to honor a distinct group of Americans who are descendants of enslaved Africans from the west and central agricultural regions of Africa," said Patricia A. Hooks, the Service's acting southeast regional director.
"Because of their geographic isolation and strong sense of community, they were able to preserve and maintain a language, arts, crafts, religious beliefs, rituals and foods that are links to their west African roots."
Gullah people (also known as Geechee in Georgia and Florida) occupied the low country along the southeastern coast from the Cape Fear River in North Carolina to the St. John's River in northern Florida.
Although many rural Gullah communities still exist, their survival is increasingly threatened by resort and housing developments along with changing job markets and population shifts.
Comments on the draft study will be accepted through Feb. 1, 2004.
The document is available at public libraries throughout the study area and on the web at www.nps.gov/sero/ggsrs/gg_res.htm.
Limited copies also are available by contacting Cynthia Porcher, Charles Pinckney National Historic Site, 843-881-5516.

Wintering Over at Fort Clatsop (Oregon) -- From December 27 to 29, Fort Clatsop National Memorial will be hosting "Fixed Snugly in their Huts: The Corps of Discovery Winters Over at Fort Clatsop."
This first-person living history program and reenactment will offer visitors an opportunity to meet members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition as they have just moved into the fort.
Visitors are urged to bring items to trade with members of the Corps and be prepared to barter.
"We encourage people, and especially children, to think about who the members of the Corps are, their journey so far, that it is winter and a long way from home," said Chip Jenkins, the park's superintendent.
"The bartering offers a terrific way to learn about the expedition and to get involved in the program."
In the past, visitors have brought everything from food and clothing to beaver traps to barter.
The program will run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day.
This park commemorates the 1805-06-winter encampment of the 33-member Lewis and Clark Expedition.
A 1955 community-built replica of the explorers' 50'x50' Fort Clatsop is the focus of the park.

Relive the March-In of the Continental Army (Pennsylvania) -- By nightfall on December 19, 1777, thousands of continental soldiers had arrived at Valley Forge and established camp.
On December 19th, 2003, from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m., Valley Forge National Historical Park will commemorate the 226th anniversary of the army's arrival.
Guided tours by lantern light will offer stories of soldiers, officers, and civilians and take visitors back to this historic moment in time.
Of all the places associated with the American War for Independence, perhaps none has come to symbolize perseverance and sacrifice more than Valley Forge.
The hardships of the encampment claimed the lives of one in ten.
Despite the privations suffered by the army at Valley Forge, Washington and his generals built a unified professional military organization that ultimately enabled the Continental Army to triumph over the British.
For additional information, call the park at (610) 783-1077.

Helping Costa Rica Preserve Biological Wonders One of Costa Rica's "crown jewels" is Corcovado National Park, located on the Osa Peninsula in the southwest (Pacific side) corner of the country.
Home to the largest remaining lowland forest in Central America (it is often compared to the Amazon rain forest in general appearance), it protects a wealth of biological diversity unusual even in as "bio-rich" a country as Costa Rica.
The park has one of the largest populations of jaguars in Central America, and it is not unusual to find their tracks on the ocean beaches.
The bird-life is particularly stunning.
It also offers one of the most exciting eco-tourism opportunities in the neo-tropics.
Unfortunately, Corcovado National Park faces many threats -- mostly from outside its boundaries.
Located on a peninsula, the park risks being cut off from other protected areas on the mainland by increased development.
With funding provided by the Costa-Rica-USA Foundation (CRUSA), the U.S. National Park Service has been providing technical assistance to the Costa Rican National Park Service at Corcovado.
This expertise is helping Costa Rican resource managers develop a new general management plan to preserve the resources of Corcovado and its sister area -- Cano Island National Park.
For more information on Corcovado National Park, check out the website listed below or read its recent World Heritage Nomination form at www.corcovadofoundation.org.

The Fox or the Eagle (California) -- Endangered foxes within Channel Islands National Park are in danger of extinction.
On Santa Cruz Island, the fox population went from about 1,500 to fewer than 100 in less than a decade.
So few foxes remained in the wild on Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands that biologists decided to bring them into captivity in hopes of saving them.
Breeding programs are underway on all three islands and, just two weeks ago, a handful of foxes were released on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa, San Miguel and part of Santa Cruz Island are part of Channel Islands National Park, where park scientists have been struggling to restore native animals and vegetation by removing nonnative species.
Park managers hope that captive breeding of foxes on all three islands will increase their populations.
The down side of the story is that the foxes are the prey of Golden Eagles, also an endangered group.
The National Park Service is trying to determine if golden eagles should be removed from the island to protect the foxes.
Park officials have not yet determined if golden eagles must be removed, and that any such decision would require considerable study.
Making the task even more difficult, the three fox subspecies are candidates for protection under the Endangered Species Act while the golden eagle is protected by two other federal acts.

2003 National Freeman Tilden Award Recipient Park Ranger Amy Garrett, from Homestead National Monument of America in Beatrice, Nebraska, recently received the Freeman Tilden Award for her creative and innovative distance-learning program that connects students in classrooms with park rangers in real-time, spontaneous interaction via fiber optics.
Her use of innovative technology reaches beyond this memorial to the pioneers who settled the west into classrooms of Nebraska bringing the students direct interaction with park rangers and other park professionals.
The award was created by the National Park Service (NPS) and the National Parks Conservation Association to stimulate and reward creative thinking and original programming activity among NPS interpreters which, when delivered, results in positive impacts upon the heritage resources of the NPS and the visiting public.

Day of the Condor (California) -- Staff at Pinnacles National Monument are getting ready to release six juvenile California Condors into the wild.
They've been in lockup for nearly two years, but in less than three weeks they'll be sprung from "the pen."
Wildlife biologists at Pinnacles National Monument are gearing up to free the California Condors that were hatched in captivity at the condor breeding facility in the San Diego Wild Animal Park and transferred to San Benito County in September.
For two and half months, the six rare birds, already with nine-foot wingspans, have been acclimating well to their mountainous surroundings from a large pen covered with netting.
Sometimes they cling to the net with their four-inch talons and flap - a sure sign they are ready to soar.
At noon on Dec. 19, the birds' caretakers will begin the release process.
Normally releases are remote and off limits, but Pinnacles rangers are inviting the public to watch this historic first release from a nearby valley at the park, which, they warn, will be a long hike from parking.
For more information about this story contact Pinnacles National Monument at (831) 389-4485.
