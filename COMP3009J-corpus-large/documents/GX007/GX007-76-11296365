Address List Map Review ALMR A January 1998 program that asked local and tribal government officials to review Census Bureau maps to identify incorrect and missing map features and names so that the Census Bureau could update the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database in time for the address listing operation.
They also were asked to record address ranges for any street segments that used city-style mailing addresses and to identify city-style address breaks for streets and roads that intersected the legal boundary.
Address List Review See Local Update of Census Addresses. address listing AL A Census 2000 field operation to develop the address list in areas with predominantly noncity-style mailing addresses.
A lister entered, in an address register, the address and/or a physical/location description for each living quarters within a specified area.
The lister marked the location of each residential structure on a block map by drawing a map spot and assigning a map spot number.
The lister also updated and corrected the map if necessary.
Called "prelist" for the 1990 census.
address listing page An individual page in an address register, with either no entries or preprinted addresses and related information.
address range The lowest and highest address numbers used to identify structures along each side of a street segment that has city-style addresses.
The Census Bureau usually expands the range to include all possible numbers, not just the existing ones (for example, the Census Bureau may expand the actual addresses of 105, 111, 123, and 131 on the odd-numbered side of a street to 101-199).
Usually, an address range on one side of a street contains only even or only odd numbers, but sometimes it contains both.

Address System Information Survey ASIS A Census Bureau survey, conducted by telephone in 1993 and 1996, to determine the type of mailing addresses used in a county or, in New England, an incorporated place or minor civil division.
It applied to geographic entities that, according to the Census Bureau's records, used city-style addresses for fewer than 95 percent of their residential mailing addresses, or that previously reported that part of the entity was served by noncity-style mailing addresses.
The purpose of the ASIS was to determine the most effective method of enumerating each geographic entity for Census 2000.

It prepares publications, such as the Statistical Abstract of the United States, and provides external customers with links to American FactFinder.
Advance Census Report ACR An unaddressed short-form questionnaire delivered by U.S. Postal Service letter carriers in advance of the actual enumeration in list/enumerate areas.
Enumerators picked up completed ACRs, checked them for completeness and consistency, transferred the responses to standard census questionnaires, and completed any missing information or entire questionnaires if necessary.
These were used for the 1990 census, but only in the Island Areas for Census 2000.
advance letter The Census Bureau sent an advance letter to alert households that the census questionnaire would be sent or delivered to them soon (for every area except list/enumerate and update/enumerate areas).
The advance letter enabled households to request a questionnaire in certain languages.
See reminder card.

ASCII American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
The most common format for text files in computers and on the Internet.
Computers "read" ASCII codes, each of which can be represented by a 7-digit binary number from 0000000 through 111111, and produce them as letters, numbers or symbols; 128 possible characters are defined.
ASCII was developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). apportionment There are two definitions for this term:
The process of dividing the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50 states based on the decennial census.
See reapportionment, redistricting.
A distribution by the Office of Management and Budget of funds available for obligation in appropriation or fund accounts of the Executive Branch.
The distribution makes funds available on the basis of time periods (usually quarterly), programs, activities, projects, objects, or combinations thereof.
The apportionment system is intended to achieve an effective and orderly use of federal funds.
See appropriation, authorization, and continuing resolution.
apportionment calculation
The mathematical calculation to determine congressional representation by each state following a decennial census
.The apportionment calculation uses the method of equal proportions.
The calculation is based on the total resident population (citizens and noncitizens) of the 50 states.
For some censuses, including Census 2000, the population includes U.S. Armed Forces personnel and federal civilian employees stationed outside the United States (and their dependents living with them) who can be allocated to a home state.
The populations of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Island Areas are not included in the calculation.
apportionment counts The first data product from the decennial census is the apportionment population for each state and the number of representatives each state is entitled to based on the apportionment calculation.
appropriation An act of Congress that allows federal agencies to incur obligations and make payments from the U.S. Treasury for specified purposes.
An appropriation is the most common means of providing budget authority, and usually follows the passage of an authorized bill.
See apportionment, authorization, and continuing resolution.
assignment area AA A small geographic area, usually a block or group of blocks, established by the Census Bureau as a basic unit for data collection by a single enumerator, lister, or other field staff.
AAs may be combined into field assignments for some operations.
Formerly called an address register area (1990 census) and an enumeration district (earlier censuses).
See assignment area map, collection geography, field assignment.
assignment area locator map AA locator map See locator map. assignment area map AA map A map that shows the area assigned to a member of the field staff for a specific census operation.
The map displays the individual roads, streets, and nonstreet features (and their names, if any); selected legal boundaries; and, if appropriate, the city-style address ranges of the roads and streets and the census collection block numbers within and adjacent to the AA.

Automated Address Range Program AARP A program for achieving a consistent address/block number relationship between field-verified city-style addresses in the Master Address File and the address ranges in the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database.
The AARP expanded address ranges to include all possible addresses on each side of a street segment.
automated data processing ADP The data processing operations performed by a system of electronic or electrical machines.
Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument ALMI A post-census 2000 system of files and software used by the Census Bureau to enable regional office field staff to update the address information in the Master Address File (MAF) and the street, address location, and related information in the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database for an area.
The field staff use laptop computers to view address and map information derived from the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database and the MAF, and to record updates and corrections to those files.
(There will be separate versions of the ALMI for use by staff at headquarters and in the regional offices.)
As of spring 2002, the ALMI has three assignment types: "Update block," for which staff are assigned specified blocks to canvass in order to find and record addresses not in the MAF, correct and unduplicate information for the addresses recorded in the MAF, record or correct the approximate location of each address, and update and correct street/road information.
"Locate address," for which staff are assigned specific addresses recorded in the MAF.
Using the ALMI, they can display a map for a specific block, nearby blocks, and, if necessary, an overview or "locator" map of a county, census tract, governmental unit, etc., in an effort to try to find each address on the ground.
They record in the ALMI the approximate location of each address that they find, identify addresses currently in the MAF that do not seem to exist or that duplicate another recorded address, and update and correct the address records and street/road information.
"Find growth," for which staff are assigned an area suspected to contain new residential development.
If they find new housing, they identify the census tract(s) and block(s), which will comprise a future "update block" assignment(s).
The primary intercensal users of the ALMI are the American Community Survey, other Census Bureau surveys, and the Local Update of Census Addresses Field Verification operation.
The ALMI also may be used for incorporating into the MAF and the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database the updated information developed from other field operations, such as special censuses.
See Group Quarters Automated Instrument for Listing.
Automated Master Address File Geocoding Office Resolution AMAFGOR A computer match that attempts to geocode city-style addresses in the Master Address File after street features, names, address ranges, and ZIP Code information have been inserted into the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database using digital files from a governmental or commercial source.

See address, city-style address, house-number-and-street-name-address, and mailing address.
Be Counted enumeration and Be Counted questionnaire BC The Be Counted program provided a means for people who believed they were not counted to be included in Census 2000.
The Census Bureau placed unaddressed census questionnaires (Be Counted questionnaires) at selected sites that were easily accessible to and frequented by large numbers of people.
The questionnaires also were distributed by the Questionnaire Assistance Centers and in response to requests received through Telephone Questionnaire Assistance.
Be Counted/ Telephone Questionnaire Assistance Field Verification BC/TQA FV An operation that verified the existence and residential status of addresses given to the Census Bureau by the Be Counted and Telephone Questionnaire Assistance programs.

A boundary generally must include at least one addressable feature; that is, usually a street or road.
The boundary of every legal and statistical entity recognized in the Census Bureau's standard data tabulations is a tabulation block boundary.
See census block, collection block, and tabulation block.
Block Boundary Definition Project BBDP A program like the Block Boundary Suggestion Project.
It applied only to Puerto Rico.
Block Boundary Suggestion Project BBSP The first phase of the Census Bureau's Public Law 94-171 programthe Redistricting Data Programthat provided an opportunity for state officials to identify map features that they wanted the Bureau to recognize as block boundaries for the decennial census.
They also could identify 1) features they did not want held as block boundaries; 2) features they wanted held as block boundaries on a contingency basis, such as the imaginary extension of a street to a city limit if that legal boundary did not change by January 1 of the census year; and 3) the legal location of the boundaries of state legislative districts.
See Block Boundary Definition Project, Block Definition Project, Redistricting Data Program.
block canvassing A Census 2000 field operation to ensure the currency and completeness of the Master Address File within the mailout/mailback area.
Listers traveled in their assignment areas to collect and verify information to ensure that their address listing pages (derived from the Master Address File) contained a mailing address for every living quarters.
They especially looked for hidden housing units (such as attics, basements, or garages converted into housing units) and houses that appeared to be one unit but actually contained multiple housing units.
They also updated and corrected their Census Bureau maps.
Formerly called precanvass, Targeted Canvassing, and Targeted Multi-Unit Check.
See blue line and canvass.
block cluster A single block or a group of blocks, varying in size depending on the requirements of each census operation or survey.

It applied only to federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, 1990 census tribal jurisdiction statistical areas, and the District of Columbia.
block group A statistical subdivision of a census tract.
A BG consists of all tabulation blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a census tract; for example, for Census 2000, BG 3 within a census tract includes all blocks numbered between 3000 and 3999.
The block group is the lowest-level geographic entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates sample data from the decennial census.
See tribal block group.
block locator map A Census Bureau map that displays a census block and a substantial amount of surrounding area, to help users, such as field staff, identify where the block is located and determine an efficient route of travel to the block.
See locator map. block map A large-scale map of a single census collection block, showing roads, streets, and other features, together with their names (if any) within and adjacent to the block.
Field staff use block maps to guide them in their canvass of each block, to annotate map changes, and, in some areas, to mark (map spot) and number the location of each residential structure.
See assignment area map, block locator map, block number, collection block, and map spot.
block number A number assigned to each census block.
For collecting information for Census 2000, each census block was identified uniquely within a county (or statistically equivalent entity) by a 4- or 5-digit number.
All the collection blocks in a county used the same number of digits.
As a result of changes to the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database after the Census Bureau had numbered the blocks in preparation for the Census 2000 field operations, the number could have an alphabetic suffix, to represent one portion of a physical block that was split by an added street or road or by the addition or change of the boundary of a county, American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, or military installation; for example, if an added street bisected Block 1005, the block was split into Blocks 1005A and 1005B to represent the portion of the orignal collection block on each side of that street.
For tabulating data for Census 2000, each census block was identified uniquely within a census tract by a 4-digit number.
A 1990 census block number had three digits, with a potential alphabetic suffix.
The first digit identifies the block group in which the census block is located.
See block group, census block, collection block, and tablulation block.
block numbering area BNA Prior to Census 2000, a statistical subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated by a state government agency or Census Bureau regional census center for the purpose of grouping and numbering census blocks in counties (and statistically equivalent entities) that did not have census tracts.
BNAs were discontinued for Census 2000; they were replaced by census tracts in every county and statistically equivalent entity.
blue line A boundary that defined the extent of the area covered by the block canvassing operation, and later was included in the mailout/mailback and urban update/leave enumerations.
Most mailing addresses inside the blue line use a house number and street name.
boarded up A housing condition in which the doors or windows of a building have been covered to prevent destruction or entry.
borough A legal entity in Alaska that the Census Bureau treats as statistically equivalent to a county; a minor civil division in each of the five counties that comprise New York city; a type of incorporated place in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
See governmental unit.
boundary A line that identifies the extent or limit of a geographic entity, such as a census block, census tract, county, or place.
The legal boundaries the Census Bureau recognizes for a census are those in effect on January 1 of the census year.
See block boundary.
Boundary and Annexation Survey BAS A survey of all counties and statistically equivalent entities, all or selected incorporated places and minor civil divisions, all or selected federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land, and Alaska Native Regional Corporations, to determine the location of legal limits and related information as of January 1 of the survey year.
See Consolidated Boundary and Annexation Survey.
boundary change The establishment, relocation, or deletion of a boundary.
For legal entities, boundary changes are reported to the Census Bureau in a state, local, or tribal government's response to a Boundary and Annexation Survey, through a periodic or occasional survey to collect boundary information for a specific set of geographic entities, as an adjunct to obtaining other information about an area (such as updated street pattern or address information), or by some other reliable source.
For statistical entities, boundary changes are provided in preparation for a specific census in response to the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program or some other specific boundary collection program.
The boundaries of legal entities are changed due to legal actions, whereas statistical entities may be changed by appropriate reviewers to reflect population growth or decline, or because of revisions either to visible or legal features used as boundaries or to Census Bureau procedures.
A boundary change also can occur due to an error in recording a boundary for one census or survey, and showing it correctly for the next.
Boundary Validation Program BVP A Census Bureau followup to the Census 2000 Boundary and Annexation Survey that enabled local and tribal government officials to review and correct (but not update beyond January 1) the January 1, 2000 legal boundaries, and to add and correct city-style addresses at the point where streets and roads intersected the legal boundary.
The Census Bureau conducted this program from June through August 2000.

census tract A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated for data presentation purposes by a local group of census data users or the geographic staff of a regional census center in accordance with Census Bureau guidelines.
Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time they are established, census tracts generally contain between 1,000 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.
Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being stable over many decades, so they generally follow relatively permanent visible features.
However, they may follow governmental unit boundaries and other invisible features in some instances; the boundary of a state or county (or statistically equivalent entity) is always a census tract boundary.
See block numbering area, tribal census tract.
census tract number A 4-digit basic number, followed by an optional 2-digit decimal suffix, used to identify a census tract uniquely within a county or statistically equivalent entity.

Census Unedited File CUF The Decennial Response File, the file containing all responses to Census 2000, is processed using the Primary Selection Algorithm.
From this file, two files are created: the Census Unedited File, which contains the individual responses to the short-form questionnaires, and the Census Unedited File - Sample, which contains the individual responses to the long- form questionnaires.
The long form, received by approximately one in six households nationwide, included the short-form questionnaire items and additional questions.
The CUF is used to generate apportionment data as well as related "raw," or unedited, census data.
central city In a metropolitan area (MA), the largest place and, in some areas, one or more additional places that meet official standards issued by the federal Office of Management and Budget.
If a place extends beyond an MA, only the portion within the MA is a central city.
A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have a central city.
central place In an urban area (urbanized area or urban cluster), the largest place and, in some areas, one or more additional places that meet specific Census Bureau criteria.
If a place is identified as an extended place, only the portion within the urban area represents the central place.
For an urban area that does not contain an incorporated or census designated place, there is no central place, and the title of the urbanized area or urban cluster uses the name of a minor civil division, or a local place name recognized by the Board on Geographic Names and recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey.
check-in An operation that records a census response into a computer database.
Every type of response (mailed-in questionnaire, telephone response, Internet response, or enumerator interview response) is checked in at a data capture center.
See check-in rate.
check-in rate Questionnaires checked in at the four data capture centers represented the initial step for processing responses to Census 2000.
Check-in at the data capture centers was an operation designed to record receipt of census questionnaires into a database for control and workflow management.
It provided an estimate of the scanning workload.
The check-in count of questionnaires included all mailed-in questionnaires, including responses from mailout/mailback, update/leave, and the Be Counted Program, and enumerator interview responses, including list/enumerate, update/enumerate, and Nonresponse Followup.
The check-in count also included questionnaires returned as undeliverable-as-addressed by the U.S. Postal Service.
Some questionnaires included in check-in may be duplicate forms from the same household, blank forms, and the like; because questionnaires from all of these sources constitute the questionnaire scanning workload, the Census Bureau does not reduce the check-in count by the number of unusable questionnaires.
city A type of incorporated place in all states and the District of Columbia.
In Virginia, all cities are not part of any county, and the Census Bureau treats them as county equivalents as well as places for purposes of data presentation; there also is one such independent city in each of three states: Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada.
In 23 states and the District of Columbia, some or all cities are not part of any minor civil division, and the Census Bureau treats them as county subdivisions as well as places for purposes of data presentation.
In agreement with the state of Hawaii, the Census Bureau does not recognize the city of Honolulu for presentation of decennial census data.

The lower the CV, the higher the relative reliability of the estimate.
collection block A physical block enumerated as a single geographic area, regardless of any legal or statistical boundaries passing through it.
(Note: State, county, American Indian area, and military base boundaries, as recorded in the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database at the time of assigning numbers to collection blocks, are always block boundaries.)
See block number, census block, and tabulation block.
collection geography The geographic entities used by the Census Bureau for taking a census.

Group quarters may have housing units on the premises for staff or guests.
See embedded housing unit, freestanding housing unit, group quarters enumeration, housing unit, and special place.
Group Quarters Automated Instrument for Listing GAIL Post-Census 2000 software that enables regional office and headquarters staff to use laptop computers to record address, location, and related information about group quarters and special places in the Special Place/Group Quarters Master File, which is subsequently reflected in the Master Address File and, often, in the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database.
During the Census Bureau's post-Census 2000 current surveys, when the Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument (ALMI) encounters a group quarters, it automatically requests the GAIL so information can be reviewed and recorded for the facility.
The GAIL can be used for other programs without reference to the ALMI when the Census Bureau updates information only for group quarters.
Eventually, the GAIL will be accessed automatically to record information about group quarters found during other Census Bureau operations.
See Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument, Demographic Area Address Listing, group quarters, special place.
group quarters enumeration A method of data collection designed to count people living or staying in group quarters.
Enumerators visit each special place, list the names of the people living or staying in the group quarters (including staff who live or stay there), and leave an Individual Census Report for each person or a staff member to complete.

HQDP operations include the headquarters check-in and followup control activities for census data. heterogeneity Heterogeneity occurs when housing units assigned to sampling strata or groupings do not have equal chances of being included or missed by a census or survey.
Heterogeneity creates difficulty for the small-area estimation process because the correction factor is applied to all people with the specified characteristic in that sampling poststratum even though some of them do not actually have the coverage characteristics.
See homogeneity.
highest elected official HEO The elected or appointed person who is the chief executive official of a governmental unit and is most responsible for the governmental activities of the governmental unit, such as the governor of a state, chair of a county commission, or mayor of an incorporated place.
Historic Areas of Oklahoma A term used in the 1980 census for an area encompassing the former American Indian reservations that had legally established boundaries during the period 1900 through 1907, but were dissolved during the 2- to 3-year period preceding the establishment of Oklahoma as a state in 1907.
It excluded territory within urbanized areas delineated for the 1980 census.
The 1980 census tabulated data for this entity, which was replaced for the 1990 census by tribal jurisdiction statistical areas.
See Oklahoma tribal statistical area.
homogeneity Homogeneity assumes that all people in a particular sampling stratum or poststratum have an equal chance of being included or missed by a census or survey.
A lack of homogeneity in a particular sample block is not an error, but it does create difficulty for the small-area estimation process.
This happens because the correction factor is applied to all people with the specified characteristic in that poststratum even though some of them do not exhibit the same coverage characteristic.
See heterogeneity. hotels, motels, and other facilities Hotels, motels, and other facilities for which vouchers are provided or that operate under contract to provide shelter to people without housing are included in the service-based enumeration.

identification number See census identification number.
imputation The assignment of values by the Census Bureau when information is missing or inconsistent.
Imputation relies on the tendency of households of the same size within a small geographic area to be similar in most characteristics.
For example, the value of "rented" is likely to be imputed for a housing unit not reporting on owner/renter status in a neighborhood with multi-unit structures for which other respondents reported "rented" on the census questionnaire.
There are two major types of imputation: 1) allocation, in which missing values for individual items are entered on the basis of other reported information for the person or household (or from other persons or households with similar characteristics) and 2) substitution, in which all of the information for a person or household is created from other persons or households with similar characteristics.
