New for Consumers Release Date: May 2002 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE FLYING Although September 11th changed many of the rules of flying, some questions remain the same -- How can you get the cheapest fares? What should you do if you're "bumped" from a flight? What can you do about lost tickets or baggage? What about cancelled flights? Learn how to protect yourself with a package from the Federal Consumer Information Center.
First, get the facts on your rights as an airline passenger with Fly Rights from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Then, find out how to stay safe and comfortable during your travels with Fly Smart from the Federal Aviation Administration and Travel Smart - Travel Safe from the U.S. Department of State.
Keep these tips in mind when you fly:
Most airlines overbook their flights to compensate for no-shows.
If your flight remains overbooked, you may voluntarily give up your seat and negotiate with the airline representative to get a later flight and compensation such as another free flight later, or upgrades to first class.
If you are involuntarily "bumped" from your flight and you had a confirmed reservation, meet the airline's ticketing and check-in deadlines, and your replacement flight arrives more than an hour after your scheduled flight, you could be eligible for monetary compensation, free flights, and more
.
There are three easy ways to get your publications.

CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT
Are you are a parent - divorced, separated or never married - with children to support? Do you need help to collect child support from the other parent who has been ordered to pay?
The Handbook on Child Support Enforcement (Item 505J, free) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services can help you get what your child deserves.
The process of obtaining child support begins at your local child support enforcement (CSE) office.
Generally run by the states, CSE programs are found in your telephone directory, usually under the state/county social services agency.
They are also listed in the back of the Handbook.
Learn more about your rights in getting child support, including health insurance and how to work across state lines, with the Handbook on Child Support Enforcement.
