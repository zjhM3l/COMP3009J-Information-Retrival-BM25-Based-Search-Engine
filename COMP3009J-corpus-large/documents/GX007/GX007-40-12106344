Summary of Evidence
Note: Separate PDQ summaries on Screening for Colorectal Cancer; Colon Cancer Treatment; and Rectal Cancer Treatment are also available.
High Fat Diet
Epidemiologic, experimental (animal), and clinical investigations suggest that diets high in total fat, protein, calories, alcohol, and meat (both red and white) and low in calcium and folate, are associated with an increased incidence of colorectal cancer.
Levels of Evidence
3aii: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group, that have a cancer incidence endpoint.
4aii: Ecologic (descriptive) studies that have a cancer incidence endpoint.
Fiber, Fruits, and Vegetables
Cereal fiber supplementation and diets low in fat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, however, do not reduce the rate of adenoma recurrence over a 3-year to 4-year period.
Level of Evidence
1b: Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed and conducted randomized controlled trial that has a generally accepted intermediate endpoint (adenomatous polyps) for studies of colorectal cancer prevention.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including piroxicam, sulindac and aspirin may prevent adenoma formation or cause adenomatous polyps to regress in individuals with prior colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps and in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis.
Levels of Evidence 1b: Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed and conducted randomized controlled trial that has a generally accepted intermediate endpoint (adenomatous polyps) for studies of colorectal cancer prevention.
3ai,3aii: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group that have cancer mortality and cancer incidence endpoints.

Significance
Incidence and Mortality
Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant neoplasm worldwide [1] and the second leading cause of cancer deaths (irrespective of gender) in the United States.[2]
Between 1985 and 1995, colorectal cancer incidence rates in the United States declined by 1.8% per year, but stabilized during 1995-1999.
Over the past 15 years, the mortality rate declined by 1.7% per year.[2] The overall 5-year survival rate is 62.1%.
About 6% of Americans are expected to develop the disease within their lifetime.[3] The risk of colorectal cancer begins to increase after the age of 40 and rises sharply at the ages of 50 to 55; the risk doubles with each succeeding decade, and continues to rise exponentially.
Despite advances in surgical technique and adjuvant therapy, there has been only a modest improvement in survival for patients who present with advanced neoplasms.[4,5] Hence, effective primary and secondary preventive approaches must be developed to reduce the morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer.
Definition of Prevention
Primary prevention involves the identification of genetic, biologic, and environmental factors that are etiologic or pathogenic in the development of cancer, and subsequent complete or significant interference with their effects on carcinogenesis.
Removal of premalignant lesions (adenomas) may also be an effective form of primary prevention.
Etiology and Pathogenesis of Colorectal Cancer
Genetics,[6,7] experimental,[8,9]
It has been suggested that dietary factors may be responsible for a significant but poorly quantitated number of cancer cases.[12] Efforts to identify causes and to develop effective preventive measures have led to the hypothesis that adenomatous polyps (adenomas) are precursors for the vast majority of colorectal cancers.[13]
Large flat and depressed lesions are more likely to be severely dysplastic.
Specialized techniques may be needed to identify, biopsy, and remove such lesions.[14] In effect, measures which reduce the incidence and prevalence of adenomas may result in a subsequent decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer.[15]

Evidence of Benefit
Dietary Factors and Chemoprevention
The studies reviewed below include those on adenomas; special note is made if a study applies to adenomas only.
Dietary Fat and Meat Intake
Colon cancer rates are high in populations with high total fat intakes and are lower in those consuming less fat.[1] On average, fat comprises 40% to 45% of total caloric intake in high-incidence Western countries; in low-risk populations fat accounts for only 10% of dietary calories.[2]
In Japan, an increased risk of colon cancer with increased frequency of meat consumption was observed in the group with infrequent vegetable consumption among a group of 265,000 men and women.[8] In Norway, an increased risk for processed meat only was found,[9]
A population-based case-control study in Sweden, however, found no evidence of increased risk associated with total HCA intake; for colon cancer the relative risk was 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-1.0), and for rectal cancer it was 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.1).[16,17]
Explanations for the conflicting results regarding whether dietary fat or meat intake affects risk of colorectal cancer [10] include (a) validity of dietary questionnaires used; (b) differences in the average age of the population studied; (c) variations in methods of meat preparation (in some instances, mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines could have been released at high temperatures [18]
Six case-control studies and 2 cohort studies have explored potential dietary risk factors for colorectal adenomas.[21,22] Three of the 8 studies found that higher fat consumption was associated with increased risk.
High fat intake has been found to increase the risk of adenoma recurrence following polypectomy.[23] In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial, a diet low in fat (20% of total calories) and high in fiber and fruits and vegetables did not reduce the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.[24]
Bile Acids
A central effect of bile acids in the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer has been claimed.[25] An increased bile acid concentration in the intestinal tract accompanies a high-fat diet since bile acids are released from the gallbladder after fat ingestion.
The concentration of bile acids in the colon is heavily influenced by the amount and type of fat in the diet.[26] The potential mechanism of action of bile salts in colorectal carcinogenesis is unknown, although it has been suggested that it is mediated by diacylglycerol.[27]
It is proposed that diacylglycerol enters the cell directly, stimulating protein kinase C which is involved in intracellular signal transduction.
Dietary Fiber, Vegetables, and Fruit
The evidence on whether dietary fiber exerts a protective role in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer is mixed.
Most animal and epidemiologic studies show a protective effect of dietary fiber on colon carcinogenesis.[28] The term fiber is used to describe a complex mixture of compounds including insoluble fiber (typified by wheat bran and cellulose) and soluble fiber (usually dried beans).
Ingestion of fiber could modify carcinogenesis in the large bowel by a number of potential mechanisms.[29-31] These mechanisms include binding to bile acids, increasing fecal water and possibly diluting carcinogens, and decreasing transit time (not an obvious factor).
Fiber may act as a substrate for bacterial fermentation with a resultant increase in bacterial mass and the production of short chain fatty acids, typified by butyrate.[31] Butyrate has been shown to have anticarcinogenic effects in vitro and is regarded as an important fuel for the colonic epithelium.[32,33]
The inverse association with fiber was observed in 12 of the 13 studies and was similar in magnitude for left-sided and right-sided colon and rectal cancers, men and women, and different age groups.
It has been suggested that the inverse association with fiber may be reflective of some other closely associated dietary constituents, such as the anticarcinogens found in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and grains.[5,34] These substances include phenolic compounds, sulfur-containing compounds and flavones.[35,36]
Other studies have corroborated the effects of dietary fiber.
One study used a supplement of 10 g/day of wheat bran, cellulose and oat bran, and found a decreased mutagenic activity of fecal contents in those receiving wheat bran and cellulose supplementation, although no measurable inhibition was observed during oat bran supplementation.[37] Fecal-total and secondary bile acid excretion increased during oat fiber supplementation.
Despite the evidence from case-control studies of a protective effect, results from the large prospective NursesÃ¯Â¿Â½ Health Study found no difference in risk of colorectal cancer between women in the highest compared to lowest quintile group with respect to dietary fiber, after adjusting for age, known risk factors, and total energy intake (relative risk = 0.95; 95% CI 0.73-1.25).[38]
Many epidemiologic studies have examined the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and the incidence of colon and/or rectal cancer,[39] with considerable variation in findings.
Perhaps the most definitive analysis to date is a prospective study that examined dietary intake data based on food frequency questionnaires from 88,764 women in the Nurses Health Study and 47,325 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.[40] The study included 
Based on analyses adjusted for numerous covariates, the authors found no association in women or men between overall fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of colon or rectal cancer.
Neither were associations observed when the data were examined for subgroups of fruits or vegetables (with the exception of legumes, which were associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in women) or individual fruits or vegetables (with the exception of prunes, which were associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in men).
Results did not change when data were examined by vitamin use status, smoking status, or family history of colorectal cancer, nor were elevated risks seen when individuals with very low levels of fruit and vegetable consumption were compared to those with the highest levels.
For women and men combined, the covariate-adjusted relative risk of colon cancer associated with 1 additional serving of fruits and vegetables per day was 1.02 (95% CI 0.98-1.05); the comparable relative risk for rectal cancer was 1.02 (95% CI 0.95-1.09).
In a population-based prospective cohort study of 61,463 women in Sweden, individuals who consumed very low amounts of fruits and vegetables (less than 1.5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day) had a relative risk for developing colorectal cancer of 1.65 (95% CI 1.23 - 2.2, p trend = 0.001) as compared with those individuals who consumed greater than 2.5 servings.
However, there was little evidence of a benefit for higher as compared with moderate consumption (greater than versus less than 3.5 servings).
Limitations of this study are that dietary intake during the study period was not reassessed over time and the influence of physical activity could not be accurately determined.
In addition, the conclusion about very low amounts of intake of fruits and vegetables is based on a retrospective subdivision of the lowest quartile of consumption and its strength has not been adjusted for other potential confounding factors.[41]
Six case-control studies and 3 cohort studies have explored potential dietary risk factors for colorectal adenomas.[21,22,38] Four of the 9 found an association of fiber, carbohydrates and/or vegetables with reduced risk.
In 1 study, cases with moderate or severe dysplasia had a significantly lower intake of cruciferous vegetables than those with mild dysplasia.
No significant effect of dietary fiber on colorectal adenoma was found in the large cohort study of U.S. nurses.[38]
High-fiber cereal supplements over a 3-year period did not result in a decrease in adenoma recurrence in a randomized, controlled trial of 1,303 individuals.[42] In a multicenter randomized, controlled trial, a diet low in fat (20% of total calories), high in fiber (18 g of dietary fiber per 1,000 kcal) and fruits and vegetables (3.5 servings per 1,000 kcal) was not associated with a reduction in risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.[24]
Calcium
It has been hypothesized that orally ingested calcium lowers colon cancer risk by binding bile acids and fatty acids, thereby reducing exposure to toxic intraluminal compounds.[43] Indirect effects on bile acid metabolism and a direct effect on colonic epithelial cells are also possible.
Several [44-47] but not all [22,48]
Interpretation of these studies can be quite complex.
For example, in Utah, an inverse relationship between colon cancer and calcium was observed in a study that compared members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and Seventh Day Adventists with a group from the U.S. population at large.
Both study groups have higher calcium intakes, mainly milk and dairy products, than the national average.
Unlike the Seventh Day Adventists, however, the Mormon group had a consumption of meats and fat similar to that of the general population.
Experimental studies in rodents [49] and some but not all human studies [50-53]
Human studies using labeling index are dependent on a complex methodology.[54] A randomized placebo-controlled trial tested the effect of calcium supplementation (3 g calcium carbonate daily (1200 mg elemental calcium)) on the risk of recurrent adenoma.[55]
A modest decrease in risk was found for both developing at least 1 recurrent adenoma (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99) and in the average number of adenomas (ARR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96).
The investigators found the effect of calcium was similar across age, sex, and baseline dietary intake categories of calcium, fat, or fiber.
The study was limited to individuals with a recent history of colorectal adenomas and so could not determine the effect of calcium on risk of first adenoma, nor was it large enough or of sufficient duration to examine risk of invasive colorectal cancer.
The results of other ongoing adenoma recurrence studies are awaited with interest (Table 1).
It is important to note that the dose of calcium salt administered may be important; the usual daily doses in trials have ranged from 1,250 to 2,000 mg of calcium.
Postmenopausal Female Hormone Supplements
Several epidemiologic studies have suggested a decreased risk of colon cancer among users of postmenopausal female hormone supplements.[56-59] For rectal cancer, most studies have observed no association or a slightly elevated risk.[60-62]
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
The clinical utility of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) results from their ability to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX).
COX is important in the transformation of arachidonic acid into prostanoids, prostaglandins, and thromboxane A2.
NSAIDs include not only aspirin, first-generation nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2, but newer second-generation drugs that inhibit primarily COX-2.
The 2 functional isoforms of COX, termed COX-1 and COX-2, play important roles.
Normally, COX-1 is expressed in most tissues and primarily plays a housekeeping role, e.g., gastrointestinal mucosal protection and platelet aggregation.
COX-2 activity is crucial in stress responses and in mediating and propagating the pain and inflammation that are characteristic of arthritis.[63]
Nonselective COX inhibitors include indomethacin (Indocin); sulindac (Clinoril); piroxicam (Feldene); diflunisal (Dolobid); ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin); ketoprofen (Orudis); naproxen (Naprosyn); and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox).
Selective COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib (Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and valdecoxib (Bextra).
Several but not all epidemiological studies have reported a reduction in colon cancer incidence associated with the use of aspirin.
<
Among a group of over 600,000 adults enrolled in an American Cancer Society study, mortality in regular users of aspirin was about 40% lower for cancers of the colon and rectum.[64,65]
.[] A population-based retrospective cohort study of nonaspirin NSAID use among individuals aged 65 and older was also associated with lower risk, particularly with increasing durations of use.[68]
There was no reduction in invasive cancers or adenomas at a median follow-up of 4.5 years.[69] In a subsequent analysis over a 12-year period, both randomized and observational analyses indicated that there was no association between the use of aspirin and the incidence of colorectal cancer.
The low dose of aspirin and the short treatment period may account for the null findings.[70]
In a randomized study of 635 patients with prior colorectal cancer (T1 to T2 N0 M0) who had undergone curative resection, aspirin intake at 325 mg/day was associated with a decrease in the adjusted relative risk of any recurrent adenoma as compared with the placebo group (0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91) after a median duration of treatment of 31 months.
The time to the detection of a first adenoma was longer in the aspirin than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for the detection of a new polyp, 0.54, 95% CI 0.43-0.94, P=.022).
Harms of treatment included upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke.[71] In a study of 1,121 patients with a recent history of colorectal adenomas, after a mean duration of treatment of 33 months, the unadjusted relative risks of any adenoma (as compared with the placebo group) were 0.81 in the 81 mg aspirin group (95% CI 0.69-0.96) and 0.96 in 325 mg aspirin group (95% CI 0.81-1.13).
For advanced neoplasms (adenomas measuring at least 1 cm in diameter or with tubulovillous or villous features, severe dysplasia or invasive cancer), the relative risks were 0.59 (95% CI 0.38-0.92) in 81 mg aspirin group and 0.83 (95% CI 0.55-1.23) in 325 mg aspirin group.[72] Harms of treatment were similar in the 2 groups and included upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.
Several studies, conducted in a rigorous manner, have demonstrated the effectiveness of sulindac in reducing the size and number of adenomas in familial polyposis.[73,74] In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 77 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, patients receiving 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day had a 28.0% reduction in the mean number of colorectal adenomas (P= .003 for the comparison with placebo) and a 30.7% reduction in the polyp burden (sum of polyp diameters; P= .001) as compared with reductions of 4.5% and 4.9%, respectively, in the placebo group.
The reductions in the group receiving 100 mg of celecoxib twice a day were 11.9% (P= .33 for the comparison with placebo) and 14.6% (P=.09), respectively.
The incidence of adverse events was similar among the groups.[75]
The NSAID piroxicam, at a dose of 20 mg/day, reduced mean rectal prostaglandin concentration by 50% in individuals with a history of adenomas.[76] Several studies are in progress assessing the effect of aspirin or other nonsteroidals on polyp recurrence following polypectomy.[28]
The potential for the use of NSAIDs as a primary prevention measure is being studied.
However, there are several unresolved issues that mitigate against making general recommendations for their use.
These include a paucity of knowledge about the proper dose and duration for these agents, and concern about whether the potential preventive benefits such as a reduction in the frequency or intensity of screening or surveillance could counterbalance such long-term risks as gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhagic stroke for the average-risk individual.[77]
Vitamins
In a prospective cohort study of 35,215 Iowa women, an inverse association between the risk of colon cancer and vitamin E intake was found; the relative risk for the highest compared to the lowest quartile was 0.3 (95% CI 0.19-0.54).[78] In a population-based case-control study, an inverse relationship between vitamin D intake and risk of colorectal cancer was found.[79]
Ongoing studies of dietary and other interventions in the chemoprevention of colorectal neoplasia are listed in Table 1.

Other Factors
Physical Activity
A sedentary lifestyle has been associated in some [82,83] but not all [84]
There are numerous observational studies that have examined the relationship between physical activity and colon cancer risk.[85] Most of these studies have shown an inverse relationship between level of physical activity and colon cancer incidence.
The average relative-risk reduction is reportedly 40% to 50%.
However, it is not known if or to what degree the observed association is due to confounding variables, such as diet or a genetic predisposition to colon cancer.
In a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer among Chinese men and women in Western North America and China, colon and rectal cancer risk was elevated among men employed in sedentary occupations in both continents.[86] Further, the association between colorectal cancer risk and saturated fat was stronger among the sedentary than among the active population.
Perhaps related to physical activity, body mass was found to be correlated with rectal cancer in men in an Australian study [84] and with colorectal cancer in men in Sweden.[87]
Obesity is associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of colorectal cancer in premenopausal women.[88]
Alcohol Consumption
There is evidence of an association of colorectal cancer with alcoholic beverage consumption.
In a meta-analysis, this association was weak.[89] In another review, statistically significant elevations of risk were found in males, particularly in regard to beer consumption and rectal cancer.
It is hypothesized that alcohol may act to stimulate mucosal cell proliferation, to activate intestinal procarcinogens and possibly provide a source of unabsorbed carcinogens that can reach the distal large bowel.[90] Subsequently published case-control studies suggest a modest-to-strong positive relationship between alcohol consumption and large bowel cancers.[91,92]
Five studies have reported a positive association between alcohol intake and colorectal adenomas.[93] A case-control study of diet, genetic factors, and the adenoma-carcinoma sequence was conducted in Burgundy.[94]
A positive association between current alcohol intake and adenomas was found to be limited to the larger adenomas suggesting that alcohol intake could act at the promotional phase of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.[94]
Cigarette Smoking
Most case-control studies of cigarette exposure and adenomas have found an elevated risk for smokers.[21] In addition, a significantly increased risk of adenoma recurrence following polypectomy has been associated with smoking in both men and women.[21]
A large population-based cohort study of Swedish twins found that heavy smoking of 35 or more years duration was associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk of developing colon cancer, although subsite analysis found a statistically significant effect only for rectal but not colon cancer.[98] Another large population-based case-control study supports the view that current tobacco use and tobacco use within the last 10 years is associated with colon cancer.
A 50% increase in risk was associated with smoking more than a pack a day relative to never smoking.[99] However, a 28-year follow-up of 57,000 Finns showed no association between the development of colorectal cancer and baseline smoking status, although there was a 57% to 71% increased risk in persistent smokers.[100]
Polyp Removal
The National Polyp Study showed a greater than 75% reduction in the subsequent incidence of colorectal cancer after colonoscopic polypectomy compared with 3 nonconcurrent, external control groups.[102]
Fecal Occult Blood Testing
The Minnesota randomized trial of fecal occult blood tests investigated reduction in incidence of colorectal cancer.
Nearly 85% of subjects with a positive test underwent diagnostic procedures that included colonoscopy or double-contrast barium enema plus flexible sigmoidoscopy.
After 18 years of follow-up, the incidence of colorectal cancer was reduced by 20% in the annually screened arm and 17% in the biennially screened arm.[103]
