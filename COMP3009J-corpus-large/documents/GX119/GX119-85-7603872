IMMEDIATELY 1.
REPORT THE INCIDENT TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY: A person who believes they are a victim of an Identity Theft is encouraged to promptly report those facts to a law enforcement agency.
In New Jersey a victim can report an Identity Theft to the Office of the County Prosecutor of the county where the theft is believed to have taken place, or to the local police department.
The address and telephone number for the County Prosecutor's Office and the local police department can be found in the blue government pages of your local telephone directory, under "County Government" and "Local Government."
Those law enforcement agencies are responsible, in the first instance, for investigating such offenses and for developing the necessary evidence to pursue the matter as a criminal prosecution, if the facts warrant.
Once a report has been filed, request a copy of the report so that it will be available to send to credit reporting agencies and creditors.
2.
KEEP COMPLETE RECORDS: Become a record keeper! Keep detailed notes and records of all telephone conversations with credit reporting bureaus, creditors or debt collection agencies.
Confirm all telephone conversations, in writing.
Keep copies of all correspondence sent and received.
Send correspondence by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Keep a record of the time spent and any expenses you incurred, in case you can request restitution in a later judgment or conviction against the thief.
3.
OBTAIN A COPY OF YOUR CREDIT REPORT FROM THE CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS: Fraud victims are entitled to a free credit report.
Therefore, a person who believes they are the victim of Identity Theft should obtain a copy of their credit record.
Carefully review the entire credit reporting record.
Any errors or actions that are suspect or fraudulent should be immediately submitted to ALL of the credit reporting agencies.
A list of those agencies is found below.
4.
NOTIFY ALL OF THE CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS: Report the theft of any credit cards or credit card numbers to each credit reporting agency.
Request that all your accounts be "Flagged with a fraud alert."
Submit a written victim statement to be included in your credit report stating: 1) Your identity has been stolen and has been used to apply for credit fraudulently.
2) Provide a contact telephone number to verify any credit applications.
3) Request all applications for credit be confirmed telephonically to the telephone number you have given, and then have those requests confirmed in writing to your address.
Ask each credit reporting bureau to do the following: 1) Inform you how long the fraud alert will remain posted to your file; and how you can extend the alert, if necessary.
Be aware that reporting an identity theft to a credit reporting bureau may not stop an identity thief from opening new fraudulent accounts in your name.
Therefore, a victim should request a free copy of their credit report from each credit reporting bureau every few months in order to monitor any new fraudulent activity.
2) Inform you of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of any credit grantor with whom fraudulent accounts have been opened.
Request the credit reporting bureau remove inquiries that they have generated due to the fraudulent access.
3) Notify all those who requested and received your credit report in the last six months that the information they received, in your credit report, is disputed.
Confirm all of these requests, in writing, to each credit reporting agency notified.
