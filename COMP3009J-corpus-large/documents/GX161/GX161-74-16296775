Notes on Riparian and Watershed Management
EPA ISSUES ANNUAL REPORT 1992 ON THE WATERSHED PROTECTION APPROACH
EPA's Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds has recently released its 1992 annual report on the watershed protection approach.
The report summarizes EPA's strategy and the progress made in promoting a watershed protection approach over the last year, and The steps taken at EPA headquarters to implement the strategy.
It contains a summary of watershed activities in the field, beginning with the steps that EPA's regions have taken to support watershed protection and concluding with brief descriptions of individual watershed projects.
An appendix references pertinent EPA funding sources that could support watershed protection efforts.
The introduction clearly sums up the rationale behind the watershed protection approach and EPA's role as follows:
What is the watershed protection approach (WPA)? The watershed protection approach is an integrated, holistic strategy for more effectively restoring and protecting aquatic ecosystems and protecting human health (e.g., drinking water supplies and fish consumption).
This approach is a renewed effort by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to focus on hydrologically defined drainage basins--watersheds--rather than on areas arbitrarily defined by political boundaries.
Thus, for a given watershed, the approach encompasses not only the water resource, such as a stream, river, lake, estuary, or aquifer, but all the land from which water drains to that resource.
To protect water resources, it is increasingly important to address the condition of land areas within the watershed because as water drains off the land, it carries with it the effects of human activities throughout the watershed.
By concentrating on natural resources and systems, it is possible to detect and take remedial action for such problems as declines in living resources and habitat loss.
The watershed protection approach has three major cornerstones: 1.
Problem Identification - Identify the primary threats to human and ecosystem health within the watershed.
2.
Stakeholder Involvement - Involve the people most likely to be concerned or most able to take action.
3.
Integrated Actions - Take corrective actions in a comprehensive, integrated manner once solutions are determined.
Evaluate success and refine actions, as necessary.
This approach places greater emphasis on all aspects of water quality, including chemical water quality (toxics and conventional pollutants, e.g., fecal coliform and total phosphorus), physical water quality (e.g., temperature, flow, and circulation), habitat quality (e.g., channel morphology, composition, and health of biotic communities), and biodiversity (e.g., species number and range).
The approach encompasses all waters - surface and ground, inland and coastal.
This approach is not a new centralized program that competes with or replaces existing programs; rather it provides a framework and new focus for effective integration of ongoing programs.
In taking this expanded approach, EPA must work closely with other stakeholders who have responsibilities in this area.
Why is a watershed protection approach needed? Although significant strides have been made in reducing the impacts of discrete pollutant sources and billions of dollars have been spent to build wastewater treatment plants, the nation's aquatic resources remain at risk.
Today's challenges include resolving the significant pollution problems that come from literally millions of diffuse or nonpoint sources, maintaining safe drinking water supplies, and restoring and protecting aquatic habitats.
These challenges require innovative solutions and, in a time of dwindling public resources, cooperation among many parties.
The watershed protection approach provides the necessary framework for meeting these challenges.
The approach emphasizes the involvement of all affected stakeholders and stresses the need for teamwork at the federal, state, and local levels to achieve the greatest improvements with the resources available.
A wide variety of sectors are expressing interest in watershed protection, including all levels of government, private businesses, academics, environmental groups, and individual citizens.
The watershed protection approach provides comprehensive methods for identifying, tailoring, and implementing the solutions needed to protect and restore the nation's aquatic resources.
Who can benefit and why? Everyone - individual citizens, the public sector, and the private sector - can benefit from a watershed protection approach.
Individual citizens benefit because watershed protection improves the environment.
The public sector benefits because agencies can accomplish more through cooperation with all stakeholders than they can on their own with limited resources.
Participation by local entities ensures that those who are likely to be most familiar with a watershed, its problems, and possible solutions play a major part, often a leadership role.
Users of the water resources (for example, industry, agriculture, and recreation) benefit because one of the intents of the approach is to distribute the burden of water resource protection more evenly among all stakeholders.
In communities across the United States, effective watershed management can lead to more environmentally sensitive and sustainable economic growth and development.
Because watershed management brings all parties to the table, the potential exists for greater consideration to be given to protecting and restoring vital natural resources during planning for new development.
What is EPA's role? EPA's overall goal for the watershed protection approach is "to maintain and improve the health and integrity of aquatic ecosystems using comprehensive approaches that focus resources on the major problems facing these systems within the watershed context."
To meet this end, EPA has identified the following objectives: + Align EPA programs to support risk-based watershed planning and management.
+ Promote the use of the approach by its partners in other federal, state, and local agencies.
+ Address the primary threats to ground and surface waters.
+ Promote stewardship and a broad understanding of and participation in the approach by the public.
+ Effectively measure progress toward restoring, maintaining, and protecting our nation's waterbodies and aquatic habitats.
In pursuing its overall goal and related objectives, EPA encourages and advances watershed protection at all levels of government and is actively involved in watershed partnerships when appropriate.
EPA's Office of Water develops technical tools to assist communities in adopting watershed protection approaches, promotes the watershed protection approach concept through various outreach activities, and works inside and outside of EPA to align its programs to better complement the approach.
EPA'S STRATEGY
The report indicates that EPA is pursuing a five-pronged strategy for adopting watershed management.
The components of the strategy are: 1.
Try it out 2.
Develop tools 3.
Advertise it 4.
Measure success 5.
Align programs
An EPA headquarters support team has been convened with representatives from the four parts of the Office of Water (Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water; Office of Science and Technology; Office of Wastewater Enforcement and Compliance; and Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds.)
The support team is to serve the regions and states, as well as local and nongovernmental entities, in pursuing watershed protection approaches.

BRINGING BACK COASTAL WETLANDS: THE SCIENCE OF RESTORATION - A REVIEW
EDITOR'S NOTE: This review was originally published in the February 1993 issue of "Marine Notes", the newsletter of the Maryland Sea Grant College.
The authors of the review are are Garry F. Mayer, chief of the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Habitat Research and Restoration Division, Restoration Center, and Peter Hill, a policy analyst and planner at the restoration center.
Thank you, Sandy Harper, editor of "Marine Notes."
*****
The tale of wetlands in the United States is a tale of massive loss --from salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and mangrove stands to tidal flats, kelp forests, and coral reefs.
Over the last 200 years, wetland acreage in the continental United States has steadily dwindled from some 200 million acres to an estimated 95 million; about one-third of those remaining are coastal in nature.
If human activity has been the cause of much of this wetland loss, a good deal of human activity, namely in far-reaching scientific efforts, is at work to find out how such diverse ecosystems can best be restored.
At all levels of government, programs to help preserve and protect these habitats are now in place; moreover, they have been complemented by efforts to restore or recreate coastal systems that have been destroyed or impaired by human activities.
"Restoring the Nation's Marine Environment", published recently by Maryland Sea Grant, covers a range of ongoing restoration efforts in the United States and abroad.
The book discusses restoration of common coastal habitats--salt marshes, tidal flats, seagrass beds, kelp forests, and coral reefs--and of habitats impacted by special problems--urbanized estuaries, diverse habitats impacted by logging, and fisheries habitats destroyed by hydroelectric dam construction.
Questions remain, however: Just how well do these restored habitats function in comparison with the natural habitats? Can we expect them to flourish on their own for decades to come?
Tracking the Causes of Loss
A variety of factors account for the loss of coastal and estuarine habitats.
Agriculture, transportation, construction and general urbanization, industry, logging, and aquaculture all physically disrupt the landscape and reduce environmental quality.
Habitats are also affected by clearing, draining, diking, filling, dredging, and shoreline stabilization.
Further effects result from water diversions and other hydrologic alterations, nutrient enrichment, changed water clarity, toxic substances from spills, and pollutants from chronic point and nonpoint sources.
All such human-induced changes are often compounded by natural occurrences--storms, climate alteration, coastal subsidence, sea level rise, disease, and the appearance of new or exotic species.
Along the nation's coasts from Florida to Virginia to California, studies have identified and tallied wetland losses.
In California, they range from 70 percent to 90 percent.
In Washington State, eight out of 12 Puget Sound estuaries showed losses of 30 percent or more.
Heavily urbanized and industrialized waterways, such as the Duwamish and Puyallup Rivers, exhibited historic reductions as great as 89.9 percent and 99.6 percent, respectively.
Mangrove and seagrass systems show similar declines.
Along the East and Gulf Coasts, widespread die-offs of seagrass remain serious problems.
The Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries, which once supported between 100,000 and 300,000 acres of eel grass (Zostera marina) and 14 other species of submerged aquatic vegetation, today contain only about 50,000 acres.
Further south, losses continue to mount: scientists estimate that approximately one-third of the seagrass meadows in coastal Florida have disappeared since the 1940s, while a loss of almost two-thirds has occurred along the Mississippi coast.
Is Restoration Enough?
Is the science of habitat restoration up to the challenge posed by coastal habitat losses that occurred in the past and that continue today? There is no unequivocal answer.
Research on the restoration of estuarine and coastal systems dates back only to the late 1950s in the United States.
Large-scale, systematic programs did not begin until the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the advent of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studies of the feasibility of creating habitat on dredged material.
As a discipline of study, restoration science in coastal and estuarine systems grew progressively in the late 1970s and burgeoned in the mid-1980s.
Today, there are hundreds of created or restored tidal marshes and mangrove forests nationwide that support diverse fish and wildlife populations.
Between 1989 and 1992, more than 800,000 acres of wetland fresh- and saltwater habitats were enhanced or restored by federal agencies nationwide.
Whether these created habitats are functionally equivalent to natural habitats, and whether they will continue to function in this manner into the foreseeable future is still an open question.
As editor Gordon W. Thayer says in "Restoring Our Nation's Marine Environment", "In the case of restored or created wetland habitats, the simple fact that they are green does not necessarily mean that they have developed into functional habitat providing services to living marine resources and to man.
In fact, there is a growing body of literature to the contrary."
When estuarine systems are lost or degraded, so are the important functions they provide--groundwater recharge and flood abatement, sediment retention and other mechanisms of shoreline erosion control, water quality improvement, trophic energy (food web) support, substrate and protective cover for fish and wildlife, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic values.
Progress Comes Slowly
The successful creation, enhancement, or restoration of habitats requires time and constant attention.
While seagrass communities may need as little as three years to become fully functional, marsh systems may take 15 or more years; mangrove habitats may take 20 to 30 years.
Under the most ideal circumstances, coral reefs can take decades to recover, and where pollution or other stresses are chronic, recovery may be postponed indefinitely.
The more complex and highly developed the habitat, the greater the time and nurturing required to ensure a successful project.
Despite the complexities of habitat restoration, laboratory and field studies have yielded techniques that take less time, are less expensive, and are less fraught with uncertainty.
For example, research in Southern California's hypersaline estuaries evaluated factors to enhance both the rate of establishment and the degree to which functional equivalence is achieved by restored cordgrass habitat (Spartina foliosa).
The addition of supplemental organic material and nitrogen to areas planted with cordgrass accelerated Spartina growth and resulted in the production of taller plants.
The addition of supplements is one of the factors needed to support the light-footed clapper rail, an endangered bird species that occurs in the area.
On the other hand, parallel experiments conducted in East Coast Spartina alterniflora habitats were not successful.
Collective wisdom says that restoration success, regardless of habitat type, is marked by careful planning.
This means selecting the most promising sites, determining the appropriate techniques to be used, and meticulous physical (and, if necessary, chemical) preparation of the sites, followed by timely planting.
Follow-up biological activities, such as the removal of unwanted, competing, or destructive biological forms until the habitats become established, are also important.
Central to any success is identification of restoration goals and the environmental factors that may limit its success.
Equally critical is a well-designed monitoring plan that remains in place over the life of the restoration, not just the early stages, to track progress and suggest corrective actions, should they be necessary.
Current studies reinforce the need for these actions.
To cite one instance, for selected species of seagrasses, experimentation has shown that site selection remains a complex problem: restoration is likely to be more effective in habitats that previously supported seagrasses; otherwise, substitution of one habitat type for another may result.
Experience further underscores the critical nature of grading potential salt marsh restoration sites with high precision: slight deviations can cause improper inundation regimes, which, in turn, can jeopardize the success of a restoration project.
Similar care must be taken in dealing with restoration sites contaminated with bioavailable toxic substances.
Advances in ecological science have enhanced our understanding of the environmental and ecological parameters needed to measure the progress and effectiveness of restoration efforts.
While the growing sophistication of instrumentation has increased the accuracy and ease of taking data, monitoring still remains among the most poorly implemented aspects of habitat restoration.
Many government agencies and industries have been unwilling to balance the cost of multi-year monitoring against savings derived from more successful and efficient restoration activities that are likely to result from improved scientific understanding.
Restoration Is Only Part of the Answer
According to Thayer, it is essential that a comprehensive evaluation of restoration, mitigation, and enhancement processes be initiated on a national scale.
Research, he says, may demonstrate that the design criteria for projects need only be improved to approach functional levels of natural habitats.
On the other hand, research may show that we cannot emulate nature as easily as has been assumed.
If this is true, then policies must take this into account.
But it is clear that restoration efforts must continue and even expand.
"The goal of no net loss cannot be attained without active programs of habitat conservation and of restoration and creation that are based on sound scientific approaches," says Thayer.
The alternative is continuing loss of ecological systems vital to environmental health.
We must place a high priority on demonstrating that habitat restoration and enhancement can be done cost-effectively with present technology.
Evidence of success will translate into support for expanding existing technologies and for developing new capabilities, such as the application of biotechnology and modern agricultural science to provide specially adapted plant stocks for large-scale undertakings.
Even restoration failures are useful for identifying habitats that are difficult to duplicate--management can then focus on conservation and land use policy for these irreplaceable habitats.
As a final step, we must educate the public about the capabilities of coastal habitat restoration.
Present expectations regarding the nature of successful restorations, the time required, and the costs associated often are unrealistic.
Regardless of restoration capabilities, it is important for all of us to understand that the future existence of coastal and estuarine habitats can best be guaranteed by avoiding habitat loss and degradation.

NORTHEAST WISCONSIN WATERS FOR TOMORROW, INC. ORGANIZES A WATERSHED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE RESTORATION
EDITOR'S NOTE: The following story was developed from a December 1992 newsletter and other material prepared by the citizens' nonprofit corporation, North East Wisconsin Waters for Tomorrow, Inc., and conversations with David White, team leader for the project.
The organization was formed with the conviction that a management program to deal with the problems of downstream Lower Green Bay could not be developed as an entity by itself.
The organization determined that a total watershed approach is necessary for the job.
*****
The Genesis of N.E.W.
Waters for Tomorrow, Inc.
N.E.W.
(North East Wisconsin) Waters for Tomorrow, Inc., is a nonprofit citizens' organization formed with a belief that cost-effectiveness (i.e. getting the biggest bang for the buck) is an important criterion in choosing strategies for reducing pollution and meeting desired water resource management objectives in the Fox-Wolf watershed and lower Green Bay region of Wisconsin.
The Fox-Wolf watershed is a 6,600 square mile area of northeastern Wisconsin extending into 12 counties.
It drains into Lake Michigan's lower Green Bay.
Much of the watershed suffers from problems such as eutrophication and contaminated sediments.
In many areas, desired conditions for recreation and habitat are not realized.
The U.S.-Canada International Joint Commission (IJC), oversees the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that the two countries signed in 1978.
In 1985, the IJC designated lower Green Bay and a section of the Fox River from its mouth to the De Pere Dam, as an Area of Concern (AOC), one of 43 around the Great Lakes.
AOCs are areas where the specific water quality objectives of the 1978 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement have not been met.
In the case of Lower Green Bay, human activities have impaired the beneficial uses of the area and reduced its ability to support aquatic life.
As a result of the 1985 recommendation of the IJC, the eight Great Lakes states and the province of Ontario committed to developing and implementing Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) to restore beneficial uses of Areas of Concern within their boundaries.
The Remedial Action Plan process represents an innovative approach to water quality management, an ecosystem-based, "bottom-up" approach to bring together diverse local interests to tackle problems affecting the beneficial uses of the water resources of the area.
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), with EPA support and intensive local involvement, produced a RAP for lower Green Bay in 1988.
David White, team leader for N.E.W.
Waters for Tomorrow, Inc., has written:
The RAP process in lower Green Bay has continued to the implementation stage.
There are many obstacles to achieving the "desired future state."
Recommendations to attain desired objectives, such as the removal of nutrients causing eutrophication, cleanup of contaminated sediments, protection and reestablishment of habitat, and enhancement of recreation, require much effort from many entities, as well as substantial funds.
The challenges to implementation are technical, social, and financial.
Attaining the objectives of the RAP requires significant financial resources, social and political will, and answers to certain technical questions.
Although many management activities are taking place throughout the watershed, it was concern for implementation of the Green Bay RAP that led a handful of Green Bay citizens to initiate North East Wisconsin Waters for Tomorrow, Inc.
On the positive side, the founders felt that the goals and objectives of the Green Bay RAP were sound, as was its ecosystem emphasis.
However, the group felt that because of the potentially high cost of implementing the RAP, dollars spent for water resources management must be spent wisely and effectively.
They also concluded that cost-effective decisions needed to be made in the context of the entire watershed.
It was evident that activities throughout the watershed contributed to the problems in lower Green Bay.
Further, they felt that the many different management efforts in the watershed, planned or underway, needed to be pulled together and related to one another.
Because little was known about how to most cost-effectively meet the goals and objectives of water resource management in the region, the founders of N.E.W.
Waters for Tomorrow hired an interdisciplinary analysis team to identify and evaluate cost-effective management strategies.
In addition to several local and national consultants, the analysis team consists of three full-time members: a resource economist, a civil engineer, and an ecologist.
The analysis team has three objectives: 1. to identify the most cost-effective measures for desired water resources conditions in the watershed; 2. to develop an analytical framework for use in the planning of water resources management in the watershed; and 3. to identify the nature and extent of uncertainties relating to water resources management in the region.
The Analysis Team Approach
The approach has two key aspects: 1.
First, it had to be future oriented.
This is because it makes sense to develop a management strategy that takes into account not only past actions and present conditions, but future problems likely to arise in a changing socio-economic-ecologic environment.
Also, attaining desired objectives takes time because actions take time to implement and the ecosystem takes time to respond.
The majority of the effort will therefore be directed toward identifying the most cost-effective measures to ensure that the objectives can be achieved and maintained.
2.
Second, the analysis must focus on the watershed in its entirety.
The analytical framework is set up to determine the most cost-effective management strategy to meet desired objectives throughout the watershed.
The effort is directed at management objectives relating to: (1) ambient water and sediment quality (i.e., phosphorus, total suspended solids, and PCBs); (2) habitat; and (3) water-based recreation.
Ongoing Activities
Currently, the analysis team is busy compiling the needed background information, much of it from previous efforts.
Ongoing work includes summarizing water resource management objectives, assessing the requirements needed to achieve those objectives, approximating the sources of water quality problems in the watershed (rural runoff, urban runoff, point sources), and projecting conditions in the watershed to 2010.
The work plan called for completion of this compilation and preliminary analysis phase by February 1993, and then spending four months analyzing the cost-effectiveness of different management strategies.
The analysis team will produce a report of the findings of the first year by July 1993.
This document will present the framework, explain the uncertainties, and provide a discussion of cost-effective management strategies required to meet desired objectives in lower Green Bay.

TROUT UNLIMITED JOINS WITH FOREST SERVICE AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT TO BRING BACK THE NATIVES
- by David A. Nolte, Trout Unlimited
EDITOR'S NOTE: David A.Nolte, a News-Notes reader from Redmond, Oregon, sent us two interesting and instructive articles the other day.
What follows is his story outlining Trout Unlimited's participation in the Bring Back the Natives program.
The program is a combined effort involving the primary managers of the public lands, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, together with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and other national partners.
Nolte is Trout Unlimited's coordinator for the program.
(For an earlier story on Bring Back the Natives see News-Notes #22 June-July 1992).
Thanks, David, for your contributions.
David's other contribution to this issue of News-Notes, on the Crooked River Watershed, can be found under Notes on Environmental Education.
*****
Bring Back the Natives
Funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Washington, D.C., this key national fisheries program is the first national campaign combining Trout Unlimited with two major federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, with partnerships including state agencies, local organizations, private businesses, citizens, and landowners.
The program is aimed at restoring the health of riverine systems and the repopulation of native freshwater species.
Currently, the program is funding 47 projects on 47 streams in 15 states.
Twenty projects directly involve Trout Unlimited chapters, including those in California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, and Arizona.
The program operates through a cooperative effort that stresses improved watershed and ecosystem management and seeks to restore the health of entire riverine systems and their native species.
The BLM manages more than 270 million acres of public lands, including approximately 175,000 miles of streams and rivers and 4.2 million surface acres of ponds, lakes, and reservoirs.
The BLM needs to expand its habitat enhancement and educational opportunities and work with a multitude of partners to accomplish management goals of fisheries that strategies such as Bring Back the Natives offers.
Successful implementation of this program will substantially benefit coldwater fish, such as bull trout, inland redband rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and various other salmonids.
Trout Unlimited, in partnership with the BLM, has established an overall program coordinator position to support the implementation and coordination of Bring Back the Natives projects.
David A. Nolte, a Trout Unlimited member residing in Oregon, has been selected for this position.
Nolte will promote and assist Bring Back the Natives projects that: * Link instream restoration with sound federal land management.
* Emphasize sustainable management, with broad resource benefits.
* Implement large, watershed-level projects.
* Convey a history of Trout Unlimited interest and involvement.
* Include active local partners and cooperators.
* Included education of the community and general public about the project and watershed.
* Meet the need for challenge grant funds.
Trout Unlimited chapters are encouraged to seek partnerships with the Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service for watershed-level projects that meet Bring Back the Natives program criteria.
