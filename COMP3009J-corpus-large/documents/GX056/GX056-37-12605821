SPECIAL EVENTS Am I Not a Sister? Date 02/10/2003 Contact Terry Roth , 814-886-6156 To honor the contributions of African-Americans and women to our nation's history, the National Park Service invites the public to attend a program that highlights the heroic work of black women during a tumultuous time in our nation's history.
Commonwealth Speaker John Burt, Esq. will present "Am I not a Sister? The Women of the Anti-Slavery Movement".
In this illustrated talk, he tells the stories of some of the most important pre-Civil War Pennsylvania abolitionists.
African American women such as Mary Myers, Henrietta Duterte, and Susan Vashon, and white women such as Lucretia Mott, Jane Swisshelm, and Madeline LeMoyne campaigned against slavery by agitating others in the media, in churches, and in politics.
They also helped fugitive slaves as they escaped from the South.
John Burt is an attorney and Adjunct Professor of Sociology at Carlow College in Pittsburgh.
He served as both a consultant and a featured speaker in "Pennsylvania's Pathways to Freedom," a television documentary on the Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania.
He has given guided tours on the subject for ten years, and lectures extensively on the history of American reform movements like the abolitionist movement.
Mr. Burt has been a popular member of the Pennsylvania Humanities Council's Commonwealth Speakers program since 1998.
This presentation is part of the celebration of Black History Month in February and Women's History Month in March.
