Go to: Guide to Business History Resources Index of Corporate America: A Historical Bibliography Â© c1984 ABC-Clio Information Services Reproduced 2001 with permission of the publisher Sources cited | Table of Contents | Catalog record and links to related information from the Library of Congress catalog __________________________________________________________________ Counter Go to: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | Y | Z | Numerals Subject Profile Index (ABC-SPIndex) carries both generic and specific index terms.
Begin a search at the general term but also look under more specific or related terms.
Each string of index descriptors is intended to present a profile of a given article; however, no particular relationship between any two terms in the profile is implied.
Terms within the profile are listed alphabetically after the leading term.
The variety of punctuation and capitalization reflects production methods and has no intrinsic meaning; e.g., there is no difference in meaning between "History, study of' and "History (study of)."
Cities, towns, and counties are listed following their respective states or provinces; e.g., "Ohio (Columbus)."
Terms beginning with an arabic numeral are listed after the letter Z.
The chronology of the bibliographic entry follows the subject index descriptors.
In the chronology, "c" stands for "century"; e.g., "19c" means "19th century."
Note that "United States" is not used as a leading index term; if no country is mentioned, the index entry refers to the United States alone.
When an entry refers to both Canada and the United States, both "Canada" and "USA" appear in the string of index descriptors, but "USA" is not a leading term.
When an entry refers to any other country and the United States, only the other country is indexed.
The last number in the index string, in italics, refers to the bibliographic entry number.
