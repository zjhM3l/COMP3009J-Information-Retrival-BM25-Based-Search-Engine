87 Acts, ch. 215, Â§15; 91 Acts, ch. 233, Â§2; 97 Acts, ch. 39, Â§2 Attorney General Opinions 1.
Validity Phrase "lawful purposes" as used in former Â§155.13(3) (see, now, this section) permitting denial, suspension or revocation of pharmacist's license for person who distributes intoxicating liquors or drugs for any other than lawful purposes was not unconstitutionally vague; former Â§155.13(3) was clearly intended to permit discipline when pharmacist distributes drugs or liquor on licensed premises in contravention of state or federal law.
Sloman v. Board of Pharmacy Examiners of State of Iowa, 1989, 440 N.W.2d 609.
2.
Suspension of license Substantial evidence supported decision by Board of Pharmacy Examiners that pharmacist sold codeine cough syrup for other than medical purposes and, thus, justified suspension of license for one year and five-year probation; Board concluded that pharmacist indiscriminately sold codeine cough syrup to limited number of people for two and one-half years, creating risk of abuse and psychological dependence.
