Preface To Governor Sundquist: The attached Report of the Task Force on Arson at Places of Worship is submitted for your review and approval.
Since you formed the task force on July 3, 1996, its members have engaged in exhaustive investigation, research and analysis.
The four committees--Prevention/Apprehension, Assistance, Legislation, and Education--have held a total of 15 statewide meetings to examine every facet of the issue and develop a course of action.
Never before have we seen Tennesseans so committed to working so the common good.
Law enforcement agencies have worked as never and with all of us.
We are overwhelmed with the warmth, deep caring Tennesseans toward fulfilling the mission for which this task force was closely together for before with each other and cooperation of created.
The recommendations we offer in this report are comprehensive.
It is our firm belief that these measures and your forceful leadership will greatly diminish and help put an end to arson attacks on places of worship in our state and make it absolutely clear that hate crimes will not be tolerated in Tennessee.
Bishop William H. Graves Co-Chairman August 21,1996 Ira A. Lipman Co-Chairman Executive Summary Governor Don Sundquist, responding to citizen concern about the burning of places of worship, convened on July 3, 1996, a statewide task force to study the problem.
This report of the Governor's Task Force on Arson at Places of Worship is a compilation of their efforts.
The Governor named Ira A. Lipman and Bishop William H. Graves to serve as co-chairmen of the task force.
Four committees were appointed to address one of the following areas: prevention/apprehension, assistance, education, and legislation.
The chairpersons of the committees are: Tennessee Attorney General, Charles Burson --Prevention/Apprehension Committee; Tennessee State Representative, Ulysses Jones--Assistance Committee; Tennessee Department of Education Commissioner, Jane Walters -- Education Committee; and Tennessee State Senator, Bud Gilbert and Tennessee State Representative, Joe Armstrong--Legislative Committee.
A summary of the committees' recommendations are included in this report.
Prevention/Apprehension Committee Charged with developing recommendations for the apprehension of arsonists and the prevention of future destruction of houses of worship, the committee implemented several projects including a Church Arson Hotline, warning signs to be posted on religious property, a brochure with suggestions for safeguarding property, a risk assessment guide, a drive-by program, and a plan for a Worship Watch program.
Summary of Recommendations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A Reward Committee should be established; Security measures identified by the committee should be considered by religious organizations for protecting their property; Congregations should use the risk assessment guidelines and should utilize the resources identified by the Assistance Committee; A Worship Watch program should be established.
Assistance Committee The charge of the Assistance Committee was to compile information and make recommendations regarding forms of assistance available to places of worship where arson has occurred.
As a result, The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance has instituted measures which will improve the handling of insurance related matters.
Private insurance carriers will provide various kinds of free assistance to religious organizations which are victims of arson.
Information regarding available assistance in the form of loans, grants, donations of cash, materials, and labor was assembled for dissemination.
Summary of Recommendations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance should collect data on cancellation of insurance to places of worship and take appropriate action.
A needs assessment should be developed determining each place of worship's individual needs with an individual plan of assistance.
A loan guarantee program should be developed and available by mid- September, 1996.
Legislative Committee The Legislative Committee was charged by the Governor to develop bi-partisan legislation to address the issues of the crime classification for arson at a place of worship, and how much the Governor can offer to reward a person or persons who have information which leads to the conviction of a person who commits such an arson.
Summary of Recommendations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Arson at places of worship should be elevated from a class C to a class B felony; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Places of worship shall be defined as permanent or temporary structures which are used for the purpose of worship, and all property which is currently tax exempt based on its use for religious purposes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of persons who commit any crime, including arson at places of worship, should be increased from $5000 to up to $50,000.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor should administer the reward pool consisting of state and privately donated funds.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Donations to the reward pool should be tax deductible for the donor.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Any legislation which is passed should be effective immediately upon signing by the Governor.
Education Committee The Governor charged the Education Committee with examining and determining methods that could address the more global problem of intolerance and disrespect for people's differences.
Summary of Recommendations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A religious liberty education campaign involving all sectors of our society be developed.
A statewide commitment to emphasize the teaching of civic virtue in schools of Tennessee.
A commitment to a comprehensive character education that focuses on core moral values.
A commitment to a fair and accurate curriculum that includes study about religion in history, literature, and other appropriate places in the curriculum.
A commitment to proactive implementation of programs that have successfully reduced violence and conflict.
The recommendations of the four committees were submitted to Governor Don Sundquist on August 21, 1996.
The Governor's Task Force on Arson at Places of Worship On June 19, 1996, President Clinton invited governors from states where arson has occurred at places of worship to a meeting at the White House.
The governors were provided with information on the federal government's concerns and response to this problem.
Vice President Gore echoed the sentiments of the group by stating: "The rash of church burnings and burnings of other houses of worship that has swept particularly across the south represents an affront to religious liberty and racial tolerance."
The meeting which took place was extraordinary because of its nonpartisanship, and because of the determination of the participants to form a nationwide response to this problem.
The governors were uniformly enthusiastic about this initiative.
All who attended felt that:: "...all Americans have the freedom to worship wherever and whenever they choose.
(Gore)" They should not be terrorized by this type of crime.
The President charged the group to frame a national prevention initiative, state by state, using federal, state and private sector resources.
Governor Don Sundquist attended the President's meeting and, in response to the initiative commissioned the Governor's Task Force on Arson at Places of Worship.
Condemning acts of hatred and vowing an all-out effort to fight them, the Governor convened a broad based, statewide task force on July 3, 1996 at the Capitol.
Over 100 volunteers representing law enforcement officials, religious leaders, legislators, business and labor representatives came together with a single message: "In Tennessee, senseless acts of hatred will not be tolerated.
Our places of worship are the heart and soul of our communities, and we are committed to protecting them.
(Governor Sundquist)" These individuals generously gave of their time, knowledge and skills to address this important issue.
The Department of Commerce amd Insurance's State Fire Marshall's Office compiled information regarding arson at places of worship in Tennessee since 1990.
The map on the following page illustrates the incidence of arson, suspected arson and fires of an underternined nature for that time period.
Ninty-one (91) cases have occured in a third of our counties (38).
The counties in which the four major metropolitan areas are located account for slightly more than half of the occurrences.
Over this time period there does not seem to be a regional concentration, with the exception of the numbers reported for Shelby County.
The Governor named Ira A. Lipman and Bishop William H. Graves to serve as co-chairmen of the task force.
Mr. Lipman is chairman of Guardsmark, Inc., a private security services company in Memphis.
He is a past national chairman and current honorary chairman of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
Mr. Lipman also serves as a member of the executive committee and a trustee of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international human rights organization.
Bishop Graves is Episcopal Church is past chairman representing more the presiding Bishop of the First Episcopal District, Christian Methodist and is vice chairman of the national board of directors of the NAACP.
He of the board of directors of the Congress of National Black Churches, than 19 million people.
Governor Sundquist asked the task force to focus on several topics related to church arson and appointed a committee to address each of the following areas: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Prevention/Apprehension, Assistance, Education, and Legislation.
The committees were requested to develop short-term and long-term solutions for fighting arson at places of worship.
The Governor appointed: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Attorney General Charles Burson to chair the Prevention/Apprehension Committee Representative Ulysses Jones to chair the Assistance Committee Education Commissioner Jane Walters to chair the Education Committee Senator Bud Gilbert and Representative Joe Armstrong to chair the Legislation Committee See Appendix A for a full list of task force members.
Members of the Task Force's Prevention/Apprehension Committee visited burned West Tennessee churches on July 10, 1996 searching for ways to prevent future arsons at places of worship.
State arson investigators, representatives of the state attorney general's office, business leaders and security experts accompanied them.
Prior to the site visits, the group met with several ministers at Lane College in Jackson.
to hear their concerns.
What follows is the report of the Task Force chronicling their activities, their achievements, and their recommendations.
The Prevention/Apprehension Committee Attorney General Charles Burson, Chairman The Prevention/Apprehension Committe was charged with assessing the impact of arson in places of worship and developing recommendations for the apprehension of perpetrators and identification of measures for the prevention of future fires.
A sub-committee was formed to get information on the needs of the communities who had had arsons at places of worship and to hear the responses of communities dealing with the problem.
The Prevention/ Apprehension Committee met twice between July 3, 1996 and August 21, 1996.
Based upon the comments and recommendations that were presented during committee meetings, a clear consensus emerged that a successful apprehension and prevention program is ultimately dependent upon an active relationship between congregations and law enforcement within local communities.
Thus, all of the recommendations and the projects put forth require coordination and communication between congregational leadership and community law enforcement resources such as sheriffs, firefighters, local police, etc.
In addition, such efforts cannot be successful unless all members of the community are informed and involved in the programs.
Projects Implemented Ã¯Â¿Â½ A Tennessee Church Arson Hotline was established.
It is staffed twenty-four hours a day by an arson investigator with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.
Information about the hotline is being disseminated via local law enforcement agencies, state organizations and associations.
Warning signs were created.
These include information about rewards for information about the crime, the number of the Confidential Arson Hotline, and the fact that it is a crime to destroy or defame religious property.
The signs were designed after much Ã¯Â¿Â½ discussion and evaluation of appropriate language to maximize their deterrent effect.
The distribution mechanism for the signs is through regional Tennessee Department of Transportation offices working with local sheriffs' departments.
To date, signs are being distributed to those churches that have requested them (see Appendix B for a facsimile of this warning sign).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Risk assessment guides developed by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the brochure, "Safeguarding Your Place of Worship," developed by the Department of Commerce and Insurance (see Appendix B for a facsimile of the brochure), are being distributed statewide via local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, state organizations and associations.
Over three thousand have already been distributed.
The goal of the committee is for the guides to reach as many congregational leaders across the state as possible.
The Tennessee Highway Patrol has initiated a drive-by program adopted by some sheriff and local police departments.
The goal of the program is to drive by as many places of worship as possible on a routine basis.
Currently, the Department of Safety is compiling statistical data to demonstrate the implementation of the program.
Many other local law enforcement agencies are increasing patrols around churches.
A subcommittee was formed to address incorporating places of worship into existing Neighborhood Watch programs and to promote the "Cluster Concept."
This allows congregations in close proximity to pool their resources and develop a Worship Watch very similar to a Neighborhood Watch.
Congregations develop a system where members are assigned to check the properties on a regular basis.
Anything suspicious is immediately reported to the local sheriff's office.
This idea teams the community with congregational leadership and local law enforcement.
The subcommittee developed a How To Guide for establishing a Worship Watch Program (See Appendix B).
The plan is divided into categories, including: steps for congregations in isolated rural areas, steps for congregations in small towns, steps for congregations in urban and suburban areas and steps for all congregations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Recommendations of the Prevention/Apprehension Committee Ã¯Â¿Â½ A Reward Committee with membership from ATF, FBI, TBI and the Department of Commerce and Insurance should be established by the Governor.
This committee should be responsible for establishing the structure, setting the amounts, and undertaking an awareness campaign.
This campaign would publicize the availability of awards for persons providing information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators of arson at places of worship.
This committee should also coordinate the acceptance of private donations or commitments.
The committee recommends that the following security measures developed by Guardsmark be considered by places of worship in their efforts to prevent future arson: -New buildings should be set back from the public road.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ -Install fences, steel tubes filled with concrete, chains, locked gates, and/or dig drainage ditches around the property to deter access by car.
-Install lighting in parking areas, at all driveway entrances, on the building exterior at high levels and low levels of the property.
-Install sturdy exterior doors and door frames.
-Lock utility areas when not in use.
-Open the minimum number of doors during worship and other activities.
-Protect door hinges against pin removal.
-Install strong door locks.
Limit distribution of keys and keep accurate records of distribution.
-Install Plexiglas over stained glass windows.
-Install anti-shatter film over windows.
-Install sprinkler system with alarm.
-Install alarm system with battery and cellular phone backup.
Limit distribution of alarm code.
-Install concealed closed circuit television connected to VCR stored in a fire-safe location and change the recorded tape daily.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Congregations should appoint appropriate members to familiarize themselves with the risk assessment guidelines and work with community law enforcement to implement the recommendations which best fit their circumstances.
In seeking to implement the recommendations, congregations are encouraged to draw upon the resources identified by the Assistance Committee of the Task Force (see Appendix C for a listing of resources).
A Worship Watch Program should be established.
The goal of the program is to involve the citizens that live in the immediate area of places of worship to unify and be trained on surveillance and observation methods that can aid law enforcement and be a deterrent to crime.
Because of the diversity of the state (urban/rural), different methods and tactics would be necessary to achieve the goals of the program.
The program may be established as a pilot at first.
The program should encourage non-profit organizations with chapters and units throughout the state to play an active role, networking with existing local groups to implement the program.
(See Appendix B for details of the pilot plan) Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Assistance Committee Representative Ulysses Jones, chairman The charge of the Assistance Committee was to compile information and make recommendations regarding forms of assistance available to places of worship where arson has occurred.
Members of charitable organizations, representatives from state government, the federal government, and the insurance industry provided information to the committee.
The Assistance Committee met two times between July 3, 1996 and August 21, 1996.
The Committee found that many charitable organizations, such as the United Way, Habitat for Humanity, and the National Council of Churches are busily working to coordinate charitable giving campaigns.
The federal government, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is setting up loan and grant programs to aid in rebuilding, prevention, and apprehension efforts.
They also found that many private citizens were actively raising and donating funds to aid congregations (See Appendix C for a listing of types of assistance available).
Volunteers and Donations The National Council of Churches (NCC) and Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI), in a joint effort, established the Church Rebuilding Project.
Located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, this office is responsible for collection of information and coordinating needs assessment and volunteers for reconstruction efforts.
A data base was created to match volunteers' skills with area needs.
A profile form for each volunteer captures such information as professional, semi-professional, accomplished non-professional, or unskilled but willing to learn.
Over five hundred calls were received in the office during the last three weeks.
Approximately one thousand profile forms were mailed recently, to both individuals and groups.
Actual building is expected to begin in September and continue through next summer.
Volunteers may be lodged in homes in the community, other churches, gymnasiums, trailers, tents, or whatever else may be available.
Volunteers pay their own expenses when working at a site.
Calls have been received from all over the country.
Donations of funds, building materials and church supplies are being coordinated through the NCC offices in New York.
Examples of donations are: hymn books, choir robes, building materials, fire retardant materials, sprinkler pipes, lighting, windows, ceiling fans, pews, roofing material, bibles, Sunday School materials, pre-school supplies, curtains and wall hangings, pianos and organs.
One group volunteered to sew alter cloths to individual church specifications.
Another group volunteered to be "the kitchen" for building sites.
A church was donated if it can be dismantled and moved.
Professionals are offering such services as architectural and building, leadership roles, and staff for coordination of efforts.
And, like volunteer workers, these donations come from across the US, and are multi-denominational.
Fund raising ranged from individual to church to creative enterprise.
For example, the owner of four radio stations - one each: talk show, rhythm 
All the disc jockeys went on the street in a simultaneous broadcast and collected money and pledges.
Checks are still coming in from the pledges.
Volunteer efforts and contributions are both individual and corporate, with corporate donations being predominantly financial.
The Office of Housing and Urban Development is working with the NCC to set up workshops and resource fairs, at a "one-stop-shop" for pastors and congregation members who are charged with the responsibility of rebuilding their churches.
Projects Implemented To rectify the misperceptions regarding the Tennessee insurance industry's procedures for places of worship that were burned, the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance provided the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A special form for places of worship to register complaints about insurance companies; An insurance company survey relative to the availability of insurance for churches and other places of worship in Tennessee; A survey of all companies writing insurance of this nature to determine what kind of coverage is offered; and A letter to congregations that have encountered problems regarding their insurance coverage.
The private insurance industry will provide the following free assistance: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Insurance information to any house of worship Physical inspections by staff of any house of worship Recommendations by staff regarding risk and prevention of arson Speakers on protective mechanisms for houses of worships Recommendations of the Assistance Committee Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance should collect data and determine reasons for cancellation of insurance to places of worship.
Appropriate action should be taken by the Department of Commerce and Insurance if there is a problem.
A needs assessment should be developed that will determine each place of worship's individual needs; including insurance, funding, and materials.
An individual plan of assistance for each place of worship should be developed.
A loan guarantee program should be developed and available by mid- September, 1996.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Legislative Committee Senator Bud Gilbert, Co-chairman Representative Joe Armstrong, Co-chairman The Legislative Committee was charged by the Governor to develop bi-partisan legislation which would deal with the issues of the crime classification for arson on a place of worship, and how much the Governor can offer to reward a person or persons who have information which leads to the conviction of a person who commits such an arson.
Other issues discussed include what the crime is for an person who is an accessory to such crimes, the definition of a place of worship for legislative purposes, the statute of limitations for civil suits brought against the perpetrators of such crimes, whether a special session should be convened to address any pending legislation proposed by the Task Force, and the effect on Tennessee of federal legislation which has passed related to arson at places of worship.
The committee met three times between July 3, 1996 and August 21, 1996.
Federal Legislation House Resolution 3525, now called the Church Arson Prevention Act, was signed into law by the President on July 3, 1996.
This Act makes arson at places of worship a federal crime.
It makes crimes motivated by race, color, or ethnicity that interfere with the ability of citizens to hold or use religious property a federal crime.
It also allows for the federal government to participate with states and local jurisdictions in the investigation and apprehension of persons involved in such crimes.
The Act sets up a loan guarantee recovery fund through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, allows victims of such crimes to be compensated under the Victims of Crime Act, and authorizes additional federal personnel as may be required to assist state and local agencies in the investigation, prevention, and response of such crimes (See Appendix D for the Church Arson Prevention Act).
Recommendations of the Legislative Committee The legislative Committee of the Task Force on Arson at Places of Worship makes the following recommendations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Arson at places of worship should be elevated from a class C to a class B felony.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Places of worship shall be defined as permanent or temporary structures which are used Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ for the purpose of worship, and all property which is currently tax exempt based on its use for religious purposes.
The reward for the information leading to the arrest and conviction of persons who commit any crime, including arson at places of worship, should be increased from $5000 to up to $50,000.
The Governor should administer this reward pool consisting of state and privately donated funds.
Donations to the reward pool should be tax deductible for the donor.
Any legislation which is passed should be effective immediately upon signing by the Governor.
A copy of the proposed legislation is located in Appendix D.
The Education Committee Commissioner Jane Walters, Chairwoman The Governor charged the Education Committee with examining and determining methods that could address the more global problem of intolerance and disrespect for people's differences.
The means for reaching the most vulnerable part of the population, children, would be the educational system.
They brought in experts in the field of diversity training and non-violent conflict resolution to share information with the group regarding programs which were already proving to be successful in addressing these isssues.
This committee met three times between July 3, 1996 and August 21, 1996.
Recommendations of the Education Committee The response of Tennesseans of all races and faiths must be to stand together against the common enemies of our shared humanity: hate, ignorance and violence.
We call upon the citizens of our state to work in partnership with faith communities, government, business, labor and educational institutions to reaffirm the civic virtues and core moral values that we hold in common across our differences.
Specifically, we recommend the following five actions to be taken by educational leaders: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A religious liberty education campaign involving all sectors of our society including faith communities, organizations, citizens of our and the United public and non-public schools, colleges and universities, youth business and government.
The focus of the campaign will be to remind all shared commitment to religious liberty under the Tennessee Constitution States Constitution.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A statewide commitment to emphasize the teaching of civic virtue in public, independent, church-related and home schools in Tennessee.
Not only should students understand the civic principles that bind us together as citizens, they must demonstrate a commitment to practice the civic virtues that sustain our Republic.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A commitment to comprehensive character education that focuses on core moral values widely shared in our communities including respect for the rights of others, understanding of differences, and civil debate.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A commitment to a fair and accurate curriculum that includes study about religion in history, literature, and other appropriate places in the curriculum.
With this commitment comes the responsibility to prepare educators to teach about religion as an important part of a complete education (see Appendix E for a list of resources).
The exclusion of religious reference from text books and the curriculum gives students the false impression that religious traditions are marginal and that religion does not play a meaningful role in history and society.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A commitment to proactive implementation of programs that have successfully reduced violence and conflict.
(See Appendix E for a list of programs that have been sucessfully implemented).
Conclusion The burning of places of worship in Tennessee and throughout the nation is a moral outrage that tears at the fabric of our democratic society.
These evil acts strike at the heart of religious liberty, the most precious, fundamental and inalienable right of every human being.
In the face of hate and violence, the people of Tennessee must act to reaffirm our bold experiment in religious liberty and our shared commitment to a just and safe society for all.
We must unite against every new menace, including that of our own complacency.
It is for us who know the blessings of liberty and to sustain it for the next generation.
