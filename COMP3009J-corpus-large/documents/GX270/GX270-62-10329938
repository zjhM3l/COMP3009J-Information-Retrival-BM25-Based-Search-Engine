REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE FLORIDA'S USED OIL RECYCLING PROGRAM 16th Annual Report May 2001 INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY Florida's comprehensive, statewide Used Oil Recycling Program is recognized as one of the most successful in the United States and serves as a national and international model.
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has implemented a used oil management program under Sections 403.75 through 403.769, Florida Statutes (F.S.), since 1984.
The program consists of a registration and record keeping program for used oil handlers, a permitting program for used oil processors and technical assistance to the public and regulated community.
The 1988 Solid Waste Management Act substantially changed public policy toward solid waste management and used oil collection, management, transportation and recycling.
New initiatives included a 5% price preference for the purchase of recycled and rerefined used oil by state and local governments, as well as some limited liability exemptions for businesses which accept used oil from the public.
The 1988 Legislature approved a one-time appropriation of funds amounting to $1 million for local government grants for establishing public used oil collection centers and $1.5 million for statewide incentive/awareness and educational programs aimed at Do-ItYourself (DIY) oil changers and school students.
The 2001 Legislature appropriated $200,000 to update Florida's used oil recycling program.
The Department continues its regulatory program and, though the number of regulated parties remains relatively stable, the amount of used oil recycled per capita continues to grow.
Florida law contains several bans on the disposal of used oil.
Since October 1, 1988, it has been unlawful for used oil to be discarded into sewers, drainage systems, septic tanks, surface or ground waters, watercourses, or marine waters.
It cannot be mixed or commingled with solid waste to be disposed of in landfills, except for those instances wherein the disposal occurs unknowingly, or is approved by the Department (such as in the case of emergency clean-up of accidental oil spills).
Used oil cannot be mixed with hazardous substances or hazardous wastes that make it unsuitable for recycling or beneficial use.
It cannot be used for road oiling, dust control, weed abatement, or other similar uses that may release used oil into the environment.
The used oil statutes were amended by the 1993 Legislature.
The majority of these amendments were made to make Florida law consistent with the federal used oil regulations,
especially in the use of terms and definitions.
A major change required retailers who sell over 500 gallons of oil annually to post signs which display the State's toll free 1-800 number (1800-741-4DEP[4337]).
This number uses a voice mail system to provide the locations of all public used oil collection centers in Florida, indexed by post office zip code.
Chapter 62-710 of the Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), addresses used oil management and implements the provisions of state law.
It establishes a program for registration, record keeping and reporting by handlers of used oil; certification of used oil transporters; and permitting of used oil processing facilities.
The federal used oil management standards which are found in Chapter 40, Part 279 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) are adopted by reference in Rule 62-710.210, F.A.C., effective June 8, 1995.
The definitions and forms used in this program are found in Chapter 62-701, F.A.C.
(Solid Waste Management).
Section 403.756, F.S., requires the Department to "submit an annual report to the Legislature which summarizes information on used oil collection and recycling, analyzes the effectiveness of this act, and makes recommendations for any necessary changes."
This report addresses the status of Florida's Used Oil Recycling Program using data collected during 1999.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Chapter 62-710, F.A.C. was amended, effective December 23, 1996.
The most significant change required Used Oil Processors to obtain a Used Oil Processing Permit.
There are currently 19 Used Oil Processors permitted by the Department.
DEP charges a $2,000 application fee to cover the cost to DEP for the permit review.
Permitted facilities must provide descriptions of the corporate structure, processing operations, preparedness and prevention, analysis and contingency plans, tank management, closure and employee training.
Some items (storage tank integrity, adequacy of secondary containment, and certain portions of the closure plan) require certification by an engineer registered in the state of Florida.
The rule was again amended, effective March 25, 1997.
These latest amendments deleted certain obsolete or redundant sections of Chapter 62-710, F.A.C., and centralized some common Solid Waste Management items (e.g. intent, definitions and forms) in Rule 62-701, F.A.C., Solid Waste Management.
USED OIL REGISTRATION AND REPORTING As of December 2000, 128 individual private and public businesses were included in the registration database, 4 of which are based outside of Florida (see Table 1, Page 13).
This is not significantly changed from the 129 handlers registered in 1999.
However, the number of handling activities and number of sites decreased in 2000, reflecting market pressure in the used oil recycling industry, the result of stiff competition and the continuing climb of liability insurance premiums.
Small operations with limited resources are quitting this industry, leaving, or selling, their customer base to larger companies.
2
Effective June 8, 1995, commercially generated Used Oil Filters (UOFs) were banned from landfill disposal and UOF Handlers were required to register with the Department's Used Oil Recycling Program.
Many used oil handlers now also manage UOFs to meet customer demand.
As of December 2000, the DEP database (Table 1, Page 13) includes 91 UOF Transporters, 68 UOF Transfer Facilities, 21 UOF Processors and 2 UOF End-Users (metal foundries and Waste-To-Energy facilities [WTEs] which accept segregated loads of UOFs from non-registered persons).
As a WTE facility will burn the oil contained within a filter for energy recovery and recycle the metal casing, the Rule allows generators of used oil filters who live in one of the 14 counties serviced by a WTE facility to commingle their used oil filters with the rest of their solid waste.
The WTE facility, in turn, need not register with the Department to manage commingled filters.
When the UOF landfill ban was put in place in 1995, a number of businesses opened up for this market.
The number of registered UOF handlers continues a steady decline as this market settles.
As the Department has the authority to regulate only the oil within a UOF, the reporting requirement for UOF Handlers was made optional within the Rule.
As reporting is optional, data regarding UOF management is destined to remain an approximation.
ANNUAL REPORTS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 1999 Transporters and processing facilities must report on the type, quantities, and sources of used oil collected, processed, and end-used.
The data from these reports are listed in detail in Table 1, page 13, are graphically illustrated in the Figures on pages 10 through 12, and are explained in the following sections.
Trends in Used Oil Management in Florida Figure 1, page 10, shows the trend of used oil management in Florida from 1984 to the present.
Overall, the trends (collection, recycling and disposal) show a steady increase in volume over time.
This is to be expected, given Florida's steady population growth.
It is difficult to correlate increased rates of used oil recycling to population growth due to many variables.
Variables resulting in reduced oil changes include extended vehicle service schedules for newer cars (significant in Florida's large rental fleets) and for those consumers using the new, synthetic oils which have a longer life, the use of on-board, inline oil filtration systems by truck fleets, and the growth of on-site used oil reconditioning and recycling technologies increasingly employed by industry.
Nonetheless, the rate of growth in the volume of used oil collected seems to at least keep pace with the population growth rate.
A significant adjustment is evident in the period between 1993 and 1995.
It was during this time that DEP promulgated amendments to both the Used Oil Management Standards and, at the same time, adopted standards for the management of Petroleum Contact Water.
The changes in definitions of used oil, oily wastes, and petroleum contact water (PCW), along with the fine tuning of the data collected by DEP regarding these activities, resulted in a major data shift.
The trend since the shift during rulemaking is interpreted by DEP to be very positive in that the amount of oil actually recycled continues to 3
increase and the volumes reported collected, recycled and disposed reconcile to within a 1.5% margin of error.
Amount of Used Oil and Oily Wastes Collected In calendar year 1999, 138,136,143 gallons of used oil and oily wastes were reported to have been collected (Figure 2, Page 11).
Automotive used oil and oily waste made up 28% of the total amount collected, including 2,648,285 gallons collected from over 1200 Public Used Oil Collection Centers.
Approximately 23% of the total was industrial oil collected from bulk petroleum and various industrial facilities, and other sources.
The remaining 49% of the total was of the mixed type generated by commercial sources (i.e. a combination of automotive and industrial oils).
Again this year, more oil is reported as Mixed, compared to previous years.
This seems to indicate a consolidation of loads by handlers.
Disposition of Used Oil and Oily Wastes As mentioned in the preceding section, approximately 138,136,143 gallons of used oil were reported to have been collected in Florida during 1999.
About 43,794,916 gallons of this figure represent a duplication of data which occurs when used oil transporters report their collections to the Department when the oil is not end-used but rather is transferred to a another facility (Table 1, Page 13).
The receiving facility then also reports this same quantity as having been collected at that site.
When the on-hand inventory is included and the transferred quantity is removed from the data, a total of 97,052,413 gallons of used oil and oily wastes were reported as collected for management.
On the other end, 98,539,249 gallons of used oil are reported as being managed (recycled or disposed).
This leaves a difference of 1,486,836 gallons.
According to information provided by industry, there is always a degree of error in tracking used oil because of differences in measuring loads of used oil which are intrinsic to the used oil industry.
Most transporters use dip sticks to estimate volume during pickup and transit.
Processors use a more sophisticated measure, using actual weight from certified scales in determining a price per load.
It is not uncommon for transporter estimates to differ by 6-12% from the final measured volume, with the mean falling around 7%.
The error in this year's annual report calculates to approximately 1.6% of the adjusted total quantity reported to have been collected.
This error continues to reflect well on the Department's efforts to increase the accuracy of its data collection and management.
Of the 98,624,851 gallons of used oil and oily waste reported as managed, 58,170,183 gallons (58%) were recycled as follows (Figure 3, Page 11): 34,463,565 gallons (59.2%) were marketed as an on-specification used oil fuel o 8,654,818 gallons (14.9%) were recycled as an off-specification used oil fuel o 11,434,760 gallons (19.7%) were marketed for other industrial uses (e.g. phosphate beneficiation) o 3,617,040 (6.2%) gallons was counted as end of year, on-site inventory o
4
This year's data is not significantly changed from that of last year.
The recycled used oil market will always be tightly linked to the virgin crude market.
Market prices for virgin crude during 1999 remained relatively stable over time and probably worked towards keeping used oil management trends in line with those of last year.
Of all the oil and oily wastes collected, 40,369,066 (42% of the total amount of used oil reported managed) ended up as oily wastes.
These wastes are primarily condensation water and sediment which are ubiquitous in used oil.
When a container of used oil is picked up for transportation, whether in drums or pumped into a vac-truck, these wastes will almost always constitute some significant portion of the used oil load.
A significant portion, according to industry reports, ranges anywhere from 4-20%, with the mean around 7%.
These oily wastes were managed as follows (Figure 4, Page 12): o o o
238,102 gallons (0.6%) were landfilled (non-liquid sediment) 39,933,985 gallons (99.0 %) were treated as industrial wastewaters 196,979 gallons (0.4%) were incinerated
Overall, the volume of oily waste disposal did not change much since last year.
This is thought to be due to the practice of conducting solid waste management at used oil processing facilities.
After the Used Oil Processing Permit was put in place in 1997, the Department noticed that a number of permitted processors were managing what were essentially solid wastes under the used oil management standards.
The Department has continued to take aggressive steps towards discouraging the blurring of the distinction between solid vs. oily wastes.
Facilities which might have managed solid wastes under the more relaxed used oil standards (and reporting it as used oil recycling), now manage such wastes under the more stringent solid waste standards (where such oily wastes are properly reported as disposal).
So, the amount of used oil recycled vs. the amount of oily wastes disposed of, continues a trend towards reconciliation with the total volume reported collected and managed.
The trends within the realm of oily waste disposal continue to show improvement.
The percentage of oily wastes managed by both landfill disposal and incineration have both dropped.
Landfill disposal of oily wastes dropped from 1.5% to 0.6% of the total disposal methods.
Even more encouraging, the incineration of oily wastes dropped from 10.3% to 0.4%.
At the same time, the volume of oily wastes treated through wastewater treatment increased by almost 11% over last year.
This is considered an improvement in the management of oily wastes as, in most cases, wastewater treatment seems to offer more refined and controlable methods of waste cleaning and emissions discharges.
Used Oil Filters (UOFs) There are a number of difficulties in deriving conclusions with a high degree of confidence from UOF data.
First, as the Department's authority to regulate UOFs extends only to the oil trapped within the filter, the reporting of such data was made 5
optional under the rule.
Second, UOFs are collected in a number of different ways (e.g. barrels, drums, roll-offs or bins of crushed, uncrushed or shredded filters) and the data are reported using barrel equivalents (1 barrel equals a certain number of filters) and tonnage conversions (converting weight to numbers of filters).
Hence, the numbers generated can only be approximations.
Furthermore, staff has been unable to obtain sales figures of new oil filters in Florida as this is considered proprietary information by the companies involved in this business.
As a result, staff can only estimate the number of filters which are generated in the state.
Finally, data on filters generated in areas of the state serviced by Waste-to-Energy facilities are, for the most part, not reported at all.
This is assumed to be a significant number of filters as approximately 30% of all solid waste generated in Florida is burned for energy recovery.
Even though the actual reporting mechanisms are weak, the Department continues to use a very liberal estimate of UOF generation in Florida (assuming four filter changes per year for the 12.3 million vehicle registrations estimated for 1998 by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehciles).
Based on this assumption, FDEP now estimates that approximately 52 million UOFs are generated in Florida per year.
From the data reported, approximately 22,043,381 UOFs were collected (diverted from landfill disposal).
This accounts for approximately 42% of the UOFs estimated generated in Florida, an increase of 6% over last year.
It can be assumed that a majority of the unreported filters are managed by persons served by a WTE facility.
Most of the filters reported to have been collected were sent to U.S. Foundry in Dade County which recycles the filters into gray steel, used to produce manhole covers and similar products.
The prohibition against the landfill disposal of used oil filters has resulted in the recycling, rather than disposal, of approximately 12,186 tons of steel in 1999.
About 198,911 gallons of used oil, trapped within the filter, were collected during the management of these filters and handled under the used oil management standards.
This less than last year's amount of used oil, while the number of filters is up.
This can be explained by the trend by U. S. Foundry in Miami, the major UOF end user in the state, towards handling only those UOFs which are relatively free of residual oil.
Approximately 916,027 UOFs were reported as end of year, on-site inventory.
It is very common for filter handlers to store large quantities of filters on-site until a large bulk load can be shipped to a final end user.
This practice minimizes transportation costs, allows for thorough draining of used oil from the filters and ensures a maximum value for the clean metal.
PUBLIC USED OIL COLLECTION CENTERS (PUOCCs) As of December, 2000, Florida had a statewide network of 1,219 PUOCCs.
The Department has worked closely with all county Used Oil Coordinators, the Florida Petroleum Council, the Florida Petroleum Marketers Association, and others in the quick-lube oil-change business in establishing this network.
As a result of this effort, all but four (rural) counties have more than one location where used oil can be taken for recycling.
Major oil companies and 6
hundreds of independent service stations, auto repair shops, quick-lube shops and auto parts retailers have volunteered to become public used oil collection centers.
Discount Auto PartsÂ® stores maintain almost 30% of the PUOCCs in Florida.
With so many sites state-wide, this major participant helps to ensure the convenience of this program for all Floridians.
The number of PUOCCs participating in this program seems to be on the upswing (Figure 5, Page 12).
This past year, some municipalities have consolidated collection sites or initiated curbside recycling programs.
At the same time, new businesses continue to register as PUOCCs, taking the place of withdrawn sites.
Operators of used oil collection sites who maintain compliance with all applicable management standards are granted certain liability exemptions under Section 114 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), are granted protection against enforcement penalties related to a release of used oil under Florida Statutes, Section 403.760, but must still assume the significant costs associated with a clean-up.
Despite slight fluctuations in the number of PUOCCs over the years, the quantity of used oil collected from household Do-It-Yourselfers (DIYers) continues to increase annually (Figure 5, Page 12).
PUOCCs accepted 2,648,285 gallons of used oil in calendar year 1999, which continues the trend (Figure 5, Page 12) of an average annual increase of about 3%.
It is difficult to estimate the number of DIYers in Florida.
This year, the Department applied a strict estimate value of 4 oil changes per year per DIYer.
The Department feels that in Florida, because of the size of its retirement age population, the vibrant quick lube service business, and large lease fleets, the number of DIYers is probably close to 15%.
FDEP estimates that Florida DIYers generate approximately 7.3 million gallons of used oil.
This means that Florida is now collecting about 36% of the used oil generated by DIYers.
The Department maintains a toll-free number (1-800-741-4DEP) which uses voice mail to index PUOCCs by post office zip code.
Anyone calling this number is prompted to enter their zip code.
The system then either reports a listing of PUOCCs in that zip code, or directs the caller to retry adjacent zip codes or leave a taped message for a prompt reply from a Department representative.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACT One of the main purposes of the Florida Resource Recovery and Management Act, of which the Used Oil Recycling Act (Sections 403.75-403.769, Florida Statutes) is part, is to promote the recovery of resources, such as used oil, which have the potential for further use while protecting the public health and welfare and the environment of Florida.
A combination of Florida's growing population, an effective PUOCC program and prohibitions on the uses and disposal of used oil and used oil filters continues to increase the amount and quality of used oil available for recycling.
Prohibitions on the land application or disposal of used oil and strict management standards provide the Department's enforcement personnel with laws and authorities that can
7
assist in preventing contamination of surface and ground waters by improper used oil management practices.
The management standards, including the processing permit, were adopted with the input, cooperation and approval of the regulated community.
They are based on a common sense approach to regulation which is felt to be protective of the environment and human health while assuring used oil will be recycled to the most practical extent possible.
Recent amendments made state and federal law more consistent and easier on the regulated community.
The signage requirement and toll free information number further expand public awareness and increase the amount of used oil which is properly managed.
According to a 1996 report published by the American Petroleum Institute and a 1995 report published by Evergreen Oil Company of California, the collection rate of Florida's Used Oil Recycling Program ranks (respectively) first and second in the nation.
The Department attributes this success to: 1) its decision not to manage used oil as hazardous waste; 2) the cooperation of public and private entities in maintaining the PUOCC program; and 3) the Department's use of effective formal education and public information materials.
Technical assistance and information provided to other states and countries indicate that Florida's Used Oil Recycling Program continues to serve as a national and international model of effective used oil management.
In 2000, the program has provided assistance to states such as Massachusetts and Hawaii and countries such as Brazil and Argentina, in implementing used oil recycling infrastructure, rules, and education materials.
RECOMMENDATIONS Florida's statewide Used Oil Recycling Program, one of the most comprehensive, extensive, and successful in the United States, continues to grow as it continues to receive national recognition.
There is, however, always room for improvement.
The Department has once again initiated rulemaking to increase the effectiveness of this rule by further refining the used oil management standards.
The purpose of this rulemaking is fourfold: 1) to correct some technical errors; 2) to upgrade the minimal insurance requirement for Certified Used Oil Transporters which has not changed since it was set at $100,000 in 1990; 3) to revise the tank standards to reflect changes in the Department's tank rules; and 4) to clarify the regulation of non-oil related solid waste management at Used Oil Processing facilities.
The Department is working closely with the regulated community and does not expect this rulemaking to be contentious.
In June of 1999, the United Association of Used Oil Services (UAOUS), which represented a good portion of the Used Oil Handlers registered with this Department, folded.
The Department has felt the loss of this association through the lack of knowledgeable input regarding the specifics of the industry in Florida.
The Department is examining some sort of mechanism which would restore the strong communications link between government regulators 8
and the private sector in this industry which was lost with the demise of the UAUOS.
Some of the strategies being considered include internet technology for more easy and open communication and the encouragement of members of the private sector to take the initiative in restoring this vital communications link.
The Department is pursuing avenues to secure industry expertise in order to establish reasonable standards that will protect human and environmental health and welfare while not placing an undue burden on industry.
Issues that need to be addressed include the completion of an industry wide standard Used Oil Transporter Training Program, an industry-wide sampling and analysis procedure for screening oil prior to transport and minimum spill control standards.
Additional funding is needed to enhance the educational initiatives developed and implemented in 1989-90.
During those years, complete formal education curriculum kits were introduced into every public K-1, secondary and post secondary school in the State.
The interest, need and demand for such materials continue to grow as these one-time production materials become outdated and the supply is exhausted.
It has also been over ten years since the Department quantified the DIY segment of the used oil universe.
While statutes, rules and data collection have kept pace with the changing nature of both used oil management and population trends, the tools used to measure the effectiveness of the DIY segment are woefully outdated and in need of refinement.
Florida's Used Oil Recycling Program remains on the cutting edge of change as environmental management and regulation evolves into the next century.
The focus of both the regulators and the regulated community is shifting steadily towards management schemes which are multi-media (encompassing a number of heretofore separately regulated waste streams) by nature and increasingly incorporate pollution prevention (P2) goals.
The object of P2 is to consider all wastes and to generate as little waste as possible.
As over 80% of the used oil in Florida is automotive or mixed with automotive, the automotive service industry has been a major stakeholder in this program.
More and more of these businesses are moving towards P2 management schemes.
Used oil is not so much a stand alone program as it once was.
To address this change of focus, Florida's Used Oil Recycling Program has been enhancing its relationship with the Department's P2 staff.
Both sections are striving to coordinate and strenghten the communication between their programs.
Joint efforts in regulatory and education initiatives have begun as these programs position themselves to assume a proactive role in the changing world of environmental regulation.
A critical step in keeping the Used Oil Recycling Program up to date and at the cutting edge of technology occurred in March 1998 when the program established a presence on the World Wide Web at the Department's internet site.
Annual Reports and all fact sheets and forms used in this program are available for downloading at this site.
Various education materials are being added to the site.
The Used Oil Recycling Program has recently begun to incorporate its data into Geographic Information System (GIS) software which will be used to enhance the information available on its website.
