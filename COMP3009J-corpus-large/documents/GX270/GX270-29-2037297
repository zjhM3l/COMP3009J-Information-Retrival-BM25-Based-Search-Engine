STONE, D Dimension stone can be defined as natural rock material quarried for the purpose of obtaining blocks or slabs that meet specifications as to size (width, length, and thickness) and shape (Barton, 1968, p. 4).
Color, grain texture and pattern, and surface finish of the stone are also normal requirements.
Durability (essentially based on mineral composition and hardness and past performance), strength, and the ability of the stone to take a polish are other important selection criteria.
Although various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are used as dimension stone, the principal rock types are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Other varieties of dimension stone that are normally considered to be special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc), and various products fashioned from natural stone.
U.S. production of dimension stone in 2001 was estimated to be 1.22 million metric tons (Mt) valued at $263 million, which was a 12% increase in value compared with that of 2000.
U.S. production tonnage of dimension stone in 2001 declined by 7.6% compared with that of 2000.
Exports increased by about 23% in value to $73.5 million, and imports for consumption increased by 8.5% in value to $1.07 billion.
The value of apparent consumption was estimated to be $1.25 billion.
In recent years, most dimension stone has been used in construction applications with the largest portions being sold or used as ashlars and partially squared pieces, curbing, flagstone, and rough block for building and construction.
Monumental stone, another major type, includes memorials of various kinds.
A noteworthy event during the year that involved the U.S. dimension stone industry was the restoration and renovation of the damage to the Pentagon that resulted from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Specifications called for the use of Indiana limestone, because this material was used when the Pentagon was originally constructed in 1943.
The prime contractors for the work were Independent Limestone Co. of Indiana for quarrying the stone and Bybee Stone Co. of Indiana for fabrication and refurbishment of the stonework.
The contract was awarded on October 29, 2001, and utilized approximately 1,134 metric tons (t) of Indiana limestone.
The final piece of limestone was laid during a dedication ceremony on June 11, 2002 (Stone World, 2002, p. 96-102).
Dimension stone production data for the United States are derived by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from a voluntary survey of U.S. quarry producers of rough and dressed dimension stone.
Data in this report cover rough crude quarried stone, irregular-shaped and rectangular blocks, and more highly processed stone.
A number of other terms also are used to describe further processing, such as "worked," "dressed," "finished," and "manufactured."
These and other terms used by the dimension stone industry describe such features as the mineral composition of the rock, the shape of the product, the STONE, DIMENSION--2001 IMENSION By Thomas P. Dolley Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Aaron J. Poyer, statistical assistant.
method of finishing a stone, and the type of finish applied (Stone World, 2001, p. 106-139).
No adjustments are made in the data to account for the sometimes substantial losses in processing rough stone into dressed stone.
Sold or used data are considered to be equivalent to production because changes in stocks are not surveyed.
Of the 222 producing dimension stone operations included in the survey for 2001, 150 (or 68%) responded, which represented 82% of the tonnage; the remaining tonnage was estimated on the basis, in part, of prior years' reporting (table 1).
Description and Terminology Scientific and commercial descriptions of various dimension stone types overlap.
The scientific description of dimension stone types is focused primarily on the stone's locality and mineralogical composition, whereas the commercial description is focused primarily on the locality and color of the stone.
Furthermore, various combinations of the scientific and commercial descriptions are used by stone producers to market their stone products effectively.
The descriptions that follow were adapted from Currier (1960, p. 1-10) and Barton (1968, p. 2-8).
Granite.--Commercial granites include all feldspathic crystalline rocks of mainly interlocking texture and with individual mineral grains that are visible to the naked eye.
This category includes such rock types as anorthosite, gneiss, granodiorite, monzonite, syenite, and all other intermediate rock types.
Primary colors of granites are white, gray, pink, and red; with green and brown are secondary colors.
Although black granites are also included in this category and range in color from dark gray to black, they are not true granites mineralogically but rather mafic rocks such as diabases, diorites, gabbros, and similar rocks.
Limestone.--Commercial limestones are rocks of sedimentary origin that primarily comprise calcium carbonate with or without magnesium.
Included in this category are calcitic limestone, dolomite, dolomitic limestone, and travertine, which is a rock that is precipitated from hot springs.
Marble.--Commercial marble includes metamorphosed limestones and serpentine rocks, all of which are capable of taking a polish.
An important member of this classification is serpentine marble, which is also known as verde antique, and comprises green-to-black serpentine, which is a hydrous magnesium silicate mineral that is crisscrossed by veins of lighter minerals, such as calcite or dolomite.
Sandstone.--Commercial sandstone is a lithified sand that comprises chiefly quartz or quartz and feldspar with a fragmental (clastic) texture.
Sandstone contains interstitial cementing materials, such as calcite, clay, iron oxides, or silica.
Arkose (abundant feldspar grains), graywacke (abundant rock 73.1 fragments), and conglomerates are included in this category.
Other members of this category include bluestone, which is a dense, hard, fine-grained feldspathic sandstone, which splits easily along planes into thin, smooth slabs; brownstone, which is feldspathic sandstone of brown to reddish-brown color owing to abundant iron oxide; and flagstone, which is a sandstone or slate that splits into large, thin slabs.
Slate.--Commercial slate is a microgranular metamorphic rock formed by the recrystallization of clay sediments, such as claystone, shale, or siltstone.
Characterized by excellent parallel cleavage, slates may be easily split into relatively thin slabs.
Greenstone.--Commercial greenstones are the result of the metamorphosis of basaltic rocks.
Greenstone is named because of the predominance of greenish minerals, such as chlorite, epidote, or actinolite.
Basalt and Traprock.--Commercial basalt and traprock includes igneous rocks that are too fine grained to be termed "black granite."
The name traprock is derived from the term "trappa," which means stairway, because of the characteristic terraced or steplike appearance of certain basalt lava fields.
This category includes extrusive igneous rocks, such as andesite, basalt, or dacite, and intrusive igneous rocks, such as amphibolites, diabase, diorites, fine grained gabbros, peridotites, and pyroxenites.
Miscellaneous.--This category includes dimension stone types that do not easily fall into the aforementioned categories, such as soapstone, steatite, or talc, which contains various amounts of talc.
Additional miscellaneous dimension stones include diatomite, mylonites, pumice, schist, tripoli, tuff, porous or scoriaceous volcanic rocks, or any other rocks used as building stones.
Production Rough stone blocks split or cut from a quarry face are transported to processing plants that are frequently located at the quarry site, at least for preliminary sizing.
Further dressing, which includes final sizing and finishing operations, such as polishing, edging, and decorating, also may be done at the quarry site.
In 2001, granite accounted for 408,000 t (33%) of the total domestic dimension stone production of 1.22 Mt, followed by limestone (26%), sandstone (15%), marble (5%), slate (2%), and miscellaneous stone (19%).
Granite accounted for about $107 million (41%) of total domestic production of $263 million, followed by limestone (26%), sandstone (9%), marble (8%), slate (6%), and miscellaneous (10%).
Production was reported in 34 States and Puerto Rico.
The leading producer States, in descending order by tonnage, were Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin, Vermont, and Texas.
These States accounted for 47% of the domestic production.
The leading producer States, in descending order by value, were Indiana, Vermont, Georgia, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
These States contributed 49% of the value of domestic production (table 3).
The top five producing companies were Buechel Stone Corp. in Wisconsin; Cold Spring Granite Co. in California, Minnesota, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas; 73.2 Fletcher Granite Co., Inc., in Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Oolitic Victor Stone Co. in Indiana; and Rock of Ages Corp. in New Hampshire and Vermont.
These companies produced about 29% of domestic production in tonnage and about 29% of production value.
The leading 14 companies accounted for 54% of total domestic tonnage and 51% of the value.
Granite.--Dimension granite was produced by 36 companies operating 64 quarries in 17 States.
Production was 408,000 t and was valued at $107 million.
Granite production tonnage decreased by about 2% and value decreased by 4.5% compared with those of 2000.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Massachusetts, Georgia, Vermont, South Dakota, and New Hampshire.
Massachusetts accounted for 20% of the tonnage of U.S. granite production.
Massachusetts and Georgia combined accounted for 19% of the value of the U.S. granite production (table 4).
Cold Spring Granite, Fletcher Granite, and Rock of Ages, which were the leading producers accounted for 52% of U.S. granite production in tonnage and 49% of U.S. granite production in value.
Limestone.--Dimension limestone was produced by 26 companies from 29 quarries in 9 States.
Production decreased by about 27% to 321,000 t from 440,000 t in 2000, and the value increased by 5% to $68.8 million from $65.5 million in 2000.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Indiana, Texas, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
Indiana produced 57% of the U.S. tonnage and 51% of the value (table 5).
BG Hoadley Quarries, Inc., Buechel Stone Corp., Indiana Limestone Co., Inc., Oolitic Victor Stone, and Texas Stone Quarries, which were the leading producers, accounted for 75% of total U.S. limestone tonnage and about 51% of the value.
Sandstone.--Dimension sandstone was produced by 28 companies that operated 31 quarries in 18 States.
Production decreased to 186,000 t in 2001 from 229,000 t in 2000.
The value increased by 2.6% to $23.5 million in 2001 from $22.9 million in 2000.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were New York, Arizona, Ohio, California, and Michigan.
New York was the leading producing State with 23% of the tonnage and 19% of the value (table 6).
American Sandstone, Finger Lakes Stone Co. Inc., Hackett Quarry Co., Waller Brothers Stone Co., and Jude Stone Quarry Co., which were the leading producers, accounted for about 64% of the tonnage and 49% of the value of domestic production.
Marble.--Marble was mined by five companies that operated seven quarries in five States.
Production increased to 63,400 t valued at $19.8 million from 31,300 t valued at $7.2 million in 2000 (table 10).
Much of the production increase is directly related to improved response to the USGS survey of marble producers.
Georgia was the leading producing State, followed by Vermont, Tennessee, Colorado, and Alabama.
The leading producers were, in descending order, Georgia Marble Co., Vermont Quarries Co., and Tennessee Marble Co.
Additional data have been withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary information.
Slate.--
Slate was produced by 13 companies that operated 16 quarries in 5 States.
Production decreased to 23,900 t in 2001 U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK--2001 from 29,600 t in 2000.
The value increased by about 5% to $14.9 million in 2001 from $14.2 million in 2000 (table 12).
The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
Additional data have been withheld to avoid disclosing company propriety information.
Consumption Rough stone represented 50% of the tonnage and 41% of the value of all dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, which included exports.
The largest uses of rough stone, by tonnage, were in construction (38%) and monumental (26%) applications.
Dressed stone represented 50% by tonnage and 59% by value of the total stone sold or used.
The largest uses of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in flagging (26%), curbing (21%), and ashlars and partially squared pieces (14%) (table 7).
Uses for the different varieties of dimension stone varied considerably.
The major uses of granite sold or used in 2001, by tonnage, were in curbing (31%), monumental rough stone (25%), monumental dressed stone (13%), rough blocks for construction (12%), and ashlars and partial squared pieces (1%) (table 8).
Primary uses of limestone, by tonnage, were in rough blocks for building and construction (42%) and ashlars and partially squared pieces (14%) (table 9).
Primary uses of marble, by tonnage, were rough blocks for building and construction (27%), and monumental rough stone, which included unspecified and unlisted uses (25%) (table 10).
Primary uses of sandstone, by tonnage, were in dressed stone for flagging (61%) and rough blocks for building and construction (16%) (table 11).
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 2001, by tonnage, was principally for flooring (40%), roofing (34%), and flagging (10%) (table 12).
Overall, the value of apparent consumption of dimension stone in the United States was estimated to be $1.25 billion in 2001; this was an increase of about 8% compared with that of 2000.
Apparent consumption is defined as production plus imports for consumption minus exports.
Value data are used in the apparent consumption calculation because tonnage data are not available for imports and exports.
Also, changes in industry stocks are not considered because the data are not available.
Prices The average 2001 value for dimension stone was $216 per metric ton; this was an increase of 21% from that of 2000 based on the USGS survey.
The average unit values for different types of dimension stone were granite, $262 per ton; limestone, $214 per ton; sandstone, $126 per ton; marble, $312 per ton; and slate, $623 per ton.
Available price data show considerable variation.
Prices are substantially different not only for the kind of stone, but also for the appearance of the same kind of stone.
Color, grain structure, and finish contribute significantly to price and marketability.
STONE, DIMENSION--2001 Foreign Trade Exports.--In 2001, total exports of dimension stone increased in value by about 23% to about $73.5 million compared with those of 2000; granite accounted for 66% of the export value.
The largest share of granite was exported to China (table 13).
Although unreported, a significant amount of granite was probably reexported back to the U.S. market.
Imports.--The value of imports for consumption of dimension stone types increased in 2001 by about 8.5% to $1.07 billion.
Italy, which continued to be the major single source of granite, accounted for 39% of granite imports.
Other important granite import sources included Brazil (18%), India (13%), and Canada (10%) (table 14).
Italy also was a major source of rough and dressed marble and travertine imports (tables 15, 16).
Duties on imported dimension stone are listed in table 2.
World Review World dimension stone production, which excluded that of the United States, was estimated to be approximately 67 Mt in 2001; this was an increase of about 5 Mt compared with that of 2000.
Although some small-scale production probably occurred in the majority of the world's nations, dimension stone was produced and officially reported in about 34 countries.
The top five producing countries in 2001, in descending order by tonnage, were China, Italy, India, Iran, and Spain.
These countries accounted for about 74% of the world production.
The United States ranked 10th in world production of dimension stone in 2001 (Internazionale Marmi e Macchine Carrara S.p.A., 2002Ã¯Â¿Â½1).
Outlook The renewed growth experienced by the U.S. dimension stone industry in recent years was dealt a setback by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
An economic slowdown was already in progress, however, by the time the event happened.
In the months after the event, the industry rebounded to levels that were consistent with the prior 2 years' performance.
Dimension stone sales during the near term are expected to remain level.
For residential and office building construction, growth in the use of dimension stone is expected in new prestige markets for home improvement as well as in renovations to attract and keep tenants.
Conversely, some sectors of the stone industry report a lack of skilled labor at quarries and that in recent years competent masons have left the stone industry for morelucrative and higher paying building projects, such as courthouses, schools, and restorations.
