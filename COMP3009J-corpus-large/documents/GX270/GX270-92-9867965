INTRODUCTION The Teen Living curriculum framework was developed by a team comprised of Idaho Professional-Technical Education staff and Idaho State University personnel.
The curriculum team developed the Teen Living framework from the National Standards for Family and Consumer Sciences Education, the previous Idaho Teen Living guide, Idaho State recommended texts, other states' curricula, and a review of literature pertaining to curriculum content.
A committee of selected Idaho teachers participated in the review process.
This statewide curriculum reflects the knowledge and skills recommended for 9th and 10th grade students.
Students completing the Teen Living course are better prepared for the challenges of living and working in today's society.
The competency-based curriculum framework format provides a means for monitoring student progress and generating student profiles.
The student profile is a cumulative record of student progress and provides documentation of competence.
The Teen Living statewide curriculum framework is intended to be the fundamental guide to schools for program content.
Schools offering Family and Consumer Sciences education should use an advisory committee to consider local and community needs.
