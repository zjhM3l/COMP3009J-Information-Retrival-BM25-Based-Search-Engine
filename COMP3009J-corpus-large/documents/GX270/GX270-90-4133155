STONE, D IMENSION By Thomas P. Dolley Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Samir Hakim, statistical assistant.
Dimension stone is a natural rock material quarried for the purpose of obtaining blocks or slabs that meet specifications as to size (width, length, and thickness) and shape (Barton, 1968, p. 4).
Color, grain texture and pattern, and surface finish of the stone are also normal requirements by both customers and the stone industry.
Durability (essentially based on mineral composition, hardness, and past performance), strength, and the ability of the stone to take a polish are other important selection criteria.
Although various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are used as dimension stone, the principal rock types are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Other varieties of dimension stone that are normally considered to be special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc), and various products fashioned from natural stone.
U.S. production of dimension stone in 2002 was estimated to be 1.26 million metric tons (Mt) valued at $254 million, which was about a 3.4% decrease in value compared with that of 2001.
U.S. production tonnage of dimension stone in 2002 increased by 3.3% compared with that of 2001.
Exports decreased by about 12% in value to $64.4 million, and imports for consumption increased by 11% in value to about $1.2 billion.
The value of apparent consumption was estimated to be $1.38 billion.
In recent years, most dimension stone has been used in construction applications with the largest portions being sold or used as ashlars and partially squared pieces, curbing, flagstone, and rough block for building and construction.
Monumental stone, another major type, includes memorials of various kinds.
Dimension stone production data for the United States are derived by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from a voluntary canvass of U.S. quarry producers of rough and dressed dimension stone.
Data in this report cover rough crude quarried stone, irregular-shaped and rectangular blocks, and more highly processed stone.
A number of other terms also are used to describe further processing, such as "worked," "dressed," "finished," and "manufactured."
These and other terms used by the dimension stone industry describe such features as the mineral composition of the rock, the shape of the product, the method of finishing a stone, and the type of finish applied (Stone World, 2002, p. 106-139).
No adjustments are made in the data to account for the sometimes substantial losses in processing rough stone into dressed stone.
Sold or used data are considered to be equivalent to production because changes in stocks are not surveyed.
Of the 220 producing dimension stone operations included in the survey for 2002, 103 (47%) responded, which represented 59% of the tonnage; the remaining tonnage was estimated based, in part on prior years' reporting (table 1).
Description and Terminology Scientific and commercial descriptions of various dimension stone types overlap.
The scientific description of dimension stone types is focused primarily on the stone's geographic locality and mineralogical composition, whereas the commercial description is focused primarily on the locality and color of the stone.
Furthermore, various combinations of the scientific and commercial descriptions are used by stone producers to market their stone products effectively.
The descriptions that follow were adapted from Currier (1960, p. 1-10) and Barton (1968, p. 2-8).
Granite.--Commercial granites include all feldspathic crystalline rocks of mainly interlocking texture and with individual mineral grains that are visible to the naked eye.
This category includes such rock types as anorthosite, gneiss, granodiorite, monzonite, syenite, and all other intermediate igneous and coarse-grained metamorphic rock types.
Primary colors of granites are white, gray, pink, and red; green and brown are secondary colors.
Although black granites are also included in this category and range in color from dark gray to black, they are not true granites mineralogically but rather mafic rocks, such as diabases, diorites, gabbros, and similar rocks.
Limestone.--Commercial limestones are rocks of sedimentary origin that primarily comprise calcium carbonate with or without magnesium.
Included in this category are calcitic limestone, dolomite, dolomitic limestone, and travertine, which is a calcitic rock that is precipitated from hot springs.
Marble.--Commercial marble includes metamorphosed limestones and serpentine rocks, all of which are capable of taking a polish.
An important member of this classification is serpentine marble, which is also known as verde antique, and comprises green-to-black serpentine, which is a hydrous magnesium silicate mineral that is crisscrossed by veins of lighter minerals, such as calcite or dolomite.
Sandstone.--Commercial sandstone is a lithified sand that comprises chiefly quartz or quartz and feldspar with a fragmental (clastic) texture.
Sandstone contains interstitial cementing materials, such as calcite, clay, iron oxides, or silica.
Arkose (abundant feldspar grains), graywacke (abundant rock fragments), and conglomerates are included in this category.
Other members of this category include bluestone, which is a dense, hard, fine-grained feldspathic sandstone that splits easily along planes into thin, smooth slabs; brownstone, which is feldspathic sandstone of brown to reddish-brown color owing to abundant iron oxide; and flagstone, which is a sandstone or slate, typically red, tan or gray, that splits into large, thin slabs.
Slate.--Commercial slate is a microgranular metamorphic rock formed by the recrystallization of clay sediments, such as claystone, shale, or siltstone.
Characterized by excellent parallel cleavage, slates may be easily split into relatively thin slabs.
STONE, DIMENSION--2002 73.1
Greenstone.--Commercial greenstones are the result of the metamorphosis of basaltic rocks.
Greenstone is named because of the predominance of greenish minerals, such as actinolite, chlorite, or epidote.
Basalt and Traprock.--Commercial basalt and traprock includes igneous rocks that are too fine grained to be termed "black granite."
The name traprock is derived from the Swedish word "trappa," which means step, because of the characteristic terraced or steplike appearance of certain basalt lava fields.
This category includes extrusive igneous rocks, such as andesite, basalt, or dacite, and intrusive igneous rocks, such as amphibolites, diabase, diorites, fine-grained gabbros, peridotites, and pyroxenites.
Miscellaneous.--This category includes commercial dimension stone types that do not easily fall into the aforementioned categories, such as soapstone, steatite, or talc, which contains various amounts of the mineral talc.
Additional miscellaneous dimension stones include diatomite, mylonites, pumice, schist, tripoli, tuff, porous or scoriaceous volcanic rocks, or any other rocks used as building stones.
Production Rough stone blocks split or cut from a quarry face are transported to processing plants that are frequently located at the quarry site, at least for preliminary sizing.
Further dressing, which includes final sizing and finishing operations, such as decorating, edging, and polishing, also may be done at the quarry site.
In 2002, granite accounted for 431,000 t (34%) of the total domestic dimension stone production of 1.26 Mt, followed by limestone (28%), sandstone (16%), marble (5%), slate (1%), and miscellaneous stone (16%).

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK--2002
Consumption Rough stone represented about 52% of the tonnage and 41% of the value of all dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, which included exports.
The largest uses of rough stone, by tonnage, were in construction (44%) and irregular-shaped stone (23%) applications.
Dressed stone represented 48% by tonnage and 59% by value of the total stone sold or used.
The largest uses of dressed stone, by tonnage, were in flagging (26%), curbing (21%), and ashlars and partially squared pieces (15%) (table 7).
Uses for the different varieties of dimension stone varied considerably.
The major uses of granite sold or used in 2002, by tonnage, were in curbing (30%), monumental rough stone (23%), monumental dressed stone (15%), and rough blocks for construction (12%) (table 8).
Primary uses of limestone, by tonnage, were in rough blocks for building and construction (51%) and ashlars and partially squared pieces (15%) (table 9).
Primary uses of marble, by tonnage, were dressed stone for slabs and blocks, flagging, monumental, panels and veneer, ashlars and partially squared pieces, tile, and unspecified and unlisted uses (53%) and rough blocks for building and construction (27%) (table 10).
Primary uses of sandstone, by tonnage, were in dressed stone for flagging (63%) and rough blocks for building and construction (15%) (table 11).
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 2002, by tonnage, was principally for flooring (48%), roofing (18%), and flagging (15%) (table 12).
Overall, the value of apparent consumption of dimension stone in the United States was estimated to be $1.38 billion in 2002; this was an increase of about 10% compared with that of 2001.
Apparent consumption is defined as production plus imports for consumption minus exports.
Value data are used in the apparent consumption calculation because tonnage data are not available for imports and exports.
Also, changes in industry stocks are not considered because the data are not available.
Prices The average 2002 value for dimension stone was $201 per metric ton; this was a decrease of 7% from that of 2001 based on the USGS canvass.
The average unit values per metric ton for different types of dimension stone were granite, $252 per ton; limestone, $194 per ton; sandstone, $116 per ton; marble, $294 per ton; and slate, $614 per ton.
Available price data show considerable variation.
Prices are substantially different not only for the kind of stone, but also for the appearance of the same kind of stone.
Color, grain structure, and finish contribute significantly to price and marketability.
Foreign Trade Exports.--In 2002, total exports of dimension stone decreased in value by about 12% to about $64.4 million compared with those of 2001; granite accounted for 68% of the export value.
The largest share of granite was exported to China (table 13).
Although unreported, a significant amount of granite was probably reexported back to the U.S. market.
Imports.--The value of imports for consumption of dimension stone types increased in 2002 by 11% to $1.19 billion.
Italy, which continued to be the major single source of granite, accounted for 35% of granite imports by value.
Other important granite import sources included Brazil (23%), India (14%), and China (9%) (table 14).
Italy also was a major source of rough and dressed marble imports (tables 15, 16).
Duties on imported dimension stone are listed in table 2.
World Review World dimension stone production, which excluded that of the United States, was estimated to be approximately 76 Mt in 2002; this was an increase of about 400,000 t compared with that of 2001.
Although there was probably some small-scale production in the majority of the world's nations, dimension stone was produced and officially reported in about 35 countries.
The top five producing countries in 2002, in descending order by tonnage, were China, Italy, India, Iran, and Spain.
These countries accounted for about 73% of the world's production.
The United States ranked 11th in world production of dimension stone in 2002 (Internazionale Marmi e Macchine Carrara S.p.A., 2003Â§1).
Outlook Dimension stone sales during the near term are expected to remain level.
For residential and office building construction, growth in the use of dimension stone is expected in new prestige markets for home improvement as well as in renovations to attract and keep tenants.
Conversely, some sectors of the stone industry report a lack of skilled labor at quarries and that, in recent years, competent masons have left the stone industry for more lucrative and higher paying building projects, such as courthouses, schools, and restorations.
