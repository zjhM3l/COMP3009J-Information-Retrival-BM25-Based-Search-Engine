FOREWORD This new curriculum guide, Clothing Design, will help students make informed choices in selecting, designing, and caring for apparel and textiles.
The Clothing Design Curriculum Guide emphasizes basic skill development in garment construction.
Students develop competence by selecting, using, and caring for supplies and equipment.
They apply technical knowledge and express creativity by designing garments according to individual needs and preferences.
Thematic student activities were developed to achieve the desired outcomes.
The instructional activity themes are: art, basic skills, cognitive, critical thinking, FCCLA, resources, teamwork, technology, and workplace readiness.
These activities are both contextual and authentic.
This course is designed to provide the essential skills for future enrollment in the apparel design career pathway.
The student's interest may be either for practical application or for career development.
It is our goal that students gain skills that will prepare them to be better consumers, citizens, and workers.
We hope this guide will be helpful to you and your students.

USING THE CURRICULUM GUIDE The focus for the Clothing Design course is on what students need to know and be able to do to construct and apply design principles to fashion construction.
With this premise, we must ask the following questions -- "How do we know when they know?" and "How do we know what they can do?" The selected curriculum format model better connects teaching, learning, and assessment.
Thus, a more accurate picture of student progress and learning can be documented and measured.
The competency goals and objectives are broadly constructed key ideas and concepts that encourage creativity.
The strategies are designed to be directly related to a theme.
The activities require students to apply knowledge and perform tasks that represent the practical application and to examine the implications achieving the desired outcome.
It is critical that the course be taught in a setting where students are self-directed and where students are continually assessing their performance.
CURRICULUM PAGE LAYOUT Each curriculum page includes the following information.

Course: Title of Course Unit: Title of Unit Competency Goal and Competency Goal Number: Identifies the competency statement and number based on the course blueprint.
Objective and Objective Number: Identifies the desired student outcome.
Each objective makes a complete statement when combined with the stem "The student will be able to ..."
All objectives are in italics.
The number identifies the objective according to the unit and competency as provided on the course blueprint.
Note that "continued" indicates the second page of activities for an objective; the content outline is repeated on these pages.
Outline: The content outline provides teachers with a base of information to use in covering each object.
Activities: Activities are designed as student strategies around nine instructional activity themes.
See the following Instructional Activities Development Chart for further information.
Activities with this "briefcase" icon beside them are suggested entries for a portfolio.

Behavior: Each objective addresses a specific level.
Learning levels are classified in one or more of the three domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective.
Symbols used on the curriculum page are identified along with appropriate types of tests and test items.
See the following Behaviors Chart for further information.
Resources: Resources are listed by competency goal on a separate page.
Each page follows the respective competency goal.
8.
USING SCENARIOS A unique feature in this curriculum guide are scenarios.
Scenarios are authentic life and work situations that place skills and knowledge in the context where the task is to be performed.
Scenarios engage students in seeking information and reasoning through a practical problem and help students apply information to solve a practical problem.
Practical problems are complex ethical questions about what is best to do.
They also provide authentic situations where the learner is to decide on and take a course of action.
In both situations, it is critical that time be taken to reflect on the action taken.
Units of instruction or lessons begin with a practical problem sometimes posed by the teacher and sometimes by students.
The most meaningful learning often comes from practical problems that emerge during discussions.
Competency goals and objectives are the basis for the development and assessment of instructional scenarios.
Several examples have been provided.
They were developed within units of instruction.
The format for developing scenarios is as follows.
Â· Â· Â· Â· Your are (real context).
You are facing (a problem) .
Your will need to (pose a solution) .
Present your (authentic presentation) .

Working with Special Populations Students in Family and Consumer Sciences Education A critical component of success is a comprehensive career development plan prepared for each student moving through a course sequence.
This career education process must start early in order for students to develop enough experience from which they can make meaningful and realistic career decisions.
Special needs students often lack experiences due to the nature of the disability or disadvantagement.
Thus, a career path must be created along the educational continuum.
Career education is a lifelong process that requires that individuals continually receive new information and experiences in order to shape and develop their lives.
The career foundation needs to start in the elementary grades with career awareness.
This is the time when students start to learn about the world around them.
They need to have opportunities to become aware of the community and discover what people do to make the community function.
Career exploration needs to occur during the middle school years.
A specific career plan needs to be developed that will enable the special needs student to start creating a career path.
The career path is not a career choice, it is only a directional indicator.
Formal and informal assessments should be given to generate some data on student likes and dislikes.
Much of the timing of these assessments and the career information collected will be dependent upon the maturity level of the students.
As the students progress through the educational system, more information about them can be secured and used in the development of their Career Development Plan.
The students can enter into the community and create a career diary through the writing of a two-three page paper for English class, or create a video or audiotape explaining what they have learned.
This is the first step in the integration of academics and vocational education.
During the high school years, more formal planning can be done in relation to the career plan.
The students need to receive career-planning opportunities through time spent with career counselors and/or teachers.
The teachers, both academic and vocational, need to be a part of the career planning process.
They need to assist students in developing an understanding of how learning word processing, computer applications, biology or chemistry, applied math or algebra fits into their career plan.
For students who do not reach levels of advanced math or chemistry, the application of applied information needs to be explained.
July 2000
7035 Clothing Design - Page 33
As special needs students complete their final year(s) in secondary school, they will need a plan to market themselves as part of their career portfolio.
The students need opportunities to develop skills in filling out applications, interviewing, dressing appropriately and behaving in socially acceptable ways.
To develop these skills, they will need to review rigorous interview questions, meet and respond to stressful situations, and other interviewing techniques.
All of these areas can be mastered through repeated opportunities for practice.
The development of a career plan for special needs students must include communication among the students, parents, teachers (vocational, academic, resource) and counselors.
The career plan is to be used only as a guide as the students make their way along the educational continuum.
The plan will help students get a clearer picture of what careers are and how they can be a part of it.
Without a plan, they will just take courses to fulfill graduation requirements without seeing where all of their efforts are leading.
At high school graduation, special needs students should be able, through their career plan and the career portfolio, to see what the next step options are in the sequence and be able to take those steps confidently and successfully.
Conclusion Special needs students have a place in Family and Consumer Sciences Education programs.
The key to success for these students is the development of a career continuum that will enable them to select the course sequences that will best fit their needs, while giving them the necessary support services.
These students need to be able to focus on developing their basic literacy skills, problem-solving abilities, work-entry skills and citizenship.
Family and Consumer Sciences Education programs can provide them with opportunities to develop these needed competencies--if all the members of the educational and community partnership feel they have a role to play and understand how they can fulfill their role.
Communication between and among all of the participants in the next few years will determine if the student will be successful! For our nation to be competitive internationally, and economically strong domestically, Family and Consumer Sciences Education programs must assure ALL students are successful.

Suggested Strategies for Teaching Special Populations General Strategies 1. Make a copy of notes and directions the student can keep at his/her desk.
2.
Provide the student with an example of how the final copy will appear as a guide.
(Many of these students are visual learners and need visual guides.)
They may need these guides for a longer length of time than other students.
3. Use peer proofing of documents to be graded.
Allow students to proof documents before they are turned in to you.
Students will teach each other.
4.
If extra time is needed or specified in the student's IEP, you may do one of the following: Â· Â· Â· Set up a designated time that the student will be allowed to come back to finish assignments.
Get approval from parents since they may have to furnish transportation.
(Parents need to be involved.)
Decide in advance of making an assignment of the amount of work/number of assignments you expect from the student.
Let them know what you expect.
Contracts work well with students.
Make sure both the teacher and the students sign the contract to indicate what is due and when it will be due.
Do not change the contract once it has been agreed upon.
Set guidelines as to how you will handle late work.
EXAMPLES: Late work will not be accepted.
All completed work must be turned in on the established date and will be graded on what is complete.
Points will be deducted for all work not completed.
Work may be turned in late, points will be deducted for each day late.
EXPECT QUALITY--NOT QUANTITY--FROM YOUR STUDENTS!
July 2000
7035 Clothing Design - Page 35
Strategies for Students with Visual Impairments 1.
If you know in advance that a student with visual impairment will be in your class, ask that braille/large print books be ordered.
These are available for state adopted textbooks.
Ask for tapes to accompany the books.
2.
If the student's sight is limited, you might use ZOOM TEXT software for the computer.
It enlarges the text on the screen.
3.
If the student is totally blind, you might ask the school system to purchase DECTALK or JAWS 2 for the computer.
DECTALK makes the computer keyboard talk to the students.
JAWS 2 reads the screen to the student.
4. Make your own tapes.
Remember to spell difficult words and to read punctuation and new paragraphs.
5.
Get the dictaphones out and teach your student to use them.
They work much better than a regular tape recorder.
Strategies for Students with Hearing Impairments 1.
Allow student preferential seating, moving about the room where he/she can hear best.
2.
If he/she has an auditory trainer or hearing aid, make sure they use it.
Ask if you are not sure.
3.
Give written directions to the student.
(They do not like to ask for extra help.
Asking "Do you understand" does not help--they will not admit they do not understand.)
4.
REMEMBER--If you make an oral change in directions, make sure to explain to the student.
They may not hear oral changes after they begin work.
5.
Ask the student to explain what is expected.
6. Use visual examples to explain what you expect.
Many times this is easier than trying to explain orally.
7.
DO NOT yell at the student.
It is embarrassing and generally does not help.
Write instructions whenever possible.
Strategies for Students with Other Health Impairments 1.
IBM offers an adaptive keyboard for students who have limited use of their hands.
Call IBM for information.
Key guards are available from IBM to assist with finger isolation.
2. Make sure the student is comfortable.
Use boxes to keep feet flat if a student's feet will not reach the floor.
3.
Contact your nearest local occupational therapist.
They have knowledge of many types of adaptive equipment.
4.
Contact your community college or university.
Many have someone who works with special populations on their campus and can offer suggestions.

MORE STUDENT ORIENTED TEACHING STRATEGIES FOR VOCATIONAL/ACADEMIC EDUCATORS Ã¾ Maintain structure in the student's environment.
Ã¾ Seat the students with their back to other students or have them sit in the front of the room to reduce distraction.
Ã¾ Provide oral directions and assignments for students with reading or comprehension difficulties.
Ã¾ Utilize peer tutors to increase interaction between students with and without disabilities.
Ã¾ Provide the student the opportunity to utilize untimed test or use of a writer, reader, word processor, or to be administered an oral test to demonstrate their competencies.
Ã¾ Allow the student the opportunity to demonstrate newly acquired competencies through direct application in laboratory settings.
Ã¾ Use a 3 x 5 card with a cutout window for the student to follow the next material.
Ã¾ Provide written assignments and directions for students with auditory problems.
Ã¾ Allow another student do duplicate notes for students who have difficulty writing or listening and writing simultaneously.
Ã¾ Require student to summarize content or outline information using their own language to help them to select the essential from the details and for comprehension.
July 2000
7035 Clothing Design - Page 38
MORE TEACHER ORIENTED TEACHING STRATEGIES FOR VOCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC TEACHERS Â· Â· Â· Encourage vocational and academic teachers to model appropriate behaviors and provide opportunities for the student to practice the new behavior.
Design a program in collaboration with academic teachers for vocational teachers to teach the students how to prioritize assignments.
Utilize a system of writing technical words, difficult to spell words, or words with the same meanings on the board.
It may be helpful to explain the word, so the teacher and students are operating on the same knowledge level.
Break vocational and academic learning tasks into smaller steps for students who cannot handle more global concepts.
Inform the students of the necessity to pay attention to the variables within a problem or statement in vocational and academic areas.
Provide opportunities for the students to learn appropriate rate, tone, and style of speech in vocational and academic settings.
Have all vocational and academic teachers include basic skills objectives and instructional activities in their lesson plans and constantly review plans for mastering.
Using visual aids, such as transparencies, diagrams, sketches, graphs, maps, charts, globes, or models to help explain difficult concepts in the vocational and academic area.
Institute daily summaries of important points or facts before the end of class either by the vocational or academic teacher.
Present material that the student can relate to in a daily situation.
Link new ideas to the student's experience level or related math or science concepts to the vocational aspect of the problem.
Utilize short sentences or phrases, also short and clearly written directions, for those individuals who have trouble following complex sentences or directions in vocational or academic settings.

Face the student when speaking providing them the opportunity to read and interpret the gestures of the lesson in vocational or academic courses.
Utilize team teaching when possible--this permits more attention to the individual student and takes the pressure off the vocational and academic teachers.
Cue the students, so they know when they are going to be asked a question.
Ask questions that the student knows the answer--this helps build confidence in answering questions in vocational academic subjects.
Establish assessment procedures for vocational and academic teachers to determine if the student has the skill and is not using the skill or if the skill is not in the student's repertoire.
Utilize guided notes (teacher provides students with daily lecture notes with blank spaces appearing periodically in the text).
Provide vocational and academic teachers the opportunity to develop and plan joint activities to avoid last minute changes.
Prepare vocational and academic lessons in sequential steps to provide the students easy access to new material.
Institute daily reviews by vocational and academic teachers and reteach any skill or step not mastered by the students.
Review the student work often, checking for omission, transposition, or reversal of letters or numbers in vocational or academic work.
Provide opportunities for the students to transfer from a vocational setting to an academic setting by preparing them for transference of these skills to community and employment settings.
Underlining or circling important words or phrases help call attention to important keywords or phrases in vocational and academic subjects.
Repeat words, points, or definitions--tell the student this is important; that they may see this information again; or they may be using this information later in their vocational or academic classes.

Make sure the instructional level of the material is in congruence with the reading and functioning level of the individual.
This is another way for vocational and academic teachers to collaborate.
List answers to multiple choice questions vertically rather than horizontally in vocational and academic subjects.
Utilize large print for those who have difficulty reading small print in vocational and academic arenas.
Offer praise and rewards appropriately by the vocational and academic teachers, especially in the other's subject.
Utilize a study review or study rehearsal strategy for preparing vocational students in the academic portion of the class.
Serving Special Populations in Family and Consumer Sciences Education Programs
Â· Â· Â· Â·
Defining Special Needs Students Vocational legislation has defined two distinct populations that are to be served within Workforce Development Education.
These populations are students who are disadvantaged (economic and academic) and students with disabilities.
Economically Disadvantaged The economically disadvantaged students are those who come from a family setting where they do not meet the minimum family income guidelines as established by the United States Department of Agriculture.
These income amounts vary depending upon the number of people in the home and the geographic location.
By being below these income amounts, the students are eligible for free or reduced lunches and Chapter 1 programs.
For record keeping purposes, the same guidelines are used for special services using vocational funds.
Academically Disadvantaged Academically disadvantaged students do not fit easily within a category of eligibility.
Academically disadvantaged students are those who may manifest some of the following characteristics: potential dropouts, do not identify with school, teen parents,
July 2000
7035 Clothing Design - Page 41
troubled home life or trouble with the law.
They are typically two or more grade levels behind chronological age peers and are in need of support services that will assist them in seeing application of school knowledge to real life settings.
Students with Disabilities The information on the following pages defines the disabilities that qualify children and youth for special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
DISABILITIES WHICH QUALIFY CHILDREN AND YOUTH FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) AUTISM A developmental disorder that is characterized by significant and pervasive impairment in several areas of development: reciprocal social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of restricted and/or repetitive behavior, interests and activities.
Autism alone, and together with the co-existing conditions, significantly affects educational programming, planning and performance.
BEHAVIORALLY-EMOTIONALLY DISABLED School-aged students who, after receiving specially designed educational support services and intervention strategies in the regular educational setting, still exhibit patterns of situationally inappropriate interpersonal behavior of such frequency, duration, and intensity to disrupt the student's own learning process.
Frequency, duration, and intensity are long-standing patterns of behavior which occur regularly and often enough as to interfere consistently with the student's own learning process.
A behavioralemotional disability is evidenced by one or more of the following characteristics which cannot be attributed primarily to physical, sensory, or intellectual deficits: (a) inability to achieve adequate academic progress (not due to a learning disability); (b) inability to maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships; (c) inappropriate or immature types of behavior or feelings under normal conditions; (d) a general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression; (e) a tendency to develop physical symptoms, pains or fears associated with personal or school problems.
The term does not include the socially maladjusted student unless it is determined that he/she is also behaviorally-emotionally disabled.
DEAF-BLIND Concomitant hearing and visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe communication and other developmental problems that a child cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for deaf children or blind children.

HEARING IMPAIRED (DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING) Hearing impaired children are those with hearing losses which are disabling educationally and developmentally and who, with or without amplification, may require various instructional modifications and related services in order to make full use of their learning opportunities.
Hearing impaired is a generic term that includes deafness and all hearing losses ranging from mild to profound.
MULTIHANDICAPPED A pervasive primary disability that is cognitive and/or behavioral in combination with one or more other disabilities, the combination of which causes such developmental and educational problems that the children cannot be accommodated in special programs that primarily serve one area of disability.
MENTALLY DISABLED Mentally disabled refers to significantly subaverage general cognitive functioning and a reduced rate of learning.
This condition exists concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior, is manifested during the developmental period, and adversely affects the student's educational performance.
ORTHOPEDICALLY IMPAIRED School-age orthopedically impaired children possess a severe orthopedic impairment that adversely affects their educational performance.
The term includes impairments caused by congenital abnormalities and impairments from other causes.
OTHER HEALTH IMPAIRED Having limited strength, vitality or alertness, due to chronic or acute health problems such as a heart condition, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, epilepsy, lead poisoning, leukemia, or diabetes, which adversely affects a child's educational performance.
SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABLED Denotes various processing disorders presumed to be intrinsic to an individual (e.g., acquisition, organization, retrieval, or expressions of information).
For the purpose of special education services, school-age students classified as learning disabled are those who, after receiving instructional intervention in the regular education setting, have a substantial discrepancy between ability and achievement.
The disability is manifested by substantial difficulties in the acquisition and use of skills in listening comprehension, oral expression, written expression, basic reading, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, and mathematics resasoning.
A learning disability may occur concomitantly with, but is not the primary result of other disabilities and/or environmental, cultural, and/or economic influences.

SPEECH-LANGUAGE IMPAIRED A disorder in articulation, language, voice, and/or fluency.
A speech-language impairment may range in severity from mild to severe.
It may be developmental or acquired, and pupils may demonstrate one or any combination of the four parameters listed above.
A speech-language impairment may result in a primary disability or it may be secondary to other disabilities.
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY An acquired open or closed head injury caused by an external physical force that impairs a student's cognitive, communicative, perceptual, behavioral, social-emotional, and/or physical abilities to the extent that the student requires special education.
Congenital, degenerative, or brain injuries induced by birth trauma are not included in this definition.
VISUALLY IMPAIRED A visual impairment which, even with correction, adversely affects a child's educational performance.
The term includes both blindness and partial sightedness.
