Population-Based Guidelines for Diabetes Mellitus
Introduction Purpose of the Guidelines These guidelines have been developed to define appropriate measures for monitoring the quality of medical care provided to a population of people with diabetes.
Diabetes is an expensive condition, costing over $1.2 billion dollars in Oregon in 1997 for direct and indirect expenses.
An estimated 216,000 Oregonians may be at risk of suffering from the complications of diabetes including blindness, end - stage renal disease, heart disease, stroke and lower extremity amputations.
Many of the adverse outcomes associated with diabetes are preventable, or at least can be delayed.
Good diabetes medical care is an essential component of a strategy to reduce the onset and severity of complications and improve the quality of life for people with diabetes.
Many medical systems and providers are committed to improved quality of care for their patients with diabetes.
These guidelines have been created to define a common means to measure the success of the effort.
The guidelines do not address all the care a patient with diabetes may need; they are not therapeutic treatment guidelines.
Rather these guidelines are a set of important procedures that are measurable for defined populations and appropriate for systematic monitoring.
These guidelines augment clinical practice guidelines such as those of the American Diabetes Association.
The evidence for these population- based guidelines is strongest for people aged 18 to 75.
The very young and very old may need care which is different from that described here.
Progress in Better Diabetes Care The quality of care provided to people with diabetes in Oregon, as measured in these guidelines, has improved.
According to statewide surveys of people with diabetes, the nine guidelines addressed show improvements.
Data fro m Medicare and from managed care plans also show improvements.

How to Use the Diabetes Guidelines Though these guidelines will find many purposes, they have been specifically designed to be used by health systems that provide care to defined populations.
By combining recommended procedures with population- based measures of success in delivering those procedures, the stage is set for continuous monitoring and improvement of specific processes of care.
Quality improvement programs are urged to use this document to identify improvement projects and to assess their success.
Health Systems that have a continuous process to (a) identify the population of members who have diabetes (b) track their current status regarding procedures, (c) trigger and support provider actions in response to that information in a timely way, and (d) give aggregate information to the providers of care will be most successful in improving the quality of care described in the guidelines.
How the Guidelines Were Developed The guidelines were developed through a collaborative effort of clinicians, educators, health plan administrators, epidemiologists, and people with diabetes.
They are largely based on the results of clinical trials which have demonstrated an effect on the development or progression of specific diabetes complications.
This 2002 edition is the third revision of the guidelines, which were first released in provisional form in October 1995.
Comments, literature reviews and review by an expanded advisory group have resulted in some content and format revisions and the addition of one guideline since the 1999 edition.

The Diabetes Guidelines Format Each of the 13 guidelines has two parts: (1) Clinical Recommendations These define the relevant population to receive specific procedures on a certain delivery schedule .
These recommended procedures are useful to a wide variety of audiences and have been summarized in "At A Gla nce: Recommended Procedures."
(2) Quality Measures.
These define the clinical documentation and the short, intermediate and long- term population measures which are appropriate to monitor the quality of care within a health system and the outcomes affected by that care.
These are useful to organizations and providers developing systems for continuous quality improvement and are summarized in "At A Glance: Population Based Measures."
Diagnostic Criteria The International Expert Committee, sponsored by the American Diabetes Association has defined and described diabetes.
See Report of The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus: 25:(Supplement 1), Jan 2002, S140147.
1.
Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration 
Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal.
The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.

FPG 
Fasting is de fined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h. or 3.

The test should be performed as described by WHO*, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75- g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.
In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, these criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day.
The third measure (OGTT) is not recommended for routine clinical use.

Eye Examination Clinical Recommendations Category of Patient A Persons with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes without previously identified retinal pathology.
B Persons with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with positive findings on routine exam; see "Referral Criteria for Patient Category B," below.
Recommended Procedure Schedule Dilated eye exam or Type 1: Start 5 years after equivalent,* by an diagnosis, then annually.
ophthalmologist or optometrist** Type 2: Annually.*** Examination by ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy.
Exam and/or consult within 1 week after new positive findings of referral criteria by examiner.
Follow up appointments to be determined by the designated ophthalmologist.
*Any other method of retinal screening must be as sensitive as the dilated eye exam in detecting diabetic retinopathy.
**May be performed by a primary care physician who is specially trained in dilated eye exams.
***Organizations with comprehensive dat a systems may determine that biannual exams are sufficient for Type 2 patients who have had diabetes for less than 10 years, who are not on insulin, who have well controlled HbA1c, and whose most recent exam was normal.
Referral Criteria for Patient Category B: 1.
A positive history of sudden, unilateral, uncorrectable vision change.
2.
Any evidence of retinopathy associated with unexplained and uncorrectable vision change.
3.
Dilated eye exam showing any of the following: o a. new or abnormal blood vessels on the optic nerve or elsewhere on the retina o b. any significant abnormality in or near the macula (e.g., hard exudates, hemorrhages beyond dot hemorrhages, or retinal edema) o c. any other abnormality of concern to the examiner.
4.
Inability to adequately visualize retina.
Suggestions for Implementation: Â· Â· Â· Designate which providers in your system are fully trained and competent in examining the interior of the eye, for performing the routine dilated eye exam.
Designate which ophthalmologists in your system are knowledgeable and experienced in the management and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
Your system will need an operational definition of blindness for measurement purposes.
The legal definition of blindness is corrected vision of 20/200 or worse in the better eye or a visual field of 20 degrees or less in the better eye.
