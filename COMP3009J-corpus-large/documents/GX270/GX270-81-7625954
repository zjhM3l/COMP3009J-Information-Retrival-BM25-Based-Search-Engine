Background
The Sunset Process The regulatory functions of the State Board of Pharmacy (Board) in accordance with Article 22 of Title 12, Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.), shall terminate on July 1, 2003, unless continued by the General Assembly.
During the year prior to this date, it is the duty of the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) to conduct an analysis and evaluation of the Board pursuant to section 24-34-104(9)(b), C.R.S.
The purpose of this review is to determine whether the Board should be continued for the protection of the public and to evaluate the performance of the Board and staff of the Division of Registrations.
During this review, the Board must demonstrate that there is still a need for the regulatory program and that the regulation is the least restrictive consistent with the public interest.
DORA's findings and recommendations are submitted via this report to the legislative committee of reference of the Colorado General Assembly.
Statutory criteria used in sunset reviews may be found in Appendix A on page 61.

Profiles of the Professions Pharmacists According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook 2002-2003 edition, pharmacists dispense drugs prescribed by physicians and other health practitioners and provide information to patients about medications and their use.
They advise physicians and other health practitioners on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications.
Pharmacists must understand the use, composition, and clinical effects of drugs.
Compounding, the actual mixing of ingredients to form powders, tablets, capsules, ointments, and solutions, is only a small part of a pharmacist's practice, because most medicines are produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form.
Pharmacists in hospitals and clinics dispense medications and advise the medical staff on the selection and effects of drugs.
They may make sterile solutions and buy medical supplies.
They also assess, plan, and monitor drug regimens.
They counsel patients on the use of drugs while in the hospital, and on their use at home when they are discharged.
Pharmacists may also evaluate drug use.
2
Pharmacists who work in home health care monitor drug therapy and prepare medications and solutions for use in the home.
Some pharmacists specialize in specific drug therapy areas, such as psychiatric disorders, intravenous nutrition support, oncology, nuclear pharmacy, and pharmacotherapy.
Approximately three out of five pharmacists work in community pharmacies, either independently owned or part of a drug store chain, grocery store, department store, or mass merchandiser.
A license to practice pharmacy is required in all states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.
To obtain a license, one must serve an internship under a licensed pharmacist, graduate from an accredited college of pharmacy, and pass a state examination.
The American Council on Pharmaceutical Education is the accrediting organization that sets standards for pharmacy schools.
The University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center operates the only accredited pharmacy school in Colorado.
In 1998, the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education accredited 81 colleges of pharmacy to confer degrees.
Nearly all pharmacy programs, including the University of Colorado's, grant the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) that requires at least six years of postsecondary study.
A limited number of pharmacy schools continue to award the five-year Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in pharmacy degree.
However, all accredited pharmacy schools are expected to graduate their last B.S. class by the year 2005.
To be eligible for the licensure examination, state boards of pharmacy require either a Pharm.D. or a B.S. degree.
Pharmacy Technicians Pharmacy technicians assist licensed pharmacists by providing medication and other health care products to patients.
Pharmacy technicians who work in retail pharmacies have varying responsibilities, depending on state rules and regulations.
In Colorado, the pharmacist responsible for the prescription or chart order may delegate certain tasks as defined in statute to a pharmacy technician.
The technician is required to be under the supervision of the licensed pharmacist.
3
Pharmacy technicians regularly perform routine tasks to help prepare prescribed medication for patients, such as counting and labeling, weighing, measuring, and sometimes mixing the medication.
Technicians may establish and maintain patient profiles, prepare insurance claim forms, and stock and take inventory of prescription and over-the-counter medications.
A pharmacist must check every prescription before it can be given to a patient.
Technicians refer any questions regarding prescriptions, drug information, or health matters to a pharmacist.
History of Regulation The practice of pharmacy has been regulated in Colorado since 1887, when the General Assembly created the State Board of Pharmacy comprised of pharmacists who had ten years of experience.
At that time, it was unlawful for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to retail or dispense drugs or operate a pharmacy.
Original licensing requirements included graduation from a school of pharmacy and two years of experience, or two years of experience and a passing score on a Board administered examination.
Five years experience was required to operate a pharmacy.
The statute was amended in 1893 to require four years experience for licensure and to regulate specific potent drugs and metals.
Between 1913 and 1917, changes were made to reflect the growing concern with the misuse of dangerous drugs.
Restrictions were placed on the sale of opium, coca leaves and cocaine, and the sale of peyote was forbidden.
In addition, a prescription was required and record keeping standards were implemented.
The 1921 repeal and reenactment of the pharmacy statute authorized the Colorado Pharmacy Association to select the board members.
The statute also listed narcotics and prohibited their sale by any person other than a pharmacist.
In 1945, the statute was further amended to provide for three types of pharmacist licenses: pharmacists, associate pharmacists, and assistant pharmacists.
4
Rule making authority was given to the Board in 1957, as well as the authority to suspend, revoke, or deny a license.
The Board was transferred as a Type 1 policy autonomous board to the Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Registrations by the Administrative Organization Act of 1968.
The statute was repealed and reenacted in 1979, to require registration of prescription drug outlets, non-prescription drug outlets, wholesalers, manufacturers, and nuclear pharmacies.
The Board was authorized to approve new drugs, embargo adulterated or misbranded drugs, and to approve schools of pharmacy.
It was not until 1979 that persons without a degree in pharmacy were excluded from obtaining a pharmacist license.
In 1981, the definition of prescription drug outlets was expanded to include nursing homes, rural health clinics, and family planning clinics.
In 1984, the Board's authority over non-prescription outlets was removed from the statute.
The Board underwent sunset review in 1985 and legislation to continue the Board passed the 1986 General Assembly.
The legislation required persons to pass a jurisprudence examination and amended the process for removing board members by authorizing the Governor to remove members.
The legislation also clarified that a prescription drug outlet may buy controlled substances from another prescription drug outlet.
The legislation also added the provision that the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee for actions in another state that are grounds for discipline in Colorado.
Changes in 1996 were a result of recommendations made in the 1995 Sunset Review.
The amended law consolidated the four classes of pharmacist licensees into one and added a definition of "pharmaceutical care" and "supervision."
In addition, the bill amended the law by creating a provision that required the registration of outlets that provide pharmaceutical care and services.
It also revised the section addressing pharmacist's supervision of unlicensed personnel.
Lastly, it granted the Board authority to issue a confidential letter of concern when an investigation reveals practices that are not violations, but could lead to violations of the statute or Board rules and regulations.

Legal Framework
The Colorado Drugs and Druggists Act (Act) is contained in section 12-22-101, et seq, Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.).
The Act defines the scope of the practice of pharmacists, creates the State Board of Pharmacy (Board), and establishes the framework for the promulgation of rules and regulations by the Board.
The Board licenses and regulates not only pharmacists and pharmacies, but also the distribution system where there is sale, delivery, or distribution of prescription drugs.
The Board consists of five licensed pharmacists and two public members, all appointed by the Governor.
The Act specifies geographical diversity and practice diversity.
The Board is required to meet at least three times a year and elect its own officers.
Definitions are contained in section 12-22-102, C.R.S.
The Act defines outlet as "any prescription drug outlet, hospital, institution, nursing home, rural health clinic, convalescent home, extended care facility, family planning clinic, wholesaler, manufacturer, or mail order vendor, other than a pharmacist, that has facilities in this state registered pursuant to this article and that engages in the dispensing, delivery, distribution, manufacturing, wholesaling, or sale of drugs or devices."
Powers and Duties of the Board The Act empowers the Board to promulgate rules and regulations.
In addition, the Board is empowered to perform a variety of general regulatory functions including granting licenses and registrations, conducting investigations and inspections, administering examinations, controlling and regulating drugs, and impounding and destroying adulterated or misbranded drugs and devices at a prescription drug outlet.
Requirements for Licensing/Registration The Act outlines the application procedures for licensure as a pharmacist and registration as an outlet, manufacturer, or wholesaler.
The Act provides exemption from licensure for hospital residency programs.
The Board may issue a license by transfer to a person licensed by examination and in good standing in another state.
6
The Board is authorized to register various types of facilities including prescription drug outlets; wholesale drug outlets; manufacturing drug outlets; and any other outlets defined that may include rural health clinics, convalescent homes, extended care facilities, animal shelters, jails or prisons, and family planning clinics.
Although prescription drug outlets operated by the State of Colorado or any political subdivision are not required to register, they are required to apply for a certificate of compliance.
Scope of Practice The practice of pharmacy consists of initial interpretation, selection of ingredients, and final evaluation of each prescription order or chart order.
Furthermore, it includes participation in drug selection and utilization of drugs and devices in the treatment of an injury, treatment and prevention of disease, and the counseling of patients and prospective drug review.
In addition, the practice includes the responsibility for the compounding, dispensing, labeling (except nonprescription drugs), delivery, storage, and distribution of drugs and devices and maintenance of proper records.
Discipline The Board is authorized to deny, refuse to renew, restrict, suspend or revoke any license or registration.
The Board is also empowered to issue letters of admonition, letters of concern, and impose probation.
The Act establishes over 20 grounds of unprofessional conduct or grounds for discipline that include such activities as fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit in procuring a license or registration; dependence on, or excessive use of, alcohol or any habitforming drug; obtaining, dispensing, or procuring a drug by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or subterfuge; or affixing a false or forged label to a package containing drugs.
7
In addition, the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee who has dispensed any drug without complying with the labeling, drug identification, and container requirements imposed by law; falsely represented a drug in the manufacturing, processing, packing, distributing, selling or dispensing of such drug; or utilized nonpharmacist personnel in the practice of pharmacy in violation of the delegatory restrictions of the Act.
Continuing Education To renew or reactivate a license, pharmacists are required to complete 24 hours of approved continuing education within the preceding two years.
Failure to obtain the 24 hours of approved continuing pharmaceutical education will result in the license becoming inactive.
Delegation of Duties to Unlicensed Personnel Pharmacists are authorized to supervise up to two unlicensed personnel for duties described in the Act.
This supervision ratio does not include other ancillary personnel who may be employed in the prescription drug outlet such as clerks and those working the cash register.
Labeling Labeling requirements for medications dispensed pursuant to a prescription order must include the name and address of the outlet; the name and address of the patient; identification of the drug; and when applicable, control number, expiration dates, warnings, and precautionary statements.
Licensing of Controlled Substances Part 3 of the Colorado Licensing of Controlled Substances Act authorizes the Board to regulate persons manufacturing and distributing controlled substances.
In addition, the Board issues licenses to humane societies or animal control agencies, which have been in existence for more than five years and who euthanize injured, sick, homeless, or unwanted pets and animals.
8
Persons licensed to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances under the Act are required to keep and maintain records and inventories for two years after the date of transaction.
Records must be kept of any controlled substance lost, destroyed, or stolen; the type and quantity of such substance; and the date of loss, destruction, or theft.
Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program The Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program is utilized by the Board to provide assistance and referral to pharmacists experiencing impaired practice due to psychiatric, psychological, or emotional problems or excessive alcohol or drug use.
The program is primarily funded through the pharmacist licensure renewal process.
Fourteen dollars a year of this fee is appropriated for the program.
Summary of Rules and Regulations The general authority for the promulgation of rules and regulations pertaining to the licensing of pharmacists and registration of facilities, manufacturers, and distributors is set forth in section 12-22-108, C.R.S.
A listing of these rules may be found in Appendix E on page 92.
Controlled Substances Act The regulation of prescription drugs is a shared responsibility of the federal and state governments.
While the federal government has extensive control and record keeping requirements over what may be dispensed, individual states have broad latitude over who may administer, dispense, and prescribe controlled substances.
The federal Controlled Substances Act, which is Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 provides a comprehensive approach to the regulation, manufacture, and distribution of narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, anabolic steroids, and chemicals used in the production of controlled substances.
9
The Controlled Substances Act is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Diversion Control Program.
The DEA's Office of Diversion Control is responsible for two distinct problems: the diversion of controlled pharmaceuticals and the diversion of controlled chemicals.
Many of the narcotics, depressants, and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical uses are subject to abuse and have been brought under legal control.
Under federal law, all businesses that manufacture or distribute controlled drugs; all health professionals authorized to dispense, administer or prescribe them; and all pharmacies permitted to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA.
Registrants must comply with regulatory requirements relating to drug security, records accountability, and adherence to standards.
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Section 809 of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act relates to the practice of drug compounding by a pharmacist.
State licensure laws include compounding as a core component of the profession of pharmacy.
While the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act specifically exempts pharmacies from inspection and registration provisions of this legislation, it has been the contention of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that compounded products are not exempt from the act's new drug provisions.
Medicare Beneficiary Prescription Drug Assistance and Stop-Loss Protection Act of 2000 The Medicare Beneficiary Prescription Drug Assistance and Stop-Loss Protection Act of 2000 provides prescription drug coverage and certain drug therapy management services.
It addresses the inclusion of a drug therapy management program as an outpatient prescription-drug benefit, explicitly recognizing that pharmacists may provide a range of patient-care services that require different commitments of time and resources.

Program Description and Administration
Licensing/Registration The State Board of Pharmacy (Board) in the Division of Registrations within the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) is responsible for the licensing and regulation of pharmacists and pharmacy interns.
The Board is also responsible for the registration and regulation of all pharmacies, wholesalers, packagers, and manufacturers that do business in Colorado.
The Board has the power and duty to inspect all places handling drugs, medicines, and chemicals.
The Board is charged with the enforcement of federal and state prescription drug and controlled substance laws.
There are 7.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees allocated to the program that include a program administrator, 2.5 administrative assistants, and four full-time licensed pharmacists to conduct inspections and investigate complaints.
The administrative assistants process license and registration applications and renewal applications, and provide administrative support to the Board.
Fees are established annually to cash fund administrative expenses and for the Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program.
Table 1 details the Board's expenditures for the past six fiscal years.
Table 1 State Board of Pharmacy Budget Fiscal Year FY 96-97 FY 97-98 FY 98-99 FY 99-00 FY 00-01 FY 01-02 Total Expenditures $720,193 $713,463 $774,865 $788,680 $781,941 $776,115
Colorado currently has 982 registered pharmacies, 419 licensed pharmacy interns, and 5,353 licensed pharmacists.
The Board has also issued registrations to 131 distributors, manufacturers, and wholesalers.
Additionally, the Board issues licenses each year to animal shelters, hospitals, community and rural health clinics, family planning clinics, schools, and jails.
Under the provisions of section 12-22-603 (3)(b), Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.), the Board is required to establish fees for each pharmacist, not to exceed $28 biennially, for the administration of
11
the Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program.
Currently, the fee for a pharmacist license is $233 biennially and the fee for a pharmacist intern license is $41 annually.
The tables below illustrate the categories and numbers of licenses and registrations granted by the Board.

The Board issues licenses to new applicants by examination or by license transfer.
Individuals requesting licensure by examination must submit evidence of completion of an internship, graduation from an educational institution of pharmacy approved by the Board, and successful completion of a Board administered written jurisprudence examination in addition to the national examination.
Persons who produce satisfactory evidence that they have graduated from a school of pharmacy outside of the United States and have passed a foreign graduate equivalency test are eligible to take the national examination.
Applicants for licensure by transfer are required to submit their documentation to a Board designated clearinghouse for review.

Examination The North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) developed by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) is utilized by the Board as part of the assessment of competence to practice pharmacy.
The NAPLEX is a computer-adaptive examination that consists of 185 multiple-choice test questions.
Of these, 150 questions are used to calculate the test score.
A majority of the questions on the NAPLEX are asked in a scenario-based format (i.e, patient profiles with accompanying test questions).
In addition, the computer-based Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) combines national and statespecific legal questions to serve as the state law examination in participating jurisdictions.
The MPJE is based on a national blueprint of pharmacy jurisprudence competencies; however, the questions are tailored to the specific law in Colorado.
13
The Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Examination Committee (FPGEC) Certification program is accepted by more than 40 state boards of pharmacy, including Colorado, as a means of documenting whether an applicant has fulfilled educational equivalency criteria for licensure.
The table below illustrates examination results for fiscal year 9697 through fiscal year 01-02.
As of fiscal year 98-99, NABPLEX was no longer used and was replaced by NAPLEX.
As of fiscal year 00-01, the Colorado jurisprudence examination was no longer used and was replaced by MPJE.

Inspections To successfully implement the pharmacy program, the Board employs four inspectors who are licensed pharmacists to perform routine inspections, and to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Drugs and Druggists Act (Act) and the rules and regulations.
14
During an inspection of a prescription drug outlet, an inspector examines packaging and labeling; dispensing; distribution; and records and record keeping.
An inspection also includes an evaluation of the physical outlet that includes the environment, equipment, security, expired drugs, refrigeration, and employee list.
When inspectors assess a wholesale drug outlet they assess the sanitation, storage, security, records and record keeping, controlled substances records, policy and procedure manual, and drug recalls.
Other drug outlets such as hospitals, community health clinics, schools, and jails are inspected for records of controlled substances, records of dispensing, packaging and labeling of pharmaceuticals, physical premises, and established protocols.
Depending on the severity of the violation(s), inspectors may require immediate correction or give the facility a specified period of time to comply.
Facility inspection is a major part of the program.
Inspectors are responsible for all field inspections whether initiated by a complaint, an application for registration, or a routine inspection.
To determine the most frequent violations cited during inspections, a random survey of five percent of the inspections for fiscal year 01-02 was performed (see Appendix B on page 62).
The most frequent violations cited addressed controlled substances and such issues as the lack of identification of prescriber, lack of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) number, lack of dates of receipt of prescriptions, and deficiencies in DEA inventories.
Inadequate record keeping is another deficiency that is often noted during an inspection.
For example, quantities dispensed were not recorded, prescriptions lacked required patient information that the pharmacist did not secure, and the daily printout lacked critical required information.
As illustrated in Table 6 on the following page, the number of new deficiencies significantly increased from fiscal year 99-00 to fiscal year 00-01.
The number of new deficiencies is significantly greater than the previous year because of vacancies in inspector personnel positions for four months in fiscal year 99-00.
During fiscal year 99-00, modified inspections were performed.
When staff allocations were filled in fiscal year 00-01, inspections were resumed.

Complaints/Disciplinary Actions The Board is charged with handling all complaints against licensees and registrants.
Violations of the Act and of rules and regulations are discovered through a variety of channels such as self-reporting, inspections, consumer complaints, professional complaints, other agency referrals, and malpractice insurance reports.
A majority of the complaints are received from consumers.
The program staff screens complaints to make sure that the Board has jurisdiction to respond and that the complaint rises to the level of being a violation of the Act.
At this point, the licensee is contacted stating the terms of the complaint and a response is requested in writing within 20 days.
Once an inspector has had an opportunity to gather the facts, a report of the complaint and findings of the inspector is sent to the Board for review.
The Board may request further study of the complaint by an inspector or make a recommendation for dismissal or disciplinary action.
The Board may dismiss, impose discipline, or refer the case to the Attorney General's Office.
The data in the table below illustrates the number of complaints received during the past six fiscal years.

The Board has a variety of enforcement mechanisms available created by statute.
The Board may take disciplinary action by denying, suspending, refusing to renew or reinstate, or revoking a license.
The Board may also issue a letter of admonition when an investigation discloses an instance of misconduct that does not warrant more severe disciplinary action by the Board.
The Board also issues confidential letters of concern that are not considered formal disciplinary action.

Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program The Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program (Program) was created through legislation in 1990, and is used by the Board to provide assistance and referral to treatment for pharmacists who are chemically dependent, or who may need psychological/psychiatric assistance or assistance with physical problems.
The Program's role is to assess, educate, intervene, identify and diagnose the practitioner's problems, and then refer the practitioner for appropriate treatment.
Pursuant to statute and Board rules, the vendor providing the services is selected by a formal bid process.
Peer Assistance Services, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, has contracted with the Board since 1993 to provide this service.
17
A review of the literature demonstrates that such assistance programs are being used with increasing frequency throughout private industry and in regulation of a number of health care professionals.
The underlying rationale for such programs is that addictions, substance abuse, and mental health problems are conditions that impair people's abilities to be effective at home and at work; drain health care systems in treatment costs; and negatively impact business systems in productivity.
Thus, longterm investment in rehabilitation should benefit many aspects of society.
The two primary philosophies of the Program are public protection and licensee rehabilitation for those who acknowledge that they suffer from a condition that is treatable.
The Program offers a possible disciplinary option to chemically dependent pharmacists rather than the revocation or suspension of their license to practice pharmacy, and the possible end of their professional careers.
All pharmacists are assessed a $28 fee that is included in their biennial license renewal.
Services offered to pharmacists by the Program include assessment and referral, short-term problem resolution, intervention, case management/monitoring, facilitated peer support groups, prevention/education programs, and 24hour, seven-day-a-week, toll-free telephone assistance.
Pharmacists are personally responsible for fees associated with mental health or substance abuse treatment and drug screenings.
The contractual agreement between Peer Assistance Services, Inc. and the Board requires the submittal of quarterly reports to the Board.
Monthly reports to the Program regarding participants include treatment and therapy reports, manager or practice monitor reports, self-help group attendance verification, drug screen reports, and self-status reports.
Because voluntary participants' names are not a matter of public record, their names do not appear on the reports and their identities are kept confidential unless there is noncompliance or the pharmacists are unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety.
18
Licensees enter the Program either voluntarily or as agreed upon in a Board disciplinary stipulation.
All licensees who enter the Program participate in a five-year rehabilitation program.
Records of voluntary participants are kept confidential and are identified by case number only.
However, the identity of the licensee who has agreed to participate in the Program through a Board disciplinary stipulation is public knowledge.
All participants in the Program enter into contracts with Peer Assistance Services, Inc. that provide terms to be fulfilled designed to rehabilitate the licensee.
The licensee agrees to Rehabilitation Contract The Return to Practice provides terms so compliance.
comply with the Program by signing the that sets up compliance requirements.
Agreement is another component that that pharmacists may demonstrate
An integral component of the Program is the practice monitor (another professional pharmacist) who monitors whether or not the licensee is practicing accepted standards of practice.
The monitor agrees to be a party to the Rehabilitation Contract and the Return to Practice Agreement.
Under the provisions of the agreement, the practice monitor must provide competency reviews that are based on interviews with staff, review DEA order forms, and perform site visits.
Any indication of noncompliance is reported to the Program that then reports to the Board within 24 hours.
A question arises concerning the protection of the public while the licensee is monitored.
There is the possibility that the licensee may relapse and resume previous behavior of chemical dependency and may be a danger to the public.
The Rehabilitation Contract, Return to Practice Agreement, practice monitoring, quarterly reports, frequent urinalysis and blood tests, and notifications of noncompliance within 24 hours keep the risks to a minimum.
From fiscal year 96-97 through fiscal year 01-02, there were a total of 28 pharmacists who entered the Program voluntarily and 29 pharmacists mandated to the Program by the Board through stipulation.
For this same time period, 14 pharmacists were successfully discharged after contract completion and 15 were terminated because of the inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety.
During this time period, an additional 18 pharmacists or immediate family members (non-diversion clients)
19
were provided with a variety of early intervention services that include relationship issues, health/emotional welfare, health and physical welfare, professional career issues, and answers to regulatory questions.
These short-term problem resolution sessions may consist of a telephone call, or two to three meetings with a staff member of Peer Assistance Services, Inc.
The Rehabilitation Evaluation Committee (REC) is a statutorily created liaison between the Board and the Program.
The Program reports to the REC.

Analysis and Recommendations
Recommendation 1 - Continue the State Board of Pharmacy and the Drugs and Druggist Act until 2012.
The regulation and licensing of qualified pharmacists and pharmaceutical facilities benefits the public's health, safety, and welfare.
The State Board of Pharmacy (Board) provides this service by establishing minimum educational and experience requirements that provide reasonable assurance that persons licensed are qualified and that businesses providing pharmaceutical services are in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and rules and regulations.
Assurance that licensed professionals act in a competent manner is provided by active investigation of complaints, facility inspections, and revocation or suspension of licenses when appropriate.
The original intent of the regulation of pharmacists was to ensure minimum qualifications of those compounding prescription drugs.
However, national and state regulatory requirements are now focused on two objectives.
The first is to ensure that the public receives the quality and strength of medications prescribed by medical practitioners.
The public has an expectation that when prescription drugs are dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, they are the correct drugs and the proper dosages.
Not receiving the correct drug or dosage may have serious consequences for the patient.
Under utilization of drug therapy may result in prolonging the illness or only masking a serious condition.
Overdoses of controlled substances may lead to severe injuries or even death.
The second objective of state regulation is to reduce the abuse of drugs by limiting access to controlled substances.
Drug therapy is the most frequently used form of medical intervention in any practice setting.
Its use has grown dramatically as the population has aged, the prevalence of chronic disease has increased, and the range of effective medications has broadened.
There is no question that the personal and economic consequences of inappropriate drug therapy are enormous.
Diagnostic technology emerging from the biotechnology industry has created demand for cost-effective management of treatment and increasingly complicated and expensive drugs, drug regimens, and information.
For these reasons, the Board and the Drugs and Druggists Act (Act) should be continued until 2012.
21
Recommendation 2 Â­ Enhance the public protection function of the Board by implementing the following three amendments.
Replace a pharmacist on the Board with a public member.
Amend section 12-22-104, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-104 Membership.
(1) The board shall be composed of five FOUR licensed pharmacists, each having at least five years' experience in this state and actively engaged in the practice of pharmacy in this state, and two THREE nonpharmacists who have no financial interest in the practice of pharmacy.
Delete the confidentiality provision in the letter of concern.
Amend section 12-22-125(7), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-125(7) When a complaint or an investigation discloses an instance of conduct that does not warrant formal action by the board but the board determines that continuation of such conduct could warrant action if continued, a confidential letter of concern may be sent by certified mail to the pharmacist against whom the complaint was made or who was the subject of investigation.
If a complaint precipitated the investigation, a response shall be sent to the person making the complaint.
Define continuous quality improvement and develop rules and regulations for a continuous quality improvement program that addresses medication errors and interventions.
12-22-102(6.5) "CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT" MEANS A SYSTEM OF STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHARMACY SERVICES AND PHARMACEUTICAL CARE, INCLUDING MEDICATION ERRORS.
Evaluation criteria direct the sunset review process to examine "Whether complaint, investigation and disciplinary procedures adequately protect the public and whether final disposition of complaints are in the public interest or self-serving to the profession."
Appendix B on page 62 lists complaint charges
22
received by the Board from fiscal year 97-98 through fiscal year 01-02 and the percentage of those charges resulting in the issuance of a letter of concern by the Board.
As the Appendix shows, 82 percent of dispensing errors resulted in a letter of concern.
The next highest percentage of letters of concern issued (26 percent) was for security violations.
An analysis of the complaint data indicates that the Board disciplines pharmacists who abuse drugs themselves or sell or give away controlled substances.
Discipline for these violations generally involves revocation, suspension or probation (sometimes by stipulation and referral to the Pharmacy Peer Assistance Diversion Program).
However, a review of the Board's disciplinary actions against licensees reveals that a high percentage of dispensing error complaints result in dismissal or in a confidential letter of concern.
Table 10 depicts final actions taken on complaints received by the Board.
It should be noted that there is a clear line of demarcation from fiscal year 99-00 to fiscal year 00-01 regarding the issuance of letter(s) of admonition (LOA) versus letter(s) of concern (LOC) for dispensing errors.
An increase in the use of an LOC for dispensing errors instead of an LOA may be attributed to a change in Board policy.
Disciplinary actions that include letters of admonition are listed in the Board newsletter and are submitted to a national databank maintained by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
Letters of concern are not submitted to the national databank or noted in the newsletter because they are confidential and not formal disciplinary actions.

23
When the Board reviews a complaint regarding a dispensing error, especially if it is the first offense, a confidential letter of concern is issued.
Article 22 of Title 12 defines the "practice of pharmacy" as an initial interpretation, selection of ingredients and final evaluation of each prescription order or chart order.
Furthermore, the responsibility for the compounding, dispensing, labeling, delivery, storage and distribution of drugs and devices is the responsibility of the pharmacist.
This practice is the foundation of the licensing scheme.
Therefore, the Board's reticence to discipline for dispensing errors is contrary to the purpose of the regulatory authority.
During this sunset review, staff attended Board meetings and observed complaint discussions and recommendations for final dispositions regarding dispensing errors.
The Board has stated that it does not consider outcomes as part of its deliberation in regards to sanctions imposed.
Other states do take outcomes into consideration.
Examples of dispensing errors that were dismissed with a letter of concern are described below.
Case #1 Â­ The prescription called for Prednisone 10 mg tablets but the drug dispensed was Methotrexate 2.5 mg tablets with a label identifying it as Prednisone 10 mg.
The customer who was issued the incorrect drug suffered from Crohn's Disease and was subsequently hospitalized.
Upon investigation, it was determined that the pharmacist had made the final evaluation of the prescription.
Additionally, a tablet from the bottle was identified as Methotrexate.
The pharmacist denied that he dispensed the incorrect drug.
Case #2 Â­ A prescription for Humalog (insulin) for injection was dispensed on an order for Humalog Mix 75/25 for injection.
The instructions for Humalog 75/25 directed the patient to use 30 units every morning and 16 units every evening.
The customer recognized the difference in the appearance of the drug and immediately returned it to the pharmacy.
If she had injected the 16 units of Humalog it could have been fatal.
The pharmacist admitted that she was unaware of the Humalog Mix 75/25 product availability.
24
Case #3 Â­ A prescription was dispensed for a nine-week old infant.
The prescription drug intended for the infant was Zantac Syrup.
The infant took the medication for one month.
Upon refilling the prescription, it was determined that something other than Zantac Syrup had been dispensed.
Upon investigation, it was determined that the pharmacist made the final evaluation on the order dispensed but could not remember dispensing the prescription.
The pharmacy manager reported that Zantac and Zyrtec Syrup are close to each other on the shelf.
It was never determined what drug the infant actually consumed.
Case #4 Â­ Prozac 10 mg was dispensed on an order for Prozac Weekly Capsules.
The 16-year old customer consumed one capsule weekly as ordered.
The family went on vacation and the daughter suffered from crying spells, sleeping difficulties, and overall depression.
A television commercial for Prozac Weekly alerted the mother to the potential problem.
The pharmacist admitted dispensing the incorrect drug and stated that he was unaware that Prozac Weekly was available.
Case #5 Â­ It was alleged that Diazepam tablets (a Schedule IV Controlled Substance) was dispensed to the customer instead of her refill prescription for Claritin 10 mg tablets.
Upon investigation, it was determined that the pharmacist had initialed the refill log but the pharmacist could not remember dispensing the prescription.
Investigation further indicated that the bottle returned to the pharmacy by the customer contained Diazepam 5 mg tablets.
Case #6 Â­ A pharmacist dispensed the generic form of Prozac 20 mg without notifying the customer both orally and in writing that she had received a generic product pursuant to section 1222-124(3), C.R.S.
The pharmacist responded that she was unaware that both written and oral notice to the customer is required.
Case #7 Â­ A pharmacist dispensed Methotrexate tablets on an order for Medroxyprogesterone tablets.
Customer reported that she received three months of the incorrect medication.
Pharmacist admitted that he was responsible for the dispensing error.
25
Case #8 Â­ The customer had an allergy to peppermint which is often used to mask the odor of Spironolacatone tablets.
Mylan is the only company that manufacturers this drug without peppermint.
A customer received a refill of her prescription with two different types of tablets in the bottle.
She questioned the pharmacist who responded that the tablets were both from Mylan and that there was no new formulation listed on the bottle.
When the customer consumed a tablet she subsequently had an allergic reaction.
One hour later, the customer's husband telephoned the pharmacist to further inquire about the medication that his wife had taken.
He was then informed that the pharmacist had located a stock bottle and noticed that it was marked with "New Formulation and Product Appearance.
The pharmacist read the package insert that reported that the tablets now contained a peppermint flavoring.
Case #9 Â­ It was determined that patient B received patient A's prescription and vice versa.
Patient B's prescription for Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim DS, a sulfa drug, was given to patient A who is allergic to sulfa drugs.
She developed gastrointestinal upset and severe headache, but no anaphylactic response.
The pharmacist admitted that she performed the final evaluation of patient A's prescription order.
The pharmacist stated that she is not responsible for the unlicensed assistant's misdelivery.
Rule 3.00.70(b) states that a pharmacist is responsible for unlicensed assistants.
The U.S. Pharmacopeia National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (Council) defines a medication error as any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm, while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer.
Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures, and systems including: prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education; monitoring; and use.
Medication errors may occur at any time, from the medication order to consumption by the patient.
26
The reasons for dispensing errors made by pharmacists and pharmacies are often questioned.
According to a synthesis of recent research into dispensing errors, the most common causes are thought to be the following: fewer clerical employees than are needed for business operation, longer shifts for pharmacists, greater numbers of prescriptions to fill and insufficient filling time, failure to properly train or supervise pharmacy employees, confusing or poorly written prescriptions, similar drug names, lack of knowledge about medication use, and a nonsupportive system with no provision for one person to check the work of another.
None of these causes justify the harm that can be caused by a misfilled prescription.
The consequences of a prescription being misfilled with a totally incorrect and unintended drug, at the very least, result in the patient not taking the drug that was prescribed for a condition or ailment.
Beyond that, the patient is potentially taking another drug that may be harmful.
Medications are the mainstay of treatment for most chronic conditions, and the elderly take numerous medications--an average of eight per day in the nursing facility setting.
Medication errors can lead to serious patient morbidity or mortality, and because drugs are used so frequently, the number of preventable injuries is substantial.
Pharmacists-in-charge at Colorado pharmacies are responsible under Rule 3.00.50 to make a final evaluation of the drug transaction and for taking whatever action is necessary to ensure that the container, label and prescription drug dispensed, as well as all records relating to the transaction are complete, accurate and appropriate.
The likelihood of discovery before the wrong medication is taken is very low because of the trust that most patients place in their pharmacy and their lack of knowledge regarding the appearance of medications or the correct dosages.
As derived from the information in Appendix B on page 62 of this review, dispensing errors accounted for 38 percent of complaints received.
In reviewing and researching dispensing errors and their final disposition, this report concludes that the Board is remiss in disciplining those violations of the statute.
This recommendation addresses this concern by proposing that the Board composition be changed to allow for an additional public member and one less pharmacist in addition to the development of rules and regulations addressing a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program.
27
Reports of medication errors and interventions should be evaluated and incorporated into a CQI program.
The pharmacist must assume responsibility for developing and implementing a plan and for the prevention of medication errors through detection and evaluation.
The following guidelines and recommendations from the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists offer a resource for the Board in their creation of rules and regulations regarding CQI for pharmacies: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Establish a process for identifying and tracking medication errors.
Define categories of medication errors, e.g., prescribing, dispensing, administration, monitoring, and compliance errors (see Appendix B on page 62).
Simplify the process of documenting errors by developing a medication error reporting and evaluation form.
Establish systems for detecting medication errors in the facility or pharmacy such as med pass observation, random sampling, and medication storage survey.
Respect the confidentiality of the patient, facility, and personnel involved in the medication error.
Recommendation 3 - Grant the Board the authority to issue fines to registrants.
Amend section 12-22-110, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-110(1)(c) Deny, suspend, or revoke licenses or registrations AND FINE REGISTRANTS WHEN CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE AND THE REGULATIONS ADOPTED THEREUNDER; Currently, the only sanctions available to the Board for violations committed by a prescription drug outlet, manufacturer or wholesaler are revocation, suspension, or denial.
When inspection reports indicate continuous violations yet those violations may not pose an immediate threat to the public welfare, there are no other sanctions available to the Board.
Revoking the license of a pharmacy is a drastic measure that has severe ramifications for its clientele.
By granting the Board the ability to fine registrants, the Board is given a less extreme option than revocation.
Other regulatory programs such as the Office of Outfitters Registration, Office of Barber and
28
Cosmetologist Licensing, Board of Veterinary Medicine, Electrical Board, Examining Board of Plumbers, and the Accountancy Board, all within the Division of Registrations, have the authority to issue fines.
The following case studies are situations in which fines might have been appropriately imposed: Case 1 In a large hospital, two pharmacists made an error on a patient's medication that resulted in the death of the patient.
Subsequently, there was a hospital settlement between the patient's family and the hospital.
However, the hospital did not inform the Board of the settlement as required by section 12-22113.5, C.R.S.
During an inspection of the hospital's pharmacy, a Board inspector learned of the error and subsequent settlement.
It took several months from that time for the hospital to complete a malpractice settlement form and submit it to the Board.
The Board disciplined the pharmacists but the Board also should have fining authority over the hospital pharmacy.
Suspending the pharmacy registration is not necessarily the best possible remedy, but a lack of action implies that the statutory requirement to report malpractice settlements is not mandatory.
Case 2 A civil case was filed in which the plaintiff alleged that he was dispensed the wrong medication from a prescription drug outlet.
The Board learned of the lawsuit from the plaintiff's attorney, not from the prescription drug outlet manager or owner.
The claim was eventually settled.
The Board learned of the disposition approximately six months after the date of settlement from the notification given to the Board by the prescription drug outlet's insurer.
In addition, the insurer neglected to file a malpractice settlement form with the Board as required by section 12-22113.5, C.R.S.
The evidence indicates that a pharmacist made a dispensing error and a settlement occurred.
However, the prescription drug outlet failed to notify the Board appropriately of the civil case or its disposition and the prescription drug outlet's insurer neglected to file the appropriate settlement forms with the Board.
29
In such situations, fining would be appropriate.
The Board rules and regulations require that all pharmacists, interns, prescription drug outlet managers and owners immediately notify the Board of the filing of all legal proceedings.
Additionally they shall also notify the Board, within 20 days, of the disposition of such proceedings, wherein it is alleged that a Board licensee has violated any law or regulation pertaining to the compounding, dispensing, delivery or distribution of any prescription drug or device.
Recommendation 4 - Require a two-year time period before a licensee can apply after revocation.
Section 12-22-116, C.R.S., should be amended to read as follows: 12-22-116(9) NO INDIVIDUAL OR OUTLET WHOSE LICENSE OR REGISTRATION HAS BEEN REVOKED SHALL BE ALLOWED TO REAPPLY FOR LICENSURE OR REGISTRATION EARLIER THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE REVOCATION.
Language in the current Act does not preclude a licensee who has had his/her license revoked from applying for a new license immediately after the revocation occurs.
The reason a license is revoked first and foremost is that the practitioner represents a significant threat to the public.
Revocation cases are quite lengthy and expensive.
In practice, it often takes the Board anywhere from nine to 18 months, or longer, to revoke a license, depending upon whether or not the case goes to hearing or is settled.
There is a tremendous investment of staff resources and dollars to discipline the practitioner.
The waiting period is intended to serve the purpose of reminding the licensees of their accountability for their behavior and the fact that it is a privilege to be licensed, not a right.
Without a substantial wait, that message is lost.
Most other practice acts in the Division of Registrations require a time-out period before reinstatement of license.
For example, the Board of Medical Examiners, Board of Registration of Professional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors, Electrical Board, Examining Board of Plumbers, and the Board of Optometric Examiners require a two-year wait.
On the other hand, the four Mental Health Boards and the State Grievance Board require a three-year wait before practitioners are eligible for reapplication after revocation.
Because of the significant threat that pharmacists who have lost their licenses pose to the public, the two-year period is justified for public safety.
30
Recommendation 5 - Allow wholesalers to sell or deliver prescription medications intended for veterinary use directly to a person responsible for the animal patient if there is a written prescription by a licensed veterinarian.
Amend section 12-22-121, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-121(3.5) A WHOLESALER MAY SELL OR DELIVER TO A PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTROL OF AN ANIMAL A DRUG INTENDED FOR VETERINARY USE FOR THAT ANIMAL ONLY IF A LICENSED VETERINARIAN HAS ISSUED, PRIOR TO SUCH SALE OR DELIVERY, A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION ORDER FOR THE DRUG IN THE COURSE OF AN EXISTING, VALID VETERINARIANCLIENT-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AS DEFINED IN SECTION 12-64-103(15.5)(a), (b), AND (c), C.R.S.
Historically, livestock producers have been able to acquire prescription medications directly from wholesale distributors after a veterinarian-client-patient relationship has been established and a prescription has been filed with the pharmaceutical distributor.
However, section 12-22-121(3), C.R.S., addressing the compounding, dispensing, and sale of drugs and devices has specific limitations for wholesalers.
This language reads as follows: A wholesaler may sell or give any drug or device to another wholesaler of drugs or devices, to any licensed hospital or registered prescription drug outlet or to any practitioner authorized by law to prescribe the same.
The current statutory language precludes a wholesaler from selling veterinarian drugs directly to a livestock producer even if there is a relationship with a veterinarian.
When this restriction is applied to animal pharmaceutical distribution, there is an additional layer of price mark-up prior to ultimate delivery and use by Colorado's livestock producers.
31
The Center for Veterinary Medicine in the U.S.
Public Health Service has addressed this issue by proclaiming that the sale (dispensing, shipping, or otherwise making available for use in animals) to the layperson of a veterinary prescription drug product may be made only by, or on the bona fide prescription or other order of a licensed veterinarian.
Because many states do authorize persons other than pharmacists to dispense prescription drug products on a veterinarian's instructions, the term "other order" is used when instructions are for a legally authorized dispenser who is not a pharmacist, namely a wholesaler.
The labeling on veterinarian products is not much different from the labeling on many devices for people, or certain orthopedic products that are to be sold only by, or on the order of a physician.
In the case of devices with such labeling, the Board has always permitted the completely unregulated sale by virtually anyone Â­ most commonly by medial supply stores, as long as the seller obtains an order, not necessarily a prescription order as defined in section 12-22-102(22.5)(a), C.R.S., - but a simple order.
This recommendation would allow the wholesaler to legally dispense a veterinary prescription drug as long as there is an established valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship as defined in section 12-64-103(15.5), C.R.S.
For quite some time, veterinarian wholesalers have sold prescription drugs directly to the rancher without any evidence of harm to the public.
The Board should adopt rules and regulations addressing this issue and consider the following requirements: 1) Orders must be issued from a licensed Colorado veterinarian; 2) The veterinarian's license number and expiration date must appear on the order; 3) Prescriptions should be valid for a period of time no longer than six months.
32
Recommendation 6 - Combine all statutory violations under the heading of "unprofessional conduct" and separate the listing of violations from the Board action that is authorized.
Amend section 12-22-125, C.R.S., and enact section 12-22125.2, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-125.
Licenses or registrations may be denied, suspended, or revoked.
UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Â­ GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINE.
(1) The board may deny, suspend, or revoke any license to practice as a pharmacist or pharmacy intern, after a hearing held in accordance with the provisions of this section, upon proof that the licensee.

{previously 12-22-125(5)(a)}(2) The board may also include in any disciplinary order that allows the licensee or registrant to continue to practice such conditions as the board may deem appropriate to assure that the licensee is physically, mentally, morally, and otherwise qualified to practice pharmacy in accordance with the generally accepted professional standards of practice, including any or all of the following: (I)(a) Submission by the respondent to such examinations as the board may order to determine the respondent's physical or mental condition or professional qualifications; (II)(b) The taking by the respondent of such therapy courses of training or education as may be needed to correct deficiencies found either in the hearing or by such examinations; (III)(c) The review or supervision of the respondent's practice as may be necessary to determine the quality of his or her practice and to correct deficiencies therein; and (IV)(d) The imposition of restrictions upon the nature of the respondent's practice to assure that he or she does not practice beyond the limits of his or her capabilities.
36
{previously 12-22-125(5)(a)(IV)(b)}(3) Upon failure of the licensee or registrant to comply with any conditions imposed by the board pursuant to paragraph (1)(b)(7), (a) of this subsection (5), unless due to conditions beyond the licensee's or registrant's control, the board may order suspension of the offender's license or registration in this state until such time as the licensee or registrant complies with such conditions.
(4) IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER PENALTY WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, ANY REGISTRANT VIOLATING ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE OR ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE MAY BE FINED NOT LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOR MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH SUCH VIOLATION. {previously 12-22-125(6)(a)}(5)(a) When a complaint or an investigation discloses an instance of misconduct which, in the opinion of the board, does not warrant formal action by the board but which should not be dismissed as being without merit, a letter of admonition may be sent by certified mail to the pharmacist against whom a complaint was made and a copy thereof to the person making the complaint.
{previously 12-22-125(6)(b)} (b) When a letter of admonition is sent by certified mail by the board to a pharmacist complained against, such pharmacist shall be advised that he or she has the right to request in writing, within twenty THIRTY days after proven receipt of the DATE ON WHICH the letter WAS MAILED, that formal disciplinary proceedings be initiated to adjudicate the propriety of the conduct upon which the letter of admonition is based.
(c) If the request is timely made, the letter of admonition shall be deemed vacated, and the matter shall be processed by means of formal disciplinary proceedings.
37
{previously 12-22-125(7)}(6) When a complaint or an investigation discloses an instance of conduct that does not warrant formal action by the board but the board determines that continuation of such conduct could warrant action if continued, a confidential letter of concern may be sent by certified mail to the pharmacist against whom the complaint was made or who was the subject of investigation.
If a complaint precipitated the investigation, a response shall be sent to the person making the complaint.
The Board's disciplinary powers and the grounds for discipline are currently scattered throughout various places in the statute.
Grounds for discipline can be found in sections 12-22-125, C.R.S., 12-22-126, C.R.S., 18-18-304, C.R.S., and 18-18-414, C.R.S.
This makes enforcement of Board actions difficult and haphazard at best.
There are potential legal challenges that could be made to Board actions pursuant to some of these sections.
In order to organize and clarify what is prohibited, it is recommended that all administrative infractions be in one place in the Act.
This would grant the Assistant Attorney General to the Board the ability to charge all infractions administratively whether or not the District Attorney decided to charge some of the infractions criminally.
Other Boards in the Department of Regulatory Agencies have consolidated infractions under the heading of "unprofessional conduct."
The revised section 12-22-125, C.R.S., contains all administrative infractions for which the Board could discipline.
Some of these are broad and would take the interpretation of the Board.
Most of the items listed were already in statute in one of the locations cited above.
A few of the items are new, based upon lists of infractions used by other professional licensing boards in the Division of Registrations.
Proposed section 12-22-125.2, C.R.S., Disciplinary Action, addresses the Board's power to take various types of actions against licensees and registrants when they violate the unprofessional conduct section 12-22-125, C.R.S.
These two sections separate the listing of the infractions from the Board action that is authorized when such infractions occur.
38
Recommendation 7 - Change the timelines for appealing a letter of admonition to 30 days from the date of mailing, rather than 20 days from the date of proven receipt.
Amend section 12-22-125(6)(b) C.R.S., which is being renumbered as 12-22-125.2(5)(a), C.R.S., to read as follows: When a letter of admonition is sent by certified mail by the board to a pharmacist complained against, such pharmacist shall be advised that he or she has the right to request in writing, within twenty THIRTY days after proven receipt of the DATE ON WHICH the letter WAS MAILED, that formal disciplinary proceedings be initiated to adjudicate the propriety of the conduct upon which the letter of admonition is based.
In practice, admonition requested.
which such the current statutory provision requires a letter of to be mailed via certified mail, return receipt This is the only verifiable way to prove the date on letter is received.
However, it is not uncommon for letters of admonition to be returned to the Board as undeliverable or unclaimed.
One reason is that pharmacists relocate and do not always notify the Board of their new addresses as required.
An additional consideration here is that State mail is not forwarded, it is returned to the Board as undeliverable.
A more pessimistic explanation is that the pharmacist simply refuses to sign for the letter, thus preventing the tolling period from beginning.
The Colorado Court of Appeals recently addressed this issue in Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners v. Roberts, 42 P.3d 70 (Colo.
App. 2001).
In Roberts, the court reviewed a provision in the Medical Practice Act that is substantially similar to the statute under discussion here.
The Board of Medical Examiners issued a letter of admonition to Dr. Roberts and mailed it to him at his place of business via certified mail, return receipt requested.
However, Dr. Roberts and his staff refused to sign for the letter on two separate occasions.
Three months later, Dr. Roberts requested that the Board of Medical Examiners vacate the letter of admonition and institute formal disciplinary
39
proceedings against him.
The Board of Medical Examiners refused, stating that two notices of attempted delivery by the U.S. Postal Service was sufficient to constitute receipt and begin the 20-day tolling period for requesting formal disciplinary proceedings.
Dr. Roberts and the Court of Appeals disagreed.
In focusing on the plain language of the statute, the court held that "receipt" in the statute requires actual receipt.
Since the Act contains language that is substantially similar to the statutory provision reviewed in Roberts, it is not unreasonable to believe that at some point, the Board could encounter a similar problem.
The recommended language attempts to expedite the disciplinary process while protecting the rights of the pharmacist.
By requiring the letter of admonition to be mailed by certified mail, the Board will be able to establish the date on which it is mailed.
To allow for delivery time, and to be consistent with other appeals timelines, the time in which a pharmacist may request formal disciplinary proceedings is extended from 20 days to 30 days.
This recommendation neither restricts nor expands the powers of the Board or the rights of the pharmacist.
Rather, it attempts to correct a procedural problem that may be exacerbated by the Roberts decision.
Recommendation 8 Â­ Conform the definition of "controlled substance" in the Drugs and Druggists Act to the section in the Colorado Criminal Code that defines "controlled substance".
Amend section 12-22-303(7), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-303(7) "Controlled substance" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS THAT DEFINED IN SECTION 18-18-102(5), C.R.S. means a drug, substance, or immediate precursor included in schedules I to V of part 2 of article 18 of title 18, C.R.S.
Section 12-22-303(7), C.R.S., defines a controlled substance as "a drug, substance, or immediate precursor included in schedules I to IV of Part 2 of Article 18 of Title 18, C.R.S."
40
Section 18-18-102(5), C.R.S., a section of the Colorado Criminal Code (Criminal Code) defines a controlled substance in an identical manner except that it goes on to state, "including cocaine, marihuana, and marihuana concentrate."
Tetrahydrocannabinols, commonly referred to as "THC", is listed as a Schedule I Controlled Substance at section 18-18203(2)(c)(XXIII), C.R.S.
Section 12-22-303(32)(a), C.R.S., defines "THC" as, synthetic equivalents or the substances contained in the plant, or in the resinous extractives of, cannabis, sp., or synthetic substances, derivatives, and their isomers with similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity . . .
Thus, THC is a part of the marihuana plant, but an individual could potentially test positive for marihuana and not THC, which is the controlled substance under the Act.
In 2001, the Board of Nursing sought to take disciplinary action against a certified nurse aide (CNA) who reported to work in an intoxicated state and tested positive for cocaine, alcohol and marihuana.
Because the Nurse Aide Practice Act references the Drugs and Druggists Act, which includes THC as a controlled substance, but not marihuana specifically, the administrative law judge (ALJ) requested the Board of Nursing's Assistant Attorney General, to establish the relationship between THC and marihuana in order to proceed to hearing whether the marihuana in the CNA's system was grounds for disciplinary action.
This involved research, legal analysis of the relevant statutes, and obtaining an affidavit from a pharmacist.
Since THC is listed as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, and the Criminal Code specifically includes marihuana in its definition of a controlled substance, it is clear that the General Assembly intended that a practitioner who is found to have abused or excessively or habitually used marihuana be subject to disciplinary action.
The recommended amendment will more clearly state the General Assembly's intention.
Two other points are worth noting in relation to this issue.
First, most, if not all, of Colorado's professional practice acts contain language similar to that at issue here Â­ they reference the Drugs and Druggists Act.
41
Finally, in 2000, the Colorado Constitution was amended to legalize the use of marihuana for people suffering from debilitating medical conditions.
Colo.Const. art.
XVIII, Â§14.
This recommendation will not infringe upon an individual's opportunity to exercise the rights granted under this constitutional provision so long as the practitioner does not report to work while under the influence of marihuana, just as a practitioner could receive discipline for reporting to work while under the influence of alcohol.
For an individual who as obtained the necessary approvals and permissions to use marihuana for medicinal purposes, a showing of abuse, or habitual or excessive use would be similar to such a showing for alcohol.
Recommendation 9 - Update the Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program.
Amend sections 12-22601(2), 12-22-603(3)(b), and 12-22-606, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-601(2) It is the intent of the general assembly that the pharmacy peer health assistance diversion program and its related procedures shall be utilized by the state board of pharmacy IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR as an alternative to the use of disciplinary proceedings by the board, which proceedings are by their nature time-consuming and costly to the people of this state.
The pharmacy peer health assistance diversion program is hereby established to alleviate the need for such disciplinary proceedings, while at the same time providing safeguards that protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
The general assembly further declares that it is its intent that the state board of pharmacy will act to implement the provisions of this article.
The Board should be able to use the Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program not only as an alternative to discipline, but also in conjunction with discipline.
42
12-22-603(3)(b) Effective July 1, 1994, as a condition of licensure and licensure renewal in this state, every applicant shall pay to the administering entity that has been selected by the board pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection (3) an amount set by the board not to exceed twenty-eight dollars biennially PER YEAR, which amount shall be used to support designated providers that have been selected by the board to provide assistance to pharmacists needing help in dealing with physical, emotional, psychiatric, psychological, drug abuse, or alcohol abuse problems which may be detrimental to their ability to practice In Subsection (3)(b), the money allotted for this program should be increased.
Currently, the program has nearly twice as many participants as the dental program, but licensees pay only onehalf of what the dentists pay.
12-22-606.
Rehabilitation evaluation committee Â­ created.
(1) The board shall establish a rehabilitation evaluation committee, which shall consist of five members to be appointed by the board.
Each PHARMACIST member of the committee shall serve UP TO A MAXIMUM OF TWO TERMS for a term of four years; MEMBER'S TERMS SHALL BE STAGGERED except that, of the three voting members, one shall serve an initial term of one year, one shall serve an initial term of two years, and one shall serve an initial term of three years.
Other than the staff member for the board, no member shall serve more than one full four-year terms.
The members shall be selected as follows: Three members who are licensed pharmacists including one who has recovered from an addiction to alcohol or drugs; one member who is the staff member for the board; and one member who is the director of a program provided by a pharmacy peer health assistance organization.
A PSYCHIATRIST OR A LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER.
The staff member for the board and the peer health assistance program director shall be nonvoting members of the committee.
43
(2)(a) The committee shall meet as necessary to review applications to participate in the pharmacy peer health assistance diversion program.
For each application, the committee shall make a recommendation to the board that the application be approved or that it be rejected.
The board shall either grant or deny applications, based upon reasonable grounds which shall be stated in writing.
Such applications may also include requests by licensees to continue in practice while participating in an approved program.
The committee shall make a recommendation to the board that such request to continue in practice be approved or rejected.
In those cases where a committee has recommended approval of the application for participation in the program, the licensee may begin participation in the program of the designated pharmacy peer health assistance organization pending final board action on the committee's recommendation.
If a committee has recommended that a request to continue in practice be approved, such licensee may continue to practice pending final board action on the committee's recommendation.
The terms of the members of the Rehabilitation Evaluation Committee should be extended to two four-year terms, as it requires significant time to educate new persons to participate fully.
In addition, it is recommended that a psychiatrist or licensed mental health professional replace the director of the program provided by the pharmacy peer health assistance organization.
44
Technical Changes to the Pharmacy Law The current Act has provisions that are ambiguous, unclear and outdated and has been amended several times since its enactment.
Technical changes are necessary to improve and update the Act.
In recognition of the many recent changes in the practice of pharmacy, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has developed a Model Act for Boards of Pharmacy (Model Act).
Though the statute has been amended slightly over the years, it has not kept pace with changes in the practice of pharmacy.
The Model Act is designed to address changes in the practice of pharmacy.
The public should have the benefit of statutes that are current with professional practices.
Many of the recommendations that follow are premised on the Model Act while others are statutory changes to enhance and clarify the responsibility of the Board.
Due to the large number of additions and statutory clean-up recommendations, the following recommendations have been made in the order of the current statute for easier identification.
Recommendation 10 - Amend specific definitions in section 12-22-102, C.R.S., and make conforming amendments throughout the Drugs and Druggists Act to read as follow: 12-22-102(1) "Administration" means the giving of medication to a patient by a pharmacist qualified to administer drugs by authorization of a physician.
"ADMINISTER" MEANS THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF A DRUG TO THE BODY OF A PATIENT OR RESEARCH SUBJECT BY INJECTION, INHALATION, INGESTION, OR ANY OTHER MEANS.
Subsection one is deleted and language from the Model Act was inserted.
The definition currently in law does not specifically define what is meant by administration.
This recommended language adds needed specificity to the definition.
45
12-22-102(5) "Casual sale" means a sale TRANSFER, DELIVERY OR DISTRIBUTION to a corporation, individual, or other entity, other than a consumer, entitled to possess prescription drugs; except that the amount of drugs TRANSFERRED, DELIVERED OR DISTRIBUTED sold in such manner by any registered prescription drug outlet or hospital other outlet shall not exceed five percent of the total amount of drugs sold annually NUMBER OF DOSAGE UNITS OF DRUGS DISPENSED AND DISTRIBUTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS by such outlet.
The recommended changes in this section alter the definition of a casual sale to encompass not only sales but also transfers of any nature.
As the section now reads, entities would be able to transfer large quantities of drugs without compliance with regulatory standards if no money was exchanged.
This is not in the best interest of the public.
In general, in order to track the distribution of drugs and the providers that exchange them, normal regulatory constraints should apply.
The intent of casual sale is to allow for small transfers without extensive restriction.
Once a transfer becomes a certain size it should meet compliance standards.
In addition, current statutory language is ambiguous regarding the amounts of drugs that can be transferred in a casual sale.
It is difficult for inspectors to clearly advise facilities due to this ambiguity.
12-22-102(6) "Compound" means to mix, weigh, or otherwise prepare ingredients, as specified in the prescription order of a practitioner, in accordance with the statutes and regulations of pharmacy and to insure that a label is prepared in accordance with the prescription order and placed on or securely attached to the container meeting compendia standards.
"COMPOUNDING" MEANS THE PREPARATION, MIXING, ASSEMBLING, PACKAGING, OR LABELING OF A DRUG OR DEVICE (i) AS THE RESULT OF A PRACTITIONER'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG ORDER OR CHART ORDER OR INITIATIVE BASED ON THE PRACTITIONER / PATIENT / PHARMACIST RELATIONSHIP IN THE COURSE OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, OR (ii) FOR THE PURPOSE OF, OR AS AN INCIDENT TO, RESEARCH, TEACHING, OR CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND NOT FOR SALE OR DISPENSING.
COMPOUNDING ALSO INCLUDES THE
46
PREPARATION OF DRUGS OR DEVICES IN ANTICIPATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG ORDERS BASED ON ROUTINE, REGULARLY, OBSERVED PRESCRIBING PATTERNS.
The language defining "compound" should be deleted and more specific language from the Model Act defining "compounding" inserted for further clarification.
12-22-102(7) "Delivery" means the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer OF A DRUG OR DEVICE from one person to another of a drug or device, whether or not there is an agency relationship FOR A CONSIDERATION.
The language defining "delivery" should be amended and language from the Model Act inserted for further clarification.
12-22-102(8) "Device" means an instrument, apparatus, machine, contrivance, or implant or a similar or related article other than a drug, including any component part or accessory which is: IMPLEMENT, MACHINE, CONTRIVANCE, IMPLANT, OR OTHER SIMILAR OR RELATED ARTICLE, INCLUDING ANY COMPONENT PART OR ACCESSORY, WHICH IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO BEAR THE LABEL, "CAUTION: FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES DISPENSING BY OR ON THE ORDER OF A PHYSICIAN."
(a) Recognized in the official compendia or any supplement thereto; (b) Intended for use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease or other conditions in humans and animals; and (c) Required under federal or state law to be prescribed by a practitioner and dispensed by a pharmacist The language defining "device" should be deleted, and language from the Model Act inserted for further clarification
47
12-22-102(9) "Dispense" means to prepare a drug or device pursuant to a lawful prescription order of a practitioner, together with an appropriate label, in a suitable container for subsequent administration to or use by a patient or other individual entitled to receive the prescription order.
THE INTERPRETATION, EVALUATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRESCRIPTION DRUG ORDER OR CHART ORDER, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF A DRUG OR DEVICE TO A PATIENT OR PATIENT'S AGENT IN A SUITABLE CONTAINER APPROPRIATELY LABELED FOR SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATION TO OR USE BY A PATIENT.
12-22-102(10) "Distribution" means the delivery TRANSFER of a drug or device other than by administering or dispensing.
The language defining "dispense" should be deleted, and language from the Model Act inserted for further clarification.
The use of the word delivery in this section confuses the definition of "distribution," as the word "delivery" is already specifically defined in statute.
Transfer is not currently defined and has a generally accepted meaning.
12-22-102(11.5) "FILL" MEANS TO PREPARE A DRUG OR DEVICE PURSUANT TO A LAWFUL ORDER OF A PRACTITIONER, TOGETHER WITH AN APPROPRIATE LABEL, IN A SUITABLE CONTAINER FOR SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATION TO OR USE BY A PATIENT OR OTHER INDIVIDUAL ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE ORDER.
The word "fill" is used regularly throughout the profession by laypersons and pharmacists.
This new definition of "fill" is the same as the current definition of dispense.
12-22-102(13) "Habit-forming drug" means any drug or medicine which is required under the state food and drug law or the federal "Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act" to be labeled as a habit-forming drug.
48
This language from the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is antiquated and no longer necessary.
The addictive properties of drugs are addressed in the Uniform Controlled Substances Act pursuant to section 18-18-101, et seq, C.R.S. 12-22-102(16.5) "Location" means the physical confines of an individual building or at the same address.
Pharmacies are registered according to their locations.
As the Act currently exists, a complex could have several pharmacies in several buildings and register only one of those entities as a pharmacy if all the buildings in the complex had the same address.
This situation places the public at risk, as the other buildings would not be inspected nor monitored for compliance with pharmacy regulations.
For example, without notifying the Board, a registered outlet (pharmacy) opened a satellite facility in a different building on its campus.
During an inspection of the primary facility, the inspector was informed that one of the pharmacists was working in the "satellite" outlet.
The registrant had one address but more than one facility on the campus.
The registrant operated an outlet for years without the Board knowing of its existence and, consequently, it was never inspected.
12-22-102(17) "Manufacture" means to cultivate, grow, or prepare by other process drugs for sale to wholesalers or other persons entitled to purchase drugs other than the ultimate user, but "manufacture" does not include the COMPOUNDING AND dispensing of a prescription drug pursuant to a prescription order.
This section is incomplete without the language concerning compounding.
The responsibility for compounding lies with the licensed pharmacist, not the manufacturer, and is currently included in the definition of the "practice of pharmacy."
49
12-22-102(20) "Nonprescription drug" means a medicine or drug which may be sold without a prescription which is prepackaged for use by the consumer, prepared by the manufacturer or producer for use by the consumer, properly labeled and unadulterated in accordance with the requirements of the state food and drug law and the federal "Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act".
The term shall not apply to any drug that is designated under any law or regulation of this state or federal law or regulation as a habit-forming drug or a controlled substance, as defined in section 12-22-303 (7).
A DRUG WHICH MAYBE SOLD WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AND WHICH IS LABELED FOR USE BY THE CONSUMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAWS AND RULES OF THIS STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
The Model Act definition of "nonprescription drug" is concise and adds clarity to the current statutory definition.
The current definition is so complex that it takes an inordinate amount of time to establish that the definition had been met at an administrative law hearing.
12-22-102(22) "Official compendia" means the official United States Pharmacopeia, NATIONAL FORMULARY, HOMEOPATHIC PHARMACOPOEIA OF THE UNITED STATES or any supplements thereto.
This recommendation conforms the definition of "official compendia" to the definition of "drug" found in section 12-22102(11)(a)(I),C.R.S. 12-22-102(22.5) "Order" means: (a) A prescription order which is any order, other than a chart order, authorizing the dispensing of a single drug or device that is written, mechanically produced, computer generated and signed by the practitioner, transmitted electronically or by facsimile, or by other means of communication by a practitioner TO A LICENSED PHARMACY and which includes the name or identification of the patient, the date, and sufficient information for compounding, dispensing, and labeling; or
50
The word "single" as used here is not comprehensive, as sometimes physicians write more than one order on each prescription.
12-22-102(23) "OTHER Outlet" means any prescription drug outlet, hospital THAT DOES NOT OPERATE A REGISTERED PHARMACY, institution, nursing home, rural health clinic, convalescent home, extended care facility, family planning clinic, wholesaler, manufacturer, or mail order vendor, other than a pharmacist, SCHOOL, JAIL, COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC, UNIVERSITY AND/OR COLLEGE that has facilities in this state registered pursuant to this article and that engages in the COMPOUNDING, dispensing, AND delivery, distribution, manufacturing, wholesaling, or sale of drugs or devices.
This section as currently written has caused numerous problems for the Board.
The meaning of the word "institutions" has been unclear.
The definition encompasses a number of facilities that are not similar, have little in common in the regulatory scheme for pharmacies, and cannot be generalized.
This recommendation suggests using the term "other outlets" and redefining it to include only those types of facilities referred to in this Subsection (23).
Manufacture is defined in Subsection (17), wholesaler in Subsection (34), and prescription drug outlets are defined in Subsection (30.2).
The Board has no jurisdiction over nursing homes; therefore, references to them should be deleted, as should references to similar facilities over which the Board has no jurisdiction.
Defining "other outlets" separately would clarify those entities that must meet the regulatory criteria for "other outlets."
12-22-102(24.2) "PHARMACY TECHNICIAN" MEANS AN UNLICENSED PERSON WHO PERFORMS THOSE FUNCTIONS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF SUBSECTION (26) OF THIS SECTION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PHARMACIST.
Amend the remainder of Article 22 to conform with this recommendation by deleting all references to "unlicensed assistant" and replacing it with "pharmacy technician."
51
Effective July 1, 2002, the term "unlicensed assistant" pursuant to section 12-22-102(33.5), C.R.S., was repealed along with other responsibilities of the pharmacy manager.
Previously, section 12-22-102(33.5)(a), C.R.S., stated "Unlicensed assistant means an unlicensed person who performs those functions set forth in paragraph (b) of subsection (26) of this section under the supervision of a pharmacist.
A pharmacist manager of a prescription drug outlet employing an unlicensed assistant shall file with the board the name and date of birth of each unlicensed assistant who is employed by the outlet."
However, the term "unlicensed assistant" still exists in other parts of the statute and should be defined.
The term "pharmacy technician" is generally used in this industry and more aptly describes the position of unlicensed assistant.
12-22-102(26) "Practice of pharmacy" means: (a) An initial interpretation, selection of ingredients and final evaluation of each prescription order or chart order, the participation in drug selection and drug utilization reviews, the participation in administration of drugs, the provision of pharmaceutical care including patient counseling and prospective drug review, drug and drug-related research not including prescriptive authority, the advising and providing of information concerning utilization of drugs and devices in the treatment of an injury and the treatment and prevention of disease, and the offering or performing of these health services, operations, or transactions necessary in the conduct, operation, and control of a prescription drug outlet by a pharmacist THE INTERPRETATION, EVALUATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND THE DISPENSING OF ORDERS; PARTICIPATION IN DRUG AND DEVICE SELECTION, DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DRUG REGIMEN REVIEWS, AND DRUG OR DRUG-RELATED RESEARCH; PROVISION OF PATIENT COUNSELING AND THE PROVISION OF THOSE ACTS OR SERVICES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE PHARMACEUTICAL CARE IN ALL AREAS OF PATIENT CARE; AND
52
(b) The responsibility for the compounding, dispensing, labeling (except nonprescription drugs), delivery, storage, and distribution of drugs and devices and the maintenance of proper records thereof; THE PREPARATION, MIXING, ASSEMBLING, PACKAGING, OR LABELING OR DELIVERY OF A DRUG OR DEVICE, PROPER AND SAFE STORAGE OF DRUGS AND DEVICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF PROPER RECORDS FOR THEM.
The language defining "dispense" should be deleted, and language from the Model Act inserted for further clarification.
12-22-102(30) "Prescription drug" means a drug which, prior to being dispensed or delivered, is to be labeled with the following statement: "Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without a prescription."
or "Rx ONLY" OR "Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian."
"Rx Only" language should be added to comply with federal law.
12-22-102(30.2) "Prescription drug outlet" means any PHARMACY outlet registered pursuant to this article where prescriptions are filled or compounded, and are sold, dispensed, offered, or displayed.
The word "pharmacy" should be added to this definition since it is the most generally accepted term used in the profession and by laypersons.
There is confusion concerning the use of the term "prescription drug outlet."
The other recommended changes in this subsection are for greater specificity and to delete unnecessary terms.
12-22-102(30.3) "Refill" means the COMPOUNDING AND dispensing of any drug by a practitioner pursuant to a previously executed order.
The amended definition clarifies the process of refilling a prescription.
53
12-22-102(32.6) "Supervision" means that a licensed pharmacist is on the location and immediately and readily available to consult with and assist unlicensed personnel performing tasks described in subsection (26) (b) of this section.
"Immediately" was deleted because the reality of practice is that the supervising pharmacist is "readily available," not necessarily immediately, but within a reasonable time.
12-22-102(34) "Wholesaler" means a corporation, individual, or other entity with facilities in this state which buys drugs or devices for resale and OR distribution DISTRIBUTES to corporations, individuals, or entities entitled to possess such drugs or devices, other than consumers.
The definition of wholesaler should include any type of transfer of drugs or devices.
Therefore, "and" is replaced by "or."
Recommendation 11 - Amend the powers and duties of the Board for greater clarification.
Amend section 12-22-110, C.R.S., to read as follows: Several changes are recommended for this section of the Act referencing the powers and duties of the Board.
The Board's powers have not been clearly and concisely defined throughout, therefore, the following recommendations add greater clarification to the Act.
12-22-110(1)(e) Administer examinations AND DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS AND FITNESS OF to applicants for licensure; 12-22-110(1)(f) Keep a record of all licenses, and registrations, AND RENEWALS FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, AND of all license and registration renewals, A RECORD OF ALL suspensions, and revocations, AND ANY OTHER DISCIPLINE and A RECORD of its own proceedings;
54
12-22-110(1)(h) MAKE INVESTIGATIONS, HOLD HEARINGS, AND TAKE EVIDENCE IN ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THE EXERCISE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE POWERS AND DUTIES VESTED IN THE BOARD AND, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY INVESTIGATION, SUBPOENA WITNESSES, ADMINISTER OATHS, AND COMPEL THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES AND THE PRODUCTION OF BOOKS, PAPERS, AND RECORDS RELEVANT TO ANY SUCH INVESTIGATION OR HEARING.
ANY SUBPOENA ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE BY THE DISTRICT COURT.
The recommended language in sections 12-22-110(1)(e) - (h), C.R.S., is modeled from language existing in other board statutes.
Although these powers are probably implied, they are not guaranteed without specific language.
12-22-110(4)(a) Whenever a duly authorized agent of the board finds or has probable cause to believe that in any REGISTERED OUTLET prescription drug outlet any drug, nonprescription drug, or device is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the "Colorado Food and Drug Act", part 4 of article 5 of title 25, C.R.S., he shall affix to such article a tag or other appropriate marking giving notice that such article is, or is suspected of being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained or embargoed and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article by sale or otherwise until provision for removal or disposal is given by the board, its agent, or the court.
No person shall remove or dispose of such embargoed article by sale or otherwise without the permission of the board or its agent or, after summary proceedings have been instituted, without permission from the court.
This recommendation expands the Board's embargo power to other facilities beyond prescription drug outlets.
The editor's note that was added to this section relates to the legalities applicable to statutory adoption.
This information is unnecessary in this Act.
55
Recommendation 12 - Allow research companies to be exempt from the Act.
Amend section 12-22-116.5, C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-116.5.
Exemption from licensure - hospital residency programs Â­ home renal dialysis Â­ RESEARCH COMPANIES.
(1) The board shall have the authority to approve hospital residency programs in the practice of pharmacy.
Persons accepted into an approved hospital residency program who are licensed to practice pharmacy in another state shall be exempt from the licensing requirements of this part 1 so long as their practice is limited to participation in the residency program.
12-22-116.5(3) A MANUFACTURER WHICH MUST OBTAIN A PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR DEVICE SOLELY FOR USE IN ITS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR TESTING PROCEDURES AND WHICH DOES NOT FURTHER DISTRIBUTE THE DRUG OR DEVICE MAY APPLY TO THE BOARD FOR A WAIVER OF REGISTRATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
THE BOARD MAY GRANT SUCH A WAIVER PROVIDED THAT THE MANUFACTURER SUBMITS TO THE BOARD THE NAME OF THE DRUG OR DEVICE IT REQUIRES AND A SWORN AFFIDAVIT CERTIFYING THAT THE DRUG OR DEVICE WILL ONLY BE USED FOR NECESSARY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR TESTING PROCEDURES AND WILL NOT BE FURTHER DISTRIBUTED.
THIS WAIVER SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AS DEFINED IN STATE OR FEDERAL LAW.
Occasionally a manufacturer needs a prescription drug for internal use in research, development, manufacturing and/or testing of a product.
A typical example might be the need for sterile water for cleaning or calibration of equipment.
The manufacturer does not qualify for registration in any category listed in section 12-22 120, C.R.S., because it does not produce or sell prescription drugs.
Without a registration, wholesale suppliers of prescription drugs are prohibited from distributing to the manufacturer.
This recommendation would create an avenue for the Board to grant an exemption for such situation, so the manufacturer would be permitted to obtain the needed product.
56
Recommendation 13 - Update and revise responsibilities of pharmacy managers of prescription drug outlets.
Amend section 12-22-119(1)(b), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-119(1)(b) The registration of any prescription drug outlet shall become void if the pharmacist manager in whose name the prescription drug outlet registration was issued ceases to be engaged as the manager, and the owner shall close the prescription drug outlet unless such owner has employed a pharmacist, and, within FOURTEEN (14) seven days after termination of the former manager's employment, has made application to transfer the registration to the new manager and has paid the transfer fee therefor.
Currently, an owner of a prescription drug outlet has only seven days in which to make an application to transfer the registration to a new manager when the previous one has left that position.
This time period is unduly short and an increase to a 14-day period is recommended.
Recommendation 14 - Amend the frequency of registration for outlets.
Amend section 12-22-120(1) to read as follows: 12-22-120(1) All outlets with facilities in this state shall register annually with the board in one of the following classifications: It is an administrative burden for the agency to be required to renew businesses every year.
All other licensees and registrants are on a biennial schedule.
For administrative efficiency, the agency would like to renew pharmacists one year and businesses the next year.
Recommendation 15 - Clarify language to allow the transfer of facility registrations.
Amend section 12-22-120(4), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-120(4) Registrations issued by the board pursuant to this section are not transferable or assignable ONLY PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE AND BOARD REGULATIONS.
57
There are several provisions in the statute that address the transfer of ownership of a pharmacy.
The provisions of section 12-22-114(1)(g),(h) 
As currently written, this section precludes any transfer of facility registrations.
This is not the current practice of the Board or the intent of the Act.
Recommendation 16 - Clarify the authority to transfer products between affiliated other outlets.
Amend sections 12-22-121(2), (3) and (5), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-121(2) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, a manufacturer of drugs may sell or give any drug to any wholesaler of drugs or to a licensed hospital or registered prescription drug outlet OR OTHER OUTLET, or he may give or sell any drug to any practitioner authorized by law to prescribe the same.
12-22-121(3) A wholesaler may sell or give any drug or device to another wholesaler of drugs or devices, to any licensed hospital or registered prescription drug outlet OR OTHER OUTLET, or to any practitioner authorized by law to prescribe the same.
12-22-121(5)(b) IN THE CASE OF A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHICH OPERATES REGISTERED OTHER OUTLETS, ONE REGISTERED OTHER OUTLET MAY MAKE A CASUAL SALE OF A DRUG TO ANOTHER REGISTERED OUTLET PROVIDED THAT (I) THE DRUG IS SOLD IN THE ORIGINAL SEALED CONTAINER IN WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY RECEIVED FROM THE WHOLESALER; (II) NO SUCH CASUAL SALE IS MADE TO ANY REGISTERED OUTLET THAT IS NOT OWNED AND/OR OPERATED BY THAT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT; AND (III) THE AMOUNT SOLD DOES NOT EXCEED THE FIVE PERCENT LIMIT ESTABLISHED BY SECTION 12-22102(5), C.R.S.
58
During an Other Outlet Task Force meeting, it was proposed that such transfers would be helpful when one outlet has an excess of drugs and another outlet needs additional drugs.
Rather than wasting the excess drugs, they could be transferred to where they are needed.
There is still the five percent limitation on total amount as expressed in section 12-22-102(5), C.R.S., that defines "casual sale."
Currently, some of the larger county health departments already register as wholesalers if they wish to purchase drugs in bulk and distribute them to their satellite "other outlets."
Re-packaging, however is not allowed, unless they comply with federal regulations.
The recommended change is proposed to reduce the red tape involved for government entities when carrying out their public responsibilities.
Subsections (2) and (3) are revised to incorporate "other outlets" into their language.
Recommendation 17 - Clarify the pharmacist's authority to refill a prescription order.
Amend section 12-22-122(2), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-122(2) A pharmacist may refill a prescription order for any prescription drug EXCLUDING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES without the prescriber's authorization when all reasonable efforts to contact the prescriber have failed and when, in the pharmacist's professional judgment, continuation of the medication is necessary for the patient's health, safety, and welfare.
Such prescription refill shall only be in an amount sufficient to maintain the patient until the prescriber can be contacted, but in no event shall a refill under this subsection (2) continue medication beyond seventy-two hours.
However, if the prescriber states on the prescription that there shall be no emergency filling of the prescription, then the pharmacist shall not issue any medication not authorized by the prescription.
Neither a prescription drug outlet nor a pharmacist shall incur any liability as a result of refusing to refill a prescription pursuant to this subsection (2).
59
Subsection (2) needs to be clarified to conform to federal law.
The pharmacist's authority to refill a prescription when the prescriber cannot be reached is limited to prescriptions for noncontrolled substances only.
Recommendation 18 Â­ Replace the word "pharmacist" with the word "prescription drug."
Amend section 12-22130(1)(b), C.R.S., to read as follows: 12-22-130(1)(b) That it complies with all lawful directions and requests for information from the regulatory or licensing agency of the state in which it is licensed as well as with all requests for information made by the board pursuant to this section.
The nonresident prescription drug outlet shall maintain at all times a valid, unexpired license, permit, or registration to conduct the pharmacist PRESCRIPTION DRUG outlet in compliance with the laws of the state in which it is a resident.
As a prerequisite to registering with the board, the nonresident prescription drug outlet shall submit a copy of the most recent inspection report resulting from an inspection conducted by the regulatory or licensing agency of the state in which it is located.
This recommendation conforms to Recommendation 2 on page 53 that revises the definition of "prescription drug outlet" in section 12-22-102(30.2), C.R.S.
