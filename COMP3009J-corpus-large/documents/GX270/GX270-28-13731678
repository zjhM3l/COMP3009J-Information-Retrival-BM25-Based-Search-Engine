A school board derives its legal status from the State Constitution and the State Legislature.
In discharging its duties, each school board must function in accordance with applicable state and federal statutes, controlling court decisions, and applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to statute by state and federal agencies.
The school board is a corporate body and has the exclusive power to manage and govern the public schools of each district in the State of Florida.
According to Section 230.22, Florida Statutes, the school board, as a legal agent, has specific statutory powers.
The school board has the legal power and duty to: n n n n n n
determine policies and programs; adopt rules and regulations; prescribe minimum standards; contract, sue and be sued; perform duties and responsibilities; and assign students to schools.
Section 230.23, Florida Statutes, provides additional powers and duties of Florida school boards: n n n n n
require minutes and records to be kept; control property; adopt school programs; establish, organize, and operate schools; designate positions to be filled; prescribe qualifications for those positions; and provide for the appointment, compensation, promotion, suspension, and dismissal of employees subject to the requirements of Chapter 231, Florida Statutes;

CURRENT SITUATION Policy making in Hillsborough County is the responsibility of, and vested in, a sevenmember school board.
Five members of the Board must reside in a district and two are at-large positions.
However, all Board members are elected by voters throughout the County.
Each Board member serves for a four-year staggered term with elections held every two years in November (1996, 1998, 2000).
The current School Board of Hillsborough County is shown in Exhibit 4-1.
Each Board member represents the Hillsborough County School District on a number of committees.
These organizational assignments are shown in Exhibit 4-2.
FINDING The School Board of Hillsborough County was one of the original school boards identified as a Master Board by the Florida School Boards Association (FSBA).
The FSBA Master Board Program is a 40-hour training program designed to: n
focus on the Board and the Superintendent as a collective unit;

build team concepts in a skills-based leadership curriculum utilizing an unstructured and individualized format; and identify areas for leadership development through self-evaluation.
n
The distinction of Master Board remains in effect for the period of time in which individuals of the leadership team continue to serve as Board members or as Superintendent in the school district.
When the composition of the leadership team changes, additional training components, such as the Master Board Reinstatement Program, must be completed in order for the new leadership team to regain the distinction of Master Board.
The additional training curriculum includes effective communication skills, leadership styles, team building activities, and ethics.
COMMENDATION The School Board of Hillsborough County is commended for its recognition as a Master Board by the Florida School Boards Association and for continuing in the Master Board Reinstatement Program.
FINDING In addition to the stability of the current Board, an analysis of the terms of past Board members also shows longevity in the terms of office for Board members.

1 Administrators include central office administrators and principals.
2 Percent responding Good or Excellent / Percent responding Fair or Poor.
The ratings provided by central office administrators and principals of school board members on MGT surveys have never been as high as in Hillsborough County.
Further, MGT observations of Board meetings, interviews with senior staff and school board members, and review of written documents confirm the high standards of cooperation maintained by this Board.
The School Board of Hillsborough County is not involved in administrative detail nor micro-managing.
The Board is also not rubber stamping administrative decisions.
Examples were found of votes that were not unanimous and also of agenda items that had been pulled because further research and/or documentation were needed.
COMMENDATION The School Board of Hillsborough County is commended for its exemplary teamwork, leadership, and support of the administration.
The School Board of Hillsborough County sets an example for other school boards in the state and nation to emulate.
Because of this cooperative focus, the emphasis in the district can clearly be on the educational system and student learning.
FINDING Board meetings are held at 7:00 p.m. on the first Tuesday and 3:00 p.m. on the third Tuesday of each month in the auditorium of the Administrative Center.
In addition to these regular Board meetings, Board workshops are held to address specific issues.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-5
School District Organization and Management
About one workshop a month occurs on the average and they frequently occur at noon on Tuesdays.
Workshops are also held at the Administrative Center.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-1: Rotate Board meetings and/or workshops among school campuses.
School boards throughout the country have found that by holding Board meetings at school campuses at least once a month, campuses can be showcased.
In addition, Board members can become more knowledgeable of school-based operations and accomplishments.
Such practice facilitates a positive relationship between the Board and campus personnel.
A rotating schedule would also respond to the concerns expressed by the community about the isolation of the Board and limited parking and the public perception concerning security at the downtown location.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Board Chairman and Superintendent should develop and prepare a calendar that identifies one school location per month for Board meetings.
2.
The proposed calendar for meetings at rotating school sites should be shared with the full School Board and approved.
FISCAL IMPACT The recommendation can be accomplished with existing resources.
FINDING An analysis of background materials provided to Board members prior to meetings reveals that these materials are sufficient for the Board to make informed decisions.
Comprehensive Board agenda packages are sent to the members one week prior to the Tuesday Board meeting.
Agenda items which did not make the Tuesday deadline are generally sent to members on Friday.
As shown in Exhibit 4-5, a cover page for each action agenda item enables senior staff to communicate effectively with the Board on the background of each agenda item.
A cover page has been developed to provide detail on each staff recommendation for Board action, the rationale for the recommendation, fiscal impact, data sources, and employee submitting the request.
Agenda item approval is required by an assistant superintendent on the cover form.
COMMENDATION District administrators provide comprehensive materials to Board members to prepare them for meetings and assist them to make informed decisions.

SUBJECT: Out of State Music Field Trips for the following schools: Bloomingdale High School Chamberlain High School East Bay High School Gaither High School Hillsborough High School King High School Plant High School
BACKGROUND: These schools have been invited to participate in various music festivals based partly on their past exemplary performances.
Many of these groups will be judged and given written evaluation on their prepared-musical literature.
RECOMMENDATION: On Friday, November 1, 1996, the music screening committee met to review applications submitted for out of state music field trips.
The screening committee would like to recommend for approval of these trips.
Music screening committee members were as follows: John Acosta, Supervisor, Middle/Secondary Music Vince Aguero, Principal, Madison Middle Robert Griffin, Band/Orchestra Director, Jefferson Rick Sylvester, Band/Orchestra, Ben Hill Jr High Danica Suarez, Orchestra Director Armwood High School/Burnett Middle Virginia Massey, Principal, Leto High Bob Keen, Band Director, Leto High Jerry Skora, Choral Director, Gaither High Manuel Suarez, Band/Orchestra, Director, Wilson Middle
RATIONALE: These festivals and concerts provide unique opportunities for our music students.
These students are able to experience performing in front of audiences from all over the country, along with meeting a wide range of students and instructors in a music educational environment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT: All cost will be borne by students and/or booster clubs.
DATA SOURCES: See attached field trip forms complete information about each trip.

The cover page for each agenda item provides a synopsis for Board members on each agenda action item.
FINDING A review of the agenda item cover sheet found inconsistencies among assistant superintendents in completing the cover sheet.
Several agenda items did not have complete summary information provided to the Board on the cover page.
In addition, the cover page could be strengthened by adding information on the Board policy governing the action.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-2: Require assistant superintendents and staff to complete agenda item cover pages; include information on the cover page as to the Board policy governing the action.
The addition of these two areas of emphasis will further strengthen the information provided to the Board and assist members in making informed decisions.
The policy reference can be used to verify compliance with Board policy.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should revise the agenda item cover page to include reference to Board policy.
2.
The Superintendent should ensure that all items on each cover page are completed by respective assistant superintendents prior to submission to the Board.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation requires no additional resources.
FINDING School board members in Hillsborough County are supported by a total of 1.25 FTE staff.
The full-time school board secretary is responsible for several duties including coordinating the Board agenda, routing and composing all responses to board members, conducting research of minutes and records, maintaining a master board calendar, and scheduling Board appointments.
The Superintendent's secretary attends Board meetings, takes minutes, and reportedly works on Board-related assignments about one-fourth of the time.
Based on a comparison of five school systems of similar size, the Hillsborough County School Board has a staff per school board member ratio of .18, which is significantly lower than any other large school system which was examined.

COMMENDATION The School Board of Hillsborough County is commended for the efficient and effective secretarial services provided while maintaining a low staff to Board member ratio.
FINDING A review of the minutes for several Board meetings, however, found lack of sufficient detail regarding agenda items and any relevant history relating to those items.
Some board minutes that were analyzed lack sufficient detail with respect to the Board discussion of agenda items.
This indicates that discussion among Board members at meetings is not taking place or that such discussion is not being documented.
(Based on observations of the January 18, 1997 Board meeting and discussions with Board members and senior staff, the review team believes the latter to be the case.)
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-3: Prepare more comprehensive and detailed minutes to support justifications of Board action.
A review of the Board minutes indicated that, in some cases, insufficient information is included in the minutes regarding Board discussion and action.
If certain Board actions were to be questioned by the public, the Board minutes in their current form, in some cases, do not provide adequate justification or accountability for that decision.
While a relatively small percentage of Board votes are split, there is no disclosure in the minutes of the basis for any position on an issue.
Consequently, it is not possible to MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-9
School District Organization and Management
evaluate Board decisions without reviewing the taped recordings of the meetings.
Every word spoken does not need to be recorded in the minutes, unless specifically requested.
However, full disclosure of the content of discussion should be included and should reference the individual making the points.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Board Secretary should obtain copies of examples of minutes developed in other districts which are more comprehensive.
The following is a "fictitious" example of how the minutes are currently recorded versus a level of detail suggested by this recommendation.
June 1997
Current approach:
Motion Failed (Board members voting against action are listed) or Motion Approved (Board members who move and second the motion are listed) and if unanimous, so stated with no discussion.
Proposed approach:
Discussion Board Member "A" mentioned importance of considering another alternative for the food services contract, and believes that the quality of food should be given priority.
Board member "B" commented that the quality of food was important, but that the cost of providing the other contract was prohibitive to the school district and was not considered when developing the budget.
The Superintendent commented that food quality was one of the evaluation criteria applied in recommending the alternative.
Vote: Motion failed (individual votes listed)
2.
The Board Chair should work with the Board Recording Secretary to ensure greater detail.
3.
Minutes should be augmented in greater detail by the Board.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished with existing resources.

Policies and Procedures
CURRENT SITUATION In the Hillsborough County School District, each assistant superintendent of the seven divisions within the district is responsible for preparing and recommending changes of policy to the Superintendent.
The assistant superintendents also prepare necessary procedures to accompany policies.
The Director of Administration within the Division of Administration is responsible for maintaining and updating the Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
The schools have approximately six printed copies of the Guidebook, which are distributed to the principal, assistant principal, guidance counselor, the food service manager, and head custodian.
An additional copy is available as a general office copy.
In the past, the entire guidebook was normally reprinted with all additions and revisions made in the summer and then distributed prior to the start of school.
The most recent major revision of the Hillsborough County School District Guidebook of Policies and Procedures was completed in 1991.
In 1993, the District signed a contract with the Florida School Boards Association to revise the district's policy and procedures guidebook.
The Florida School Boards Association and the Hillsborough County School District did not complete the revision agreed upon in 1993.
In December 1996, the district, the Florida School Boards Association, and a subcontractor (Educational Management Consultant Services, Inc.) signed an agreement to revise the Hillsborough County Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
The Florida School Boards Association estimated that a minimum of 1,000 manpower hours will be required to complete the project of revising the policy manual.
FINDING The Hillsborough County Public Schools Guidebook of Policies and Procedures is not current.
Once the decision was made to revise the Guidebook in 1993, the Office of the Director of Administration stopped the normal procedure of integrating new policies and procedures into existing guidebooks.
The policies which have been approved, but not distributed, include those which were approved between February 1992 and the time of the performance review.
A draft document was recently prepared in which the policies and procedures since 1992 were incorporated into the 1991 edition of the Guidebook.
There is no standard process in the district for updating the copies of the Guidebook.
The current draft of the Guidebook is available on computer disk; however, no electronic version of the Guidebook has been made available to the schools, district offices, or to the public.
Exhibit 4-7 shows part of the current "Superintendent's Goals and Strategies," accepted by the Hillsborough County School Board in January 1997, in which the Superintendent described the district as one which is actively decentralizing its authority and responsibilities.

EXHIBIT 4-7 GOALS AND STRATEGIES OF THE SUPERINTENDENT January 21, 1997
SUPERINTENDENT'S GOALS AND STRATEGIES July 1996 and Beyond Through reforms which are already under way and which are being proposed in goals and strategies which follow, the school system is being re-engineered.
The unit of accountability has become the school, and the accountability is shifting from evaluation of processes and procedures to the evaluation of the success of the school in meeting goals for student academic performance.
Source: Excerpted from the complete document, "Agenda Item for Approval," January 21, 1997, "Goals and Strategies of the Superintendent," page 3.
Currently, the principals in the schools do not have a current set of policies and procedures to guide their work.
Some procedures are necessarily linked to the policies which guide them and are included in the 1991 edition and the 1996 draft of the Guidebook.
Some procedures included in both editions are unnecessarily included.
In addition, other procedures are found in the many procedural handbooks which exist in the various divisions of the school district.
RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4-4: Complete the comprehensive review and update of policies and procedures begun in January 1997.
With the Superintendent's stated belief in and priority for accountability at the school level, it is important that those held accountable for implementing Board policies and procedures have current and revised information.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Director of Administration should oversee the completion of the revision of the district's Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources.
Summer 1997
MGT of America, Inc.

Recommendation 4-5: Develop a system for regular dissemination of new and revised Board policies.
The Assistant Superintendent of Administration should ensure that policy holders receive all Board changes to policies in a timely manner.
Currently, the principals in the schools do not have a current set of policies and procedures to guide their work.
They do not receive copies of policies to insert into their policy manual each time the Board approves a new policy or revises an existing policy.
Nor is there any system in place for sending out new or revised policies on a periodic basis.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should decide on the timeframe which is best for distributing new Board policies to all policy book holders.
This timeframe may be as frequently as immediately after the Board passes a change.
It should not be any longer than full dissemination of all changes once every three months.
2.
The Superintendent should direct the Assistant Superintendent of Administration to develop a permanent system for distributing Board policy changes to all policy book holders.
3.
The Director of Administration should implement the new system for periodic distribution of policy changes, upon completion of the current revision of the Guidebook.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within current resources available within the Division of Administration.
Recommendation 4-6: Create an electronic system for updating and circulating the Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
With the growing use of computer technology in the district, it is possible to serve the district's schools and learning centers with an electronic version of the Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
The capability exists for some of the schools and learning centers to receive the manual with an on-line delivery system.
Others can use diskette versions or printed copies.
The master version should be a current on-line edition maintained and updated monthly by the district with computer diskette revisions distributed in a timely basis as needed.

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Director of Administration should direct the preparation of a computerized version of the newly revised Guidebook of Policies and Procedures.
The index now in use should be expanded to include keywords found in policies.
2.
The Superintendent should that updated copies of Guidebook of Policies and through the public libraries in recommend to the Board the Hillsborough County Procedures be available Hillsborough County.
July 1997

3.
The Director of Administration should use a current list of the status of technology and electronic communications within each school and learning center to make electronic versions available in the appropriate manner and provide printed hard copy versions as necessary.
4.
The Director of Administration should provide a standard process by which schools and learning centers regularly update their copies of the Guidebook.
5.
The Director of Administration, in conjunction with the General Director of Management Information Services, should make the district's Guidebook of Policies and Procedures available on a district homepage.
6.
The Director of Administration should direct the monthly updating and maintenance of the information in the Guidebook in the electronic format.

The Hillsborough County School District does not have a comprehensive administrative procedures manual.
Also, most departments/divisions do not have procedures manuals common in many districts (e.g., purchasing manual, employee manual/handbook).
During interviews with assistant superintendents, a few isolated manuals were identified.
Nonetheless, for the most part, these administrative procedures/regulations do not exist and procedures are communicated through memos.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-14
School District Organization and Management
RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4-7: Develop a comprehensive administrative procedures manual, which is updated regularly, maintained and circulated electronically.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Assistant Superintendent for Administration should outline all existing procedures manuals within the district.
2.
The Assistant Superintendent for Administration should require that the procedures identified be keyed to specific board policies.
In conjunction with the General Director of Management Information Systems, the Assistant Superintendent for Administration should oversee the electronic preparation of a comprehensive set of procedures and a procedures manual for the district.
Use of keywords should be incorporated to allow easy access policies and related procedures.
3.
The Assistant Superintendent for Administration should oversee the electronic production and regular distribution of the standardized procedures which accompany or support Board policies.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished with existing resources.
Recommendation 4-8: Hold administrators responsible and accountable for the prompt development of administrative procedures for their divisions.
These administrative procedures should (1) be the source of implementation of Board policy, (2) be communicated clearly to school administrators and staff, and (3) be updated annually.
The evaluation of each administrator should include a component on the effective development and implementation of administrative procedures in his/her area of responsibility.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
Following adoption of the revised policy manual by the Board, each Assistant Superintendent should conduct a detailed analysis of all updated policies to determine which policies require administrative procedures.

FINDING
1997-98 school year
June 1998
Commencing in 1998-99 year
Each school in Hillsborough County School District prepares a School Improvement Plan.
Plans may be based on practices allowed under current statutes, policies, or negotiated agreements.
However, schools may also request special waivers of state statutes, Board policies, or negotiated agreements in order to meet the goals specified in the school plan.
Waivers must be directly related to the School Improvement Plan.
Districtwide policies and practices have emerged from the school improvement process.
An example of this is found in the present practice of monthly released time for planning work which started with two schools in 1990 as part of the site-based decisionmaking initiative, and became a board-approved, districtwide policy in Fall 1992.
Another example of changing practice emerging from individual initiatives is found in the Educational Support Personnel Contract in which a change was made to allow for educational support personnel (ESP) to act as substitute teachers, as shown in Exhibit 4-8.
EXHIBIT 4-8 ESP/EMPLOYEES ACTING AS SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS Unless approved under a Blueprint 2000 School Improvement Plan that allows for supplemental pay, ESP employees shall not act as substitute teachers or be solely responsible for a classroom of students for more than two hours in any one day, for more than four hours in any one week, and for more than twelve hours per calendar month.
The hour limitations listed above are set at maximum levels to allow for emergency situations.
Normal conditions should only require the teacher aide to cover for one-half hour per day during the teacher's lunch time.

A study of "Paras as Subs" conducted by the Office of Accountability, Testing and Evaluation in Fall 1996 examined the current use of paraprofessionals as substitute teachers in the 51 eligible schools.
The purpose of the study was to monitor the use of this practice within the schools which had applied through School Improvement Plans to ask paraprofessionals to substitute for teachers.
One-third of the schools in Hillsborough County are now using the waiver process to allow paraprofessionals employed within a given school to cover classes as shown in Exhibit 4-9.
EXHIBIT 4-9 1995-96 WAIVERS GRANTED FOR PARAPROFESSIONAL USE AS SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS Waiver Paraprofessionals as Substitutes Number Granted 48 n n
Outcome Forty-six schools implemented this policy waiver.
Forty-four of the schools reported extremely positive results.
Most indicated that the lessons were carried out appropriately and disruptions were reduced when the paraprofessional was the substitute.
Source:
Report on Adequate Progress Toward School Improvement Goals and Evaluation Findings of Approved Policy Waivers, October 1996, Department of Evaluation, Assessment, and Accountability.
School Advisory Councils, principals, and teachers report significant benefits in increased learning time for students as a result of this practice.
At the present time, there is no Board policy which guides the practice of using paraprofessionals as substitutes.
The practice is likely to continue to expand.
There is widespread support at the school and district level for this change since there has been a shortage of permanent substitute teachers in the district.
Increased efforts have been made at the district level to advertise for and recruit additional substitutes.
However, these efforts have not been successful.
At the middle school principals' meeting in November 1996, and again in December, a discussion took place indicating that there were at that time only 1,000 applications for substitute teachers on hand, which was down from prior year figures of about 10,000.
Only 100 of the 1,000 will predictably be qualified for or accept the job as substitute teacher.
The minutes from the December meeting reported that, despite some easing of the problem, the situation was still a concern.
The data gathered in Fall 1996 for monitoring purposes may be a possible source of policy addition, change, or contract language review.
A third example of individual school initiatives growing into precedent-setting practice is in the area of examination exemptions.

Report on Adequate Progress Toward School Improvement Goals and Evaluation Findings of Approved Policy Waivers, October 1996, Department of Assessment, Accountability, and Evaluation, page 4.
When all schools in the district are using a practice established through the waiver process it takes on a different status than it might otherwise have, setting precedent over time that the policy may no longer be needed or effective.
Rather than policy change by default, the growing changes which result from the school improvement process need to be examined regularly as a source of policy change.
In the case of this particular practice, while support for the change is strong among the high school administrators, no support for the practice was voiced by district administrators when invited to comment on the trend.
In fact, the opposite was true.
The situation which has emerged is one in which decisions made at the school level are changing policy without benefit of the district's usual committee/study format.

confirming the district's commitment to site-based decision making and school improvement, there is, in this example, a conflict within the process.
District administrators will have to recommend or not recommend continuation of a policy which schools have worked hard to change, putting the district administrators at potential odds with high school principals.
Another example of a waiver area which has the potential to need policy adjustment or centralized procedure adjustment is the adoption by at least one high school in 1996 of the Copernican model of program scheduling.
This will result both in a difference of credits awarded to students for graduation and a difference among schools of the time of year when students have completed certain courses.
The high mobility rate of students from school to school within the district makes this an area which needs a proactive, planned approach to change which is beyond the scope of the individual school improvement process.
In the Superintendent's Goals and Strategies, presented to the Board in January 1997, the Superintendent identified specific parameters he will establish for any deviation from the district's "Standard Core Curriculum" as shown in Exhibit 4-12.
EXHIBIT 4-12 SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR REQUESTING TO DEVIATE FROM CORE CURRICULUM GOALS AND STRATEGIES OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 5.1.4 5.1.5 A Standard Core Curriculum will be implemented at all grades.
Deviation from the Standard Core Curriculum will be approved only for research-based pilots with both a finite time period and an empirical assessment component.

Source:
At the present time, curriculum waivers are discouraged and infrequently requested.
This practice is true under the current accountability legislation and was also true in 1990 when the district and the Teachers' Association identified curriculum as one of the areas which would not be eligible for site-based decision making under that initiative.
Exhibit 4-13 shows the status of waivers granted for curriculum modification last year.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-9: Use the analysis made annually by the Office of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation as a source of data for identification of potential areas for policy changes in the fall of each year.
Reach consensus on and publish in the Guidelines for School Improvement, a list of any areas in which schools should not apply for waivers or in which there are specific conditions on the waivers.

During interviews with senior staff, principals, teachers, and community leaders, the current Superintendent was praised for his strong leadership.
The responses of administrators, principals, and teachers to the confidential employee survey conducted by MGT indicate that the Superintendent is seen as a strong instructional leader by administrators (90 percent for Hillsborough administrators compared to 66 percent for administrators in other school districts), and as an effective chief administrator and manager (91 percent for Hillsborough administrators compared to 70 percent in other school districts).
Clearly, as shown in Exhibit 4-16, the Superintendent enjoys the relatively strong support of administrators and teachers within the Hillsborough County School District.

School District Organization and Management
COMMENDATION The Superintendent is commended for his strong leadership role for the education and management of the Hillsborough County School District.
High student performance and effective management do not occur by chance.
It takes a strong leader who is willing to support staff, articulate clear objectives, and secure the necessary resources to ensure the best educational system possible.
The current Superintendent exhibits the skills and determination necessary to lead and manage this school district.
FINDING The Senior Staff consists of the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, each assistant superintendent, the Director of Communications, and the Administrative Assistant to the Superintendent.
The Superintendent's Senior Staff regularly addresses issues related to district operations and continues to strive to initiate internal improvements.
Team members actively participate in defining management issues and collaborating on solutions.
COMMENDATION The Hillsborough County School District is commended for the team work exhibited by the Superintendent's Senior Staff.
The focus of the Superintendent's Senior Staff is on increased visibility in the schools and providing a customer service focus for the central office.
The Superintendent provides the leadership and role model for this focus on schools.
FINDING In January 1997, Superintendent Lennard proposed a district reorganization of the divisions (effective July 1997).
The July 1997 reorganization plan was developed in collaboration with the divisions.
The assistant superintendent of each division was directed by the Superintendent to analyze unit responsibilities and reorganize resources to increase direct support to students, parents, teachers, and principals, while reducing the salary expenditures for district operations.
According to the Superintendent's plan, the proposed reorganization increases collaboration between divisions to strengthen the focus on the district goals.
The plan's goal is to bring district-level administrators closer to students, parents, and schools as well as the community they serve; facilitate the completion and management of the full implementation of the cluster plan; and increase support for the efforts of schools to improve student achievement.
The proposal: n
transfers two General Directors (one from the Instructional Division and one from the Division of Technical, Career and Adult Education) to the Division of Administration to bring the total of General Area Directors to six; Hillsborough Page 4-24
MGT of America, Inc.

n
assigns personnel of other divisions so that identified individuals will have responsibilities for schools in the specific geographical administrative area assigned to a General Area Director; consolidates Office Machine Repair, Audio Visual Repair, and technology responsibilities in the Division of Operations; reduces the number of district-level positions; and aligns positions with responsibilities and reduces district-level salary accounts by $3.15 million.
n
n n
Six administrative areas are being created.
A General Area Director will be responsible for and housed in each of the six geographical areas, composed primarily of schools in contiguous clusters.
Resource personnel from other divisions will be assigned to the geographical clusters, but will not be housed in the specific area.
Exhibit 4-17 below describes the personnel to be transferred to each area.
As can be seen, in addition to the General Director, transportation, ESE, and food service staff are being reassigned to specific geographic areas.

In the Superintendent's reorganization plan, the following administrative position classifications are being deleted, added or reclassified (not including Teachers on Special Assignment): n
19 administrators -- supervisors (13) and coordinators (6) are being deleted; six administrators are being added -- two directors, one supervisor and three coordinators; five vacancies are being filled -- three supervisors and two coordinators; and six positions are being reclassified as supervisors.

Therefore, the net effect of central office administrators under the reorganization plan is that 19 administrative positions are being deleted and 17 are being added or a net effect for a reduction of two administrators.
In addition to the changes in administrators, a net of 15 Teachers on Special Assignment (TSAs) are being deleted, and six other instructional positions are being deleted and one is being reclassified.
For clerical and non-instructional positions, 33 are being deleted, 20 are being reclassified, 13 added, and five vacancies filled.
COMMENDATION The Superintendent and Senior Staff of the Hillsborough County School District are commended for the district reorganization plan which will be implemented July 1997.
The plan should bring services closer to the schools, facilitate decentralization and site-based decision making, and promote the implementation of the cluster plan.
NOTE: The MGT recommendations which follow in this section provide for further reorganization.
They are intended to support the Superintendent's goals and strategies and further decentralize the central office while promoting the six administrative areas under the auspices of the six General Area Directors.
The following list provides highlights of the three different organizational structures.

FINDING Exhibits 4-18, 4-19, and 4-20 provide Florida Department of Education data on administrators per student for the 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96, and 1996-97 school years.
n
Exhibit 4-18 provides these data by ratios of administrators per classroom teachers, administrators per instructional personnel, and administrators per total staff; Exhibit 4-19 shows total administrators per 1,000 students for the three years; and Exhibit 4-20 provides district-level (central office) administrators per 1,000 students.
n
n
As can be seen, when comparing these exhibits, the Hillsborough County School District has more administrators per 1,000 students than the peer districts and state average for each of the four years shown.
The peer district average in 1995-96 was .99 district-level administrators per thousand students; the Hillsborough County School District ratio was 1.44 administrators per thousand students.
Similarly, in 1996-97, the peer district average was .81 and the Hillsborough County School District ratio was 1.29 per thousand students.
MGT's rationale for using the administrator comparison ratios provided by the Florida Department of Education was provided in Chapter 2 (Section 2.12).
However, in light of concerns expressed by the Hillsborough County School District and based on our experiences in other school districts, we are making no recommendations for reductions in administrators based on state-level data alone.
Rather each division, department, and in some cases, program or unit is analyzed based on its specified role and responsibilities, span of control for administrators, documentation provided by the district, expertise of the consultant team, and best practices seen in other districts.
In conducting the analyses and in making recommendations, the overarching charge was the direction set by the Florida Legislature as the three purposes for the Florida school performance reviews.
Once again, these three purposes are: n n n
save funds; improvement management; and improve efficiency and effectiveness.

RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4-10: Further reorganize the central office administration in the Hillsborough County School District (as of July 1998).
MGT's recommended organizational structure for the executive administration of the Hillsborough County School District is shown for senior staff (and the instructional divisions) in Exhibit 4-21.
This recommended structure further decentralizes the district administration by having general area directors report directly to the Superintendent, and by delegating additional responsibilities to the areas which should be augmented over the next five years.
While the Superintendent's plan makes significant process towards decentralization and providing more support for the schools, several additional organizational changes in the central office are needed and should be made.
A further reduction in the number of central office administrators and flattening of the organizational structure is recommended.
The recommendations call for the deletion and consolidation of several positions which will each be specifically addressed in subsequent chapters of this report.
The following organizational changes are consistent with the intent of site-based decision making and accommodate a decentralized service organization and structure as the district continues to implement the site-based decision making as well as the area and cluster concepts.
n
Eliminate the Assistant Superintendent for Supportive Services and create an Assistant Superintendent for Educational Support Services.
The duties of the new assistant superintendent should be: - - - -
assessment, accountability, and evaluation physical, mental health evaluation and social services staff development educational media and technology
n
Have General Area Directors report to the Superintendent (as the role of the area office is expanded, the Board and Superintendent may wish to retitle the General Area Directors as Area Superintendents by FY 2000).
The Deputy Superintendent's role should be the day-to-day management of the central office.
With the reduced responsibilities of the Assistant Superintendent for Administration (i.e., without General Area Directors to supervise), the position should be expanded to include a planning as well as the administration function (see Section 4.3.2) with a change in title to Assistant Superintendent for Planning and Administration.
n
Six elementary generalist positions and two secondary generalist positions should be created to support the area offices (some of these positions will be created in July 1997 under the Superintendent's Reorganization Plan).

Selected transportation, food services, and ESE operations will be administratively moved to areas in July 1997.
Each year the Superintendent's senior staff should continue to assess the effectiveness of the area offices with the goal to further decentralize services from the central office to the six areas.
FINDING Under the Superintendent's Reorganization Plan, the General Area Directors will be the focus in the six area offices for schools and principals.
In Section 4.4 which follows, the need for the General Area Directors to focus on instruction and the additional training required of General Area Directors are discussed.
Under the current and proposed structure, there are too many layers between the principals and the Superintendent.
Recommendation 4-11: Realign the reporting relationship so that General Area Directors report directly to the Superintendent.
Implementing this recommendation will remove two layers of management between the Superintendent and principals as shown in Exhibit 4-22.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINES 1.
The Superintendent should study the proposed reorganization plan as shown in Exhibits 4-21 and 4-22.
2.
A draft proposed reorganization plan for 1998-99 should be presented to the Board for review.
3.
Following Board approval of the draft, the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources and should develop job descriptions for all new and revised positions.
4.

4.3.2 District Planning CURRENT SITUATION Since 1989, the School Board has approved a series of significant reform initiatives.
For example, the 1994 Vision and Goals for Quality Education set forth vision and mission statements for the Hillsborough County School District.
In this document, the school district adopted the national goals of America 2000 and state goals identified in Florida's Blueprint 2000.
These included: n
Goal 1 Readiness to start school - Communities and schools collaborate to prepare children and families for children's success in school.
Goal 2 Graduation rate and readiness for post-secondary education and employment - Students graduate and are prepared to enter the workforce and postsecondary education.
Goal 3 Student Performance - Student successfully compete at the highest levels nationally and internationally and are prepared to make well-reasoned, thoughtful and healthy lifelong decisions.
Goal 4 Learning Environment/Excellence in Math and Science School Board provide a learning environment conductive to teaching and learning that includes sequential instruction in mathematics, science, reading, writing, and the social sciences and appropriate educational materials, equipment and pupil/teacher ratios.

Goal 5 School Safety and Environment - Communities provide an environment that is drug-free and protects students' health, safety, and civil rights.
Goal 6 Professional Teachers and Staff - The schools, district, and state ensure professional teachers and staff.
Goal 7 Adult Literacy/Multicultural - Students PK-12 and adult Floridians are literate and have the knowledge and skills needed to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, and appreciate the value and contributions of all races and cultures.

More recently, in January 1997, the Superintendent set forth proposed goals and strategies as part of the overall plan for continuous improvement of the school district.
The goals and objectives were developed to ensure successful completion of several reform initiatives.
The district's reform initiatives and re-engineering processes which have been ongoing since 1989 are shown in Exhibit 4-23.
EXHIBIT 4-23 MAJOR REFORM INITIATIVES AS OUTLINED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT IN THE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 1.
THE CLUSTER PLAN: The district has reorganized the schools into seventeen clusters of feeder chains built around the seventeen zoned high schools.
Junior high schools and first grade centers were replaced by elementary schools housing grades kindergarten through grade five.
Middle schools were designed and implemented for grades six through eight.
High schools housing grades nine through twelve were developed.
Growth will add two more high schools and their supporting clusters in 1998-99.
The cluster plan completely redesigned the school system and eliminated the district organization which was in place since the school system was desegregated in 1971.
The cluster plan eliminated one grade center.
It provides continuity for students by seeking to keep students together in student bodies with peers from their neighborhoods as the students move through the school system.
The cluster plan has been carefully and systematically implemented form 1992-93 through 1997-98.
Extensive involvement of the community has occurred through an ongoing set of community meetings held in the neighborhoods as each cluster was designed.
2.
MIDDLE SCHOOLS: The district has replaced sixth grade centers, seventh grade centers, and eight and ninth grade junior high schools with middle schools for grades six, seven and eight.
A Middle School Task Force was developed to help design and implement the middle school program.
The task force provided the means for broad participation in the development of the program by school-based administrators, teachers and community members.
The result was not just a reorganization of grades, but a complete redesign of the content of the curriculum.
Additional reforms include the development of interdisciplinary team teaching, teacher advisor-advisee programs, and performance assessment.
3.
MAGNET SCHOOLS: To provide parents and students with greater opportunities to choose the schools they attend, decrease the use of mandatory busing for desegregation, and improve instruction, the district has and is opening a series of elementary, middle and high school magnet programs.
The present magnet offerings are based on national research and local market analysis.
Extensive admissions waiting lists and excellent student performance data testify to the effectiveness of the magnet programs that are presently operating.
Additional programs are already designed and will open in 1997-98 and 1998-99.
Additional magnet offerings will be determined as part of the district's continuous planning process.

EXHIBIT 4-23 (Continued) MAJOR REFORM INITIATIVES IN THE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 4.
SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING: Prior to the implementation of Blueprint 2000 and Florida's System of School Improvement and Accountability, the School District implemented site-based decision making.
The process for site-based decision making was designed by a group of district and school-based administrators, teachers, parents and community members.
This task force developed the policies and procedures which were eventually incorporated into the reforms associated with Blueprint 2000 and were adopted and used across the district.
The original planning team evolved into the Central Facilitating Team, an organization with broad participation, including teachers, parents, and business community members.
The Central Facilitating Team developed the original policies and procedures for school improvement teams and designed and conducted training for members of the school improvement teams.
As the process of site-based decision making merged with the school improvement process and became well established, the role and responsibilities of the Central Facilitating Team changed.
It has not become entrenched as another layer in the system, but instead has evolved into an advisory committee which is also available for ad hoc problem solving in the school improvement process.
5.
THE VISION AND GOALS TASK FORCE: The Vision and Goals Task Force was a strategic planning initiative which involved teachers, school-based and district administrators, and citizens in a broad based effort to develop a vision for the district and goals which insure the realization of that vision.
The School Board now has a vision for the district that guides the work of the organization and has officially adopted the goals of Florida's System of School Improvement and Accountability.
6.
DISTRICT STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS: A Standards and Benchmarks Committee, which included citizens, parents, teachers, and school and district administrators, helped develop a set of student performance standards.
The student performance standards include specific requirements for achievement of reading, writing and mathematics skills, and the application of those skills to real world situations.
These performance standards have been adopted and a time line for their implementation has been established.
Specific assessment tools to measure student attainment of the benchmarks are being developed.
The District Pupil Progression Plan is being changed to require the attainment of the appropriate standards for promotion from grades two, five, and eight and for graduation.
7.
BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS: Since 1989, the policies of the school district related to business partnerships have been completely reformed.
Prior to 1989 relationships between the school system and the schools, and business in the community were virtually nonexistent.
Today there are thousands of partnerships between businesses and the school system and between businesses and individual schools.
The Hillsborough Educational Foundation uses business partnerships to support grant requests and to fund hundreds of college scholarships each year for students still in the school system.
An additional benefit of the developing relationships with businesses is the rapidly increasing number of opportunities to get members of the business community into the schools and involved in the decision making process through participation on school improvement teams.

The Superintendent's goals were established to: n n n
improve student academic performance; ensure a safe and productive environment; and fully ensure a fiscally stable school system within available resources.
The Superintendent's goals and strategies are envisioned as a source of information to facilitate accountability and to evaluate the performance of the Superintendent as an instructional leader and chief administrator.
The goals are consistent with Sunshine State standards.
The Superintendent's goals and strategies are shown in Exhibit 4-24.
The addition to the Superintendent's goals and strategies, in January 1997 the School Board held a strategic planning retreat.
At the retreat, the Board identified the following three goals for the district: n n n
reading; training in the context of learning; and communication.
Additional strategic planning initiatives were being planned for Spring 1997 to further refine goals and develop objectives and strategies.
FINDING While the district has several goals, objectives and strategies as identified in the previous sections, there is no umbrella document which links the Superintendent's goals, Board goals, the Vision and Goals for Quality Education, and other planning initiatives.
No one office in the Hillsborough County School District is responsible for strategic planning.
Although a director in the Division of Instruction is responsible for "Comprehensive Planning," this was a position created to develop the state-required Comprehensive Education Plan in years past.
The individual in this position is not responsible for implementing either the Superintendent's nor the Board's goals.
Currently, the planning function is fragmented among several offices including the Division of Administration, Division of Instruction, and Division of Supportive Services.
RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4-12: Create a planning function within the Hillsborough County School District within the same organizational unit under one manager.

Consolidating these functions should greatly improve the coordination of district planning (long-range, short-range, enrollment projections) with the budget and resource allocation process.
This responsibility should be assumed by the Assistant Superintendent for Administration.
The name of this division should be changed to the Division of Planning and Administration.
This Office should be responsible for the creation of a strategic plan which links the Superintendent's goals and strategies, school board goals, as well as the Vision and Goals for Quality Education.
A Strategic Planning Committee should be created to facilitate this effort.
The Committee should be comprised of district and school MGT of America, Inc.

administrators and staff, business leaders, parents, and other community leaders.
Incorporating senior managers and Board members as members of the Planning Committee will underscore the importance of the plan as the umbrella instrument of the school district which provides the framework for addressing the Superintendent and Board priorities and facilitates the effective implementation of the priorities.
The Board and senior staff members should engage in a strategic which emphases and promotes the necessity for and importance of efforts in the Hillsborough County School District.
The plan should Board and senior staff as the overarching document which provides all existing and proposed initiatives in the school district.
Recommendation 4-13: Require that all central office/department budgets include a planning component which is linked to the Superintendent and Board priorities and supported through each office/department's budget request.
All budgets created by divisions and departments within the district should have a planning component which links to the districtwide strategic plan.
Each office and department should develop a plan which supports the mission of their unit and which is integrated with their budget.
School Improvement Plans should be linked with the annual budget development process.
Specifically, school plans should relate to the school's stated goals and objectives, and should contain specific budget requests to carry out the plans.
Currently, there is no requirement to develop such a plan.
Department and school plans should be linked to the Superintendent's and Board's goals and priorities.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
A Strategic Planning Committee should be created.
The Committee should be comprised of a broad cross section of district and school administrators, teachers, staff, and community representatives.
2.
The Board and Superintendent, with senior staff, should develop a strategic plan and ensure that it is closely integrated with the Superintendent and Board goals and the district's budget.

such other legal services as may be requested by the Board.
According to the terms of the agreement, for the services described in Section 1 above, the Board pays the attorney an annual fee of $58,200 (including a part-time secretarial allowance).
For the services identified in Section 2 above, the Board is assessed a fee of $103 per hour.
FINDING Most large school districts of over 100,000 students (and many smaller ones such as the Lee and Alachua County School Districts) have one or more Board or staff attorneys as employees of the district.
As shown in Exhibit 4-25, the legal fees provided to the Few and Ayala law firm in 1994-95 and 1995-96 total about $260,000 annually.
In addition, fees paid to other legal firms totaled about $440,000 in 1995-96.
While some of these legal services require highly specialized attorneys, others could be provided by a full-time School Board attorney.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-15: Hire a School Board attorney.
Most duties outlined in Section 2 above (for which the Board is assessed $103 per hour) should be assigned to a full-time Board attorney employed by the Hillsborough County School District.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Board should approve a position of Board attorney and one full-time secretary.
2.
The position should be advertised.
3.
The position of School Board attorney should be filled.
FISCAL IMPACT The fiscal impact is based on the fact that regular legal services would be performed by the full-time attorney hired by the Board as well as about 10 percent of the other legal August 1997 September October 1997 January 1998

services shown in Exhibit 4-25.
This projection is based on the best practice seen in other large school systems.
Ten percent of current legal fees (minus the Few and Ayala retainer costs) is about $44,000 with $260,000 for Few and Ayala for a total annual projected savings of about $304,000.
The salary of a full-time attorney is based on $75,000 per year plus benefits of 32 percent.
The salary of the secretary is calculated at $22,000 plus benefits.
The total annual cost of an attorney and secretary with benefits is $128,000.
($304,000 $128,000 = $176,000).
One-half the net savings is projected in 1997-98.
Recommendation Reduce Legal Costs 1997-98 $83,000 1998-99 $176,000 1999-2000 $176,000 2000-01 $176,000 2001-02 $176,000
4.3.4 Teachers on Special Assignments (TSAs) CURRENT SITUATION In the current school year, a total of 64 teachers are serving in the Hillsborough County School District in quasi-administrative roles.
These teachers include the following: n
50 Teachers on Special Assignment are designated to support programs at the central office (see Exhibit 4-26); and 14 Administrative Resource Teachers serve in elementary schools with student enrollments of over 1,000 students (see Exhibit 4-27).
(This position category was approved by the School Board in December 1993).
n
FINDING The district does not have a policy on the use of Teachers on Special Assignment.
Consequently, there is no limitation of the number of years a teacher may remain working in the capacity of a Teacher on Special Assignment.
Several districts have established a Board policy that stipulates how long a teacher may fill a position that has been specially assigned (e.g., Leon County has a limit of two years).
Furthermore, some districts no longer place teachers in specially assigned positions because of their commitment to keep teachers in the classroom for maximizing instruction (e.g., Bay and Sarasota Counties).
RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4-16: Establish a Board policy which limits the placement of a Teacher on a Special Assignment for a maximum period of three years.

The School Board should make a determination before the third year of a teacher's placement in a special assignment whether to continue the teacher as assigned or to create a permanent administrative position.
This recommendation should apply to both teachers on special assignment and administrative resource teachers.
Recommendation 4-17: Reduce Teachers on Special Assignment by at least 50 percent beyond the Superintendent's recommended level.
Teachers should be in the classroom instructing students.
While having a position as teacher on assignment provides exposure to administrative positions, the Hillsborough County School District has taken this initiative to an extreme by employing over 60 teachers in quasi-administrative roles with no direct responsibility for educating students.
The number of TSAs should be reduced by at least 18 in the 1998-99 school year.
Teachers on Special Assignment are technically considered to be teachers.
These individuals are obtaining administrative experience yet, for the most part, they are serving no students.
At an average teacher's salary of $32,000 (without benefits) times 50 Teachers on Special Assignment in the central office equates to about $2 million in salaries and benefits for teachers who serve no students.
According to the Superintendent's plan for reorganization in 1997-98, 20 TSA positions will be deleted and five added; the net effect of this recommendation is that 35 teachers would remain on special assignment in the central office.
Administrative Resource Teachers are discussed further in Section 4.4 of this chapter on school management.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should draft a policy for Administrative Resource Teachers and Teachers on Special Assignment.
2.
The draft policy, which limits the time for a teacher to be placed on special assignment, should be submitted to the Board for approval.
3.
The Deputy Superintendent should conduct an analysis of the current Teachers on Special Assignment.
4.
At least 50 percent of the current TSAs should be transferred to the classroom: n n

School Management and Site-Based Decision Making
4.4.1 Reorganization and the Role of Area Directors CURRENT SITUATION In the Hillsborough County School District, there are currently 149 regular public schools for K-12.
In addition, there are special center schools where more specialized student and adult services are provided.
From 1992 to 1997, the district has been systematically regrouping its schools into 17 clusters.
Clusters are K-12 feeder systems, in which schools at the primary level (regular elementary schools, full service schools, pre-school/kindergarten and ancillary schools) feed into middle schools, and, students from the middle schools feed into one high school.
Part of the development of the cluster plan depended upon the district's conversion of grade level center schools and junior high schools to the middle school philosophy and organization.
Ninth grade, under this plan, was moved into the high schools.
The K-12 clusters have been organized into six geographic areas.
As noted previously, each area has an Area Director assigned to oversee area and cluster development.
Each Area Director will work in an office located within the geographic area he/she is assigned.
In addition to the Area Director, personnel from the areas of special education, transportation, and food services will be housed in area offices.
At the present time, an Elementary Generalist has also been assigned to each area office, but will remain housed at the Central Office.
FINDING For the past five years, extensive training for and communication about the transition to middle schools has taken place.
Teachers, administrators, and parents have attended a variety of sessions in middle school areas such as: n n n n n n n
teaming discipline appropriate curriculum and instructional strategies student advisory technology team leadership performance assessment Hillsborough Page 4-48
MGT of America, Inc.
School District Organization and Management
In addition to these training experiences, school personnel report that each succeeding group of middle schools which were developed learned extensively from the previous groups.
Educators expressed with confidence about learning from each other, making the transitions easier and easier each year.
In 1998, the district will complete its transition to the middle school philosophy and organization.
Part of the transition into the middle school system has been the assigning of ninth grade students to the high schools.
Educators report that this transition has been somewhat difficult.
The sentiments of teachers and administrators involved with the transition of ninth grade into the high school were markedly different than the sentiments of teachers and administrators involved with the transition into sixth, seventh, and eighth grade middle schools.
The reported sentiments of the high school educators were more of resignation, while the sentiments of the middle school educators were more of enthusiasm.
In contrast to the widespread staff development which was centrally planned to support the transition to middle school, staff development opportunities for high school educators were provided upon request.
Specific comments from the interviews with high school educators included comments about the immaturity of ninth grade students, about their poor behavior, and about their lack of readiness to learn at the high school level.
Some educators voiced the opinion that the district should return ninth graders to the middle schools.
In one high school, fragmentation of the student body and the school in general were identified as negative conditions, in a recent, problem-solving study of school effectiveness conducted by the Division of Administration.
As noted by the study, the new ninth grade and the incoming tenth grade resulted in half of the student body being new to the school in one year.
COMMENDATION The district is commended for its vision, courage and skill in converting the variety of middle grade programs formerly in place in Hillsborough County, into one, strong, research-based middle school system.
This has been a complex undertaking, centered around the equity and developmental needs of students.
Throughout the district, there is high satisfaction with the transition which has occurred.
Parents, teachers, school-level administrators, and district administrators take pride in the orderly, well planned transition which has occurred.
Parents speak highly of the K-12 cohesion and coherence which this plan brings to their children's years in public education in the county.
Educators speak highly of the training they received.
There is a widely shared belief that the middle school system is right for the students.
The transition to the middle school system is one example of the district's effective use of planned, evolutionary change, as a way to improve learning for students.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-18: Design and implement a needs assessment for high school administrators and teachers as a basis for a districtwide program of inservice activities in the area of learning needs and developmental characteristics of ninth grade students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Director of Staff Development should oversee the inclusion of questions related specifically to the learning and other developmental needs of ninth grade students in the questionnaire used to plan for inservice activities.
2.
The Director of Secondary Education, in conjunction with the six Area Directors, should conduct an inquiry with administrators, teachers, students, parents, and school advisory teams at the senior high school level, as a basis for a series of training and workshop opportunities for high school personnel who work with ninth grade students.
The findings from this inquiry should be published to all stakeholders.
3.
The Director of Secondary Education should create a planned inservice series for educators who work with ninth grade students.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources in the staff development budget.
FINDING The current job description for Area Directors emphasizes tasks and functions on the management side of school administration.
Currently, the directors work in the Division of Administration and they report to the Assistant Superintendent for Administration.
Their position summary shown in Exhibit 4-28 describes job expectations.
The responsibilities for assisting schools and principals with the development of school improvement practices, curriculum, instruction, assessment, and student achievement in general, are assigned to various personnel in the Division of Instruction.
While the Area Directors do not have any direct responsibilities in the instructional program areas, they annually evaluate principal performance.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-19: Revise the position description for the Area Directors to include clear focus on instructional leadership and raising school achievement for all students.
The role of Area Directors should evolve into a comprehensive leadership role, in which administrative and operational initiatives and services, are focused on the central purpose of ensuring high student achievement for all students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent, in collaboration with the Division of Instruction and Division of Human Resources, should revise the job description of the Area Directors.
2.
The revised job description, reflecting a blending of leadership responsibilities from both instruction and administration should be phased in, along with personnel support and training, beginning with the 1998-99 school year.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources.

EXHIBIT 4-29 EMPHASIS OF SUPERINTENDENT'S GOALS AND STRATEGIES July 1997 and Beyond The re-engineered school system will be designed to provide schools with the support and the ability to be accountable to improve student performance.
District-level operations are being re-engineered to provide direct support to students, parents, teachers, and principals.
The teachers and principals are working to accomplish the vision and mission of the School Board, which is to assure that "Each student will become a literate, competent, lifelong learner who progresses toward full potential while functioning as a productive citizen."
The district offices will provide the resources, select and evaluate school leadership, set the standards, and provide the assessment, research, legal advice, program design, and training necessary for the success of all students.
Source: Goals and Strategies of the Superintendent, Hillsborough County Public Schools Agenda Item, January 21 1997.
The Area Directors have a primary role in the Superintendent's reorganization plan.
The Area Directors are the area leaders who must be the most knowledgeable about the flow of K-12 education in the schools within their areas and clusters.
The backgrounds of the area directors are varied, with school and educational program experiences spanning one or two of the three educational levels in the school district.
The backgrounds of Area Directors are outlined in Exhibit 4-30.
A review of the transcripts for inservice training for all six incumbents, with records available from 1980 to the present, showed that most sessions attended by the Area Directors have been directly related to their administrative and operations positions in the district.
Four of these six administrators participated in school improvement (accountability) training in 1992.
The records of two of the six do not have any event listed from 1992 to the present in school improvement.
Exhibit 4-31 identifies the training listed in all six transcripts provided by the Hillsborough County School District Staff Development Department.
No training in the use of standards, benchmarking, curriculum planning, performance assessment, or data analysis are indicated for any of the six.
None of the transcripts indicate participation in the middle school training events in the past five years.
As the Area Directors prepare to assume an expanded leadership role in the district, it is important that they do so with clear focus on the Superintendent's stated goal of improved learning for all students.
In order to achieve that goal, it is important that each leader have a thorough familiarity with the developmental learning needs of students at different ages, and with the programs and organizational structures which best support learning at the elementary, middle, and senior high levels.

Recommendation 4-20: Encourage and require new and returning Area Directors to become knowledgeable about current K-12 research and practice in curriculum, instruction, and assessment.
The Area Directors should be provided time and assistance to learn what he/she needs in order to evolve into a strong instructional leadership role.
Each Area Director needs a personal growth plan, which will identify areas of need in curriculum, assessment, data analysis, cutting edge educational practices at level(s) they have not had direct experience, learning research, and effective school improvement processes.
The Area Directors must have the support of the Superintendent to learn and develop instructional leadership skills as part of their job requirements.
They must have the time to learn, and a mixture of traditional, personalized and innovative ways of incorporating learning and learning time into their daily job schedules.
These should include on-line, computerized coursework, individual coaches or tutorials, and time and support to attend appropriate conferences/workshops.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction should jointly present to the Superintendent's Administrative Council for review, discussion, and input, a list of vital initiatives in instructional areas about which Area Directors should be knowledgeable.
2.
The Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent for Instruction should jointly meet with all Area Directors, to outline a personal growth plan process for all Area Directors.
This process should include (but not be limited to) a personal needs assessment based on the list of vital initiatives; a short- and long-range priority learning list; a realistic timeline; and a mixture of traditional, personalized, and innovative ways for the Area Directors to acquire necessary training.
Time for learning should be considered part of the job expectations required of Area Directors.
3.
A five-year timeline should be developed with each Area Director, which is realistic and accountable, for the evolution of the current role into an instructional leadership role.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources in the staff development budget.

FINDING Area Directors reported spending up to half of each working day, taking calls from and responding to parents.
When parents call with concerns about actions taken at the school level, or requesting resolution by someone at the central office, calls are referred to the appropriate Area Director.
The result of this practice is that Area Directors spend too much of their time reacting to problems, rather than being able to plan and work pro-actively for school improvement.
In the estimation of the Area Directors, while the practice does help to maintain open communications on the part of the central office, it is only the exceptional call which actually needs to be resolved at a level above the school level.
The practice of having parental complaints go to the Area Director for resolution, even with the reduced number of schools within each of the six newly created areas, is time and resource consuming.
It is important to maintain as much of the processing of complaints at the school level as possible.
While the role of ombudsperson is important, it results in disproportionate amounts of an Area Director's time and resources being spent with individual parents and students.
The Superintendent has targeted communication as a goal area.
He specifically calls for improved support for school-based personnel, parents, and community, as shown in Exhibit 4-32.
EXHIBIT 4-32 SUPERINTENDENT'S GOAL OF IMPROVED COMMUNICATION
4.2
Improve support for schools by requiring each Division to assess level of client/customer (parent, school-based personnel, students) satisfaction yearly and to develop an annual plan to address needs identified.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-21: Reduce the amount of daily time Area Directors spend resolving parental concerns.
The Director of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation should track the data from each Area Director with respect to parental concerns for a statistically meaningful period of time and examine the data for patterns.
Patterns should be identified by school and by cluster.
The data should be used with all related internal stakeholders, including the School Board, the Superintendent, the Superintendent's Administrative Council, the School Improvement Teams, school administrators, and other groups, in an effort to find systemic solutions to the problem of excessive time spent on hearing and resolving parental concerns above the school level.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-55
School District Organization and Management
Systemic solutions involve identifying patterns of problems, by type and location, identifying ways to reduce the number of concerns which rise above the school level, providing support for necessary changes, and identifying alternative resources at the district level to assist the Area Directors in fielding concerns which do need to be addressed by someone above the school level.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Director of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation should examine the problem and oversee the creation of a research template for this study.
2.
The Area Directors, using the template created by the Director of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation, should record daily issues, time spent, resolutions, school and cluster data.
3.
The Director of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation should evaluate the data, identifying patterns of issues, patterns of resolutions, school and cluster issues, and provide data sets as appropriate to Area Directors, the Superintendent, the Assistant Superintendents, and other stakeholder groups including principals, School Improvement Teams, parent groups, and teachers.
4.
The Assistant Superintendent for Instruction and the Superintendent for Administration should jointly propose alternatives to the Superintendent for his consideration and review.
5.
The Superintendent should direct the reduction of time spent by Area Directors in processing parental concerns.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources with principals assuming greater responsibility.
FINDING The Division of Instruction has identified seven (five full-time and two part-time) Elementary Supervisors as Generalists who will be assigned to work with each of the six clustered areas.
Each has a varied background he/she brings to the position.

because the Elementary Supervisors will have other responsibilities, in addition to those related to the schools in the areas they serve.
At the present time, the Superintendent's plan for reorganization does not include assignment of middle school and high school specialists or instructional generalists to work with schools by area.
The Superintendent's goals do not make any specific reference to the development of curriculum and instructional support by area.
The general description of current thinking in this area is shown in Exhibit 4-33.
While the district has a proven track record of evolving large changes successfully, it is important that the support the Superintendent provides for the Area Directors, in the areas of student achievement, curriculum and assessment, evolve along with the Area Directors' move to the areas they direct.
The longer administrative functions stand apart from curriculum design, data analysis, assessment, and instruction, the more priority they will take, demanding time and resources, and presenting an endless array of issues, problems, and concerns.
EXHIBIT 4-33 SUPERINTENDENT'S GOALS FOR DECENTRALIZATION 4.3 Decentralize the school system and bring district-level administration closer to the students, parents, schools and communities that we serve.
4.3.1 Divide the district into six areas composed of three geographically contiguous clusters with a general area director responsible for each.
4.3.2 Locate each general area director's office in the area he or she serves.
4.3.3 Ensure that school principals will be accountable for achieving student academic progress and administering the school and will report to an appropriate general area director.
4.3.4 Ensure that district-level personnel provide support to the general area directors and to the schools.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-22: Identify a five-year development plan for the full involvement of the instructional support personnel in the area offices.
The plan should include a job description for the elementary generalists which specifically supports the development of K-5 articulated programs and structures within each cluster and area.
There must be a timeline which clearly identifies when, in the next year, elementary generalists will move to the Area offices, and relinquish responsibilities which are not directly related to the schools within their Area.
Each generalist should have a three to five-year personal growth plan which ensures that he/she has or develops the leadership skills for this position, which is different in scope and intensity than supervisory or leadership positions some may have held in the District.
The plan should include detailed training in data analysis and other skills directly related to School Improvement.
Individual generalists will have to become more deeply knowledgeable about program areas K-5, including both research and best practice.
Each generalist should understand the skills involved with writing standardsbased curriculum and developing performance benchmarks which ensure that students meet their benchmarked requirements.
The plan needs to identify the personnel and timeline for support for middle level and senior high level programs, and for their move away from central office to the respective area offices.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should oversee the development of the plan to determine instructional support for the area offices.
2.
The plan should be presented to the Board as part of the Superintendent's report of progress on the development of his goals and strategies.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources.
FINDING Within each area, the clustered arrangements of schools provides a clear progression of feeder schools for students to attend from kindergarten through grade 12.
The district has recently completed major work which clearly identifies both graduation standards and benchmark achievements which students at grades two, five, and eight must accomplish.
With these benchmarks in place, each cluster has the potential to MGT of America, Inc.

become a clearly articulated, K-12 system within the larger school district.
The revised K-12 Pupil Progression Plan represents a strong step towards a cohesive K-12 focus, both within the Division of Instruction at the district level, and in the newly arranged K12 clusters.
The transition to six area groups and 17 clusters is a reflection of the district's and the Superintendent's commitment to move closer towards decentralized, school-based improvement for students.
At the present time, data for student achievement, student mobility, and student discipline are gathered by school, but are not compiled by cluster.
Some school administrators within clusters began meeting informally when clusters were announced.
These meetings have not been scheduled on a regular basis.
The cluster plan is now in its seventh year of implementation.
This orderly evolution is characteristic of the success the Hillsborough County School District has had in making some major changes.
Two years of work with the Court to clear the way for the creation of the clusters were followed by the need for a major building renovation plan.
Some high schools were inadequate to hold ninth - twelfth grade students; new buildings were needed for some of the sixth - eighth grade middle schools; and some of the elementary buildings needed conversion and retrofitting.
The first clusters to be identified were those in which the boundaries for equity and the facilities were close to completion.
The Central Facilitating Team, the standing committee which until Fall 1996, facilitated the development of both school improvement and site-based decision making initiatives, used the cluster organization as a basis for schools deciding to use the newly approved three-year format for School Improvement Plans, rather than the oneyear format.
The committee saw the newly developed clusters as a natural home for increased K-12 articulation of goals and actions to raise student achievement as described in Exhibit 4-34.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-23: Create a strong, academically focused K-12 cluster identity with students, parents and educators at the school level, and educators at the district level.
The district should write a five-year plan, phasing in a variety of organizational and communications strategies focused around strengthening cluster identity.
The plan should include, but not be limited to the concepts presented below: n
Each cluster should have a name; at present clusters are generally referred to by the name of the high school to which the elementary and middle schools feed.
A name chosen for a person, event, or Hillsborough Page 4-60

School District Organization and Management
idea of significance within the cluster can help to develop a singular identity.
n
Regularly scheduled meetings of cluster administrators with common job titles (e.g. principals meeting with principals, assistant principals for curriculum meeting with assistant principals) should occur.
In the first year of the cluster, having students attend events at other cluster schools, is a solid first step in helping students to see themselves as part of a cluster.
A common review of all SIT plans within a cluster by administrator, teacher and parent groups would be beneficial.
The formation of Cluster Advisory Teams (CAT), comprised of representatives of parents, local citizens, faculty and administrators should occur.
The function of the CAT is to analyze cluster data, to look for common patterns, common resources and common solutions.
The CAT should review equity data, look at special education referrals and programs, examine mobility and stability statistics and the achievement related to both of these types of students, help to develop common benchmark and standards plans, and consider all possible social and academic connections which might be made across schools within the district.
Another area for the CAT to tackle is the difference in fund raising capabilities by schools within the cluster.
n

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should ask Area Directors to begin meeting with cluster administrators by job function.
2.
The Superintendent should ask Area Directors to plan for the Cluster Advisory Team to begin meeting.
3.
The Superintendent should work with Area Directors to develop a three-year plan for developing cluster identity, allowing for as much variation as needed for each cluster.

SCHOOL YEAR 1990 - 1991 1991 - 1992 1992 - 1993
Source: Memo to John Hilderbrand, Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation, January 10, 1997.
This initiative was folded into the Blueprint 2000 initiative in 1992.
The committee overseeing the Site-Based Decision Making Committee merged with the Central Facilitating Team which had been established to assist the district with the implementation of the State's accountability program.
The Central Facilitating Team remained in operation until the 1996 - 1997 school year and is credited by many in the district with effective leadership of the program throughout its existence.
In Fall 1996, the committee switched to an ad hoc basis, because of the belief that the accountability process has become a fully integrated part of the district and the school-level operations.
For the first few years of the accountability program, Regional Facilitating Teams comprised of SIT members and volunteers from within each region of the district, existed for the purpose of reviewing each school's plans for completeness and compliance before they were submitted to the Department of Assessment, Accountability, and Evaluation for review.
This practice proved to be cumbersome and somewhat costly, and evolved into the current use of liaisons from the central office.
At present, each of the district's schools has a liaison assigned, to actively assist the school throughout its cycle of planning and implementing school improvement efforts.
Primary responsibility for the School Improvement Process and for reviewing plans rests with the Department of Assessment, Accountability, and Evaluation where the Director of the Department, the Coordinator of Evaluation, and the Supervisor of Accountability receive and review plans, provide continuous feedback, technical assistance, and ongoing support in the accountability process.
A Teacher on Special Assignment to the Staff Development Department coordinates and plans staff development activities for the School Improvement process.
Within the central office, plans are distributed to all divisions for feedback prior to their approval.
The Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation annually publishes "Guidelines for School Improvement."

"Guidelines" are interpreted to be Board policy, since they are formally accepted by the Board each year.
The "Guidebook" was first published in 1992 and has been changed to include changes in the legislation as well as annual improvements in the process.
The Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation publishes a newsletter entitled "School Improvement News," which reports updates on changes and best practices throughout the district.
FINDING The Central Facilitating Team which recently brought its job to an end, has been an effective planning and support council for the growth of site-based decision making and school improvement planning.
The Central Facilitating Team has nurtured growth in the school improvement process in a deliberate and planned way.
Minutes of the Central Facilitating Team show repeated instances of communication and coordination between the Staff Development Department and the other departments involved with School Improvement.
One of the most recent accomplishments of the Central Facilitating Team, the transition to multi-year plans, carries the hope of helping School Improvement Teams and school personnel to focus more time on the actions which will lead to improvement, by reducing the amount of time spent planning for improvement.
The Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation has taken a systems approach to school improvement.
The priority given to school improvement appears clearly in the Department's 1996-97 Staff Action Plan.
The plan identifies specific expected outcomes for school improvement, and identifies the personnel who will carry out the responsibilities for reaching those expected outcomes.
The Department has planned for changes in the school improvement process, piloted those changes, collected data about results of changes made in the school improvement process, and then implemented the change throughout the district.
This closely resembles the Total Quality Model and planned change cycle of Plan-Try-Study-Implement.
Procedures are improved each year, based on annual surveys and changes in state mandates.
The reports written by the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation are detailed, thorough, and user-friendly.
Summary reports are numerous, informative, and well-organized.
Data have been systematically gathered in repeated years, allowing for year-to-year comparisons in the growth of the School Improvement Process in the district.
Professionals in the Department articulate and carry out their work with commitment to the goals of: n n

COMMENDATION The district is highly commended for the work accomplished during the past five years in the area of school improvement initiatives.
The Hillsborough County School District's model of implementation of School Improvement is a systems model, which has learned from each year's experiences, and made changes to increase the effectiveness of the school improvement process for users.
In particular, the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation has provided a vision for a high quality process, backed up by the consistent production of useful and timely data.
FINDING A review of the "Guidelines for School Improvement," shows that the manual describes in detail the procedures used to form the School Improvement Team and the procedures for arriving at and writing the School Improvement Plan.
The procedures required in the manual identify the need for alignment among the needs assessment findings, the goals set, the actions taken and the waivers requested.
There is precise detail required in demonstrating the relationship between waivers and specific goals and expected outcomes for students.
The Procedure for Submission of the School Improvement Plan is detailed, and includes mention of the practice used in the district of sending copies to all divisions and unions for review prior to the plans being recommended to the Superintendent.
The "Guidelines for School Improvement" establish that central office professional personnel will act in the role of `liaison' to district schools to facilitate the school improvement process.
While school personnel have direct access to the Office of Accountability for help and information about school improvement, each of the district's 149 schools has a support person who works at the central office.
The roles which central office personnel take with each of their schools varies significantly from school to school.
The purpose of the role is to provide schools with extra support they may need in developing and implementing their School Improvement Plan.
It is also to help ensure that the schools meet their obligations to submit and implement plans in a timely and accurate way.
A list of possible roles and responsibilities for district liaisons is included in the Guidelines.
Exhibit 4-37 lists the general roles.
One of the most important functions of the district liaison is to assist in the development and review of school improvement

In addition to these roles, the liaison is included in the team created to assist a school which has not made adequate progress towards its goals.
The description of the role is expanded in the "Guidelines" to include specific activities which a liaison might engage in that are best practice in each category.
Taken together, the examples and the role description, form a rich composite of the different ways in which a liaison could be an effective support for school improvement.
The Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation provided information about liaison training, and the evolution of their role in the past year.
Liaisons receive training each year on the procedures for school improvement.
Their role has recently shifted away from the responsibility of assessing the adequacy of goals set, a job reserved for the more detailed and technical review conducted by the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation, using a consistent and statistical approach for all schools.
Exhibit 4-38 is an example of the technical feedback provided to the School Improvement Teams, before their plans are approved.
EXHIBIT 4-38 FEEDBACK ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PLAN Goal 3: Performance-based assessments can be used to measure progress towards your Expected Outcome A.
For Expected Outcomes B and D, you stated that the Stanford-8 will be used to measure progress.
Therefore, your Adequate Progress statement needs to reflect that the Stanford will be used to measure progress.
For Expected Outcome C, a class roster of student grades can be used to measure progress.

The changing liaison role, away from the more technical aspects of the review process, was in response to comments which arose in two different formative evaluations.
In MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-65
School District Organization and Management
1995 and 1996, the district studied different aspects of the school improvement process.
In 1995, the Assistant Superintendent of Instruction asked the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation to conduct a formative evaluation of the School Improvement Process to find out what School Improvement Team members thought about the process and to determine training needs.
The 1995 report, "School Improvement Formative Evaluation, June 1995," made five summary recommendations based on both specific questions asked and open-ended comments gathered and analyzed.
One of those recommendations was to "continue to provide training to district personnel who provide support to schools."
An interview with the author of the report interpreted "personnel" in this recommendation to be referring to the liaison role played by district personnel.
The 1996 report, "An Assessment of Stakeholders' Perceptions Regarding Florida's System of School Improvement and Accountability," was conducted by the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation, to assess the district's implementation of the school improvement process.
Once again, all aspects of the process were queried, both in closed and open-ended questions.
Again in this report, the recommendation emerged that the role of the district liaison be reviewed.
The data showed that administrators, teachers, parents and educational support personnel on the School Improvement Teams reported the range of helpfulness from Very Helpful to Not Helpful, when judging the role played by district liaisons.
District-level personnel, in responding to the same questions, also expressed concerns about the role as shown in Exhibit 439.
EXHIBIT 4-39 DISTRICT LIAISONS AND CENTRAL ADMINISTRATORS VIEW OF THE ROLE OF DISTRICT LIAISONS
Central office administrators were asked to express their feelings on the usefulness of the District Liaisons in expediting the plan development process.

Twenty-eight (28) percent of the respondents believe that the District Liaisons are providing a useful service to the schools, while 41 percent indicated they were not sure about their usefulness.
Of the 33 supervisors, coordinators, and TSAs who responded to the survey, 39 percent indicated that they did not know if they were useful in facilitating the accountability process and 27 percent stated that they did believe they were useful to the schools in their role as District Liaison.

With the conversion of the district's system to a multi-year planning process, the role of the liaison will evolve as well.
It is important that the role continue to grow in effectiveness.
At the present time, Directors of Elementary, Middle and Secondary Education receive monthly reports from liaisons which provide details of the liaison's work with the School Improvement process.
There is still wide variation in the effectiveness of the job done by district liaisons to help support school improvement.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-24: Engage in a strategic planning process aimed at improving the district-level support provided to principals and School Improvement Teams.
Strong consideration should be given to creating an on-line learning group for liaisons, for SITs and others working in school improvement.
One way to share the different areas of expertise which different district liaisons bring to the role they are asked to perform, is to create a on-line discussion group where problems and issues may be shared openly for input from those with experience or knowledge in a given area.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent should request that the Central Facilitating Team reconvene to further study the support schools need from the district in carrying out their school improvement work.
2.
The Central Facilitating Team should look both inside and outside of the district to find exemplary support systems for the accountability process, considering both individual school and emerging cluster needs.
3.
The Central Facilitating Team should investigate the feasibility of creating an on-line discussion group for school improvement monitored by a member of the Department of Accountability, Assessment, and Evaluation in the Hillsborough County School District.
4.
The Central Facilitating Team should build upon the analysis already conducted by the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation in the area of liaison development, adding its findings from outside sources and its technology research.
The Team should report its findings and recommendations to the Superintendent.
FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished with existing resources.

FINDING Many references were made to the district's practice of requiring that School Improvement Teams include at least one significant goal for improvement aligned with the State's "Goal 3: Student Performance."
All individuals interviewed knew about this goal and described it as a policy expectation.
However, the goal is not included as a written guideline in the district's "Guidelines for School Improvement" which is the Board's policy document on School Improvement.
The expectation is carefully monitored by the Office of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation.
At least one "Goal 3" area, and usually more than one, was identified in each of the 20 school plans chosen at random for review.
It is an important facet of the district's implementation of the School Improvement Process.
The history of the policy expectation that a "Goal 3" area be included resides in the Central Facilitating Team, and is attributed to the current Deputy Superintendent, who has had a significant role in guiding the development of the process.
Exhibit 4-40 shows an example of the Deputy Superintendent's influence in this area, as the Central Facilitating Team discussed the evolution of the district's plans towards a three-year system.
EXHIBIT 4-40 EXPECTATION FOR INCLUDING GOAL THREE IMPROVEMENTS Extended School Improvement Plans: A draft outline of the multi-year school improvement plan concept was distributed by Sam Rosales and reviewed by the team.
Beth Shields [former Associate Superintendent; current Deputy] has stressed that student outcomes must be a part of any extended plan.
Source: Excerpted from Minutes, Central Facilitating Team Meeting, September 27, 1995, page 3.
It is important to note that the members of the Central Facilitating Team who monitor the plans to ensure compliance with this expectation have been involved with school improvement since its inception.
This has provided consistency of expectation.
It is important that the "Goal 3" inclusion concept endure beyond the specific involvement of the administrators monitoring the system.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-25: Revise the Guidelines for School Improvement to include a specific guideline about the inclusion of at least one goal of significance related to the State's "Goal 3: Student Performance."

1.
In time for the next publication of the "Guidelines for School Improvement," the Supervisor of Accountability should propose that at least one "Goal 3: Student Performance" area be included in each school plan, unless there are justifiable circumstances for not doing so.

In Winter 1996, the School Board approved in concept the transition of single year school plans to three-year plans, based on the premise that significant change in instruction, focus and achievement rates is a long-term commitment.
The schools choosing the multi-year format must submit yearly action plans for each year of the plan, and must participate in the annual review of adequate progress for each year of the plan.
One-third of the schools availed themselves of this change for the 1996-97 school year.
It is anticipated that this number will rise to two-thirds for the 1997-98 school year.
The "Guidelines for School Improvement" manual describes procedures for forming the School Improvement Team.
There are no specific guidelines or procedures in the manual for the roles and responsibilities the team has in the process.
Nor does the manual describe best practice, for example, in the areas of effective decision-making models, communications with stakeholders outside of the SIT, or methods of asking questions of the data on student achievement.
Conversion of the planning timeline from one to three years provides the opportunity to help School Improvement Teams improve their efficacy at overseeing and ensuring high achievement for all students.
The shift in focus of the work of the team from assessing, planning, and implementing in a one-year cycle, to implementing and assessing in a continuous cycle for three years, can result in a broader involvement by the School Improvement Teams in communications with parents and teachers about the school goals, a more in-depth analysis of data by a greater number of team members, and most importantly, about expanding the understanding of the goals and work on the goals to an increased number of stakeholders in the school community.
Surveys and studies conducted by the Department of Assessment, Accountability, and Evaluation carefully analyze many aspects of the school improvement process.
Exhibit 4-41 shows the reports provided by the Department for this performance review, when asked for the major reports affecting school improvement.
Reports have concentrated on participant opinions of the process for the purpose of improving the stakeholders' use of the process.
They have provided summary data about goals and waivers, so that schools, liaisons, and district-level administrators can have access to this information.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-69
School District Organization and Management
With the expansion of the timeline for planning and implementing school improvement strategies to three years, there is an opportunity for School Improvement Teams to develop increasingly sophisticated skills as a leadership team and focused support from the district will be critical to the process.
With one-third of the teams now in a three-year planning cycle, and two-thirds of the teams now in one-year planning cycles, the timing is appropriate to gather information about how teams spend their time.
This is a baseline year for the new procedure.

process.
Results are reported in a variety of ways.
Participants in the surveys, studies and reports have been primarily district-level administrators involved in school improvement, principals and SIT teams.
With the use of three-year plans and the expansion of focus from reading, writing, and mathematics outward to include all benchmarked subjects, the number of faculty who will be directly involved in implementing strategies directly related to the achievement of the goal is likely to expand.
In 1992-93, the school-based decision making initiative merged with the Florida Accountability initiative in the district.
This merger allowed greater focus of resources on developing a high quality school improvement process.
For the past five years, major support has gone to building a system for accountability which meets both the letter and the spirit of the Blueprint 2000 legislation in Hillsborough County.
Nonetheless, there is no relationship between the existence of School Improvement Teams, and school plans for improvement, on the one hand; and, the management style of the principal, and the extent of full staff ownership of, shared decision making in, or accountability for the results of the plan.
The "Guidelines for School Improvement" Manual does not provide any insight into the Board's, the Superintendent's, or district administrator expectations for shared decision making in schools.
The "School Improvement News" editions provided, focused on many aspects of school improvement, but not on any aspects of shared decision making.
Effective schools research has shown a correlation between a greater climate for student learning and significant, participatory decision making in schools.
In February 1991, the Department of Assessment, Accountability, and Evaluation began a longrange study of site-based decision making.
For a number of reasons that study was interrupted after several years.
However, in the study's introduction, the author describes the intent of the district at the time, with respect to site-based decision making, as shown in Exhibit 4-42.
EXHIBIT 4-42 HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT'S VIEW OF SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING In accepting Site-Based Decision Making as a districtwide goal, the school board embraced the notion that authority within school systems should be decentralized and that teachers should be given a greater role in the school-level decision making process.
While not formally stated at the onset, the goals of the site-based decision making project were: 1) To increase the level of collaboration among teachers, parents, and administrators at the school level; 2) To decentralize decision making so that many more decisions are made at the school site than have been made in the past; and 5) To increase teachers' perceived and actual levels of empowerment.

The 1991 Report went on to propose a research format which studied the effect of training and implementation in the shifting roles of principals into facilitators rather than bosses, of teachers into leaders rather than workers, and of students into workers rather than passive recipients of knowledge.
The research questions, which were written based on a review of the literature and questions gathered from stakeholders in the district, included some which are shown in Exhibit 4-43.

There were additional questions in these areas in the original research design as well as questions about the role of parents and community, and about revisions to the teaching and learning process.
These questions have not been included in recent studies, as the focus of the research has shifted to school accountability processes.
In interviews with district personnel, with school administrators, with teachers, with educational support personnel, and with parents, it became clear that schools which have some level of site-based decision making, as it has developed in Hillsborough County, do not necessarily have well developed models of shared decision making in place.
Additionally, survey results gathered as a part of this performance review confirmed that there are different views of site-based decision making, delegation of decision making, and empowerment held by different groups in the district as shown in Exhibit 444.
The survey's results suggest that personnel view the distribution of authority differently.
and participatory management has not been whether these differences have gotten larger at different levels within the school district And, since the development of site-based charted over time, it is not possible to tell or smaller over time.

By omission or commission, models for making decisions at the school level have evolved over the past five years, as the district has actively sought to distribute its authority to its schools and school leaders.
Some principals report that they have the appropriate amount and level of autonomy in creating research-based learning environments for teachers and students.
This was especially true of the comments made by principals in Title I designated schools, where additional flexibility and autonomy in federally-funded spending has accompanied decentralization.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-76
School District Organization and Management
On the other end of the opinion and reaction scale, there are principals in the district who view the decentralization with skepticism; they define it as a shirking of duties on the part of district-level personnel; they neither seek more authority, nor disperse it to other professionals in the building.
This latter group report that they operate much as they did five years ago; that, in effect, not much has changed.
With a great number of schools in Hillsborough County, there are bound to be varied points of view and practices involved with decentralization, site-based management, and participatory decision making.
With the transition to the new Superintendent, his commitment to decentralization, and the implementation of the new three-year planning cycle for school improvement, there is a renewed opportunity for the district to revisit the status of school-based and participatory decision making throughout the schools.
As each division of the central office continues on its present course of finding the balance between centralized support and management and decentralized management, results, and accountability, it is important for all to have information on the growth and development of quality sitebased and participatory decision making, if, as stated by one district-level administrator, the district is to remain a `school system,' and not become a `system of schools.'
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-27: Structure and implement a long-term study of decentralization through site-based and participatory management in the Hillsborough County School District.
The study should have several elements including a survey of administrators, teachers, and educational support personnel who are not or who have not been involved with the School Improvement Team.
The district should determine the current levels of awareness of, sense of ownership for, and degree of activity directly related to achievement of the school's improvement goals.
Another vital part of the study should include the development of a common picture among district-level personnel of the changes which have occurred in management and authority in the past five years.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Superintendent, with the assistance of the Superintendent's Advisory Council, should outline his expectations for the long-term study.
2.
The Office of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation should conduct the study, reporting results at various intervals in the next three years.

FISCAL IMPACT This recommendation can be accomplished within existing resources.
4.4.3 School Management CURRENT SITUATION In 1990, the Hillsborough County School District created a "School Effectiveness Assessment" process and guide.
At present, there is a team of district-level personnel who are cross-trained as an effectiveness team to be able to go into schools with sudden and/or severe problems, and conduct an effectiveness assessment.
The process includes a site visit by the team, with school observations, classroom observations, and artifact reviews.
Additional information sources include surveys and interviews of administrative, instructional and non-instructional personnel, parents and students.
The areas reviewed for effectiveness are administration and school operations, school activities, school and community relations, curriculum and instruction, personnel and human resources, and student services.
The procedures manual is detailed, both with steps to be taken, and precise survey instruments and forms for immediate use.
FINDING In November 1996, the Division of Administration made the decision to review conditions at one of the district's high schools after numerous problems were reported.
The Effectiveness Team visited in December and submitted a final report to the Superintendent later that month.
Prior to the report being sent to the Superintendent, the overall findings, commendations and recommendations were sent to the faculty and staff at the school.
The Assistant Superintendent reports plans to send the team back into the high school later in this school year to reassess the progress made on recommendations.
Neither the School Effectiveness Assessment procedures manual, nor the detailed report on the distressed high school, make any reference to the School Improvement Process or School Improvement Team at that school.
COMMENDATION The district is commended for Assessment process.

Administration is commended for the thoroughness, detail, and apparent usefulness of the report generated in December 1996.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-28: Revise the School Effectiveness Assessment procedures to include the involvement of the School Improvement Team in conducting an analysis of the School Improvement Plan and of other effectiveness variables at the identified site.
The revision should include a role for the School improvement Plan and the School Improvement Team in helping to resolve the issues and concerns at the distressed school.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE: 1.
The Superintendent and senior staff should revise the School Effectiveness Assessment procedures to include an analysis of the effectiveness of the School Improvement Plan and its School Improvement Team.

CURRENT SITUATION The district's principals meet by level each month for either full or half-day sessions.
At most meetings, principals receive updates from district-level administrators on a variety of timely topics.
Topics are discussed for clarification.
At some meetings, principals vote jointly to make or recommend changes, or to investigate the feasibility of change.
At least one session per year is dedicated to staff development activities.
Area Directors evaluate and supervise principals.
Principals report to the Area Directors to whom they are assigned.
Exhibit 4-46 describes their current accountability.
The responsibilities of principals are outlined in Board policy, Section A-42.
This policy description of the role and responsibilities of the principal is the only current job description in the district for principals.
All principals hired in the district have served in the district as assistant principals.

As stated previously, the current emphasis in the job description for principals is on the administrative and management side of the job, rather than on the leadership and program side of the job.
The job description does not match the performance indicators listed in the Human Resources Management Development Handbook which identifies the categories, competencies and behavioral indicators by which principals will be evaluated.

RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-29: Revise the job description for principals in the Hillsborough County School District to include an accurate description of their current roles as educational leaders.
The description should include the principals' responsibilities in school improvement, and their significant involvement in the district's work on the creation of standards and standards-related curriculum, conversion of the school's programs to meet benchmarks, and use of performance assessments.
Principals should also be trained to be responsible for the effective use of data to measure outcomes.

FINDING The Human Resource Management and Development System (HRMDS) for the Hillsborough County School District was revised in 1996.
The system includes procedures and criteria for administrator selection, the performance appraisal of new and experienced administrators, and procedures manuals for preparing both new principals and new administrative leaders in other positions.
The Introduction to the manual highlights its focus on "emerging requirements for educational leadership that are reflected in research, in Blueprint 2000, and in other national, state and local initiatives."
Within the sections of the HRMDS, there is a consistency of high expectations, of common language, and of coordinated procedures and indicators.
The revised Administrator Evaluation Form for Experienced Administrators (Track 2) lists nine competency areas for administrators.
The form for administrators in need of assistance (Track 3) or newly appointed administrators (Track 1) uses these same skill areas in more detail.
The language used is not directly linked to the district's initiatives in school improvement or school-based decision making.
While there are some general competencies and skills which can apply, no area is specifically written to support the growth and development of systemic school improvement through participatory decision making.
The HRMDS provides insight into the Florida Statutes on assessment of administrator performance as shown in Exhibit 4-49.
There is explicit language in the statute, included in the first line after the general description, identifying attention to the school improvement plan.

"For the purpose of improving the quality of instructional, administrative, and supervisory services in the public schools of the state, the superintendent shall establish procedures for assessing the performance of duties and responsibilities of all instructional, administrative and supervisory personnel employed in his district.
The following conditions must be considered in the design of the district's instructional personnel assessment system.
(a) The system must be designed to support district and school level improvement plans."
Source: Hillsborough County Human Resource Management and Development System, Part 2, Administrator Performance Appraisal, March 1996, page 40.
The criteria used to describe Leadership Skills do not include language about knowing multiple ways to build consensus.
Nor does it refer to shared governance of the school, to the use of the School Improvement Team, or to inclusion of parents and community as partners in the work of the school.
The Communications Skills section of the Competency Development Form for Track 1 and 3 administrators do not make mention of electronic technology skills.
The section on Program/Curriculum Management does not contain language about significant use of data and data analysis to identify needed changes in programs.
No mention is made in the listing of the school improvement plan.
Section VI of the Performance Appraisal Section of the HRMDS contains an expanded list of categories, competencies, and behavioral indicators which clarify in greater detail the competencies used on the evaluation forms.
The list of behavioral indicators does not include specific language on school improvement.
One indicator has a peculiar approach to an area which could clearly be specified in the language of school improvement.
This indicator is shown in Exhibit 4-50.

No mention is made throughout the extensive list of indicators of learning to make effective use of the district's waiver procedures.
This language is clearly written in the School Improvement Guide and numerous schools have used the waiver procedure satisfactorily.
While the Indicator 1.2 certainly captures the skill colloquially, it is equally important that the indicators identify skills of using policies and procedures which exist to help remove interference.
The HRMDS lists 15 important purposes for performance.
These are listed in Exhibit 451.
The purposes outlined in the HRMDS for administrative performance appraisal do not include a clear orientation towards ensuring learning for all students or for improving student achievement.
Although it may be assumed from some of the purposes listed, student achievement is not explicitly included as a purpose for an administrative performance review.
The Performance Assessment System is based on the assumption that if all indicators are true, then student performance will be adequate or will rise.
The system is an input-based assessment system; it does not require accountability for results as it is now written.
The pilot proposal described in the HRMDS section on Performance Appraisal indicates that the Revision Committee continues to operate in 1996-97.
COMMENDATION The district is commended for the linkage created in the criteria for selecting new principals and for preparing developing leaders.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-31: Revise the Track 1, Track 2, and Track 3 Performance Assessment and Competency Development form and criteria.
The form and criteria should include accountability for results in student learning, more specific language related to school improvement processes, the use of data as a basis for program planning, and participatory and school-based management.
In addition, the revision should: n replace language such as "4.2 Recognizes the importance of sharing decisions..." with clear, accountable language such as "4.2 Builds strong school-based structures for participatory decision making;" n
orient the indicators and the performance evaluation itself, clearly towards accountability for student learning results and high achievement; include significant use of a variety of consensus building models, ongoing training by the principal of staff and parents to make decisions, and principal's use of electronic technology as an important tool for school improvement; Hillsborough Page 4-85

The newly revised performance assessment system for principals includes a pilot project sponsored by the Performance Appraisal Committee.
The pilot project allows administrators to go onto a multi-year evaluation cycle, and requires that participants who seek a rating of "exemplary" for their work create portfolio collections of work samples.
A review was made of the evaluations of five principals for three years -- 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96.
The evaluations were anonymous as were the names of the Area Directors who evaluated them.
Area Directors use a numerical rating system of l through 4, meaning Improvement Needed through Exemplary.
This rating system has been changed to a letter system for 1996-97.
The letters used are S+ (Exceeds expected standards), S (Meets expected standards), N (Needs improvement) or U (Unsatisfactory).
There were no substantive comments on the evaluations read for the three-year period.
The new form allows a small space for comments to be written.

The feedback provided to principals about their performance in the eleven categories rated was essentially that they were exceeding expectations and doing exemplary work in most areas.
The feedback they received in the areas specifically included in the two open areas tended to be lower than the ratings received in the standardized areas although the feedback was still fairly positive.
This comparison suggests that some substantive dialog between principals and their supervisors can and does go on.
The fact that the struggle for growth occurs in areas designed specifically by the principals and their supervisors further suggests that this is a fertile area for providing and receiving more discriminating feedback about one's performance than the standardized parts of the form, which tended to be uniformly rated at the highest two rankings.
This year, two principals out of 149 in the district have opted to create portfolios to earn an exemplary rating.
It is not clear how many have gone to a multi-year cycle, if any.
Both of these practices are part of the ongoing pilot to change the way in which principals are evaluated.
Principals need coaching and mentoring in order to grow in their positions.
With the division of the district into six geographic areas in 1997-98, each Area Director will still be responsible for the direct supervision of more than 30 building principals.
It is not possible for one Area Director to provide 30 building principals per year with high quality feedback and mentoring.
It is important that the Performance Appraisal pilot, MGT of America, Inc.

allowing for multi-year evaluation cycles, expand in the coming years.
If 33 principals within one area were on a three-year evaluation cycle, then an Area Director could work closely with 11 principals in a given year.
In the intervening years, principals can work on a professional development plan developed with the help of the Area Director.
Of the areas written into the five principals' performance assessments for the three years, only two citations were made anywhere on any of the forms of school improvement work.
Interviews with district-level administrators indicated that Area Directors do not routinely solicit information from curriculum supervisors or from accountability personnel about principals' work in curriculum improvement or school improvement.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-32: Expand the pilot performance appraisal project to create a multi-year evaluation cycle for principals.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Revision Committee should write a three-year plan to evolve from the pilot stage to full implementation, putting principals on a three-year evaluation cycle, with necessary annual monitoring to meet statutory requirements.

FINDING Principals in Hillsborough County come to their jobs from a variety of backgrounds.
The breadth of curriculum and assessment experiences which assistant principals have as they prepare to become principals, varies and depends upon school size, level of assignment, intensity of student needs, quality of the principal mentoring experience, and assistant principal positions held.
The direct contact with the School Improvement Process which principals have had prior to becoming principals in the district varies significantly from school to school.

The 1991 edition of the Hillsborough County Guidebook of Policies and Procedures identifies two types of assistant principals: Assistant Principal II and Assistant Principal I (listed in this order in Section A-43).
The official Unit Allocation data sheets provided for this performance review use the Board's designation of Assistant Principal II or I (also listed on the sheets in this order) to assign "units" of administration to the schools.
The Administrative Allocation Formulas document identifies a position of Assistant Principal for both elementary and junior high schools.
The same document uses the titles of Assistant Principal for Student Affairs and Assistant Principal for Curriculum/Administration as positions allocated to the Senior High Schools.
The Board policy identifies an allocation formula used to assign administrative units to schools based on enrollments (Exhibit 4-55).
A review of the projected enrollments for the 1997-98 school year, compared with the assignment of Assistant Principals and Teachers on Assignment assigned to the role of Administrative Resource Teacher, showed that all schools are operating within the Board's allocation formula.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-35: Revise the job descriptions for the three Assistant Principal positions (Curriculum, Administration, and Elementary Education) in the Hillsborough County School District.
The Superintendent should require that all assistant principals aspiring to be principals have some direct, sustained, and substantial responsibilities for improvements which are outlined in the School Improvement Plan under the "Goal 3" area, regardless of the specific job title of their assistant principalship.

FINDING Teacher "units" are assigned to elementary schools using an allocation formula which is substantially different from the formula used to allocate teacher units to middle and senior high schools.
Classroom teacher units at the elementary level are determined based on student enrollment.
Specialists are then assigned, based on the number of preparation periods the classroom teachers need.
Inquiries at the district level indicated that the reason for the difference in the allocation formulas lies in the district's tradition of thinking of the middle and secondary levels as having more complex staffing needs, driven by the many different required areas of certification at those levels.

Elementary school principals are restricted by the patterns of staffing units which result from the way in which the staffing unit allocation is determined.
Interviews with elementary school principals indicated that principals believe they cannot exercise a great deal of discretion in deciding how to match staff resources with student needs.
MGT of America, Inc.
Hillsborough Page 4-95
School District Organization and Management
This is substantially different for schools which are designated as Title I schools, because there is more flexibility to combine outside funding with district funding for creative solutions to problems which arise when trying to match human resources to student and program problems.
At the middle school and senior high school levels, allocation of all positions is done based on a total student enrollment.
Principals then have the flexibility to identify specific student and program needs, and trade in teacher units of one type for another in a flexible way.
In interviews with elementary school principals who are not Title I principals, the inflexibility of their staffing allocation procedures was identified repeatedly as a significant factor blocking school improvement and school-based decision making in terms of authority to match resources with solutions to significant learning problems.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-36: Study the financial and personnel impact of changing the procedures used to allocate teacher units to the elementary schools.
The Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation should identify the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining or changing the present system.
Significant input from the elementary principals should be solicited.
The balance of the authority they now have to change human resources as needed should be measured against the responsibility they have to ensure that all students learn at high levels.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE 1.
The Elementary Principal Council should work with the Department of Assessment, Accountability and Evaluation on a research design to study this issue.

The criteria for evaluating the techniques of instruction are oriented towards whole group instruction.
No significant indicators are included for individualized or small group work.
The assessment criteria for certificated personnel are based on research about effective teaching.
However, they seek to judge teacher behaviors or "inputs" into the learning process of students.

There is no mention in the evaluation criteria of responsibilities for understanding the School Improvement Plan or for contributing to the fulfillment of the Plan.
The evaluation criteria do not mention active participation in the School Improvement Team or any other governance or advisory capacity as ways of making a contribution beyond the classroom work expected.
This omission creates a mixed message for both principals and teachers with respect to the importance of participating in the School Improvement Team processes.
Teacher leadership through participation in decision making is an important facet of school improvement resulting in higher achievement for all students.
The teacher evaluation criteria do not identify the Sunshine Standards, curriculum designed to meet the benchmarks the district has set or the development of performance-based assessments.
The teachers are evaluated annually.
In a review of 20 teacher evaluations from the 1994-95 school year, based on a rating system of satisfactory-needs improvement-unsatisfactory, most ratings for most teachers were satisfactory.
The 20 evaluations came from eight different schools.
Eighteen (18) evaluations showed all 40 items in the four categories to be rated as "satisfactory."
Two evaluations, for two different individuals, had ratings other than completely satisfactory.
RECOMMENDATION Recommendation 4-37: Revise the teacher evaluation procedure and criteria.
The revision should also include the following: n
criteria for active participation in the school's improvement process, both as a contributor to the Action Plan and as an active member of the School Improvement Team; criteria that describe effective learning which seeks to look at student learning behaviors in the classroom; Hillsborough Page 4-97

n
criteria that define teacher responsibilities in the areas of standardsbased curriculum development, benchmarks, and performance assessments; criteria that hold teachers accountable for learning results; and a multi-year cycle of evaluation, and professional development plans in the non-evaluative years, with the net result of reducing the number of teachers with whom administrators work on evaluation each year.
n n
Peer evaluation as well as student evaluation strategies should be considered as components in revising the teacher appraisal procedures.
Compensation should be linked to performance.
