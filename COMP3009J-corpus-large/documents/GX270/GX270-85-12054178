Section 2: Programs and Projects The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women (ICSW) works on numerous projects and programs in seeking to advance the status of women in the economic, political, and social life of the state.
It collects employment related information and works toward pay equity; monitors legislation and strives to equalize women's participation in policy-making positions in the government and private sectors; and recognizes Iowa leaders through the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame, the Write Women Back Into History Essay Contest, and the Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice.
ECONOMIC LIFE The ICSW strives to improve Iowa women's tenuous economic status by conducting various employment-related programs and studies to assist women statewide to work to achieve pay equity.
In 1999, Iowa women made just 73 cents for every $1 a man made.
Sixty-four percent of women made $25,000 or less, while 67 percent of men made $25,000 or more.
This wage disparity reflects the occupational choices of males and females, the
wage differences between male- and femaledominated jobs, and the gender pay gap that exists in many of the same occupations.
Both women's and men's wages would rise if wage discrimination were corrected.
Workers, whether men or women, in female-dominated jobs Â­ such as receptionists, secretaries, nurse aides, and child care providers Â­ are paid less than workers in similar jobs not dominated by women.
Differences in pay scales among occupations that are dominated by one gender or the other contribute to pay inequities as seen in the graph below.
AVERAGE HOURLY WAGE $ 6.52 $10.16 $16.04 $ 8.33 $ 8.67 $10.35 $ 7.91 $10.17 $ 8.75 $ 7.94

Wage/Benefits Studies Wage Survey: In 1993, the ICSW initiated a Department of Employment Services study on gender-wage disparity in Iowa.
That report revealed, among other things, that Iowa women, on average, made 68 cents per dollar that Iowa men made.
In 1999, the ICSW requested that Iowa Workforce Development conduct research to replicate the 1993 study.
The results of the updated study, released in 2000, showed that women, on average, earned 73 cents per dollar that Iowa men made.
The study also found that 64 percent of women earned annual wages of $25,000 or less, while 67 percent of males earned $25,000 or more.
Nationally, women earned 72 cents for every dollar a man made in 1999.
Iowa Certified Nursing Assistant Wage and Benefits Survey: A statewide wage and benefits survey of Iowa Certified Nurse Assistants (CNAs) was released in June 2001, showing that Iowa CNAs are underpaid Â­ almost three-fourths earn less than $10 per hour.
Cosponsored by a number of organizations and state agencies in collaboration with the ICSW, the study revealed that 94 percent of CNAs are female.
Although 77 percent of CNAs are offered health care insurance, 41 percent cannot afford the cost.
Contingency Workers Study: The ICSW initiated a study of contingency workers' wages with Boddy Media Group in late 2000.
The study, which was released in December 2001, reported the impact on women of contingency jobs, such as temporary, part-time, and contractual work, usually with few or no benefits and no job security.
It found that twothirds of Iowa's contingency workers are female.
A typical contingency worker is most likely to be urban, single, parenting pre-school age children, have no more than a high-school education and work in sales/marketing.
Forty-one percent earn $10.99 per hour or less and 57 percent receive no benefits.
Follow-up to Employees' Wages and Benefits: Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Projects 1997 Report and Recommendations: In 1997, the ICSW conducted a study of the wages and benefits of employees in domestic violence/sexual assault projects (dv/sa) across the state.
The study revealed significantly low wages across the board, with many employees living at, below, or barely over the poverty line.
Because of the increase over the past several years in federal and state monies available to dv/sa projects, the ICSW made, in its report of the study, wage recommendations for specific job descriptions, using comparable jobs in state government as a comparison.
The response was overwhelming.
In a 1998 ICSW follow-up to the study, the Commission's study was credited for approximately $112,000 in pay increases in dv/sa jobs statewide.
This study and follow-up survey continue to be distributed and influence wages and benefits for employees in dv/sa projects not only in Iowa but across the United States.
Pay Equity Initiatives Equal Pay Day: The ICSW commemorated Equal Pay Day on Tuesday, April 3, 2001, which symbolized the day when women's wages catch up to men's wages from the previous week.
Because women earn less, on average, they must work nearly seven days to earn what the average man would earn in five.
In addition to writing an opinion/editorial piece for leading newspapers around the state, the ICSW distributed a press release regarding Equal Pay Day.
A press release and pay equity advertisement were also sent to select women and other organizations statewide that have an interest in pay equity.
Paycheck Negotiation Workshop: In order to help address wage disparity, a paycheck negotiation workshop was held in November 2001 to give women the tools to negotiate for higher compensation when they are offered employment or at an annual/ performance review.

Show Me The Money: Paycheck Negotiation Workshop: As part of the paycheck negotiation workshop held in November 2001, a video was produced of the speakers.
See Paycheck Negotiation Workshop under Pay Equity Initiatives for more information.
POLITICAL LIFE While the ICSW works hard at eliminating the "sticky floor"--women who are stuck in lowpaying jobs with few benefits and opportunities for advancement--it also recognizes the need to break the "glass ceiling" in government and private sector policy-making positions.
In addition, the ICSW annually researches, submits, and advocates for a program of Proposals to the Governor and General Assembly.
It also follows legislation pertinent to women and, in particular, those bills that relate to its Proposals.
The Executive Director of the ICSW is registered as a lobbyist to the Iowa Legislature and Executive Branch.
Publications How to Get Your Bearings - How to Get a Job: The guide, for Iowa women who are looking for a job or who are seeking a better job, includes information on how to write a resume, conduct an interview, obtain personal counseling if needed, fix a car, find housing, etc.
Containing one-third more information than previous editions, the guide, revised by Dr. Judith Anne Conlin, is distributed primarily through the displaced homemaker programs and Family Development and Self-Sufficiency programs across the state.
Funding for the guide was provided by Iowa Workforce Development and the Carl D. Perkins Applied Technology and Vocational Education Act.
Roster of Qualified Women In 1970, the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women assumed responsibility for developing a roster of Iowa women qualified for appointments to paid and volunteer positions on state boards and commissions.
When the Commission was made statutory in 1972, it continued to develop the roster and to submit names for the Governor 's consideration in making appointments.
Appointment resume forms are provided upon request; they include biographical information, educational background, work experience, organizations, and information on areas of interest.
Each year it advertises the availability of appointment resumes in the IoWoman, the Friends of ICSW newsletter that is sent to 8,500 organizations and individuals statewide.
The Roster of Qualified Women has contributed significantly to the expanding role of women in government.

Jane Elliott was honored with the medal at the 2001 Iowa Women's Hall of Fame Ceremony, Des Moines.
She has worked to combat discrimination, ignorance, and racism for over 30 years.
Best known for her "Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes" discrimination exercise, Elliott has attempted to encourage racial sensitivity in children and adults of all kinds.
Believing that racism is a learned behavior, she facilitates the experience of prejudice and discrimination by labeling participants inferior or superior based on their eye color.
From her first exercise, on April 5, 1968, the day following Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, Elliott strove to "inoculate [children] against the disease of racism," something she did until her retirement from the classroom in 1984.
Since then, she has brought her work to adults, conducting workshops in corporate, military, and academic arenas.
Elliott and her work have been the subject of several documentaries Â­ "Eye of the Storm," "Eye of the Beholder," "A Class Divided," "Blue Eyed," and, most recently, "The Angry Eye."
For her extraordinary work, she has received the National Mental Health Association Award for Excellence in Education.
SOCIAL LIFE The ICSW believes that in order to advocate for the full participation by women in the political, economic, and social life of the state, leaders in those areas need to be identified, recognized, and promoted as role models.
Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice This award was established in 1982 and honors the woman who served on the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women and who first chaired the statutory Commission.
From 1972 to 1976, Cristine Wilson led the Commission in combatting sex discrimination and in promoting equal opportunity.
The medal is given to individuals--male or female-who have exhibited outstanding dedication and service on behalf of the ideals of equality and justice.

Ann Dearing Holtgren Pellegreno Ann Dearing Holtgren Pellegreno has been a professional musician, teacher, author, lecturer, and farmer.
In 1960, on the day she obtained her private pilot's license, she took her mother up for a flight as her first passenger, a surprise because Mrs. Holtgren was not aware that her daughter had learned to fly.
Within five years, Pellegreno obtained a commercial pilot's license to which she added ratings for instrument, multi-engine, and flight instructor for airplanes and instruments.
On June 9, 1967, she and a crew of three took off from Oakland, California, in a twin-engine Lockheed 10, a sistership to that flown by Amelia Earhart on her fateful world flight in 1937.
Exactly thirty years later Pellegreno found Earhart's flight-planned destination Â­ tiny Howland Island Â­ dropped a wreath, and returned to Oakland on July 7th, completing the 28,000-mile commemorative flight.
In 1974 Pellegreno was appointed to the Aeronautics Commission, the first woman thus serving in Iowa, and also to the Iowa Department of Transportation Commission, the first woman in the nation to serve in that capacity.
Pellegreno was inducted into the Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame (1990), the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame (1991), and the Experimental Aircraft Association Â­ Vintage Aircraft Association Hall of Fame (1997).
Her first book, World Flight, the Earhart Trail, was published in 1971.
The first two volumes of her trilogy Iowa Takes to the Air were published in 1980 and 1986.
She was born in Chicago, Illinois.

SECTION 3: Information/Participation The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women (ICSW) office is a resource center for information on hundreds of topics relative to women and girls--publications, reference materials, and videotapes.
And as mandated by the Code of Iowa, the ICSW provides assistance to organized efforts by communities, organizations, associations, government agencies, and other groups working toward the improvement of the status of women in Iowa.
INFORMATION The ICSW provides information to the public and elected officials on many issues, including the status of Iowa women, nontraditional jobs, divorce, sexual harassment, gender-fair curriculum in education, and more.
Media The ICSW Executive Director serves as a media spokesperson for the Commission on issues relative to women across the state.
During 2001, media contacts and topics discussed included: Associated Press, comparable worth; Iowa Radio News, legislation and women judges; The Des Moines Register, Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice 2001 recipient Jane Elliott, and sexual harassment; KMAQ, ICSW and Iowa Women's Hall of Fame; WOI Radio, ICSW, Iowa Women's History Quiz, and Women's History Month; and a Des Moines local cable television interview on Iowa Women's Hall of Fame inductees.
Advocacy Directory Originally undertaken jointly by the American Association of University Women, Iowa Division, and the ICSW, with updating funded by the Family Community Leadership, the statewide advocacy directory was designed to provide a computerized guide to networks on women's issues in Iowa.
In 2001 the directory was continually expanded and updated; approximately 6,200 persons are in the database for one or more of the 66 categories of interest and/or experience.
As an ongoing commission program, the directory will continue to expand its database and its usefulness throughout the state, and additional persons and organizations will be identified on a regular basis.
Printouts of category lists are available for a minimal fee from the ICSW; the Iowa women's organizations listing is free.
Publications Cristine Wilson Award Recipients: In 1999 the ICSW developed a small publication featuring the Cristine Wilson Medal recipients.
The piece was updated in 2001 and posted to the website prior to the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame Ceremony--when the award is presented.
Financial Safety Planning for Older Women: The ICSW teamed with the Department of Elder Affairs and the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence to update the safety and finance publication for older women who are in domestic violence situations.
It was reprinted in 2000.
Iowa Women and the Law: The ICSW initiated a revision by volunteer attorneys in conjunction with attorney Roxann Ryan.

SECTION 4: Contractual Agreements The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women (ICSW) has contractual agreements to administer state fund appropriations to public and private nonprofit programs providing services to Iowans in Transition (displaced homemakers and female offenders) and to administer state fund appropriations to the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault (IowaCASA) for training on issues related to domestic violence and sexual assault.
IOWANS IN TRANSITION GRANTS During fiscal year 2001, the ICSW administered $185,000 in state fund appropriations as grants to 8 public and private nonprofit programs providing services to displaced homemakers and female offenders, or Iowans in Transition.
Displaced homemakers are individuals who have worked principally in the home providing unpaid household services for family members.
They are persons who are unemployed or underemployed; have had or would have difficulty finding appropriate paid employment; and have been dependent on the income of another family member or on government assistance, and are no longer supported by that income.
Programs that work with displaced homemakers and female offenders help them deal with the trauma of their situation and prepare them for education and training toward self-sufficiency.
Reports from the programs with grants during fiscal year 2001 show a total of 1,654 (1,551 displaced homemakers and 103 female offenders) were served
with counseling (1,559 persons); support services (878); workshop seminars (963); ABE, GED, and English as a Second Language (128); academic upgrading (411); and training for a degree (879).
At intake, 47 percent were receiving welfare.
Of those served, 1,572 were women and 82 were men.
Racial breakdown follows: 1,329 whites, 174 African-American, 60 Latinas, 77 American Indians, 10 Asian-Pacific Islander and 4 unknown.
Since July 1999, 14 of the 23 programs serving displaced homemakers in Iowa have closed.
Eight of those programs had received ICSW Iowans in Transition grant funding.
Fiscal Year 2002 Grants: Effective July 1, 2001, the definition of Iowans in Transition was expanded to include single parents.
The ICSW administered $172,000 in grants for fiscal year 2002.
Applicants for the grants were accepted from freestanding entities and subgroups or special programs sponsored by a larger organization.
Eighteen applications were received from the programs

In June, the six-member Iowans in Transition Grant Review and Selection Committee met and made grant recommendations.
The committee included Mary Wiberg, chair; Vicki Brown; Jule Reynolds; Lorie Houghton; Joan Moll; with Charlotte Nelson, ex officio.
Ten grant proposal applications were denied due to insufficient funding.
Iowa New Choices: The Commission participated in monthly telenet meetings with displaced homemaker/single parents and sex equity program coordinators and the sex equity consultant for vocational education in the Department of Education, focusing on recent federal legislation removing set-asides for those programs and other pertinent issues.
On December 19, 2001, the ICSW sponsored the Iowans in Transition Program Coordinators' Meeting.
Coordinators learned about federal legislation, which impacts vocational education; DOT training; Women Work! National Conference review; Workforce Investment Act; and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families funding and Family Investment Program limits.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Addressing the priority area of violence against women is done through a cooperative relationship with the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault (IowaCASA).
Resources and information are shared among the offices, thereby enhancing the ICSW's ability to carry out its responsibilities through interaction with these private, nonprofit agencies.
Together, they work to strengthen efforts to prevent sexual assault and domestic violence, and to support programs that provide services to victims.
The two organizations were located with the ICSW until April of 1995.
Fiscal Year 2001: The ICSW administered state fund appropriations of $9,500 to ICADV to provide training to community professionals and the general public, $6,250 to provide training to service providers, and $5,250 to provide training to criminal justice system personnel on issues of domestic violence.
IowaCASA was funded through state appropriations of $9,665 to provide training to service providers, $5,667 for training of community professionals, and $5,668 to provide general public education on issues of sexual assault.
Fiscal Year 2002: The ICSW administered state fund appropriations of $21,000 to IowaCASA to provide training to the public and community

CHALLENGE GRANT Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force The ICSW renewed it intra-agency contract with the Iowa Division of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning (CJJP) to provide staff support to the Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force funded through a U.S. Department of Justice Challenge Grant.
A co-employee with the Commission fulfills the contract terms, including convening the monthly Task Force activities.
The Iowa Juvenile Justice Advisory Council developed the Task Force to oversee CJJP's and the State Advisory Group's activities as well as make recommendations related to gender-specific services.
The Task Force involves key stakeholders in Iowa's juvenile justice system, particularly service providers who want comprehensive system change that reflects gender equity for girls and young women.
The ICSW made periodic presentations to the Iowa Juvenile Justice Advisory Council on the progress of the Challenge Grant Project.
"Strong Girls: A Medley of Facts and Stories" Intensive Retreat The ICSW organized a two-day intensive retreat for members of the Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force and other invited professionals on October 4-5.
The retreat featured presentations by local clinical social workers on critical thinking, selfcare, going from domestic abuse victim to survivor, and an individual perspective of what works with girls in the juvenile justice system or girls at risk for involvement with the juvenile justice system.
Presenters Shawn Beirman, LMSW, Julie Hoshaw, MSW, Binnie LeHew, LISW, and Patti Campidilli, LISW all shared their extensive knowledge of how girls at risk are strong and stay strong.
"Whispers and Screams" Conference Directed by the Task Force, the ICSW coordinated the conference, Whispers 
More than 220 individuals from Iowa and nearby states participated in the twoday event, which succeeded in drawing greater representation than previously from the Juvenile Court, the Department of Human Services, and men.
Keynote speakers were Joe Kelly, executive
Development of Speaker's Bureau and Program Development Training As part of the Challenge Grant efforts, several members of the Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force were involved in doing training and presentations at conferences and throughout different Iowa communities.
This developed into the Task Force Speaker's Bureau, which consists of members willing to present on the gender-specific philosophy, the efforts of the Task Force, or their area of

Section 4 expertise.
For example, one member trained professionals in "Gender Programming/ Expectations" in April as well as gave a "GenderSpecific 101" presentation to the Juvenile Court Officers Conference in May.
Another member gave a unique presentation to the Council on Human Services on the progress of the Task Force itself.
In addition, two Task Force members provided an innovative joint training on "Program Evaluation."
Yet another Task Force member delivered nine presentations throughout the state of Iowa on "Gender-Specific 101," "Advocacy for Young Women," and the "Differences in Female Development and How This Should Affect Programming." subcommittee to develop materials to assist with community planning and technical assistance efforts, which is responsible for providing creative approaches that local officials can use to better plan for the needs of girls.
In addition, the ICSW wrote two editions of The Girl Connection for publication in organizations'/agencies' newsletters.
Gender-Specific Program Evaluation In collaboration with Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning (CJJP), the ICSW reviewed grants for gender-specific services for girls as well as reviewed and approved formula grant proposals.
Two program evaluation proposals were funded: 1) Girls' Circle, an after-school prevention program for girls ages 11-15, and 2) Foundation 2 Discoveries, a day-treatment program for girls ages 14-17 who are involved with juvenile court.
The expected outcomes of the evaluation processes will be reported in July 2002 identifying how genderspecific service components impact the juvenile females being served by gender-specific programs.
Outcomes will also be beneficial to the programs being evaluated, as the conclusions can guide future program development.
The conclusions will also be used to guide statewide policy regarding services for juvenile females.
Other The Challenge Grant Project continues to make gender awareness and community planning a permanent part of the juvenile justice system/child welfare system in Iowa.
