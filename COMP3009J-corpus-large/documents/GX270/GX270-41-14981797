Chief Louis Barry (413) 467-9222 Community/Agency Program Name Target Audience Description Contact Person Telephone # 115 Greenfield High School School/ Community Task Force Middle and High School Students Three years ago, the Greenfield school community had serious problems with gangs and fights.
Consequently, as much as it was a community issue whereby things that happened on the streets and at home were brought into school, Greenfield High School decided to invite the community to help find solutions to these problematic issues.
As a result, a strong coalition was formed among Greenfield Public Schools, the Probation Department, DYS, DSS, the DA's Office, and the Visiting Nurse Association.
The coalition has also developed relationships with liaisons from high schools in surrounding communities.
By using a task force approach, school personnel have been able to reach into the community for levels of assistance which were previously thought to be unavailable.
As a result of the program, the overt display of gang activity has been virtually eliminated, theft has been reduced, and the level of fighting has been reduced from twenty the first year to two minor assaults during the last school year.

In 1998, the Nessacus Regional Middle School, concerned about referrals to the guidance department stemming from verbal and physical harassment, homophobia, fights, and bullying, contacted the Berkshire County Children's Advocacy Center (The Kid's Place) and the Elizabeth Freeman Center for assistance.
As a result, a school-wide program directed at promoting peer tolerance and understanding was developed.
The pilot program included a school-wide pledge to behave in non-violent ways, a writing and art contest, and the use of music and drama to discuss tolerance, diversity, and acceptance.
The pilot program has been expanded to include the use of Second Step, a curriculum that seeks to prevent violence and promote social competence by developing skills in the areas of empathy, impulse control, and anger management.
The program offers three sessions of 20 classes each at the end of the regular school day, from 2:45 3:45 p.m.
The Peacemakers' Club meets after school and serves to promote antiviolence activities within the school.
The Club sponsors such activities as poster contests, the Pyramid of Hate program, and the Peck Peace Pledge.
Club members meet weekly with a faculty advisor to discuss issues related to peace within the school.

In the Planning Room, a specially trained teacher assists students to process the violation by reviewing what happened, why it happened, and how it can be avoided in the future.
Any class time that the student misses is made up after the school day and parents are contacted.
In cases where a student does not properly process the violation or if the negative behavior persists, parents are required to meet with the principal.
