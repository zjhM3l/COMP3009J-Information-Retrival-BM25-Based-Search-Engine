Prescriptions for Tough Vegetation Problems By JAMES H. MILLER, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Auburn University M ost tough forest vegetation problems are caused by non-native plants.
These foreign invaders-- often called exotic, alien, or noxious weeds--occur as trees, shrubs, vines, and grasses.
Some have been introduced into this country accidentally, but most were brought here intentionally for livestock forage or as ornamentals.
They arrived without their natural predators of insects and diseases that tend to keep most plants in a natural balance.
They are now essentially free to spread without too much opposition, except from control and eradication measures applied by landowners and managers trying to defend their property from an unfriendly takeover.
Most alien plants come to your property from their migration along right-ofways and stream margins.
Some are widely scattered by bird- and animal-dispersed seeds, while others are actually planted by unsuspecting or poorly informed landowners and land managers.
The first line of defense against an alien plant takeover is a constant surveillance of adjoining right-of-ways, stream banks, and internal roads and trails for any new arrivals.
With the first sign of an unwelcome plant, effective control measures should be started.
Early detection and treatment will minimize efforts and costs that come with treating well-established plants or full-blown infestations.
More effort is required for successful eradication of established infestations, but it still can be accomplished with proper treatments described here.
containment or eradication, because herbicides can kill roots.
To be successful, the most effective herbicide for the species should be used, applied using the correct method, and during the optimum time period.
Only herbicides registered by the Environmental Protection Agency for forestry use in the Southeast will be discussed here.
Herbicides in other use areas (such as noncropland, right-of-way, pastures and rangeland, etc.) may be just as effective, or even contain the same active ingredient of those mentioned.
Read and thoroughly understand the herbicide label and its prohibitions before and during use.
Many herbicides and some target plants require the addition of a good non-ionic surfactant to the spray tank to be effective.
Another important point is to always use clean water and mix your spray solution thoroughly before applying.
Forgo applications during periods of severe drought as herbicide effectiveness can be greatly reduced during these times.
And, always wear your personal protective equipment prescribed on the label or in supplementary materials.
cide control of germinants.
Prescribed burning can also prepare the site for effective herbicide applications by clearing debris and revealing application hazards, such as old wells and pits.
Disking and rootraking, if applied correctly, can dislodge herbicide-damaged woody roots and large runners, leaving them to dry and rot.
It is important that herbicide applications following burning or disking be delayed to permit adequate resprouting of target plants for maximum herbicide uptake and effectiveness.
It is also important to take steps for preventing erosion when using mechanical and burning treatments.
An eradication program for infestations of troublesome plants usually takes several years and surveillance for many more years to check for seed germination or new invasions.
By doing this in a planned manner, and being persistent, your lands and the lands you manage can be protected from being choked out by useless alien plants.
In this way, native plants and forest productivity can be safeguarded and wildlife can continue to have suitable habitat.
Exotic Tree Control with Herbicides Exotic tree species hinder reforestation as well as stand and right-of-way management.
Some occur as scattered trees while others occur in dense infestations.
Silktree is continually spreading along stream networks, chinaberry is appearing more in new forests, and tallowtree has extensive infestations in wet forests, replacing native species.
All use roadsides for gaining access to your lands and often occur together.
Silktree or mimosa (Albizia julibrissin) Nature: Small legume tree, growing 30-40 ft. tall, that reproduces by seeds and root sprouts.
It has feathery deciduous leaves, showy pink blossoms, and smooth light brown bark.
Other Treatments Overgrazing is a way to reduce the vigor of palatable alien plants like kudzu, but this rarely yields eradication and may spread seeds (now occurring with tropical soda apple).
Mechanical treatments and prescribed burning can assist eradication measures, but are limited in effectiveness.
Mechanical rootraking and disking can actually spread or aggravate a problem when dealing with plants having runners.
Prescribed burning does not control runners and usually only kills small aboveground shoots, not the roots or runners, providing only temporary above-ground control.
Although ineffective by themselves, both mechanical and burning treatments can give additional kill of herbicide-weakened plants and have a place in an integrated pest management program.
Burning can kill or stimulate seed germination of troublesome plants permitting effective herbi- Troublesome Plants and Effective Herbicide Treatments If an alien plant infestation is spotted or already occurs on your land, then proper and effective eradication measures should be undertaken or spread is inevitable.
Continued treatments and retreatments will probably be necessary to be successful.
Most alien and troublesome plants are perennials, having extensive tough runners or roots.
This means that effective herbicide applications offer the best means of 26 / Alabama's TREASURED Forests Summer 1999 USFS Origin: Native to Tropical America.

Exotic shrubs have some value as wildlife forage, and are often established by misinformed hunter groups.
Bicolor (Lespedeza bicolor) and Serecia lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) Nature: Although still planted for quail food, these plants will quickly invade surrounding forests, replacing native plants.
Bicolor is a shade-tolerant, 3leaflet, legume shrub up to 10 ft. tall that spreads by bird- and Bicolor lespedeza animal-dispersed seeds.
Serecia is not really a shrub, but a semi-woody plant to 3 ft. tall with many small 3-leaflet leaves feathered along erect stems.
Bicolor has small purple flowers and serecia has tiny cream-colored flowers during the summer.
Both will form dense Summer 1999 USFS Exotic Vine Control with Herbicides Exotic vines are some of the most troublesome invaders because they form the most dense infestations.
Kudzu and Chinese wisteria can overtop even mature forests, while Japanese honeysuckle can form dense cover below tree canopies.
Reforestation after harvesting infested stands requires high-cost treatments.
A relative newcomer is Japanese climbing, which is extending its range rapidly by wind-blown spores.
It can be found along forest roads, margins, and within even dense forest cover.
Kudzu (Pueraria lobata)

Damage to surrounding plants may occur with these herbicides.
Ted Bodner Some of these are generally considered naturalized--like bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), crabgrass (Digitaria spp.), and giant fescue (Festuca arundinacea)--but are still troublesome for forestry.
Most exotic grasses spread and reside along highway and utility right-of-ways since eradication treatments are not applied.
Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) Nature: Dense, erect perennial grass that spreads by prolific seed production and rhizome movement in fill-dirt.
Has light yellow-green foliage.

Herbicide control: Apply Arsenal AC as a 1% solution (1.3 oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer) or Accord as a 2% solution (8 oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer) (or combination of the two) in water with a wetting agent to thoroughly wet all foliage in Sept. or Oct. with multiple applications to regrowth.
Ted Bodner Japanese grass or stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) Nature: Dense, mat-forming annual grass that roots at nodes and is shade tolerant and occupies various habitats including creek banks, floodplains, forest roadsides and trails, damp fields, and swamps.
Origin: Native to temperate and tropical Asia, it was introduced near Knoxville, TN around 1919.
Range: Eastern U.S. Uses: None Herbicide control: Apply Accord or VantageTM as 2% solutions in water (8 oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer) with a wetting agent in late summer.
Ted Bodner Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), Giant fescue (Festuca arundinacea), Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) Nature: All these grasses have been widely planted and continue to provide excellent forage for cattle and sheep, but can present problems for forest landowners and rightof-way managers.
They are difficult to control when converting old pastures to tree crops and continue to increase along right-of-ways to the exclusion of any native plants.
Origin: Introduced from the Mediterranean and Africa, and now widely distributed most everywhere in the world.
Uses: Improved pasture for livestock production.
Bermuda grass is a turfgrass also.
Fescue is commonly planted for wildlife openings and soil stabilization.
Johnsongrass is now only a troublesome weed.
Giant fescue Herbicide control: Apply Accord as a 2% solution in water (8 oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer) with a wetting agent in latesummer before planting trees.
Then over sprays with mixtures of 1% Johnsongrass Arsenal AC (4 oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer), 1-2 oz. Oust (0.3-0.6 dry oz. in 3-gal. sprayer), and 1 ounce Escort (0.3 dry oz. in a 3-gal. sprayer) in water and a wetting agent in May when pine tolerance is needed.
limited seed supplies and the absence of well-developed establishment procedures hinders their current use.
In the near future, with the commendable efforts of organizations like the Alabama Wildflower Watch, native plant seeds will become commercially available in adequate supplies.
This will leave the development of proper establishment procedures as the last barrier that will require intensive study.
Native plants do have native predators and require proper seed treatments to assure timely germination, thus their establishment will be more challenging than the commonly available alien plants.
Caution Pesticides used improperly can be injurious to humans, domestic animals, desirable plants, and fish or other wildlife.
Use all herbicides and pesticides selectively and carefully.
Follow recommended practices for the disposal of surplus herbicides and pesticides and their containers.

Ted Bodner Ted Bodner Attention CRP Landowners If you are planning to thin your CRP pines under the cost share, you need to know about annosus root rot (ARR).
ARR is associated with sandy well-drained soils and attacks pines following thinning IF the stumps are not treated with Borax at the time of thinning.
The soils in Alabama have been rated for ARR hazard and any plan that requires thinning should have this rating included along with recommendations for prevention.
Make sure your plan includes ARR hazard ratings--and if the rating is high, implement prevention.
Your county office of the Alabama Forestry Commission has copies of the ARR hazard rating and prevention measures.
The Rehabilitation Phase The most important final part of an eradication and rehabilitation program is the establishment of fast growing native plants that will out-compete with any surviving unwanted plants.
Actually, this often means planting genetically-improved Southern pine seedlings and ensuring their initial rapid growth through cultural means.
Another option is the planting of improved forage grasses, but most of these are actually introduced plants that can spread through your lands.
Native plants are increasingly becoming available for planting for rehabilitation, but Summer 1999 Alabama's TREASURED Forests / 29
