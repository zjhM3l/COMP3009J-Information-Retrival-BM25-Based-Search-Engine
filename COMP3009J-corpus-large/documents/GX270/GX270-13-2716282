If any of them WAIVES HIS OR HER RIGHT TO APPEAR AND CONTEST OR fails to appear or, if appearing, cannot per sona lly assume legal and physical custody promptly, taking into account the child's age, needs, and individual circumstances, such person's parent-child legal relationship with reference to the child shall be terminated.
If the other birth parent or a person representing himself or herself to be the other birth parent appears and demonstrates the desire and ability to personally assume legal and physical custody of the child promptly, taking into account the child's age, needs, and individual circumstances, the court shall proceed to determine parentage under article 4 of this title.
If the court determines that the person is the other birth parent, the court shall set a hearing, a s expeditiously as possible, to determine whether the interests of the child or of the community require that the other parent's rights be terminated or, if they are not terminated, to determine whether: (3.1) The court may order the termination of the other birth parent's parental rights upon a finding that termination is in the best interests of the child and that there is clear and convincing evidence of one or more of the following: (c) That the parent has not promptly taken substantial parental responsibility for the child.

THE NOTICE ALSO SHALL INFORM THE PARENT OR ALLEGED PARENT WHOSE RIGHTS ARE TO BE DETERMINED THAT SUCH PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO WAIVE HIS OR HER RIGHT TO APPEAR AND CONTEST AND THAT FAILURE TO APPEAR AND CONTEST MAY LIKELY RESULT IN TERMINATION OF THE PARENT'S OR THE ALLEGED PARENT'S PARENTAL RIGHTS TO THE MINOR.
Proof of giving the notice shall
