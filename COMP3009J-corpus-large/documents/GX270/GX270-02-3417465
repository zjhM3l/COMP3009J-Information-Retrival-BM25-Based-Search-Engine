diabetes prevalence of 7.4% compared with a 5% prevalence among men.
Almost 9% of Hispanic and African American respondents reported a diagnosis of diabetes compared to 5% of whites.
Women had a There was a direct relationship between age and diabetes prevalence.
The prevalence difference between the youngest (18-24, 1.2%) and oldest (65+, 13.6%) age groups exceeded 12%.
Household income and educational attainment were inversely proportional to diabetes prevalence.
Respondents with less than a high school education or with household incomes less than $15,000 had more than twice the prevalence of diabetes of their more educated, higher earning counterparts, respectively.
Introduction: Diabetes, the body's inability to 1,169 cases of diabetes-related kidney disease, and properly use sugar from the blood, is one of the fastest growing health problems in the United States today.
Sixteen million Americans have diabetes and about half of them do not know they have the disease.
Diabetes disproportionately affects women and minorities.
Every year, another 625,000 Americans are diagnosed with diabetes and 400,000 persons die of this disease.1 causes most of the 3,200 amputations in Texas.
4 Texas spent over $4 billion on the direct and indirect costs of diabetes in 1992.5 Fortunately, diabetes can be treated through modifications in exercise and diet, and with medication.
Type I diabetes, which typically has onset during childhood or early adulthood, results from the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin.

The standard American diet and number have undiagnosed diabetes.2 Almost 22,000 sedentary lifestyle both increase the chances of getting Texans over the age of 40 years were reported to this type of diabetes and the chances of developing have died from diabetes between 1989 and 1994.3 complications such as blindness, nerve damage, kidney Since deaths from diabetes are typically underdamage, and heart disease.

This report examines diabetes prevalence and related behavioral risk factors among adult Texans profiled by the Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1988-1993.
In addition, we also report data gathered in 1994 from the diabetes module.
The BRFSS consists of a monthly survey of 150 randomly selected Texans 18 years of age and older who are asked questions about their health habits, e.g.
"Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" If the person has been diagnosed with diabetes, they are asked a set of questions related to the onset and treatment of their disease.
Figure 1 Methods: BRFSS uses a special type of probability cluster sampling: a list-assisted, stratified random sample.
Prior to 1994 , the BRFSS samples were selected using the Mitofsky-Waksberg method for random digit dialing.6 Statistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN.7 Data were weighted to reflect the age, sex, and race distribution in Texas as well as the probability of being selected.
For most variables, data from 1988-1993 were aggregated into a single data set and re-weighted to the Texas population distribution as gathered from 1990 census data.
All references in this paper to significance and confidence intervals refer to a probability of less than 5% that the results are due to chance.
When "controlling" or "adjusting" variables is referred to, the variables have been analyzed using multiple logistic regression at the same confidence level.
Figure 2 Survey Results: Based on data from the BRFSS from 1988-1993, 6.4 % (95% CI, 5.8-7.0) of adult Texans report having been diagnosed with diabetes at some time during their lives.
Prevalence of diabetes by demographic characteristics is shown in Figures 1-5.
These figures illustrate the typical pattern of elevated diabetes prevalence with age, and higher diabetes prevalence among women, minorities, and those with lower household incomes and lower educational levels.
The diabetes prevalence difference between minority and white Texans is dramatic: almost nine Figure 3 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Page 3 lower incomes than younger persons.
Both African Americans and Hispanics, who have a greater genetic predisposition to develop diabetes than others, tend to graduate from high school less often and are less likely to hold college or advanced degrees than whites.9 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: The recommendation that Americans should exercise more and eat less especially will benefit those predisposed to diabetes and those who already have the disease.
A sedentary lifestyle, defined as leisuretime physical activity less than 20 minutes per day at least three days per week, increases risk for diabetes.
Sedentary lifestyle is related to age, education, and income.
The same group of older, less educated, lower income Texans at higher risk for developing diabetes is also the most sedentary group of Texans.
Data from the 1994 BRFSS show that inadequate physical activity is significantly higher in Texans 65 years of age and older compared to those aged 18 through 24 years.
There is some reason for concern about levels of exercise in both populations, since 67 % of Texans over age 65 and 51 % of those aged 18 to 24 years are sedentary.
College graduates were significantly less sedentary (45.3%) than those who had not completed high school (69.3%), and those with household incomes less than $15,000 per year (69.0%) were more sedentary than those earning $35,000 or more yearly (46.1%).10 Figure 4 Figure 5 percent of both Hispanic and African American Texans have diagnosed diabetes compared to five percent of whites.
This difference probably reflects a greater genetic predisposition to develop diabetes among minorities combined with American lifestyle influences on exercise and diet, a phenomenon documented by researchers among Mexicans and Mexican Americans in San Antonio of similar economic status.8 Dramatic drops in prevalence as income and education rise may be partly attributable to increased prevalence of diabetes by age and to ethnic origin.
Persons 55 years of age and older are less likely to have graduated from high school and tend to have Figure 6 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Page 4 Figure 6 (page 3) compares sedentary lifestyle among Texans with and without diabetes (19891992).
Texans with diabetes are more sedentary than those who don't have diabetes.
These differences, about 10% in men and 3% in women, are not statistically significant between people with diabetes and without, even when differences in age, raceethnicity, and education are accounted for.
Educational attainment, however, does significantly predict sedentary lifestyle among Texans, even when controlling for age, sex, race-ethnicity, and diabetes diagnosis, suggesting that efforts should be expanded to encourage exercise among those with lower educational attainment.
Interestingly, people with diabetes were significantly more likely to be former cigarette smokers than those without diabetes, although no significant difference exists in current cigarette smoking status between people with and without diabetes (Figures 7 and 8).
In people with diabetes, smoking can cause acute impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity.
It also can produce higher serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and higher heart rate, and blood pressure.12 About 22 % to 24% respectively of persons in both groups currently smoke cigarettes.
No difference in current smoking prevalence between Americans with and without diabetes was also found in an analysis of 1988 BRFSS data for the nation.
12 Figure 7 Figure 9 Figure 8 Figure 10 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Page 5 Texans with diabetes are both significantly more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension and be obese than Texans without diabetes (Figures 9 and 10).
Hypertension often occurs with diabetes, especially among African Americans.
Figure 9 shows that Texans with diabetes are 2.6 times more likely to have hypertension than those who don't have diabetes, a problem that puts diabetics with hypertension at much higher risk of stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and nerve damage than other diabetics.
In Type II diabetes, obesity results from the disease process of glucose intolerance and insulinresistance that precedes and accompanies diabetes.
The data in Figure 10 illustrate that Texans with diabetes are about twice as likely as those without diabetes to be obese, regardless of sex.
Preventive Health Practices: Obese Texans with diabetes, like their non-diabetic counterparts, are likely to be trying to lose weight*.
Figure 11 shows that 61.0% of obese persons with diabetes are trying to lose weight compared to 56.3% of obese non-diabetics.
This difference is not statistically significant.
Exercise and diet are important parts of the diabetes treatment regimen.
Becoming more mobile is particularly important for people with diabetes because they are more prone to heart disease and because exercise helps the body's cells use insulin more effectively.
About 46% of Texans with and without diabetes who are trying to lose weight use * Weight loss data from 1989, 1991-1992.
both diet and exercise to lose weight (Figures 12 and 13).
Using diet only is the next most popular method, used by 41.7 % of diabetics and 33.5 % of nondiabetics, a difference possibly caused by mobility problems among the older diabetic population.
The large proportions of diabetics trying to lose weight using diet alone indicates a need to review and adjust the diabetes self-management plans of many Texans to ensure adequate exercise in addition to dietary treatment.
Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 11 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Page 6 Fortunately, most Texans diagnosed with diabetes --88.2 percent-- have had a routine examination during the year preceding the survey (Figure 14), compared to 64.4 % of Texans without diabetes.
Having diabetes significantly predicts having had a routine checkup, even controlling for age, income, race/ethnicity, sex, and educational attainment.
Part of this difference is probably due to a self-selection effect: people who regularly go to the doctor are more likely to have existing diseases diagnosed.
Up to half of people with diabetes are undiagnosed.
(Figure 15).
People with diabetes should have their cholesterol checked every year.
The test should include levels of high-density and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) and triglycerides.13 Although people with diabetes have been discouraged from drinking alcohol in the past, this stance recently has been softened to allow for modest consumption of alcohol taken with meals.14 From 1988-1993, 28% of people with diabetes consumed at least one drink within the month before being surveyed compared with 55.2% of other Texans.
Modest alcohol consumption is allowed except when contraindicated by some medications or health conditions, but heavy and continuous alcohol use among people with diabetes can cause hypoglycemia, glucose intolerance, and a buildup of ketone and lactate in the short term.
Long term effects of heavy alcohol consumption correlates with an increased prevalence of cancer, hypertension, liver cirrhosis, and symptomatic neuropathy.14 The prevalence of binge drinking, consuming five drinks at a single setting during the month before the survey, was 4.7 % among Texans with diabetes compared to 16.9 % among nondiabetics (Figure 16).
The large difference between the two groups is most likely attributable to the older average age of people with diabetes.
Still, that almost one in twenty Texans with diabetes engages in such drinking behavior is worrisome and should be looked out for by health professionals treating diabetes.
Figure 14 Figure 15 Similarly, 71.9 % of diabetics and 64.4 % of nondiabetics had their cholesterol checked within the year before the survey, although an alarming 17.5 % of diabetics had not had their cholesterol checked at all Figure 16 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Page 7 Diabetes-Specific Topics: In 1994, Texans with diabetes were asked several questions specific to their diabetes about age at onset, insulin use, visits to a health professional, testing for blood sugar and control, and others.
Mean age at onset for Texans with diabetes in 1994 was 47 years.
More diabetic Texans are taking insulin to treat their disease than are not: 52.3% are injecting insulin.
At minimum, Texans who show none of the complications of diabetes should see a health professional twice a year, and have a glycoslylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test twice a year.
13 Texans with diabetes, both complicated and uncomplicated, visited a health professional for their diabetes an average of 5.6 times, plus or minus 2.1 visits.
Only 16.5 % of Texans with diabetes had even heard of a glycosylated hemoglobin test.
Only 41.3 % checked their blood glucose at least daily; 15.8 % have never checked their blood sugar.
People with diabetes are equally as likely to smoke cigarettes as those without diabetes, suggesting that emphasis should be placed on smoking cessation for this high risk group.
17.5 % of people with diabetes have never had their cholesterol checked, and 4.7 percent engage in binge drinking.
Few Texans with diabetes check their blood sugar levels on a regular basis; even fewer have even heard of a glycosylated hemoglobin test.

Conclusion: The BRFSS has proven to be a valuable source of data describing important health behavior related to diabetes.
This profile of Texans with diabetes points to specific population groups that need programs and messages targeted at reducing behaviors contributing to diabetes and its complications.
Texans exhibit a typical pattern of elevated diabetes prevalence with age, and higher diabetes prevalence among women, minorities, and those with lower household incomes and educational attainment.
Sedentary lifestyle is a problem among all Texans, regardless of diabetes diagnosis.
Those with lower educational levels are more likely to be sedentary.

These costs include $1.6 billion for direct medical care and $2.4 billion in lost productivity due to short-term illness, long-term disability and premature mortality.
Many of the complications that occur as a result of diabetes can also happen independently of diabetes.
For this reason, researchers classified costs for persons with diabetes as follows: cost clearly attributable to diabetes, cost probably attributable to diabetes, and total cost of care regardless of cause.
Costs clearly attributable to diabetes amounted to about $2 billion, including $500 million for direct medical care and $1.5 billion in indirect costs.
Total costs for persons with diabetes, without consideration of cause, were formidable - $3.2 billion in medical care, including care for conditions which may or may not be attributable to the disease.
Total indirect costs without regard to cause or limitation of death, were estimated at $4.3 billion.
Indirect costs probably attributable to diabetes in 1992 accounted for 60% of the total cost estimate, and 60% ($1.43 billion) of indirect costs were due to long-term disability.
It was estimated that around 72,200 Texans were totally disabled, and another 47,200 partly disabled as a probable consequence of diabetes.
Approximately 7,100 persons died prematurely as a probable consequence of diabetes, at an estimated cost of $853 million.
Short term illness was estimated to have cost about 4,700 person-years of productivity.
