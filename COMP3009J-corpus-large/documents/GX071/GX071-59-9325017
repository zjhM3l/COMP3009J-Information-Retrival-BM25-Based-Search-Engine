Testimony by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, Co-Chair Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues to the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee Thursday, April 29, 1999 2358 Rayburn
Mr. Chairman, I am Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of NY and I am the Democratic Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues for the 106^th Congress.
I have only a few minutes, so I would like to talk very briefly about five very important issues.
Parkinson's Disease Research Funding
First, I would like to say a word about funding for Parkinson's Disease research.
I make this request not only as the Co-Chair of the Women's Caucus, but also as the Co-Chair of the Congressional Working Group on Parkinson's Disease.
Parkinson's Disease is a chronic, progressive disorder affecting one million Americans - women and men almost equally.
In its final stages, this cruel disease robs individuals of the ability to speak or move.
Scientists have described Parkinson's as the most curable neurological disorder.
However, there are a number of avenues of Parkinson's research that have yet to be explored due to a lack of resources.
One of these avenues is the role of estrogen in the development and progression of Parkinson's.
Significant advances have been made, but we still have a long way to go.
Congress recognized the enormous toll that Parkinson's exacts from our society and the need to increase Parkinson's research funding and passed the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research Act, which authorized up to $100 million in new funding for research focused on Parkinson's.
However, there has been indication that the National Institutes of Health is misinterpreting Congress' intent and has been broadly interpreting what constitutes Parkinson's focused research.
We are so close to finding a cure for this terrible disease.
I urge this committee to direct the NIH to respect the definition of what constitutes Parkinson's focused research and to appropriate sufficient funds for the NIH to carry out this research.
Funding for Dioxin 
I would also like to ask that the committee consider including report language in the appropriations bill in regard to my bill, the Tampon Safety and Research Act, H.R.890.
This bill asks the NIH to conduct research on dioxin and other toxins and additives in tampons to determine the extent to which these additives may pose health risks relating to cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and infertility.
As you may know, dioxin is a byproduct of the bleaching process used on tampons.
The EPA has said that dioxin is a known animal cancer-causing agent as well as a probable human carcinogen.
Other chemicals additives are regularly added to tampon or related products, while the risks are simply unknown.
Tampons are used by approximately 73 million American women - that's 53 percent of American women and almost a third of the total population.
Because the effects of dioxin are cumulative and because a woman could use almost 17,000 tampons in her lifetime, even trace amounts of dioxin pose a potential health risk.
Little research has been done on the link between tampons, dioxin, and women's health.
The fact is that we know more about the risks of using bleached coffee filters than we do a product used by millions of women.
I urge the Committee to adopt report language to include this kind of research in the excellent work done at NIH.
Title IX
I would like to say a word about Title IX, the federal law that requires federally funded institutions to ensure equity in education and sports.
It is imperative that every girl and every boy have equal opportunity to participate in sports.
We know that girls who play sports have higher grades, higher self esteem, lower levels of depression, are less likely to become pregnant, have a more positive body image, and may suffer less incidences of breast cancer and osteoporosis as they get older.
A 1992 study showed that less than 36% of college athletic scholarships were awarded to female athletes.
Less than 24% of college sports operating budgets and less than 18% of the athletics recruiting dollars are allocated to women's sports.
Despite this fact, funding for the enforcement of Title IX has been cut each of the past three years.
In fact, in 1998, twenty states have totally eliminated their equity offices, leaving no one responsible at the state level for implementing or monitoring civil rights programs and laws.
Prior to its passage, many young women were relegated to the cheerleading squad; today, every year more than 2 million young women play softball, soccer, basketball, and many other sports.
The effects of 25 years of Title IX are clear:
*In 1996, the US women's softball and US women's soccer teams won Olympic gold medals.
*In 1997, we saw the first season of women's professional basketball teams.
*In 1998, the US Olympic women's hockey team won the gold medal.
*This summer, America will host the Women's World Cup soccer.
And millions of American children will be watching.
Let's not let this success story for young American women turn to failure because of reduced funding and lack of enforcement.
I urge this committee to fully fund Title IV of the Civil Rights Act Training and Advisory Services in the Education Budget at the $7.3 million requested in the Presidents budget for FY2000, to provide for enforcement of Title IX.
An additional $73.3 million has been requested for the Office for Civil Rights for FY2000, which investigates discrimination complaints, and addresses all educational equity issues.
Both monies are critical to enforcing Title IX.
Title X
I would also like to request that this committee funds the Administration's request of $240 million for Title X programs.
These programs are essential to women's health.
Particularly the health of low income and young women.
Publicly funded family planning programs, including Title X, prevent 386,000 unintended pregnancies to teenagers annually, avoiding 183,000 abortions.
In addition to providing information on contraception, Title X clinics also provide screening and treatment for STDs, HIV screening, routine gynecological exams, and breast and cervical cancer screening.
Title X clinics are an important component of our health care system and I urge this committee to ensure that they are able to continue their important work.
Child Care Development Block Grant
More than ever, children need care at an earlier age as more women enter the workforce...many because they have to.
Experts have told the country about the importance of early brain development.
With women required to move from welfare to work, the waiting lists for infant and toddler care is growing.
Many are left out in the cold are simply not able to get quality, intellectually stimulating care for their children.
We need to increase the amount of support in the federal budget for the Child Care Development Block Grant.
Child care centers must receive adequate reimbursement equal to their real costs.
We want centers that meet standards, provide affordable care, and pay their staff livable wages to succeed.
It is good for our communities.
It is good for our economy.
This is an investment in the children, this country's future.
Achieving this goal depends on Congress passing a federal budget that increases funds for the Child Care Development Block Grant.
