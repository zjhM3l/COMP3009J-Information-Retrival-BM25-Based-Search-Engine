Commission Recommends Grants Totaling $3,819,431, Changes Schedule of Future Meetings At its meeting on February 24, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission recommended that the Archivist of the United States make grants totaling $3,819,431 for 62 projects and changed the schedule of its future meetings.
NHPRC Chairman John W. Carlin noted that the President's proposed budget for fiscal year 2000 includes $6 million for NHPRC grants, the same amount as in fiscal year 1999.
Chairman Carlin also welcomed new Commissioner Mary Maples Dunn, Director of Radcliffe College's Schlesinger Library, representing the American Historical Association, to her first Commission meeting, and announced that the American Association for State and Local History has named Brent D. Glass, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, as its new representative on the Commission.
With the implementation of the Commission's new strategic plan and application deadlines, no proposals will be eligible for review at a June 1999 meeting.
The Commission consequently resolved not to hold a meeting this June.
It further resolved that, beginning in fiscal year 2000, the Commission will meet twice, in November and in May.
The November meetings will last two days, in order to allow the Commission time for policy deliberations.
At its November 1999 meeting, the Commission will approve one-time bridge grants for ongoing documentary publication projects affected by the schedule change.
For the present, deadlines for proposals remain as listed in NHPRC's Guidelines: June 1 for consideration at the November meeting, and October 1 for consideration at the May meeting.

The World War II Letters of American Women Project by Judy Barrett Litoff and David C. Smith Most historians are voyeurs who like nothing better than to read other people's mail.
Fortunately, the taboo about private life being sacrosanct is discarded when historic mail is concerned.
In recent years, in fact, historians have adeptly used private correspondence to reveal new realms of knowledge about life and society in America.
We certainly plead guilty to the charge of reading other people's mail.
For more than a decade, we have been involved in a nationwide search to locate letters written by American women during World War II.
Our collection now consists of some 30,000 letters written by 1,500 women representing diverse social, economic, ethnic, and geographic circumstances.
We have letters written by mothers, daughters, sisters, cousins, aunts, grandmothers, stepmothers, wives, sweethearts, and friends on the home front.
Complementing these letters is the correspondence of many pioneering women who served in the military both at home and abroad.
A sociologist colleague assayed our collection and found it to be representative of the population of the United States during the 1940s.
Locating and obtaining our cache of mail originally occurred as an act of serendipity.
It began in the early 1980s as we conducted research for a book, Miss You: The World War II Letters of Barbara Wooddall Taylor and Charles E. Taylor (1990), which was based on thousands of pages of correspondence between a young war bride and her soldier husband.
Their letters dramatically told the story of the vicissitudes of their war: courtship by mail, marriage on the move, traveling cross country with a baby, life on the Continued on page 9

The Executive Director's Column They have been called the Greatest Generation, the men and women who in their youth weathered the privations of the Great Depression and then as young adults fought and won World War II.
They then returned home, married with astonishing speed, sired the Baby Boom generation, worked hard, and retired.
Too many now have left us.
As a group, they were notable for their reticence, their lack of inclination to dwell upon their experiences in the war.
This certainly was true of my own father, who served in the China-Burma-India theater as a glider pilot with an Army Air Corps group known as the First Air Commandoes.
I knew that he had won the Distinguished Flying Cross--several times--but such was his attitude toward this that I formed the impression that it was a common achievement.
I knew that, at the time, the First Air Commandoes were famous: that they were the basis of a comic strip called "Terry and the Pirates."
Yet it wasn't until 1994, when I went with him to Coventry, England, for a reunion of the "Chindits", the combined British and American Force in Burma, that I learned the full extent of his and his compatriots' persistent bravery.
Upon my arrival at NHPRC, it was a source of great satisfaction to me to learn that there were several projects focusing upon this period, this generation.
And it is a source of great satisfaction to present this issue of Annotation.
Sadly, my father will not see it, for he died this past Christmas Eve.
But I hope you will read and enjoy it.
And visit these projects; research the documents; read the editions.
And remember the Greatest Generation.
Brent D. Glass Joins Commission The American Association for State and Local History has chosen Brent D. Glass, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, to be its representative on the the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.
Dr. Glass will join the Commission at its November 1999 meeting.
He succeeds David H. Hoober, Arizona State Archivist, who served three four-year terms as a member of the Commission.
Dr. Glass, who has held his current position since 1987, also serves as Pennsylvania's State Historic Preservation Officer.
He previously worked for several public and non-profit organizations in the fields of historic preservation, neighborhood revitalization, and humanities education.
He received his B.A. degree from Lafayette College, his M.A. from New York University, and a Ph.D. in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Dr. Glass has written several books, book reviews, and articles on a wide range of topics, including industrial history, historic preservation, and public history policy.
In Memoriam: Mr. Justice Blackmun NHPRC members and staff were saddened to learn of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a longtime member of the Commission.
He had great respect for the Commission, he said many times, and the NHPRC benefited immensely from his active and influential participation.
Of quiet dignity and a sharp sense of humor, much of it self-deprecatory, Justice Blackmun was a man of numerous interests, many of them related to history, the sifting of evidence, the uncertainty of truth, and the excitement of discovery.
In 1997, DreamWorks released Steven Spielberg's film Amistad.
Based loosely on an actual historical event, the film portrays a slave revolt on a Spanish ship.
Captured off the coast of Connecticut when their desperate attempt to sail home failed, 53 Africans were forced to stand trial for murdering the crew that had held them prisoner.
In their fight for freedom, the Africans were aided by abolitionists and former president John Quincy Adams, who took their battle all the way to the U.S. Continued on page 4

World War II Refugees and the Unitarian Service Committee by Timothy Driscoll News of refugee crises caused by early Nazi imperialism prompted numerous modern missionary movements in the midto late 1930s.
By 1938, in an effort to aid European missions undertaken by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and other organizations, American Unitarian Association (AUA) ministers, including Robert Dexter, Waitstill Sharp, Martha Sharp, and AUA president Frederick May Eliot, informally constructed a network of volunteers and supporters to provide assistance to refugees in Czechoslovakia's Sudeten province.
The Sharps agreed in early 1938 to undertake a fact-finding mission to Czechoslovakia, while Eliot, Dexter, and an emerging educational, and medical aid projects to help rebuild dozens of cities and regions left devastated by Nazi occupation and Allied liberation efforts.
The work was urgent and complex, and the dynamics of the institution changed often, according to the attention required to oversee continuing and new projects and specific cases.
The Unitarian and the Universalist denominations merged in 1964 to become the Unitarian Universalists.
The Universalists also had a wartime service committee, and the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) was the successor of the two earlier committees.

group of ministers and lay volunteers formed an exploratory commission to seek funding for aid programs that would provide refuge, shelter, clothing, food, and community for the uprooted population.
In May 1939, after the AUA Board of Directors voted to fund the Czech project, and while Czech relief continued and fact-finding missions to Poland and other European nations were undertaken, the Unitarian Service Committee (USC) was formed as an agency independent from AUA governance.
Throughout World War II and in its aftermath, the Unitarian Service Committee acted to counter the ravaging effects of the war throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa.
The USC implemented emigration, sanitation, economic, agricultural, eventually donated the records of all three committees to Harvard Divinity School.
The UUSC archives contain a rich and comprehensive collection of case files and project files relating to the USC's early role in refugee assistance.
The records document the formation and development of the USC as one agency among dozens working independently and cooperatively during World War II to rescue and help repair millions of lives destabilized by the war.
This summary of the refugee records is a selective description of the vast body of case files and project files in the UUSC archives.

resistance and subsequently disappeared.
The case appears to have been matched by USC staff with an letter from an American citizen expressing interest in helping "a family of three with a small daughter under two years...."
Documentation of USC staff efforts to connect the need with volunteer interest exists in correspondence between the USC Boston and Toulouse offices, and finally in an exchange of letters between the USC and the donor describing the situation of the fatherless family and the donor's affirmative response, asking for clarification about the gender of the children so that the proper clothes might be donated.
The amount of, and level of detail in, correspondence required to connect one American family with one refugee family, among the tens of thousands of pages documenting similar situations during World War II and the postwar era is impressive.
The energy and efficiency of this handful of people in the USC offices in America and in Europe, tracking and attempting to connect war victims with people who were able to provide some sort of aid, is as impressive as any of the singular stories within the archives.
Many of the case files include anonymous third-person narratives of the situation of the refugee(s).
The purpose of the narratives is unclear, but one can imagine them being used for raising funds, for general USC operations, and for other specific purposes.
The story of a young German couple forced into a refugee camp in Ericeira, Portugal, is powerfully descriptive.
The first document begins with an invitation to imagine a photograph of the family in front of their house.
The narrative then focuses on the present life of the family and describes their paths to Ericeira.
After escaping imprisonment for his role in the Spanish Republican war effort, the man met his future wife, then a war-widow, in Lisbon.
They eventually married.
The man's past soon was exposed, and husband and wife, then with two children, were held incommunicado in prison.
After a month in prison, she attempted suicide.
The narrative then switches perspectives to describe the USC's role in caring for the couple's children while they were imprisoned.
USC staff members acted as observers during the mother's incarceration and subsequent medical treatment, and played a part in her ultimate return to Ericeira and her children.
The narrative ends with the story of the husband, who was finally released in 1946, after spending months in solitary confinement and years in various prisons.
The couple remained separated and their future uncertain.
Like many of the cases documented in the USC archives, this story ends without resolution or conclusion.
Other case files reveal the financial considerations central to USC operations.
Cases required sponsors, but even with sponsors, it was very expensive to adequately resolve a case.
One example is the plight of a man transported from Lisbon to his homeland in
Mexico.
The file includes correspondence with the man's brother in Philadelphia, asking for an additional two hundred dollars to defray the transportation costs.
When the brother wrote USC staff that he could not afford to reimburse the agency for the costs, USC staff worked out an arrangement with another aid agency to cover the expenses.
Despite the constant financial shortcomings in an operation as vast as this, it is clear from these files that the USC worked under the premise that missions were the primary focus, and that the expenses associated with the work were a secondary consideration.
Financial problems were significant and occasionally decisive, however.
Some of the USC case files are organized more as project files.
These files detail cases from the broader perspective of the administration of various field offices in Europe.
One crisis in the Paris field office was dramatically documented in correspondence, reports, and narratives.
The liquidation in 1946 of the National War Fund, a primary financial resource for USC operations, set the stage for a decision at USC headquarters in Boston to close the Paris office and remove the director of European operations.
The correspondence from the European side indicated clear symptoms of stress and fatigue within the Paris office that resulted in inefficiency and low morale.
The correspondence and operational reports are supplemented by detailed accounting and budget records that delineate the expenditures of all Paris operations, including all aid project costs and operational overhead.
The most compelling documentation is found in the final exchange between Boston and the European director.
These letters balance the USC officers' appreciation for the work of the field staff with their practical realism in determining the need to close the Paris office and reorganize the entire European operation.
To date, there are no comprehensive histories of this aspect of the USC's history and work.
The complicated arrangement of the collection begs for intensive and long-term research projects.
Since processing and cataloging were completed in 1995, the collection has been used primarily by individuals tracing the role of the USC and its allied agencies in aiding them and/or their relatives.
Research was also recently undertaken to prepare an overview of the collection as part of a larger project to document the work of relief organizations during World War II.
As contemporary cultural interest in the World War II era continues to grow, these Service Committee records may serve as a major resource documenting the human tragedy of World War II, the heroism and bravery of its victims, and the efforts of those who worked to repair the damaged lives and populations.
