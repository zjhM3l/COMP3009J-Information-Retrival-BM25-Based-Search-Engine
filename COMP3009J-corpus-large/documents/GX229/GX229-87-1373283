Concerns about global climate change are expected to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and use of fossil energy.
Scientists cite such phenomena as the melting of the polar ice caps and increases in weather volatility as evidence that climate change is already under way, and consensus is growing among both political and industry leaders that actions must be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent far-reaching consequences.
The oil and gas industry will be challenged to minimize and control these emissions on many fronts, including in E
Environmental challenges for the exploration and production of oil and gas will intensify.

that worldwide demand for oil and gas will grow considerably over the longer term.
As a result, the international petroleum industry will face intensified pressure to provide increased volumes of crude oil and natural gas at reasonable prices.
Industry success will depend on continued improvements to productivity and efficiency.
The global oil and gas industry is struggling to survive in the increasingly competitive and volatile marketplace.
Mergers and acquisitions, such as the BP-Amoco and ExxonMobil mergers, are unprecedented in both scale and pace.
Moreover, the industry is going through a fundamental transformation -- many countries with traditionally government-operated national petroleum companies are divesting assets and opening their borders to international investment and development.
The petroleum industry has in the past and must continue in the future to be able to withstand change in the marketplace.
The industry has a long record of success in assessing and managing risk, and in handling the cyclic oil prices that have been a hallmark of the petroleum business.
By most accounts the year 1998 was considered one of the worst the industry has ever experienced.
Adjusting for inflation, world oil prices

In 1997, approximately 436,000 oil wells in the United States produced fewer than 10 barrels per day.
With 353 million barrels produced, these wells accounted for almost 15 percent of domestic oil production.
In 1998, company budgets for exploration and development expenditures were dramatically reduced from previous years.
Finding capital for new projects and preserving the existing infrastructure -- including leases, wells, drilling and service equipment, transmission pipelines, and a skilled workforce -- became increasingly difficult.
Although industry is breathing easier these days, the pain of low oil prices has not faded.

reached the lowest level in 25 years.
Throughout 1999, however, world oil prices have rebounded considerably, increasing nearly 50 percent in the first six months of the year.
Low oil prices: What's at stake? While low oil prices, such as those in 1998, enable energy consumers to reap significant savings, they also threaten the viability of the domestic petroleum industry.
The number of rigs drilling in the United States in 1998 was 60 percent lower than the year earlier.
Upstream employment dropped to levels not seen in decades, to an annual average of almost 326,000, the lowest level in 25 years -- nearly 55 percent lower than the record employment levels of the early 1980s.
And U.S. imports of crude oil reached an all-time high of 8.6 million barrels per day.
Low prices make marginally producing wells (especially those producing fewer than 10 barrels per day) particularly susceptible to

United States dependence on imported oil has increased to record levels during the last 25 years.
Net imports provide almost 50 percent of U.S. oil consumption.
Oil imports could grow to as much as 71 percent in 2020 depending on world oil prices, as the gap between domestic oil production and consumption widens.

Low oil prices pose a particular threat to smaller domestic companies, those of insufficient size, diversification, or worldwide presence to "weather the storm."
In the United States, the vast majority of oil and gas companies are smaller independent firms with fewer than 20 employees.
These independents drill 85 percent of all new oil and gas wells in the country and produce 40 percent of the crude oil and 65 percent of the natural gas.
Americans enjoying the low prices at the gasoline pump may ask, "So what?" The answer: this short-term windfall may well come at the expense of longer-term economic and national security.
If American wells are prematurely plugged and abandoned and American producers go out of business, we lose jobs, tax revenues, royalty income to land and mineral owners, access to domestic
resources, in some cases never to return, and increase our dependence on foreign oil and gas.
Such changes could also hurt our environment -- reducing the capability of industry to meet projected natural gas demand in the United States, increasing tanker traffic and the possibility of spills in the marine environment, and reducing industry's capacity to develop and deploy new technologies for improving productivity and environmental performance.
A formidable task for industry and government At this challenging time in the industry's history, government and industry must work together to preserve America's longer-term oil and gas production capacity and energy security.
An array of actions by States as well as the Federal government may periodically be necessary to assist the industry, especially small businesses, in surviving low oil prices, and to enable them to provide a foundation for the future.

Building Awareness of Smarter Technology
Additional causes for concern are trends in corporate downsizing and restructuring, as well as a phase-out of consumer subsidized financing by 2005 at the Gas Research Institute, the Nation's largest natural gas research and technology development organization.
Some experts believe these trends foreshadow a shrinking population of scientists and engineers and reduced opportunities for new generations of technologists.
Other factors provide reason for hope.
From the vantage point of three decades, both the E
Industry and government relationships over the environment have progressed markedly, from confrontation toward dialogue, from conflict to far more collaborative, win-win problem solving.
Technology partnerships have become more widespread.
To meet cost pressures and leverage resources, companies increasingly are working with each other, with academic groups, and with government in new and creative technology research, development, and deployment efforts.
More efforts of this kind will be required in the future, to enable essential technological advances.
Continued need for leadership Energy experts from industry, academia, and the research community have recommended that the Federal government continue to provide leadership, focus, and substantial financial support for energy research and development.
This Federal role can ensure the achievement of national goals of U.S. energy security, economic strength, environmental quality, and leadership in science and technology.
Organizations fostering oil and gas technology transfer range from universities, to States, to professional societies, to advocacy groups.
These groups are also instrumental in articulating geoscience principles, and standards for more efficient oil and gas operations, environmental protection, and professional conduct.
A representative -- but not comprehensive -- list of these organizations includes: American Association of Petroleum Geologists American Association of Professional Landmen American Geological Institute American Institute of Professional Geologists American Petroleum Institute Association of American State Geologists Completion Engineering Association Drilling Engineering Association E

"Technological progress plays a critical
Fostering technology transfer Demonstrations of advanced technology concepts and information exchange are critical to accelerating the deployment of smarter technologies.
As new technologies are developed to improve economics or productivity, their introduction into the marketplace can vary significantly due to such factors as cost, performance, applicability, adherence to government regulations or policies, and regional availability.
The advanced technologies described in this report range from technologies commonplace today, such as 3-D seismic, to those gaining wider use domestically and internationally, such as horizontal drilling, to very promising technologies yet to be fully demonstrated, such as separating oil and water downhole within the reservoir.
Minimizing and Controlling Greenhouse Gases T HE RISE IN GREENHOUSE GAS emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial and agricultural activities has aroused international concern about the impacts of these emissions on climate.
Greenhouse gases -- mostly carbon dioxide, but also some methane, nitrous oxide, and other trace gases -- are emitted to the atmosphere, enhancing an effect in which heat reflected from the earth's surface is kept from escaping into space, as in a greenhouse.
Concerned scientists believe that the earth's surface temperature may rise enough to cause global climate change.
They cite such phenomena as the melting of the polar ice caps and increases in weather volatility as evidence

that climate change is already under way.
And while scientific uncertainty remains on the extent of the potential climate change, nonetheless, consensus is growing among both political and industry leaders that actions must be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent potentially farreaching consequences.
On a per capita basis, the United States is the world's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.
With 4 percent of the world's population, our Nation emits 23 percent of the world's greenhouse gases.
Approximately 90 percent of United States greenhouse gas emissions from human activities come from energy production and use, most emissions a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels.
Concerns about global climate change are expected to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions related to the production and use of fossil energy.
The oil and gas industry will be challenged to minimize and control these emissions on many fronts, including in E
The Kyoto Protocol, negotiated by more than 160 nations in December 1997, is intended to reduce net emissions of certain greenhouse gases significantly by the 5-year period between 2008 and 2012.
Each participating developed country has established emission reduction or limitation targets under the negotiated treaty.
The ground rules for how these reductions can be achieved, reported, and verified continue to be negotiated.
Uncertainties and constraints Many believe that significant economic burdens could result from implementing the requirements agreed to under the Kyoto protocol.
The extent of these burdens is highly uncertain, however, and is the source of significant disagreement.
Some factors contributing to this uncertainty include: Â· The availability and cost of new and improved technologies, and the pace at which existing capital stock can be replaced.
Â· Consumer acceptance of more advanced or efficient technologies, as well as the increased use of nuclear and renewable electric generation technologies.
Â· The identification and implementation of successful, cost-effective fiscal and monetary policies to moderate economic impacts, and a diverse range of cost-effective mechanisms to encourage actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Â· The adjustment of the electricity, natural gas, and renewable energy industries to new requirements and the possible changes in industrial and energy sector composition that would likely result.
Â· The timing and phase-in of the necessary transitions.

The Birth of the Kyoto Protocol
Â· In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the available scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information regarding climate change.
Â· The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992, in which Parties agreed in a nonbinding pledge to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
The United States was one of the first countries to ratify this treaty.
Â· In 1995 and 1996, the first and second Conference of the Parties agreed to address greenhouse gas emissions for the period beyond 2000, and began negotiating a protocol establishing legally binding emissions limitations and reductions for developed countries.
Â· At the third Conference of the Parties -- held in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan -- the Kyoto Protocol was finalized, committing participating developed nations to specific, binding emissions targets.
Â· The fourth Conference of the Parties, which was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, agreed to a 2-year plan for implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol on November 12, 1998.
Although signing affirms the United States' commitment to work with other nations to meet the treaty's goals, it does not impose an obligation on the United States to implement the Protocol.
(The treaty cannot become binding without approval of the United States Senate.)
Most projections envision a dramatic rise in natural gas consumption to meet the needs of a greenhouse gas constrained world, which in turn will require substantial increases in natural gas development and production to meet growing market demands.
To minimize potential negative economic impacts of climate change constraints, the domestic industry must be able to continue to hold costs down while delivering increasing volumes of natural gas.
To accomplish this, technological advances must continue, and a supportive policy and regulatory environment must encourage increased natural gas development and production.
The response: policy and technology dimensions To meet the challenges posed by climate change, industry and government must work collaboratively.
Government must provide a policy and regulatory environment for the industry that encourages action, without posing unnecessary economic burdens or penalizing in the future those that act today.
Governments must identify and evaluate the full range of options available to encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions, allowing the maximum amount of flexibility possible to capture the innovation and entrepreneurial creativity that has always characterized the petroleum industry.
All possible policy instruments -- including, but not limited to, economic incentives, emissions trading, technology controls, energy efficiency initiatives, and product changes -- should be debated, evaluated, and, where appropriate, implemented.
"For the oil and gas industry the dominant issue of public policy is climate change.
. . .
Our goal [at BP Amoco] is to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases by 10 percent from a 1990 baseline over the period to 2010.
. . .
That target will now sit alongside our financial targets.. . .
[It] has been developed . . . in close cooperation with the Environmental Defense Fund, whose help and support has been tremendously valuable.
I want to pay a tribute to them."
The opportunity: the critical role of natural gas Because of the higher relative carbon content of coal and petroleum products, any strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would encourage the decreased use of these fuels and the increased use of lower-carbon fuels.
This implies more reliance on renewable energy, perhaps on nuclear energy, and, especially in the nearer term, on natural gas.

Industry must be proactive in addressing demands upon it to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It must participate in multistakeholder forums to constructively develop effective mechanisms to address climate change issues and ensure that industry's concerns and recommendations are represented.
Industry must carefully examine its own operations, policies, and procedures, and identify all possible options for costeffectively and voluntarily reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and improving efficiency of operations.
In many instances, considerable cost reductions and economic advantages can be achieved in conjunction with emissions reductions.
And responding to concerns about climate change can provide marketplace opportunities for those in industry willing to act decisively.
The oil and gas industry currently possesses many of the tools and basic understandings needed to mitigate carbon emissions.
Technologies now available, and under development, may be used to separate and capture carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled power plants, oil and natural gas processing facilities, and other industrial processes for injection into geologic formations.
Three principal formations -- inactive and uneconomical gas reservoirs, aqueous formations, and deep and unmineable coal reservoirs -- are widespread and have the potential for sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide.
In the case of carbon dioxide injection for enhanced oil recovery or enhanced coalbed methane recovery, the benefits of oil and gas extraction may partially or totally offset the cost of carbon dioxide separation and capture.

Achieving that potential will take a commitment of innovation, leadership, and resources by the industry to overcome challenges that arise."
National Petroleum Council, The Potential for Natural Gas, 1992
Ensuring Responsible Development E NVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WILL BE a continuing issue for the oil and gas industry.
America's oil and gas industry must find the means, including new technology, to meet its future challenges, both in lowering costs to maintain competitiveness and in protecting the environment.
A rational regulatory framework, reasonable access to resources in the United States and abroad, and communication are also critical to meeting these objectives.
Reinventing government A more flexible and responsive policy and regulatory framework is critical to the U.S. oil and gas industry's ability to provide reliable and affordable energy supplies in a manner reflecting shared societal concerns for environment, health, and safety.
Government must continue to improve its approach to regulation -- emphasizing sound science and cost-benefit and goal-oriented mechanisms -- and to improve coordination of policies affecting the industry.
States and Federal agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Transportation, have increasingly come to understand effective roles of government in enabling industry to improve its environmental performance.
These roles include providing educational assistance and fostering, not stifling, technology innovation and voluntary efforts to protect the environment.
For the industry and the Nation to address climate change, continued improvements in technology are critical.
Technology opportunities in the 21st century to reduce United States greenhouse gas emissions are possible only with sustained government and industry R
Future technologies for deployment in the oil and gas industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may include: Â· Increasing energy efficiency in crude oil refining.
Â· Converting natural gas to liquid fuels.
Â· Increasing natural gas production to help fuel industry and generation of electric power.
Â· Pumping carbon dioxide captured from industrial and electric power generation into oil reservoirs to enhance oil recovery, into coal seams to recover methane efficiently, and into natural gas storage fields to maintain subsurface pressures necessary for gas deliverability (carbon sequestration).

Moving beyond conflict to consensus Access to oil and gas resources domestically and abroad will increasingly depend on industry's ability to demonstrate its commitment to responsible development.
Industry has a responsibility to improve its credibility and an opportunity to lead in the resolution of contentious issues.
Oil companies, in particular, have been viewed by many as lacking a concern for the environment and the commitment to protecting it.
For this perspective to change, industry must improve and expand communication with stakeholders outside the industry.
Such communication will be crucial for resolving the economic and environmental issues the oil and gas industry will face.
Enhanced communication must be championed by industry leaders to show the commitment to real change in relationships with stakeholders.
Effective dialogue can enable consideration of the positions of all stakeholders, resulting in a more realistic basis of action.

Better communication between industry and the public will improve public understanding of the industry and its value to the country.
Education in the principles of science and economics is key to comprehending energy and environmental issues facing the industry.
Though industry has a strong history of supporting educational programs, it must focus its efforts to better understand public and customer concerns, and to encourage science, economic, and energy education.
Stewardship of public lands In the United States, vast quantities of oil and gas resources underlie Federal lands, including forests, deserts, rangelands, wetlands and marine environments, to be managed for public benefit.
Today, onshore Federal lands annually yield approximately 5 percent of our Nation's crude oil production and nearly 10 percent of its natural gas.
Offshore, Federal lands account for approximately 19 percent of annual crude production and 25 percent of annual natural gas production.
About 50 percent of the remaining untapped technically and economically recoverable crude oil and gas reserves are on Federal lands, excluding wilderness areas.
More than 80 percent of these properties are offshore.
Public opinion on access to Federal lands for resource exploration and production remains divided.
Advanced oil and gas technology will play a critical role in the continued debate regarding access to Federal lands, both onshore and in the Outer Continental Shelf.
Public dialogue on the need for energy and the need for protection of the environment, particularly our most fragile ecosystems, will contribute to improved resolution of the issues.
