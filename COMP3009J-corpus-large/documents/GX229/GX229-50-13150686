Economics and Statistics Administration Economics and Statistics Administration Mission Statement The Economics and Statistics Administration's (ESA's) mission is to chronicle, understand and explain economic and societal change.
Our goals are to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Help maintain a sound Federal statistical system that monitors and measures America's rapidly changing economic and social arrangements; Improve understanding of the key forces at work in the economy and the opportunities they create for improving the well-being of Americans; Develop new ways to disseminate information using the most advanced technologies; and Support the information and analytic needs of the Commerce Department, the Executive Branch, and the Congress.
The United States enjoys the reputation of being the world's unrivaled economic information leader, due in part to the timely and accurate analysis produced by the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA).
Producing such vital measures as the decennial census, the gross domestic product, and the balance of payments, ESA provides economic and demographic information that dramatically impacts the decision making of the President, Congress and businesses, and affects the lives of all Americans.
Organizational Structure ESA includes: ESA Headquarters, The Bureau of Economic Analysis, and The Bureau of the Census.
ESA headquarters (comprised of The Office of the Under Secretary, the Policy Support staff, and STAT-USA) has three main roles: to provide management, financial analysis, and administrative support to all ESA agencies; to provide economic policy analysis; and to provide data dissemination services.
The Office of the Under Secretary and the Office of Administration provide management, financial, and administrative services to ESA.
Policy Support's staff economists conduct research on the factors contributing to US industrial strength and the relationship between industry performance and economic growth, including recent major studies on the scope and economic impacts of electronic commerce.
Data dissemination services are provided by STAT-USA, an easy to use, "one-stop shop" that provides a focal point for business, economic, and trade statistics.
STAT-USA is a revolving fund account that requires no government funding.
(STAT-USA is discussed in detail in this section) STAT-USA As part of ESA headquarters, STAT-USA provides the public with access to key business, economic, and international trade information.
STAT-USA's mission is to: "produce, distribute, and assist other government agencies in producing world-class business, economic, and government information products that American businesses and the public can use to make intelligent and informed decisions."
It accomplishes this through its three primary products and services: the National Trade Data Bank (NTDB) CD-ROM, the USA Trade CD-ROM, and STAT-USA /Internet.
STAT-USA also performs services for other Commerce agencies, primarily in the area of information technology.
Projects include LAN support and website development.
The organization obtains financial support for its activities through sales of its information products and FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 51 Economics and Statistics Administration services.
It receives no appropriated funds, but rather operates on a revolving fund.
STAT-USA is organized into four functioning units including the Office of the Director, Customer Outreach, Operations, and ADP Support.
All units are located in Commerce's H.C. Hoover Building except for the Customer Outreach functions, which are located within the USA Trade Center at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center Building.
Priorities and Initiatives This fiscal year is an important and challenging one for STAT-USA.
The office's business operating plan is focused on the implementation of its STAT-USA/Internet "value-added" initiatives.
In addition to its normal business activities, STAT-USA, through its employees, is expected to complete fifteen value-added initiatives, spanning all STAT-USA functional areas.
The initiatives include key projects to update and improve the appearance of our website, and expand the services available on the web to include online help, online registration, and online questions and answers.
The initiatives also address specific marketing and advertising campaigns, and customer service plans.
These initiatives, compiled by a team of STAT-USA employees and reviewed and ranked by the entire staff, make up the core projects that will enable STAT-USA to improve its products and services and lead to a new, higher level of customer service.
The initiatives are a key part of our measures of performance listed below.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis serves as the Nation's accountant, developing measures and systems for collecting and interpreting vast amounts of diverse data from government and private sources.
BEA produces such widely used statistical measures as gross domestic product (GDP), corporate profits, and balance of payments.
(See the following section on the Bureau of Economic Analysis) The Bureau of the Census chronicles societal and demographic change.
The Bureau fulfills the constitutionally mandated requirement to conduct a decennial census, and the Bureau collects a wide range of economic and demographic data.
The data provided by the Bureau of the Census shape important policy decisions that help improve our Nation's social and economic conditions.
(See the following section on The Bureau of the Census) Summary ESA's staff and programs provide vital information, analysis, and advice to Commerce and other Executive Branch Departments, agencies, and officials.
Many of the Nation's decisions are based upon the economic and demographic information the agency produces

Reliable and consistent measures of economic activity are essential to the decision-making of business people and policymakers, and to the efficient operation of financial markets.
The mission of BEA is to produce and disseminate accurate, timely, relevant, and cost-effective economic accounts statistics that provide government, businesses, households, and individuals with a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of economic activity.
As the Nation's accountant, BEA develops measures and systems for collecting and interpreting vast amounts of diverse data from government and private sources.
BEA combines and transforms those data into a consistent and comprehensive picture of economic activity, which is summarized by the estimates of gross domestic product (GDP).
BEA's national, regional, and international economic accounts form much of the core of the federal statistical system, which in turn is critical to sound economic decisions by businesses, individuals, state and local governments, and federal institutions, such as the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.
These data provide many of the yardsticks by which the health and potential of the economy are judged.
They affect every American who runs a business, saves for retirement, or takes out a mortgage.
BEA data are also essential to the Federal government, providing information for policy development.
Priorities Bureau The major issue confronting BEA is the need to improve the accuracy and reliability of its economic accounts estimates.
For example, there has been growing concern in the economic community over the "statistical discrepancy," i.e., the difference between GDP, as measured by final expenditures for the goods and services produced by the U.S. economy, and gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure that is derived by totaling the costs incurred and the incomes earned in the production of those goods and services.
In theory, these measures should be equal, but the persistent discrepancy between them calls into question the accuracy of BEA's estimates.
BEA is pursuing many initiatives to improve the accuracy and reliability of its estimates, including working with the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other source data agencies to provide comprehensive coverage of services and other new and rapidly expanding sectors of the U.S. economy.
Department-Wide Ã¯Â¿Â½ Electronic Commerce: BEA supports the Department's electronic commerce initiative.
If its economic accounts are to keep pace with the relentless growth and increasing complexity of the American economy, BEA must develop the capacity to capture and accurately measure all aspects of economic activity from the traditional smoke-stack industries to the latest high-tech products and services, such as E-Business.
FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 56 Economics and Statistics Administration BEA However, E-Business creates such fundamental changes in the nature of economic transactions that new data sources and methodologies are needed to measure it.
Through coordination with its major source data suppliers, the Bureau of Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BEA will provide the first detailed and consistent accounting of E-Business, including data on its volume, its impact on GDP and the U.S. economy, its regional and cross-industry impact, and its impact on incomes and prices.
Incorporating coverage of EBusiness into BEA's national, international, and regional accounts will provide a more comprehensive picture of today's economy.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Critical Infrastructure Protection: BEA supports the Department's effort to ensure the security of critical infrastructure.
The experiences of other agencies, both government and private, with actual and threatened acts of terrorism and destruction of electronic data systems dictate the need to increase our awareness of any vulnerabilities that may exist.
By identifying and assessing those vulnerabilities, we will be able to take corrective and preventative actions to protect our critical systems.
In addition, BEA has proposed an initiative that will enhance the security of BEA's data by undertaking a number of positive steps, such as procuring additional firewall protection and router hardware and software, installing automatic intrusion monitoring software, and upgrading authentication technology for remote access.
These steps will help ensure that BEA is able to disseminate data promptly to its users via the BEA web site with confidence that the integrity of the data has not been compromised.

Their impact can be seen in Federal budget projections, where the discrepancy in recent years between income- and product-side estimates of real GDP growth can result in a difference of $150 billion in 5-year budget projections.
Over $115 billion in Federal grants to states are directly linked to BEA's estimates of regional income and product.
In a recent private study, BEA's quarterly advance GDP data was named as one of the three most important statistical releases for its effect on financial markets.
In large part, the success of BEA is measured by public trust in its data.
For example, economic reports on such variables as GDP, inflation, and personal income have an important influence on the formulation of consumer confidence and thus play a key role in consumers' expectations and buying plans.
To meet the needs of its users, BEA must produce and disseminate timely and relevant data.
No matter how high the quality of the estimate is, the data are of no use until they are available to the data users.
Thus, BEA strives to release its estimates as soon as reasonably possible, to publish a schedule of future release dates, and to consistently meet that schedule.
In addition, the usefulness of BEA's estimates depends on how well they meet the needs of the broad range of data users.
Therefore, achieving a high level of customer satisfaction is an important measure of the success of BEA's programs.

In addition, BEA obtains source data from most government agencies that produce statistics.
Interagency Council on Statistical Policy: Under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget, BEA is a major participant in the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, which works to improve collaborative activities of federal statistical agencies.
Activities of the council have led to standardization of data and concepts, transfers of technology, methodology exchange, collaborative research, process improvement, improved customer service, reduced respondent burden, and infrastructure sharing.
The Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Scheduling of BEA's releases is based on the availability of source data provided by other agencies, including the Bureau of the Census and BLS.
Economic and Export Agencies: STAT-USA originates few of the many thousands of files in its information base.
Rather, it obtains files from major economic agencies in the government (BEA, Census, BLS, and the Federal Reserve) and agencies providing export information (Census, ITA, State Department, and others).
STAT-USA also provides information technology (IT) solutions to other Commerce agencies to help them meet their IT needs.
FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62 Economics and Statistics Administration BEA Performance Goal 1: Provide Accurate, Timely and Relevant Economic Data External Factors and Mitigation Strategies BEA is highly dependent on other government agencies and private organizations for the source data it uses to produce its economic accounts statistics.
Thus, BEA's ability to provide accurate, timely, and relevant economic data and to move forward with improvements in its economic accounts is constrained by the quality and availability of that source data.
BEA works closely with its data sources to obtain the best and most complete data possible and continually refines its estimation methods to improve its measures, especially in areas with source data deficiencies.
FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 63 Economics and Statistics Administration Bureau of the Census Mission Statement To be the preeminent collector and provider of data about the people and economy of the United States The Bureau of Census' goal is to provide the best mix of timeliness, relevancy, quality, and cost for the data collected and services provided.

are used by large corporations and local businesses to devise their domestic and global strategies.
The credibility, expertise, and high statistical standards of the Bureau of the Census routinely elicit response rates of 90-95 percent for household surveys and 80 percent for business surveys.
This allows the Bureau of the Census to provide the most accurate and reliable information available.
The Bureau of the Census has developed four bureau-wide strategies to achieve its mission.
All goal-level strategies fall within one, or a combination, of these bureau-wide strategies: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Valuing our employees Ã¯Â¿Â½ Innovating in our work Ã¯Â¿Â½ Responding to our customers Ã¯Â¿Â½
Improving public cooperation Priorities Department-Wide Decennial Census - To enable Congressional apportionment and distribute $180 billion in federal grants, the Bureau of the Census will plan for and conduct the Decennial Census in the year 2000

Billions of government dollars are divided among states and communities, and businesses make decisions such as where to locate, based on demographic, social, economic, and housing profiles.
The federal government needs such information to manage programs.
Communities use it for economic development, for decisions about their future such as locating schools and expanding roads, and to see how they are doing compared with others.
Accurate measures of the country's demographic composition are critical to the efficient allocation of resources through both governmental appropriations and private markets.
Improving data quality is fundamental to the Secretarial objective of enhancing our Nation's statistical infrastructure.
Providing relevant demographic data in a timely manner supports the Secretary's initiative to enhance the country's statistical infrastructure.
It is vital that the most meaningful demographic data be promptly available to policymakers at the federal, state, and local level and to stakeholders and data users who depend on that information to make important and critical decisions.
Demographic programs develop plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory.
Official population estimates and projections for the Nation are prepared, and reports on socioeconomic, demographic and housing topics are published.
Also, analytical research on emerging issues and trends such as the condition of children and the elderly, the employment of disabled individuals, and the characteristics of immigrants is undertaken.
Directing and coordinating technical and developmental work on the collection and analysis of data by race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry is a major responsibility.
This work results in reports on the characteristics of special population groups, and for American Indian and Alaskan Native areas.
An important aspect is examining reporting issues such as error or bias in these data.
Official statistics on income and poverty, as well as longitudinal data on income and program participation that federal agencies use to develop, modify, and monitor transfer programs originate from Demographic Programs.
Especially important are data necessary to determine the impact of welfare provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, often called "welfare reform."
Much of the foundational analysis and research underlying the Office of Management and Budget's decisions on national statistical standards on topics such as occupational classifications, metropolitan areas, and race and ethnicity are conducted by Demographic Programs.
The Demographic Programs also plan and conduct surveys and special censuses, funded by other government agencies, that focus on topics of national importance, such as unemployment, crime, health, education, and consumer expenditures.
Also, we process, analyze, and disseminate data from the Decennial Census.
The demographic area is able to provide accurate, timely, and relevant data in an exemplary manner because of the excellent work done by the four divisions that comprise the directorate, Population; Housing and Household Economic Statistics; Demographic Surveys; and Demographic Statistical Methods.

Interagency Council on Statistical Policy: Under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget, both BEA and the Census Bureau are major participants in the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, which works to improve collaborative activities of federal statistical agencies.
Activities of the council have led to the standardization, improved customer service, reduced respondent burden, and infrastructure sharing.
Additionally, the Census Bureau participates in numerous non-statistical federal agency activities, such as being a data supplier, a survey collection resource, and an advisory and research resource.
External Factors and Mitigation Strategies Survey non-response rates continue to rise, perhaps affected by public perception.
The Census Bureau's strategies address segments of this problem.
Many aspects of public non-response are beyond the Census Bureau's control.
FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 71 Economics and Statistics Administration The Bureau of the Census Performance Goal 3: Conduct Accurate, Timely, Relevant, and Cost-effective Decennial Census Rationale for Performance Goal Improving data quality is fundamental to the Secretarial objective of enhancing our Nation's statistical infrastructure.
Census has been designated a High-Impact Agency by the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR).
The Bureau of the Census' NPR quality goal for Census 2000 will be achieved by executing the most complete and accurate census possible.
In January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled in Department of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives that the Census Act prohibits the Census Bureau from using statistical sampling in the decennial census to determine the population for congressional apportionments.
In response, the Census Bureau revised the plan for Census 2000 and will use traditional census taking methods to produce apportionment counts by December 31, 2000.
This resulted in a budget request for an additional $1.7 billion for FY 2000.
This includes funding for increased coverage improvement programs and extensive quality assurance to ensure that the data collected are accurate
.
These plans were developed taking into account past experience with the effectiveness of various programs.
Programs with demonstrated effectiveness were included.
Ineffective or error prone methodologies were not.
In their decision, however, the Supreme Court went on to say that the use of statistical sampling is lawful for purposes other than apportionment.
The Census Bureau will therefore conduct an Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Survey at the conclusion of the first phase of the census using modern statistical sampling techniques in order to produce more accurate and complete numbers.
The Census Bureau expects to have these statistically corrected numbers ready by April 1, 2001, and plans to make the more accurate census counts available in a form that allows states to use them for redistricting purposes.
The more accurate counts can also be used for determining the allocation of Federal funds, and for ongoing statistical and programmatic purposes.

The Census Bureau will then conduct an Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (ACE) Survey at the conclusion of the first phase of the census.
People counted in the ACE will be compared with those enumerated in the census.
After the matching is completed, a field interview will reconcile selected cases.
Following that, the Bureau will use modern statistical methods to produce more accurate census counts statistically corrected numbers ready by April 1, 2001, and plans to make the more accurate census counts available in a form that allows states to use them for redistricting purposes.
The more accurate counts can also be used for determining the allocation of Federal funds, and for ongoing statistical and programmatic purposes.
Frequency The measure will be obtained when legally mandated data are relased on schedule.
Data storage Internal Census databases Verification The Bureau will adhere to a statistical methodology that is well documented and reported publicly.
FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 73 Economics and Statistics Administration Performance Goal 3: Conduct Accurate, Timely, Relevant, and Cost-effective Decennial Census Strategies and Activities BUDGET FRAMEWORK Program Development and Management ACTIONS This category reflects the many activities associated with headquarters management, administrative, integration, and reporting requirements for Census 2000.
As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, Census 2000 has become a considerably larger and more complex program requiring extended headquarters management capacity.
In FY 2001, work will focus on disseminating Census 2000 products.
The Bureau will review, certify and deliver the Census 2000 data tabulations.
The data to apportion Congressional seats will be delivered to the President by December 31, 2000 and redistricting data as required by P.L. 94-171 will be delivered to the States.
We will begin to disseminate Census 2000 data via the American Factfinder system for the full range of Census users.
The Bureau will also prepare and disseminate geographic products such as county, block maps, census tract outlines maps, county subdivision outline maps and many summary and profile products.
The Bureau will maintain the support systems needed for final Census 2000 data collection, evaluation programs and orderly closing of census offices, disposition of assets and resolution of any personnel and operational issues.
This includes the field work associated with Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) survey person follow-up and final housing unit follow-up operations.
A.C.E. is the coverage measurement methodology that enables the Bureau to assess the effectiveness of Census 2000 and to publish final census data below the state-level for use in redistricting activities, distribution of Federal funds and many other purposes.
The Bureau must begin to update the basic software environment in which the TIGER database functions.
In FY 2001, the Bureau will evaluate commercially available software for the conversion.
The Bureau will process the Coverage Improvement Follow-up and Accuracy Coverage Evaluations operations data.
The Bureau will archive census questionaires, data capture information collected for evaluating census operations, data key census long form questions that fail edit checks, conduct computer and clerical coding of write-in responses, perform A.C.E. computer and clerical matching operations, and create a central repository for metadata.
The Bureau will implement the evaluation program designed to obtain information about the quality of Census 2000 data to provide for future census planning.
The evaluations will be released in the form of a Report Card on Census 2000.
The Bureau will complete data collection and processing activities including questionaire check-in, data capture and processing.
Creation of Census 2000 data products and final close-out of offices will also occur in this activity.
The effectiveness of field outreach and promotion programs and the Census in Schools program will be evaluated.

Interagency Council on Statistical Policy: Under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget, both BEA and the Bureau of the Census are major participants in the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, which works to improve collaborative activities of federal statistical agencies.
Activities of the council have led to standardization of data and concepts, transfers of technology, methodology exchange, collaborative research, process improvement, improved customer service, reduced respondent burden, and infrastructure sharing.
Additionally, the Bureau of the Census participates in numerous non-statistical federal agency activities, such as being a data supplier, a survey collection resource, and an advisory and research resource.
In conducting Census 2000, the Bureau is working closely with the U.S. Post Office to develop and update the census address list, and the Office of Management and Budget has established the Census Address List Appeals Office, which allows local and tribal governments to appeal final determinations made by the Census Bureau regarding suggested housing unit additions.
External Factors and Mitigation Strategies Survey non-response rates continue to rise, perhaps affected by public perception.
The Census 2000 Partnership and Marketing Program is a multi-faceted effort to remind the general population about the census, educate those members of the public who do not understand the purpose of the census and its significance to their communities, and motivate them to complete their census questionnaires.
The Census Bureau recognizes that different segments of the population respond in different ways with different levels of trust and willingness to participate in the census.
The Partnership and FY 2001 Annual Performance Plan 75 Economics and Statistics Administration The Bureau of the Census Performance Goal 3: Conduct Accurate, Timely, Relevant, and Cost-effective Decennial Census Marketing Program incorporates five components designed to reach these populations in the manner most appropriate to each.
Together, these components provide many vehicles to reach people many times in the places where they live, work, go to school, and play.
The components of the Partnership and Marketing Program include: 1.
The establishment of partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments; community-based organizations; media and the private sector.
Just as corporations have been developing partnerships with their suppliers and customers to improve their operations, the Census Bureau recognizes the value of local knowledge and has developed partnerships with stakeholders to improve the census.
The goal of the partnership program is to increase the mail response among people who historically have not been persuaded by direct mail, advertising or other methods.
2.
A direct mail campaign designed to draw attention to the census questionnaire when it arrives in people's mailboxes.
3.
A paid advertising campaign to generate awareness about Census 2000 via print, broadcast and outdoor advertising.
For the first time ever, the Census Bureau is using paid advertising to increase participation in the census.
There is a concerted effort in the advertising campaign to reach out to every person living in the United States, Puerto Rico and the island areas.
The ads for television, radio and print have been created in 17 different languages to reach the many non-English speaking communities.
4.
A media relations campaign to encourage positive, informative coverage emphasizing the importance of responding to the census.
5.
Promotions and special events to provide non-threatening, fun, educational activities in communities and schools, particularly in hard-to-enumerate areas.
In addition, the Census Bureau will also implement the Census 2000 language program, which is designed to help raise the response rate among foreign- language-speaking households.
Census forms will be available in five languages other than English: Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.
In addition, language guides will be available in nearly 50 languages, including Spanish.
Respondents can use these guides to assist them in answering the questionnaire that is mailed to them.
The mailing strategy for Census 2000 is composed of three phases: households will receive an advance letter, then the questionnaire, and finally a reminder card.
Upon receipt of the advance letter, the respondent has the option to request a questionnaire in Spanish or one of four other languages, which they can complete in place of the English questionnaire.
The advance letter will include instructions in each of the languages mentioned above.
By checking the appropriate box and returning the advance letter to the National Processing Center in the enclosed self addressed envelope, respondents can expect to receive a questionnaire in the selected language approximately one week later.
If the respondent does not care to return the advance letter requesting a specific language questionnaire within a week of receipt, they can contact a local Questionnaire Assistance Center for a translation guide to assist them in completing the English form.
These guides will be distributed to our local and regional census offices and will be provided to local community groups and organizations by our local partnership specialist.
They also will be available upon request by calling a toll free 1-800 number, which will include Spanish instructions on the automated voice mail menu system.
In addition, the Questionnaire Assistance Centers will include bilingual staff familiar with the communities they serve, and a Census 2000 Language Identification Flashcard will be available to assist these staff members and respondents with identifying which language is spoken in the respondent's household.
The Census Bureau is confident that its language program is the most effective way to ensure that linguistically isolated households receive the assistance they need to be enumerated in Census 2000.
