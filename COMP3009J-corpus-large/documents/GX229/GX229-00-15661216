WEEK OF MAY 26 - 30, 1997 DAIRY MARKET NEWS NATIONAL DAIRY MARKET AT A GLANCE VOLUME 64, REPORT 22 At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Grade AA butter increased 8 cents to $1.1300, Grade A increased 7 cents to $1.0500, and Grade B increased 7 cents to $1.0500.
Also at the CME, barrel cheese decreased 1 cent to $1.1275 and 40# blocks are unchanged at $1.1650.
The USDA has determined that the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) U.S. average 40-lb. block cheddar cheese price is the equivalent price to the National Cheese Exchange (NCE) 40-lb. block cheddar cheese price for use in the pricing provisions in Federal Milk Orders.
The NASS cheese price series will be used to announce the Basic Formula Price (BFP) for May and future months and to derive a protein price and/or milk quality adjustment in 10 Federal orders which contain multiple component pricing plans.
According to ERS and AMS, commercial disappearance of dairy products during the first quarter of 1997 (January - March) totals 38.5 billion pounds, 3.4% more than the comparable period a year ago.
Comparing disappearance levels with the same period a year ago: fluid milk products are down 0.8%, NDM is 1.0% lighter, and butter is 1.4% lower, while American cheese consumption is 6.5% heavier and other cheese is 5.3% greater.
Milk production patterns across the country are now starting to be noticeably influenced by warmer temperatures.
In the south from Florida across the country to Southern California, hot temperatures continue to stress the milking herd, lowering milk output.
Elsewhere in the U.S., temperatures are more favorable and milk production is holding steady at seasonally high levels or continues to build.
The Memorial Day holiday weekend has come and gone and most contacts report milk volumes were heavy, but handled without too much difficulty.
Most of the additional milk was processed by midweek and bottling schedules reverted to pre-holiday levels.
Another factor contributing to surplus milk volumes at this time is the recessing of schools for the summer.
Many schools have already closed, with the balance closing during the next 10 - 14 days.
Diversions of milk to manufacturing plants are heavy and expected to remain so for the near future.
Cream demand remains good, despite the 12 1/2 cent increase in Grade A butter at the CME on May 23.
Some multiples were lowered to keep cream moving.
Demand for soft serve and ice cream mix is improving as resort and vacation areas open for the summer.
Dry dairy product markets are much the same as they have been over the past few weeks.
Nonfat dry milk production was heavy over the Memorial Day weekend and plant stocks are generally heavy.
Again this week, surplus Western NDM was offered to CCC with contacts expecting sales to continue in an effort to clear extra product.
Due to heavy stocks, some producers are lowering prices as a way of keeping powder moving commercially versus government clearances.
Buttermilk powder markets remain weak with prices holding steady to lower.
Demand is mainly limited to contract sales with minimal spot interest noted.
Production levels are increasing.
Whey markets are steady to firm, although prices are higher and lower.
Domestic demand is steady at fair to good levels.
Export interest is rated as quiet and slow.
Exporters are spending more of their time completing shipments of previously sold product than putting together new deals.
During the week of May 26 - 30, CCC purchased 118,938 pounds of nonfortified NDM under the price support program.
Also purchased were 148,800 pounds of process American cheese, the first cheese price support purchase since mid February.

BUTTER HIGHLIGHTS: At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, all prices are sharply higher.
Following the sharp increase in butter prices recorded May 23, the butter industry continues to adjust.
Over the past Memorial Day holiday weekend, churning schedules were heavy thus butter stocks are heavier than current demand is clearing.
Often, producers and handlers are holding additional stocks.
Demand for current needs is fair while more active for late summer and fall needs.
CHEESE HIGHLIGHTS: The cheese market is unsettled.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the 40# block price was unchanged, but barrels declined 1 cent to $1.1275.
Trading was light.
Cheese production was heavy over the long holiday weekend at many locations.
Demand was slow to develop during the holiday abbreviated week.
Most cutter/processors are operating on reduced schedules following the holiday.
Sales continue to lag seasonal levels for many processors.
CCC purchased 148,800 pounds of process cheese under the price support program at $1.1825 per pound from the Midwest, the first cheese support purchase since February.

The market tone is unsettled.
Many industry contacts were again surprised and confused by both the increase and the size of the price jump.
Traditionally, the Memorial Day weekend is one of the heaviest processing weekends of the year for butter/powder plants and contacts wonder why prices should increase prior to a period of heavy manufacturing.
Churning activity is heavy as most Eastern butter makers had plans to run at capacity during the weekend.
Butter stocks range from light to heavy.
There is still evidence of users and traders speculating on butter and buying ahead of anticipated, summer needs.
Contacts believe that all this storing may have an impact on demand and prices later in the year.
April cold storage figures for butter show a 59.1% increase from March 1997 and a 6.7% increase over a year ago.
Retail sales are slow to fair and food service orders are good and starting to settle into summer patterns.

Print orders are strong as buyers place orders before prices have a chance to move higher and to get ready for the summer tourist season.
Demand for bulk is also steady at good levels, ranging from 2-4 cents under.
Even with prices for cream sharply higher, demand is quite good.
The market appears to be getting ready for the summer season with the memory of last year still fresh in peoples' minds.
Contacts have been surprised at the volumes traded at the CME the past few weeks.

Many butter producers and handlers were surprised at the substantial increase in prices going into the Memorial Day holiday weekend when butter production is usually heavy.
As expected, churning activities were heavy and many producers continue to work down heavy holiday cream volumes.
Stocks of bulk and print butter are readily available for current needs.
Buying interest is not aggressive as buyers assess inventories and adjust to the higher prices.
In most instances, producers are holding surplus volumes due to limited buyer interest.

DAIRY MARKET NEWS, MAY 26 - 30, 1997 -3CHEESE MARKETS VOLUME 64, REPORT 22 NORTHEAST WEST Prices and the market tone are unchanged.
Production levels were heavy over the Memorial Day weekend.
Some plants had little room for more milk.
Others, however, had room and were taking milk only if prices were very attractive.
Few cheese makers are fortifying their milk with skim solids.
Plant stocks are generally adequate for current demand.
More cheddar is being put into aging programs.
Demand for cheddar is slow to fair despite upcoming June Dairy Month promotions.
Mozzarella orders are slowing as schools and colleges close for summer recess.
Food service orders are improving as resort restaurants prepare for summer needs.
WHOLESALE SELLING PRICES: DELIVERED, DOLLARS PER POUND (1000 - 5000 POUNDS MIXED LOTS) Extra milk was certainly available over the holiday weekend, but not more than anticipated.
It cleared with relative ease.
No one is anxious to make extra cheese at this time.
Sales activity for barrels, Swiss, and Mozzarella are all slow.
Current blocks are in better shape than blocks that have some age on them.
Buying interest is very spotty, depending on what shape inventories are in.
Most contacts don't believe that there is much chance of firming prices until the milk supply shrinks this summer.

Cheese prices were unchanged at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on May 22.
Current orders are slow to develop after the long Memorial Day weekend as many buyers built extra working inventory prior to the holiday.
Overall, the trend in interest continues to pickup for most processors and packagers, but current sales typically continue to lag year ago volumes.
Most processors/packagers are running on reduced (4 day) schedules this week due to the holiday.
Overtime remains limited.
A few producers are in better position with inventory while others are little changed in the Midwest.
Attractively priced Western cheddar offerings continue to pressure Midwestern premiums.
Aging programs are also being rebuilt at current prices.
Mozzarella sales remain sluggish as sales traditionally slow near the end of the school year.
Cheese production was heavy at many plants over the long holiday weekend as extra fluid backed up from bottling channels.
Spring flush milk receipts are slower to arrive at many northern locations due to continued cool, windy weather.
WISCONSIN WHOLESALE SELLING PRICES: DELIVERED, DOLLARS PER POUND (1000 - 5000 POUNDS MIXED LOTS) Prices are unchanged and the market tone is steady.
Stocks of imported and/or domestically made cheese range from light to adequate for the slow to fair needs.
As of mid-May, the EU canceled the issue of all export licenses (subsidies) for cheese until June 2.
Because of the relatively limited volumes qualified for export refunds under GATT, year-2, the EU suspended all "pre-bookings."
Contacts feel that when reinstated, refunds may only last a short while as importers may apply for more than available quantities remaining under GATT.
The GATT year ends June 30.
Retail sales of foreign type cheese remain slow to fair.

Some distressed loads were moved, but volumes were often below years past.
Milk production is falling in Florida and other Gulf Coast States where hotter weather is starting to take its toll on the cows.
Florida handlers shipped about 50 loads of milk out of state, but shipments were halted at midweek and milk is in good balance.
Bottled milk sales are slow to fair.
Schools are starting to recess for the summer which is going to impact Class I sales and manufacturing schedules.
Farther north, milk output is holding at or just below the seasonal peak.
Bottled milk sales are up slightly from late last week.
In the more northern areas, the milk flow is steady, but contacts are not sure if they have reached the peak.
Cooler than normal weather has retarded grass growth and slowed field work.
Reports state that in New England and parts of New York, this spring has been the coldest and wettest since 1968.
Manufacturing plants were busy over the holiday weekend, but handled the milk without serious problems.
Some distressed milk was moved out of region, but that isn't uncommon for Memorial Day.
The condensed skim market is unsettled.
Prices are steady to lower as buyers expect lower prices following the big jump in butter/fat prices last Friday.
Demand for wet solids is fair, but lower prices may help stimulate interest.
The fluid cream market, despite the big jump in butter prices, is firm.
Cream volumes were long late last week, but are now tight.
Spot prices are sharply higher.
Ice cream production is improved after many operations were down for the long weekend.
Demand for soft serve and ice cream mix is improving as resort area outlets opened for the summer.
With Memorial Day so early, outlets have an extra week of summer this year.
Cream cheese production is still good, but sharply higher cream prices are a deterrent to build much of an inventory.
Churning activity ranges from lighter to moderate and some producers are still looking for more cream to process.

However, over the next few weeks, additional school systems are closing for the summer.
This traditionally causes additional fluid volumes to divert into manufacturing channels.
Manufacturing plants were generally operated on extended schedules to clear offerings.
Increased holiday surplus milk supplies were available over the long weekend into early this week.
Prices were typically lower and a few loads over the past 2 weeks in the region were cleared for less than $10.00 per cwt.
The majority were sold at less than $1.00 under BFP/MCP delivered.
Most milk handlers had prepared contingency plans for moving surplus milk well ahead of the holiday, reducing the volume of last minute "surprises."
Some unexpected disruptions were noted particularly when a large cheese plant had equipment problems for about a day.
Some interregional milk movement occurred, but early reports suggest little change from previous weeks.
Cream prices are sharply higher, reflecting both higher multiples and the 12.5 cents increase in butter prices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on May 23.
Local milk intakes are steady to higher in most northern sections.
Receipts are declining in many southern parts of the region where heat stress is more of a problem.
A few upper Midwestern operations are starting to report local milk receipts finally equal to year ago levels.
In northern tier states, first cutting Pool receipts of milk in California for April total 2.24 billion pounds, up 3.2% from March on a daily average basis and up 12.0% from April 1996.
Receipts for the first four months of 1997 total 8.47 billion pounds, up 8.9% from the comparable period in 1996.
The blend price at a fat test of 3.59% is $12.28.
This is the lowest monthly fat test since August of 1996.
The percentage of receipts used in Class 1 products stands at 20.98%.
This is about half the utilization percentage recorded in April 1984 (41.5%).
The April quota price is $13.30, down 29 cents from the previous month and one cent higher than one year ago.
Base and overbase prices are $11.60, down 29 cents from March.
Milk production patterns are trending lower in the heat of the Southwest.
The continued hot weather is stressing cows and lowering milk output.
California production is lower than peak levels, but noted to be higher than last week following moderating temperatures over the weekend into the early part of this week.
Plant receipts continue to outpace 1996 levels, often by double digit increases.
Feedlot conditions and feed quality remain favorable.
The Memorial Day weekend caused limited disruptions of milk processing, although most plants operated at higher schedules with limited problems noted.
Cream demand remains good, despite the 12 1/2 cent increase for Grade A butter at the CME on May 23.
Some multiples were lowered to keep cream moving.
Sales were good to butter producers in the region and to other areas of the country.
Ice cream interest is picking up.
Additional milk supplies entered manufacturing facilities over the holiday weekend in the Pacific Northwest, but few surprises were noted.
Rain was wide spread in the region over the weekend which helped row crops, but caught many hay growers with their first cutting down in the wind row.
The quality of the hay that has been rained on is being questioned by buyers and a wider spread is developing on pricing.
The hay that was put up in good shape without rain is being rated as excellent.
Heifer markets remain very quiet and slaughter cow markets are lower in price.
More hay is being cut between rain showers in Utah and Idaho.
Quality is rated as generally very good.
Most manufacturing plants were running at capacity levels to clear additional supplies of milk over the holiday weekend.

Holiday milk volumes were not too burdensome and most plants were caught up by midweek.
Plant stocks are very heavy and some producers are lowering offering prices as a way of keeping powder moving.
Demand is, at best, lackluster and one contact termed the NDM market as "stale."
Much of the lower priced powder is for export under DEIP, but regular spot sales are also occurring near the bottom of the Northeast range.

However, the continued sluggish demand and increased cheese production seem to be working against such a strategy.
Dry whey production in the Northeast is heavy as cheese output remains heavy.
Milk volumes are still climbing toward the peak and soon, schools will be out for the summer which will provide additional milk to manufacturing plants.
Most Eastern producers have powder to move and they are trying to keep it clearing.
Export interest is also slow.

The flush season was reported to be strong in the South, resulting in larger shipments of milk to northern manufacturing facilities.
Along with seasonal increases in local milk output, this inflow made more milk available to cheesemakers.
Additionally, Western cheese output continues to rise sharply, even though butter-powder production has had a nominal advantage.
Western cheesemakers have aggressively competed with Midwestern producers for prime cheese customers -- hoping that the long-run gain will outweigh some short-run losses.
This combination of temporarily more milk for cheese making and less active pursuit of Midwestern cheese supplies, may have led traders to underestimate current market tightness.
Also, traders may be paying more attention to conditions for American varieties than to the stronger conditions for other types.
Spring and summer milk supplies should post substantial increases from the very weak levels of a year earlier, although increases will be constrained by feed conditions.
The late spring in many northern areas will add to the problems of the large number of dairy farmers trying to stretch forage stocks until new-crop supplies are available.
Also, the spring milk-feed price ratio is expected to be below 1.5, unfavorable for much increase in concentrate feeding.
However, the relatively high returns of the last 2 years may start to buttress milk cow numbers by summer.
Expected supplies should be absorbed without difficulty.
Continued economic expansion is projected to provide a fairly broad demand base for dairy products during the rest of 1997.
With year-to-year increases in retail dairy prices expected to disappear by late in the year, increases in commercial use are projected to keep pace with production growth.
