13 The United States Flag: Federal Law Relating to Display and Associated Questions Background Public concern and confusion regarding the proper respect shown to the United States flag has given rise to many questions on the law relating to the flag's handling, display, and use.
Both the state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation on this subject.
On the national level the Federal Flag Code1 provides uniform guidelines for the display of and respect shown to the flag.
In addition to the Code, Congress has by statute designated the national anthem and set out the proper conduct during its presentation.2 The Code is designed "for the use of such civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments" of the federal government.3 Thus, the Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include enforcement provisions; rather the Code functions simply as a guide to be voluntarily followed by civilians and civilian groups.
The Federal Flag Code does not purport to cover all possible situations.
Although the Code empowers the President of the United States to alter, modify, repeal, or prescribe additional rules regarding the flag,4 no federal agency has the authority to issue "official" rulings legally binding on civilians or civilian groups.
Consequently, different interpretations of various provisions of the Code may continue to be made.
The Flag Code itself, however, suggests a general rule by which practices involving the flag may be fairly tested: "No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America."5 Therefore, actions not specifically included in the Code may be deemed acceptable as long as proper respect is shown.
In addition to the Flag Code, a separate provision contained in the Federal Criminal Code established criminal penalties for certain treatment of the flag.6 Prior to 1989, this provision provided criminal penalties for certain acts of desecration to 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4-10.

CRS-2 the flag.
In response to the Supreme Court decision in Texas v. Johnson7 (which held that anti-desecration statutes are unconstitutional if aimed at suppressing one type of expression), Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act of 1989 to provide criminal penalties for certain acts which violate the physical integrity of the flag.8 This law imposed a fine and/or up to 1 year in prison for knowingly mutilating, defacing, physically defiling, maintaining on the floor, or trampling upon any flag of the United States.
In 1990, however, the Supreme Court held that the Flag Protection Act was unconstitutional as applied to a burning of the flag in a public protest.9 All the states, at one time or another, have enacted laws relating to the United States flag.10 Even though the Federal Flag Code does not provide penalties for certain conduct or may not govern certain practices, state law may do so.
Therefore, it is advisable to consider applicable provisions of state law, as well as federal law, on questions of proper use of the flag.
The Flag Code--History and Text On June 22, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved House Joint Resolution 303 codifying the existing customs and rules governing the display and use of the flag of the United States by civilians.11 Amendments were approved on December 22nd of that year.12 The law included provisions of the code adopted by the National Flag Conference, held in Washington, D.C. on June 14, 1923, with certain amendments and additions.
The Code was reenacted, with minor amendments, as part of the Bicentennial celebration.13 In the 105th Congress, the Flag Code was removed from title 36 of the United States Code and recodified as part of title 4.14 7 491 U.S. 397 (1989).

Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag; Manner of Delivery.
The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all," should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart.
When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.
Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.

Display and Use of Flag by Civilians; Codification of Rules and Customs; Definition.
The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America is established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments of the Government of the United States.
The flag of the United States for the purpose of this chapter shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of Title 4 and Executive Order 10834 issued pursuant thereto.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6.
Time and Occasions for Display.

The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
The flag should never be displayed with union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.
There are eight sites in the United States where the flag is flown day and night under specific legal authority: Fort McHenry National Monument, Baltimore, Maryland;21 Flag House Square, Baltimore, Maryland;22 the United States Marine Corps Iwo Jima Memorial, Arlington, Virginia;23 Lexington, Massachusetts;24 the White House;25 the Washington Monument;26 United States Customs ports of entry;27 and Valley Forge State Park, Pennsylvania

However, since the section speaks in terms of "days when the weather is inclement," it apparently does not contemplate that on an otherwise fair day, the flag should be lowered during brief periods of precipitation.
Flying the Flag at Half-Staff The Flag Code sets out detailed instruct ions on flying the flag at half-staff on Memorial Day and as a mark of respect to the memory of certain recently deceased public officials.30 This section embodies the substance of Presidential Proclamation No. 3044, 31entitled "Display of Flag at Half-Staff Upon Death of Certain Officials and Former Officials."
The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution.
The flag should be displayed in or near every polling place on election days.

No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or international flag equal, above, or in a position of superior prominence or honor to or in place of the flag of the United States or any Territory or possession thereof: Provided, That nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of the practice heretofore followed of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United States at the headquarters of the United Nations.
The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.
The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
When flags of States, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak.
When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last.
No such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States flag's right.

When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half-staff.
When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the building.
When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.
When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.
When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east and west street or to the east in a north and south street.

By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a state, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory.
In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law.
In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that State, territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at halfstaff.
The flag shall be flown at half-staff thirty days from the death of the President or a former President; ten days from the day of death of the VicePresident, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice-President, or the Governor of a state, CRS-6 territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.
The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day.
As used in this subsection--(1) The term "half-staff" means the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff; (2) the term "executive or military department" means any agency listed under Sections 101 and 102 of Title 5, United States Code; and (3) the term "Member of Congress" means a Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico.
When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder.

When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon entering.
If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south.
If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the east.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 8.

Frequently Asked Questions on Flag Display, Use, and Associated Matters Pledge of Allegiance The Pledge of Allegiance is set forth in 4 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4.
In 1954, Congress added to the "Pledge of Allegiance" the phrase "under God" after "nation".16 Questions about the "Pledge of Allegiance" usually involve practices and requirements of local and state statutes mandating participation in the recitation of the "Pledge" in some manner (e.g., flag salute and pledge, standing quietly, standing at attention) in schools.
Provisions involving compulsory participation in "Pledge" activities are usually attacked as violations of the free speech clause of the First Amendment or the free exercise of religion clause.
In 1943, the Supreme Court held that a state-required compulsory flag salute-Pledge of Allegiance violated the First Amendment rights of members of the Jehovah's Witnesses religious group.17 Nature of Codification of Customs and Rules The Flag Code is a codification of customs and rules established for the use of certain civilians and civilian groups.
No penalty or punishment is specified in the Flag Code for display of the flag of the United States in a manner other than as suggested.
Cases which have construed the former 36 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 17518 have concluded that the Flag Code does not proscribe conduct, but is merely declaratory and advisory.19 16 P.L. 396, 83rd Cong., 68 Stat. 249.

CRS-9 Display of the Flag 24 Hours a Day There is no absolute prohibition in federal law on flying the flag twenty-four hours a day.
The Flag Code states:
It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open.
However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during hours of darkness
There are eight sites in the United States where the flag is flown day and night under specific legal authority: Fort McHenry National Monument, Baltimore, Maryland;21 Flag House Square, Baltimore, Maryland;22 the United States Marine Corps Iwo Jima Memorial, Arlington, Virginia;23 Lexington, Massachusetts;24 the White House;25 the Washington Monument;26 United States Customs ports of entry;27 and Valley Forge State Park, Pennsylvania
.28 The reports that accompanied these official acts indicate that the specific authority was intended only as a form of tribute to certain historic sites rather than as exceptions to the general rule of the Code.
As a matter of custom, and without specific statutory or official authorization, the flag is flown at night at many other sites, including the United States Capitol.
It would seem that display of the flag in a respectful manner with appropriate lighting does not violate the spirit of the Flag Code since the dignity accorded to the flag is preserved by lighting that prevents its being enveloped in darkness.
Flying the Flag During Inclement Weather The Flag Code states:
The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all weather flag is displayed
.29 The language of this section reflects the now-popular use of flags made of synthetic fabrics that can withstand unfavorable weather conditions.

Flying the Flag at Half-Staff The Flag Code sets out detailed instruct ions on flying the flag at half-staff on Memorial Day and as a mark of respect to the memory of certain recently deceased public officials.30 This section embodies the substance of Presidential Proclamation No. 3044, 31entitled "Display of Flag at Half-Staff Upon Death of Certain Officials and Former Officials."
The section provides that the President shall order the flag flown at half-staff for stipulated periods "upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a state, territory, or possession."
After the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag may be flown at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or in accordance with recognized custom not inconsistent with law.
In addition the Governor of a state, territory, or possession may direct that the national flag be flown at half-staff, territory, or possession may direct that the national flag be flown at half-staff in the event of the death of a present or former official of the respective government.
Presidents also have ordered the fly to be flown at half-staff on the death of leading citizens, not covered by law, as a mark of official tribute to their service to the United States.
Martin Luther King, Jr. is among those who have been so honored.
Again, the provisions of the Flag Code on flying the flag at half-staff are, like all the Code's provisions, a guide only.
They do not apply, as a matter of law, to the display of the flag at half-staff by private individuals and organizations.
No federal restrictions or court decisions are known that limit such an individual's lowering his own flag or that make such display alone a form of desecration.Ornaments on Flag Staffs, Fringes on Flag The Flag Code is silent as to ornaments (finials) for flagstaffs.
We know of no law or regulation which restricts the use of a finial on the staff.
The eagle finial is used not only by the President, the Vice-President, and many other federal agencies, but also by many civilian organizations and private citizens.
The selection of the type finial used is a matter of preference of the individual or organization.
The placing of a fringe on the flag is optional with the person or organization, and no Act of Congress or Executive Order either requires or prohibits the practice.
Fringe is used on indoor flags only, as fringe on flags used outdoors would deteriorate 30 31 4 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 7(m).

The fringe on a flag is considered an "honorable enrichment only" and its official use by the Army dates from 1895.
A 1925 Attorney General's Opinion states: The fringe does not appear to be regarded as an integral part of the flag, and its presence cannot be said to constitute an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by statute.
An external fringe is to be distinguished from letters, words, or emblematic designs printed or superimposed upon the body of the flag itself.
Under the law, such additions might be open to objection as unauthorized; but the same is not necessarily true of the fringe.32 Destruction of Worn Flags The Flag Code states: The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.33 The Act is silent on procedures for burning a flag.
It would seem that any procedure which is in good taste and shows no disrespect to the flag would be appropriate.
The Flag Protection Act of 1989,34 struck down albeit on grounds unrelated to this specific point,35 prohibited inter alia "knowingly" burning of a flag of the United States, but excepted from prohibition "any conduct consisting of disposal of a flag when it has become worn or soiled."
Display of United States Flag with Flags of Other Nations or of States The Flag Code provides rules on the position that the national flag should occupy when displayed with other flags.36
In short, the rule is the flag of the United States should always be displayed with utmost dignity and respect and in the position of highest honor.
To this end, the Code lists several illustrative ways in which the flag may be displayed with other flags.
No flag other than a church flag during services at sea should be displayed above the United States flag.
If all flags are displayed at the same height, the United States flag is to be given a place of superior prominence, to the right of other flags.37 This provision does not require the federal flag to be flown higher than any other flag so long as no flag is above it, but does require it to be flown to the right of all other flags if it is not above them

CRS-12 By international custom, flags of all nations are to be flown at the same height when displayed together; therefore, the part of this provision dealing with the display of flags at the same height is designed to comply with the respect to be accorded all nations when the United States flag is displayed with flags of other nations.
An exception is made for display of the United States flag at U.N. Headquarters.
At that site, the United Nations flag may be displayed at a position of superior prominence.38 The flags of different nations should be of approximately equal size.39
When the United States flag is displayed with the flags of states of the union or municipalities and not with the flags of other nations, the federal flag, which represents all states, should be flown above and at the center of the other flags.40 Where there is only one flag pole, the federal flag should be displayed above state or municipal flags
.41 Use of the Flag in Jewelry, Commercial Products, Wearing Apparel, and Advertising The Flag Code addresses the impropriety of using the flag as an article of personal adornment, a design on items of temporary use, and item of clothing.42 The evident purpose of these suggested restraints is to limit the commercial or common usage of the flag and, thus, maintain its dignity.
The 1976 amendments to the Code recognized the wearing of a flag patch or pin on the left side (near the heart) of uniforms of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations.43
The Code also states that the flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever
.While wearing the colors may be in poor taste and offensive to many, it is important to remember that the Flag Code is intended as a guide to be followed on a purely voluntary basis to insure proper respect for the flag.
It is, at least, questionable whether statutes placing civil or criminal penalties on the wearing of clothing bearing or resembling a flag could be constitutionally enforced in light of Supreme Court decisions in the area of flag desecration.45 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Id. 4 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 7(g).

CRS-13 In the past, the Supreme Court has held that states may restrict use of pictures of the flag on commercial products.46 There is a federal criminal prohibition on the use of the flag for advertising purposes in the District of Columbia.47 While commercial speech does not receive the full protection of the First Amendment,48 the status of these statutes and cases can not be taken for granted in light of Eichman and Johnson.
Restrictions on Size and Proportions of the Flag Questions on size and dimensions usually arise in the context of the display of huge flags.
The Flag Code is silent on recommendations for proper flag size and dimensions.
Regulations governing size and dimensions and other requirements for flags authorized for federal executive agencies can be found in Executive Order No. 10834.49 These regulations provide that the length of the flag should be 1.9 times the width.
