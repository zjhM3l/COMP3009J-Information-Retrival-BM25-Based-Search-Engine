A Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance Executive Summary This Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance (Action Plan) was developed by an interagency Task Force on Ant imicrobial Resistance that was created in 1999.
The Task Force is co- chaired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health and also includes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Health Care Financing Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Action Plan reflects a broad- based consensus of federal agencies on actions needed to address antimicrobiala resistance (AR).
Input from state and local health agencies, universities, professional societies, pharmaceutical companies, health care delivery organizations, agricultural producers, consumer groups, and other members of the public was important in developing the plan.
While some actions are already underway, complete implementation of this plan will require close collaboration with all of these partners,b a major objective of the process.
The plan will be implemented incrementally, dependent on the availability of resources.
The Action Plan provides a blueprint for specific, coordinated federal actions to address the emerging threat of antimicrobial resistance.
This document is Part I of the Action Plan, focusing on domestic issues.
Since AR transcends national borders and requires a global approach to its prevention and control, Part II of the plan, to be developed subsequently, will identify actions that more specifically address international issues.
The Action Plan, Part I (Domestic Issues), includes four focus areas: Surveillance, Prevention and Control, Research, and Product Development.
A summary of the top priority goals and action items in each focus area follows.
Surveillance Unless AR problems are detected as they emerge Â­ and actions are taken quickly to contain them Â­ the In this document, the term "antimicrobial" is used inclusively to refer to any agent (including an antibiotic) used to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.)
This term applies whether the agent is intended for human, veterinary or agricultural applications.
a
Implementation of this Action Plan requires working with a wide variety of partners, e.g. state and local health agencies, universities, professional societies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health care delivery organizations, insurers, agricultural producers, consumer groups, and the public.
A wide variety of expertise is needed, e.g., from clinicians, consumers, pharmacists, microbiologists, epidemiologists, behavioral and social scientists, economists, health policy researchers, and others.
Partners and expertise needed will vary with different action items.

world may soon be faced with previously treatable diseases that have again become untreatable, as in the pre- antibiotic era.
Priority Goals and Action Items in this focus area address ways to: Â· Â· Â· Â· Develop and implement a coordinated national plan for AR surveillance; Ensure the availability of reliable drug susceptibility data for surveillance; Monitor patterns of antimicrobial drug use; and Monitor AR in agricultural settings to protect the public's health by ensuring a safe food supply as well as animal and plant health.
A coordinated national surveillance plan for monitoring AR in microorganisms that pose a threat to public health will be developed and implemented.
The plan will specify activities to be conducted at national, state, and local levels; define the roles of participants; promote the use of standardized methods; and provide for timely dissemination of data to interested parties, e.g., public health officials, clinicians, and researchers.
Needed core capacities at state and local levels will be defined and supported.
When possible, the plan will coordinate, integrate, and build on existing disease surveillance infrastructure.
All surveillance activities will be conducted with respect for patient and institutional confidentiality.
The availability of reliable drug susceptibility data is essential for AR surveillance.
The accuracy of AR detection and reporting will be improved through training and proficiency testing programs for diagnostic laboratories and by promoting and further refining standardized methods for detecting drug resistance in important pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses.
Public and private sector partners will address barriers to AR testing and reporting, e.g., barriers due to changes in health care delivery.
A plan to monitor patterns of antimicrobial drug use will be developed and implemented as an important component of the national AR surveillance plan.
This information is essential to interpret trends and variations in rates of AR, improve our understanding of the relationship between drug use and resistance, identify and anticipate gaps in availability of existing drugs, and identify interventions to prevent and control AR. Improved surveillance for AR in agricultural settings will allow early detection of resistance trends in pathogens that pose a risk to animal and plant health, as well as in bacteria that enter the food supply.
Agricultural surveillance data will also help improve understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial drug and pesticide use and the emergence of drug resistance.
Prevention and Control The prevention and control of drug- resistant infections requires measures to promote the appropriate usec of antimicrobial drugs and prevent the transmission of infections (whether drug- resistant or not). c
In this Action Plan, appropriate antimicrobial drug use is defined as use that maximizes therapeutic 3
Priority Goals and Action Items in this focus area address ways to: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Extend the useful life of antimicrobial drugs through appropriate use policies that discourage overuse and misuse; Improve diagnostic testing practices; Prevent infection transmission through improved infection control methods and use of vaccines; Prevent and control emerging AR problems in agriculture, human and veterinary medicine; and Ensure that comprehensive programs to prevent and control AR involve a wide variety of nonfederal partners and the public so these programs become a part of routine practice nationwide.
Appropriate drug-use policies will be implemented through a public health education campaign on appropriate antimicrobial drug use as a national health priority.
Other actions in support of appropriate drug use will include reducing inappropriate prescribing through development of clinical guidelines and computer- assisted decision support, considering regulatory changes, supporting other interventions promoting education and behavior change among clinicians, and informing consumers about the uses and limitations of antimicrobial drugs.
Improved diagnostic practices will be promoted by encouraging the use of rapid diagnostic methods to guide drug prescribing, facilitating direct consultation between clinicians and laboratory personnel with appropriate expertis e and authority, and promoting the use of appropriate laboratory testing methods.
Guidelines, training, and regulatory and reimbursement policies will be utilized to promote improved diagnostic practices.
Reduced rates of infection transmission will be addressed through public health campaigns that promote vaccination and hygienic practices such as hand washing, safe food handling, and other behaviors associated with prevention of infection transmission.
Infection control in health care settings will be enhanced by developing new interventions based on rapid diagnosis, improved understanding of the factors that promote cross- infection, and modified medical devices or procedures that reduce the risk of infection.
The prevention and control of AR in agriculture and veterinary medicine requires 1) improved understanding of the risks and benefits of antimicrobial use and ways to prevent the emergence and spread of resistance; 2) development and implementation of principles for appropriate antimicrobial drug use in the production of food animals and plants; 3) improved animal husbandry and foodproduction practices to reduce the spread of infection; and 4) a regulatory framework to address the need for antimicrobial drug use in agriculture and veterinary medicine while ensuring that such use does not pose a risk to human health.
impact while minimizing toxicity and the development of resistance.
In practice, this means prescribing antimicrobial therapy when and only when beneficial to a patient; targeting therapy to the desired pathogens; and using the appropriate drug, dose, and duration.
4
Comprehensive, multifaceted programs involving a wide variety of nonfederal partners and the public are required to prevent and control AR.
The AR Task Force agencies will ensure ongoing input from, review by, and collaboration with nonfederal partners.
The appropriate agencies will support demonstration projects that use multiple interventions to prevent and control AR (e.g., through surveillance, appropriate drug use, optimized diagnostic testing, immunization practice, and infection control).
The Task Force agencies will encourage the incorporation of effective programs into routine practice by implementing model programs in federal health care systems and promoting the inclusion of AR prevention and control activities as part of quality assurance and accreditation standards for health care delivery nationwide.
Research Understanding the fundamental processes involved in antimicrobial resistance within microbes and the resulting impact on humans, animals, and the environment forms an important basis for influencing and changing these processes and outcomes.
Basic and clinical research provides the fundamental knowledge necessary to develop appropriate responses to antimicrobial resistance emerging and spreading in hospitals, communities, farms, and the food supply.
Priority Goals and Action Items in this focus area address ways to: Â· Â· Â· Increase understanding of microbial physiology, ecology, genetics and mechanisms of resistance; Augment the existing research infrastructure to support a critical mass of researchers in AR and related fields; and Translate research findings into clinically useful products, such as novel approaches to detecting, preventing, and treating antimicrobial resistant infections.
Needs in the field of AR research will be identified and addressed through a government- wide program review with external input.
Additional research is needed, for example, on the epidemiology of resistance genes; on mechanisms of AR emergence, acquisition, spread, and persistence; and on the effects of antibiotics used as agricultural growth promotants on microbes that live in animals, humans, plants, soil and water.
Further study is also required to determine whether variations in drug use regimens may stimulate or reduce AR emergence and spread.
Improved understanding of the causes of AR emergence will lead to the development of tools for reducing microbial resistance, as well as for predicting where AR problems are likely to arise.
A comprehensive research infrastructure will help ensure a critical mass of AR researchers who will interact, exchange information, and stimulate new discoveries.
This aim will be achieved through the appropriate strategies and scientific conferences tha t promote research on AR.
The AR Task Force agencies will work with the academic and industrial research communities to attract AR researchers, prioritize needs, identify key opportunities, and optimize the utilization of resources to address AR problems.

The translation of research findings into innovative clinical products to treat, prevent, or diagnose drug- resistant infections is an area in which the federal government can play an important role, focusing on gaps not filled by the pharmaceutical industry or by other nongovernment groups.
Special efforts will be placed on the identification, development and testing of rapid, inexpensive, point- of- care diagnostic methods to facilitate appropriate use of antimicrobials.
The AR Task Force agencies will also encourage basic research and clinical testing of diagnostic methods, novel treatment approaches, new vaccines, and other prevention approaches for resistant infections.
Product Development As antimicrobial drugs lose their effectiveness, new products must be developed to prevent, rapidly diagnose, and treat infections.
The Priority Goals and Action Items in this focus area address ways to: Â· Ensure that researchers and drug manufacturers are informed of current and projected gaps in the arsenal of antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics and of potential markets for these products (designated here as "AR products"); Stimulate the development of priority AR products for which market incentives are inadequate, while fostering their appropriate use; and Optimize the development and use of veterinary drugs and related agricultural products that reduce the transfer of resistance to pathogens that can infect humans.
Â· Â·
Current and projected gaps in the arsenal of AR products and potential markets for these products will be reported to researchers and drug manufacturers through an interagency working group convened to identify and publicize priority public health needs.
The development of urgently needed AR products will be stimulated throughout the process from drug discovery through licensing.
The regulatory process for AR products will continue to be streamlined, and incentives that promote the production and appropriate use of priority AR products can be evaluated in pilot programs that monitor costs and assess the return on the public investment.
The production of veterinary AR products that reduce the risk of development and transfer of resistance to drugs used in human clinical medicine will be expedited through a streamlined regulatory and approva l process.
As with drugs for the treatment of human infections, pilot programs can be initiated to evaluate incentives that encourage the development and appropriate use of priority products that meet critical animal and plant health needs.
Private and public partners will also evaluate ways to improve or reduce the agricultural use of particular antimicrobial drugs, as well as ways to prevent infection, such as the use of veterinary vaccines, changes in animal husbandry, and the use of competitive exclusion products (i.e., treatments that affect the intestinal flora of food animals).

Introduction and Overview Background In the 1940s, the widespread availability of penicillin and the subsequent discovery of streptomycin led to a dramatic reduction in illness and death from infectious diseases.
However, bacteria and other disease- causing organisms Â­ viruses, fungi, and parasites Â­ have a remarkable ability to mutate and acquire resistance genes from other organisms and thereby deve lop resistance to antimicrobial drugs.
When an antimicrobial drug is used, the selective pressure exerted by the drug favors the growth of organisms that are resistant to the drug's action.
The extensive use of antimicrobial drugs has resulted in drug resistance that threatens to reverse the miracles of the last half century.
Drug- resistant pathogens are a growing menace to all people, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic background.
They endanger people in affluent, industrial societies like the United States, as well as in less developed nations.
Examples of clinically important microbes that are rapidly developing resistance to available antimicrobials include bacteria that cause pneumonia, ear infections, and meningitis (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae1), skin, bone, lung, and bloodstream infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus2,3), urinary tract infections (e.g., Escherichia coli4), foodborne infections (e.g., Salmonella5), and infections transmitted in health care settings (e.g., enterococci6 and Klebsiella spp.7).
For example, up to 30 percent of S. pneumoniae found in some areas of the United States are no longer susceptible to penicillin, and multidrug resistance is common.
Approximately 11 percent of S. pneumoniae are resistant to "third generation" cephalosporin antibiotics, and resistance to the newest fluoroquinolone antimicrobials has already been reported.8 Nearly all strains of Staphylococcus aureus in the United States are resistant to penicillin, and many are resistant to newer methicillin- related drugs.2 Since 1997, strains of S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin, for many years the only uniformly effective treatment, have been reported.9,10 Many other pathogens Â­ including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis11 and gonorrhea,12 human immunodeficiency virus,13 the fungi that cause yeast infections,14 and the parasites that cause malaria 15 Â­ are also becoming resistant to standard therapies.
If we do not act to address the problem of AR, we may lose quick and reliable treatment of infections that have been a manageable problem in the United States since the 1940s.
Drug choices for the treatment of common infections will become increasingly limited and expensive Â­ and, in some cases, nonexistent.
Risk While anyone may acquire a drug- resistant infection, certain people are at increased risk, e.g., patients in hospitals and children in daycare centers.
Drug- resistant infections may be acquired in health care settings (e.g., staphylococcal infections in intensive care units), in the community (e.g. pneumococci acquired from a classmate) and through the food supply (e.g., salmonella acquired from meat or eggs), both domestically and overseas.
However, resistant microbes are increasingly appearing in new settings.
Methicillin- resistant S. aureus, which for 30 years with few exceptions was a problem only in 9
hospitals, is now occurring in the community.
3,16
Costs The costs of treating AR infections place a significant burden on society Â­ a burden that is likely to grow larger as the number of cases of drug- resistant illness increase.
Individuals infected with drug resistant organisms are more likely to require hospitalization, to remain in the hospital for a longer time, and to have a poor prognosis.
For example, it has been estimated that the in- hospital cost of hospital- acquired infections caused by just six common kinds of resistant bacteria are at least $1.3 billion per year, in 1992 dollars.17 This estimate does not include the costs of infections caused by other pathogens, the costs of lost workdays, post- hospital care, or resistant infections in the outpatient or extended care facility settings.
Solutions AR will always be with us.
The challenge before us is to transform this increasingly urgent threat into a manageable problem.
Over the past ten years, the Institute of Medicine,18 the American Society for Microbiology,19 World Health Organization20 other panels of distinguished experts, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment,17 and the General Accounting Office 21, 22 have provided recommendations and options for government action to address the dangers posed by AR.
The experts agree that we need to improve surveillance for emerging AR problems, to prolong the useful life of antimicrobial drugs, to develop new drugs, and to utilize other measures, e.g., improved vaccines, diagnostics, and infection control measures to prevent and control AR. Despite the urgency of the problem, the achievement of these goals has not been simple or straightforward, and accomplishments to date have been insufficient.
Monitoring, preventing, and controlling AR requires sustained effort, commitment, and collaboration among many groups in the public and private sectors, and involvement of the general public.
It also requires support and leadership from the federal government and a willingness to address complex and sometimes controversial scientific, medical, and economic issues.
A Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance A Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance provides a blueprint for specific, coordinated federal government actions to address this emerging threat.
The plan builds upon reports prepared by expert panels in recent years.
This document is Part I of the plan, fo cusing on domestic issues.
However, AR transcends national borders and requires a global approach to its prevention and control.
Part II of the plan, to be developed after the World Health Organization finalizes its Global Strategy for the Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance,23 will identify federal actions that more specifically address international issues with input from and in collaboration with WHO and additional partners.
A National Action Plan to Combat Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis has been published previously.24 Plan Development 10
This plan was developed by an Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance that was created in 1999.
The Task Force is co- chaired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also includes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The plan is based in part on input obtained at a public meeting held in Atlanta, Georgia, in July 1999.25 Present at the public meeting were consultants from a wide variety of groups, including state and local health agencies, universities, professional societies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health care delivery organizations, agricultural producers, consumer groups, and the public.
A draft of the plan was released for public comment in June 2000, 26 and the plan was modified following consideration of comments received.
Partnerships, Implementation, and Coordination The plan reflects a broadly- based consensus of federal agencies on federal actions to combat AR.
However, implementation of this plan will require collaboration with many partners.b More specific details of these collaborations will be developed by the agencies as the actions are implemented.
The plan will be implemented incrementally as resources become available.
The agencies recognize that a number of the items may require either new statutory authority or changes in regulatory requirements.
The extent to which such measures may be needed to implement a given action item will be considered by the agencies involved.
The plan includes a summary and a list of issues, goals, and action items addressing surveillance, prevention and control, research, and product development.d For each action item, coordinator and collaborator agencies/departments are specified.
Contingent on available resources, the coordinators will assume the primary responsibility of carrying out the specified action items and the collaborators will assist and/or carry out part of the specified action.
Additional agencies may become collaborators in the future.
The Task Force identified 13 top priority action items.
Approximate timelines were also identified for all action items; these timelines provide another indication of priority but also take into account prerequisites for certain items and the achievable pace of action on sometimes complex issues.
Designation of top priorities and timelines was a difficult task given the realization that many items could be considered top priority and should ideally begin immediately.
For action items with multiple Except where specified, these issues, goals, and action items apply to human AR issues and not to nonhuman (e.g., agricultural) issues.
Agricultural issues refer to the production of animals and plants, as well as fish and other species (aquaculture). d
11
component parts, the agencies involved will further develop priorities and timelines, with appropriate input from outside partners, as they implement the action item.
The Interagency Task Force will continue to facilitate coordination among agencies and monitor implementation of the plan.
During the coming years, the Task Force will publish periodic reports detailing how the plan is being implemented, solicit comments from the public, Â­ and if necessary, update the plan.
Details of current agency activities regarding AR are beyond the scope of this document, but may be obtained by contacting the specific agencies.

The Focus Areas I. Surveillance Surveillance of AR is critical to providing early warning of emerging problems, monitoring changing patterns of resistance, and targeting and evaluating prevention and control measures.e Timely surveillance information is also necessary for assisting researchers in developing new drugs and for providing good patient care.
For example, clinicians should be informed of drug resistance problems in their communities that may influence their prescribing decisions in order to help them avoid treatment failures.
In addition, monitoring patterns of antimicrobial drug use is needed to interpret trends and variations in rates of AR, improve understanding of the relationship between drug use and resistance, identify and anticipate gaps in availability of existing drugs, and help identify preventive interventions.
At present, the United States lacks a coordinated national plan for AR surveillance.
Creating a national plan requires collaboration with partners in the public and private sectors.
Improved AR surveillance depends on enhancing epidemiologic and laboratory capabilities at local, state, and national levels; using standardized and reliable laboratory testing methods; and enhancing use of informatics.
A. Issue: The United States lacks a coordinated national plan for surveillance of: Â· AR emergence in organism- drug combinations of public health importance and Â· Antimicrobial drug use in human and nonhuman settings.

Desirable qualities of any system include simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity, and representativeness.
A surveillance system also includes the timely dissemination of these data to persons who can undertake effective prevention and control activities, including clinicians, researchers, laboratorians, and public health personnel.

facilitate surveillance for antimicrobial resistance at all levels.
Coordinator: CDC; Collaborators: HCFA, DVA, DoD, HRSA Develop standards for reporting quantitative resistance data (e.g., minimal inhibitory concentrations or zone diameters) in ways that will detect decreased susceptibility.
These standards are necessary because numerical AR test results reported nonquantitatively (e.g., as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) as "susceptible" may mask an emerging AR problem, i.e, microbes with a small decrease in susceptibility may still be classified as susceptible.
Coordinators: CDC, USDA, FDA Assess how current policies on maintaining the confidentiality of medical and veterinary data collected for other purposes relate to procedures for gathering data on antimicrobial resistance.
If necessary, develop a comprehensive national confidentiality policy on human and agricultural AR surveillance that includes both patient and institutional confidentiality, is consistent with confidentiality policies applied to other forms of surveillance and research data, and recognizes the differences in human and animal medicine and food production surveillance programs.

Prevention and Control Prevention and control of drug- resistant infections require measures to promote the appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs and prevent infection transmission.
The concept of appropriate use may be expressed in various other ways, e.g., good antimicrobial stewardship or judicious, prudent, or rational use.
In this Action Plan, appropriate antimicrobial drug use is defined as use that maximizes therapeutic impact while minimizing toxicity and the development of resistance.
In practice, this means prescribing antimicrobial therapy when and only when beneficial to a patient; targeting therapy to the desired pathogens; and using the appropriate drug, dose, and duration.
Appropriate antimicrobial drug use should not be interpreted simply as reduced use because these drugs offer valuable benefits when used appropriately.
It is overuse and misuse that must be decreased to reduce the selective pressure favoring the spread of resistance.
Appropriate use can be facilitated in various ways, e.g., by promoting informed prescribing by clinicians, informing consumers about the proper use and limitations of antimicrobial drugs, and improving diagnostic techniques.
The challenge facing public health organizations is to work with partners to identify effective methods of promoting appropriate antimicrobial drug use and to translate these interventions into routine medical practice.
Measures to prevent infection transmission, whether drug- resistant or not, are also very important in controlling AR.
These measures include the appropriate use of vaccines and infection control, sanitation, hygiene measures, and other safe behaviors, e.g., safe sexual practices.
Efforts to control drug- resistant infections must become part of everyday practice in health care settings across the nation, as well as in other settings (e.g., agriculture and veterinary medicine) in which antimicrobial drugs are used.
Partners in many sectors of society and the general public will need to be involved in this effort.
A. Issue: Appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs can offer great benefits to patients, but overuse and misuse of these drugs can hasten the development of resistance and shorten the drug's useful life.

Research Antimicrobial resistance is among the most challenging problems in microbiology, clinical medicine, and public health.
Antimicrobial resistance is not one problem, but an overarching term for an array of problems inherent in the evolution of microbes and influenced by antimicrobial use.
Basic and clinical research provides the fundamental knowledge necessary to develop appropriate responses to antimicrobial resistance emerging and spreading in hospitals, communities, farms, and the food supply.
Major scientific accomplishments throughout the years have contributed much to the understanding of the fundamental biological processes of AR within microbes and the resulting impact on humans, animals, and the environment.
This knowledge base provides us the opportunity to influence these processes and outcomes.
Because of its broad scope, the U.S. research community has a major contribution to make in meeting the goals the AR Task Force has set forth.
The research and development of diagnostic tests, new antimicrobial agents, novel therapeutic products, and vaccines and other preventive approaches in response to AR is a multistep process that begins with basic research discoveries and ends with the availability and use of a new product or implementation of a process.
Along this pathway three areas need to be addressed: the identification of gaps and needs in the molecular and cellular understanding of resistance, the infrastructure to support a robust research community, and a means for moving research findings into the development of new products.
The Interagency Task Force has worked with representatives from the public and private sector to 32
identify important research needs in microbial physiology, ecology, genetics and mechanisms of resistance.
Existing gaps in knowledge and understanding should be addressed to augment the federal and private sector response to the overall problem.
Efforts are underway to build and enhance the field of AR research, through increased focus, recognition, and collaboration.
The aim is to develop a research infrastructure to support a critical mass of AR researchers who will interact, exchange information, and stimulate new discoveries.
In order to move novel ideas arising in the research laboratory to useful products or approaches, support of the underlying infrastructure to study and test products and a mechanism to transition to industrial partners is necessary.
This effort will involve federal agencies that conduct, support and promote basic and clinical research in academia and industry and will involve prioritizing needs, identifying key opportunities, recruiting new investigators to the field, and making responsible use of resources to address AR problems.
A. Issue: Specific scientific gaps remain in the understanding of microbial physiology, ecology, genetics and mechanisms of resistance.
1.Goal: Identify gaps and address existing research needs and identify new ones. a.

IV.
Product Development New products are not being developed rapidly enough to address increasing microbial resistance.
Needed products include not only new classes of antimicrobials able to kill otherwise resistant organisms, but also vaccines and anti- infective devices with the potential to prevent infections as well as improved diagnostic tools to aid in appropriate use of therapeutics.
With respect to antimicrobial drugs, each new agent represents a major investment by a pharmaceutical company, which must shepherd the product through pre- clinical studies and clinical testing, followed by large and expensive clinical trials.
Pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest extensive resources in the development of drugs, such as those antimicrobials targeted to resistant organisms, which are often given for short time periods to small numbers of patients.
Manufacturers are similarly concerned that appropriate use policies may limit sales and profits.
On the other hand, when a drug is used widely, allowing recovery of costs and profitability, resistance may develop more rapidly and shorten the useful life of the drug.
Due to these economic realities Â­ as well as to scientific limitations and a lag in the perception of a need for new agents Â­ very few novel antimicrobial drugs have reached the market for several years.
A major aim of this interagency effort is to work with the private sector to explore and test innovative ways to address these issues.
Approaches to be considered include providing incentives (and overcoming disincentives) to promote and assist the development of important products to address AR. Product development is also a very important issue for veterinary medicine and agriculture.
U.S. agencies and private sector partners must intensify efforts to encourage the development and use of veterinary drugs and agricultural practices that are unlikely to stimulate resistance to important human drugs or spread resistant pathogens to humans.
Again, increased attention also needs to be turned to strategies to prevent infections of animals (e.g., vaccines, changes in husbandry) and to the improved use of existing and new products.
A. Issue: Researchers and drug manufacturers need to be better informed of current and projected gaps in the arsenal of antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics and of potential markets for these products.
1.
Goal: Provide a systematic assessment of the current status and projected future needs for AR products.
37
a.
Action Item (79) TOP PRIORITY ACTION ITEM - Create an Interagency AR Product Development Working Group to identify and publicize priority public health needs in human and animal medicine for new AR products (e.g., innovative drugs, targeted spectrum antibiotics, point- of- care diagnostics, vaccines and other biologics, antiinfective medical devices, and disinfectants).
The Working Group will take these steps: Â· Obtain input from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, physicians, epidemiologists, and microbiologists, on which products are needed; Â· Involve experts in the nonmedical disciplines (e.g., engineering and remote sensing, etc.); Â· Model future resistance trends, product needs, and potential markets (particularly for novel and narrow spectrum uses), taking into account AR surveillance data and numbers of patients at high risk of developing drug resistant infections (e.g., increases in immunocompromised patients); Â· Evaluate current market incentives for the development of priority AR products (Related Action Item: Product Development #80); Â· Reassess AR product priorities on a regular basis ; Â· Evaluate the availability of currently approved, critical products where shortages or potential for shortages exists and develop an approach to ensure that the supply of such products is adequate to meet public health needs; and Â· Communicate the information and priorities developed by the Workgroup to inform and allow coordination with planning and action efforts in research, prevention and control, and product development.
Coordinators: FDA, USDA, CDC; Collaborators: NIH, AHRQ Timeline: Begin within one to two years
B. Issue: Existing market incentives and regulatory processes may be insufficient to stimulate the development of certain priority AR products while fostering their appropriate use.
1.
Goal: Investigate and act upon potential approaches for stimulating and speeding the entire AR product development process, from drug discovery through licensing.
a.
Action Items

(80)
TOP PRIORITY ACTION ITEM - Identify ways (e.g. financial and/or other incentives or investments) to promote the development and/or appropriate use of priority AR products, such as novel compounds and approaches, for human and veterinary medicine for which market incentives are inadequate.
Â· This process should include consultation with outside stakeholders, economic consultants, and the AR Product Development Working Group (Related Action Item: Product Development #79).
Â· All such proposals will require careful economic modeling and analysis.
New approaches should be used on a trial basis for appropriate time periods and the costs and benefits of incentives used in these pilot programs should be monitored to assess the return on the public investment.
Â· Similar incentives should be explored for ensuring adequate availability of existing products that meet critical public health needs but for which market incentives are inadequate to assure supply.
(Related Action Item: Product Development #79).
Coordinators: FDA, CDC; Collaborators: USDA, AHRQ Timeline: Begin within one to two years Consider, in consultation with academia and industry, whether government has a constructive role to play in discovery of drugs and other products targeted to address areas where market incentives are limited and unmet needs exist (e.g., novel antimicrobial drugs targeted to specific resistant organisms).
(Related Action Items: Research Issue B) Â· Such a role could utilize intramural, extramural or partnership type mechanisms.
Products developed under such mechanisms could be licensed commercially either with or without specific stipulations regarding use.
Coordinator: NIH; Collaborators: USDA, FDA, CDC Timeline: Begin within three to five years Continue ongoing approaches that streamline the regulatory process, including clinical trials and enhanced pre- clinical studies (e.g., use of pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data) to help bring AR products (including drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and devices) to market as efficiently and rapidly as possible, while still assuring their safety and efficacy.
Â· This approach might involve use of an expedited process in which certain drugs are considered for approval, in accordance with Subpart E of the Investigational New Drug (IND) regulations.
It might also involve defining new surrogate endpoints that indicate a meaningful response benefit over existing treatments for particular infections (e.g., HIV- 1 RNA viral loads or CD4 counts as surrogate markers in the treatment of HIV/AIDS), in accordance with Subpart H of New Drug Application (NDA) regulations.
Â· In the case of approvals for anti- infective medical devices, AR concerns will be 39
(81)
(82)
Â·
addressed during the pre- and post- licensing review, to ensure that these products reduce infection without engendering significant resistance.
For products specifically targeted to serious or life - threatening AR infections, for which there are few therapeutic alternatives, develop approaches for more focused development programs that would streamline product availability.
This should be done in consultation with all of the stakeholders in the process.
Coordinator: FDA; Collaborator: USDA Timeline: Initiated
C. Issue: The development and use of antimicrobial drugs and related products in agriculture and veterinary medicine should be optimized to reduce the development and transfer of resistance to pathogens that can infect humans.
1.
Goal: Promote the development and use of new and existing AR products that reduce the risk of the development and transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans, as well as new approaches to reducing agricultural and veterinary use of antimicrobial drugs.
a.
Action Items (83) In consultation with stakeholders and expert consultants, identify ways to promote the development of new and alternative veterinary treatments and the improved use of existing therapies that are unlikely to stimulate resistance to drugs in human medicine.
This action will include consideration of the incentives and approaches listed in Action Items #80 (Product Development), #28 (Prevention and Control), and #78 (Research) and the implementation of pilot programs to stimulate the development of priority products that meet critical animal health needs.
Â· Approaches for evaluation should include ways to improve and/or reduce the use of specific antimicrobial drugs, as well as ways to prevent infection, such as vaccines, changes in animal husbandry, and the use of competitive exclusion products (e.g., treatments that affect the intestinal flora of food animals).
Coordinators: FDA, USDA, NIH, CDC Timeline: Begin within three to five years Streamline the regulatory and approval process for veterinary antimicrobial drugs and related products that are unlikely, now or in the future, to result in transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans.
Coordinators: FDA, USDA Timeline: Begin within three to five years
