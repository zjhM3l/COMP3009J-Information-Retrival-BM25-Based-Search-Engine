The Great Whales: History and Status of Six Species Listed as Endangered Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 A Special Issue of the Marine Fisheries Review SIMONA L. PERRY, DOUGLAS P. DeMASTER, and GREGORY K. SILBER The Status of Endangered Whales: An Overview Introduction and Background In the history of whaling from prehistor ic to modern times, the large whales, sometimes called the "great whales," were hunted most heavily owing in part to their corresponding value in oil, meat, and baleen.

lations of North Atlantic right whales, Eubalaena glacialis glacialis, were already decimated by 1700, and the North Atlantic gr a y w hale, Esc hric htius robustus, was hunted to extinction by the early 1700's (Mitchell and Mead1).
Then, as whalers turned to modern, mechanized forms of whaling in the 1860's, worldwide populations of gray; bowhead, Balaena mysticetus; humpback, Megaptera novaeangliae; blue, Balaenoptera musculus; fin, Balaenoptera physalus; sei, Balaenoptera borealis; and sperm, Physeter macrocephalus, whales were in some instances greatly reduced (TÃ¯Â¿Â½nnessen and JohnMitchell, E.

However, as their numbers have diminished, concern for their (and other species) well-being has increased, and has resulted in such U.S. laws as the Endangered Species Conservation Act (ESCA) of 1969, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.
Under these laws, eight species of large whales have been added to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (the List).
Smaller species of whales (e.g. minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata), whose numbers have remained fairly constant, have not been listed as endangered.
This report reviews the history and status of six species of endangered whales: right, humpback, blue, fin, sei, and sperm whale (Fig. 1).

2 Marine Fisheries Review species of large whales were not included in this volume because 1) the eastern North Pacific stoc k of gr ay whale was removed from the endangered species list in June 1994 and 2) a status review of bowhead whale stocks was recently published (Shelden and Rugh, 1995).
As defined in the ESA, a species2 should be classified as endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range as a result of any one of the five factors specified in Section 4(a)(1) (Table 1).
In addition, a species should be classified as threatened if it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future due to any of the factors listed in Table 1.
On 10 November 1978, the U.S. Congress passed Public Law 95-632, which amended the ESA and required the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to review the status and degree of endangerment of all species on the List at least once every 5 years.
Within the 5-year status report, the results of a determination are to be reported as to whether a listed species should be 1) removed from the list, 2) reclassified from endangered to threatened, or 3) reclassified from threatened to endangered.
In response to this Congressional mandate, the National Marine Mammal Laboratory of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) began its first such review in 1982, publishing the status reports jointly in the Marine Fisheries Review (Rice et al., 1984; Mizroch et al., 1984a, b, c; Johnson and Wolman, 1984; Braham and Rice, 1984; Braham, 1984a; and Gosho et al., 1984).
Braham In the implementation of the ESA, the term species has been interpreted to mean "any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate, fish, or wildlife, which interbreeds when mature" (ESAÃ¯Â¿Â½3[16], as amended in 1978).

2 (1984b) reported in a summary article that only the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whale and perhaps the western North Atlantic stock of humpback whale may have recovered to levels approaching their preexploitation population size.
He further noted that "On the basis of population size alone, these two stocks plus most sperm whale stocks seem likely candidates for reclassification.
However, population size is not the only criteria to be considered in deciding whether a stock warrants continued protection under the ESA."
In the 14 years that followed, there were no formal status reviews or publications produced similar to the 1984 issue (46(4)) of the Marine Fisheries Review.
However, several significant actions regarding the status of endangered species of large whales took place.
First, from 1984 to 1998 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) continued to review the status of all stocks of large whales and to make management recommendations when there was agreement within the Commission.
For example, the IWC imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling for all stocks starting with the 1986 coastal and the 198586 pelagic seasons (IWC, 1995b).
Although the Government of Norway formally objected to the classification of the nor theaster n stock of minke whales as a "Protected Stock" (i.e. a stock for which commercial whaling was not allowed) and therefore was not bound by the IWC moratorium for this stock, there were no objections to the moratorium for any of the species listed under the ESA (IWC, 1995b).
In addition, the IWC continued to manage the aboriginal subsistence harvest for the f ollo wing stoc ks of lar g e whales: Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whale, eastern North Pacific stock of gray whale, west Greenland and central North Atlantic stocks of minke whale, west Greenland stock of fi n whale, and the North Atlantic stock of humpback whale (IWC, 1995b).
Because aboriginal whaling quotas are set by the IWC for a specified time period, comprehensive status reviews for most of the stocks taken by aboriginal hunters were performed every 35 years.
Braham3 completed a status update of endangered whales in April 1991.
While this report was never formally published, it was widely distributed.
In that report, Braham noted the following: 1) the eastern North Pacific gray and sperm whale stocks were not in danger of becoming extinct and were not threatened with becoming endangered in the foreseeable future (i.e. recommendation to delist), 2) the BeringChukchi-Beaufort bowhead whale stock was not in danger of becoming extinct in the foreseeable future (i.e. recommendation to downlist to threatened), and 3) all other stocks of large whales were either severely depleted or the data were inconclusive to warrant changing their current listing status of endangered.
In 1991 the NMFS published Recover y Plans for tw o species of large whales: Final Recovery Plan for the northern r ight whale (Anon ymous, 1991a) and Final Recovery Plan for the humpback whale (Anonymous, 1991b).
In each of these Recovery Plans, the status of stocks within U.S. waters was reviewed.
Further, while definitions of endangered and threatened for the western North Atlantic stock of right whale and the definition of threa tened for stocks of North Pacific and North Atlantic humpback whales were provided in the Plans (Table 2), their relevance to the ESA definitions of endangered and threatened has been questioned (DeMaster and Gerber4 ; Shelden5).
A summary of environmental threats to baleen whales was recentl y completed by Clapham and Brownell6 .

As already noted by several authors (Tear et al., 1995; Easter -Pilcher, 1996; Shelden5) the NMFS and FWS have used an ad hoc and subjective approach to classifying individual species.
This has led to considerable disparity in the type and quality of classification criteria among species that are listed.
In 1988, the U.S. Congress amended the ESA to require that each Recovery Plan incorporate objective, measurable criteria for recovery (i.e. delisting).
Nonetheless, these criteria have yet to be developed for species of large whales for which Recovery Plans exist.
Further, the Recovery Plans currently being developed for listed species do not include such criteria (DeMaster and Gerber4).
Finally, we believe that Congress also intended to have delisting criteria developed for those species for which Recovery Plans have not been developed.
There has been some confusion in the literature between a classification of threatened under the ESA and a classification of depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).
In some cases, it has been assumed that a population sufficiently large to be classified as healthy under the MMPA (i.e. population greater than 60% of its carrying capacity (K)) is also sufficiently large to be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife of the ESA.
Unfortunately, there is nothing inherent about the definition of threatened that makes such a relationship valid.
To further complicate matters, the status of a population relative to its carrying capacity (K) is not necessarily well correlated with the probability of extinction in the foreseeable future.
Obviously, populations at very low status levels (e.g. less than 10% of K) are often very small in number and therefore more likely to become extinct over a given period of time than a population several times larger.

Completion of the fin and sei whale Recovery Plan is expected in 1999.
An additional action concerning the status of listed stocks of large whales involved the gray whale.
In November 1991 the NMFS issued a proposed determination that the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales be removed from the List.
The NMFS issued a final determination to delist on 7 January 1993, but concurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was not received until June 1994, when this stock was officially removed from the List.
This delisting was the first such action for any species of marine mammal since the passage of the ESA in 1973.
As a part of the delisting process, in 1993 the NMFS also developed a 5year plan for research and monitoring8 .
The development of such a plan is a requirement of the ESA, where the agency responsible for management (i.e. U.S. Department of Commerce for cetaceans) must commit to monitor the status of the delisted stock for a period of at least 5 years following delisting.

retary of Commerce finds that the species' well-being is at risk, the ESA provides that emergency protective regulations, under Section 4(b)(7), shall be issued by the Secretary to ensure the conservation of any recently delisted species.
As part of the 5-year plan for research and monitoring, the NMFS conducted three biennial surveys during southbound migrations for the purposes of estimating annual abundance and determining trends in abundance and four annual surveys during northbound migrations for the purpose of estimating calf pr oduction.
Also required as part of the delisting process is a formal review of the status of a delisted stock 5 years following the action to delist.
A workshop was held during the spring of 1999 to review the status of the eastern stock of North Pacific gray whale.
Shelden and Rugh (1995) published a formal status review of the bowhead whale, which included a status summary of the five recognized stocks.
No specific recommendations to change the listing status of any of these bowhead whale stocks were proposed by them.
However, they did report that NMFS would undertake to develop objective criteria to determine whether the current classification of one of these stocks, bowhead whales of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, is accurate (Shelden5).
The following report officially updates the status of the remainder of the stocks of endangered large whales (i.e. right, humpback, blue , fin, sei, and sperm whales).
In the remainder of this overview, we summarize problems that have been identified in defining classification criteria under the ESA, discuss possible changes to the classification of endangered large whale stocks, and provide an update on the currently listed large whale species (except bowhead whales).
4 over a wide range of population sizes, status relative to K alone is not a good predictor as to whether extinction is imminent.
T he Wo r ld Conser v a tion Union (IUCN) recently developed objective classification criteria for the purposes of identifying species that are, or may be, threatened with extinction (IUCN, 1996).
As noted in Gnam (1993) and Shelden5, these criteria seemed to have been developed with terrestrial species in mind, and some of the definitions or parameters used in the criteria are not easily applied to marine species.
For example, one of the criteria refers to the area of occurrence, but it is not clear how to apply such a criterion to species like large whales that migrate over great distances.
Nonetheless, this approach represents a significant improvement over the ad hoc system previously used by the NMFS and FWS.
As noted by DeMaster and Gerber4, the IUCN criteria can be modified to make the criteria more pertinent to marine species, including species of large whales.
Most endangered whale species occur in geographically and, in some cases, genetically discrete populations.
These populations are typically referred to as stocks, and may be designated on the basis of species' biology, management objectives, or a combination of biological and management goals.
However, since biological information necessary to make reliable stock structure determinations is generally lacking for the large whales, management objectives tend to play a large role in how stocks are designated (Barlow9).
Two different approaches for stock designation are referred to in this document.
The first of these approaches has been adopted by the NMFS in the production of annual stock assessment reports.
As a default in the absence of biological data, the NMFS approach defines stock structure r elative to discontinuities in the distribution of the stock in question and relative to the distribution of commercial fisheries in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans 9 Barlow, J .

(Barlow et al., 1995a).
The second approach uses stock determinations currently recognized by the IWC (Donovan, 1991).
The former approach uses smaller areas to define the range of a stock than does the latter, and has been adopted in an effort to minimize the risk of adverse interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals.
The latter approach generally uses much larger areas to designate stocks (i.e. typically an ocean basin).
While detailed evaluation of the merits of these two approaches is beyond the scope of this report, we summarize the status of six endangered large w hale species based on current stock designations that currently rely on these approaches (Tables 3, 4, 5).
Summary and Recommendations Regarding the Listing Status of Large Whales As discussed above, all large whale species currently listed as endangered under the ESA were severely depleted as a result of commercial whaling.
The effects of low population size and the continued thr eat of overexploitation were the primary reasons that the species were first listed.
Because commercial overexploitation is no longer imminent, or at least is greatly diminished, the listed species could, theoretically, be delisted.
However, the potential for adverse effects from human activities still exists, and the lingering effects of low population size do remain (Clapham et al. 10).
For example, northern right whale stocks, which are still severely depleted, have shown no sign of recovery or at least no substantial population growth in the last two decades even though local commercial hunting ceased in 1949 (Anonymous, 1991a).
Clearly, the listing classification of this species should remain (Table 5).
Stock identity of North Atlantic and North Pacific humpback whales is relatively well understood, and some humpback whale populations are showing significant increases (see the review beginning on page 24).
Most notable are the western North Atlantic and the cen10 Table 3.--Available potential biological removal (PBR) levels for five species of endangered whales from Hill and DeMaster (1998); Barlow et al. (1997); Waring et al. (1998).
PBR = product of Nmin , 1/2 maximum net productivity rate , and a specified "recover y" factor for endangered stocks, threatened stocks, or stocks of unknown status relative to OSP (Wade and Angliss, 1997).
Stocks without PBR indicate that data were insufficient.

For example, Smith et al.11 estimated there are 5,543 whales in the western North Atlantic, which may be greater than estimated preexploitation levels (Table 4).
As population estimates are refined, population structure is better understood, and as mortality and serious injury from human activities are reduced, these stocks may be considered for downlisting or delisting if the appropriate long-term monitoring programs can be established (Table 5).
Blue whale stocks off the west coast of North America also show signs of growth.
For example, the stock of blue whales that feed in waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, which was once thought to include fewer than 500 individuals, was recently estimated at 1,785 (CV = 0.24; Barlow et al., 1997).
While additional data are still needed on stock structure, trends in abundance, and habitat requirements, this stock may be a candidate for downlisting as long as reliable monitoring programs are established and long-term research is continued (Table 5).
In contrast, for several other species there is insufficient information about stock structure and abundance to make determinations regarding changes in listing status at this time (Table 5).

Therefore, while the abundance of some stocks may be increasing or their total abundance in any given ocean basin is relatively large (e.g. sperm whale), data on stock struc- ture and habitat requirements are too inconclusive to warrant changing their listing status in the near future.
The comprehensive status reviews that follow are based on published lit- erature from about 1980 through 1998.
In some instances, where important data remains unpublished, we have cited personal communications, manuscripts in press, and draft documents.
In other instances, where no new data has been collected since the 1984 reviews, we have cited pre-1980 literature.
Scientists continue to develop new methods of ga thering and analyzing population data, thus expanding our knowledge of large whale population biology; however, new and important publications after early 1999 were excluded from these reviews for the sake of timeliness.
As it stands, these reviews are already more than 10 years later than the Congressionally mandated 5-year review period.
