VA - MD - POTOMAC RIVER - WOODROW WILSON BRIDGE - BRIDGE INFO Mariners are advised that contractors are continuing construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Memorial Drawbridge across the Potomac River, mile 103.8, between the City of Alexandria, Virginia and Oxon Hill, Maryland.
Excessive speed and wake by boaters have caused the potential for serious or fatal incidents to the Bridge project.
It is crucial that mariners obey the speed restrictions and eliminate wakes through the work zone due to the sensitive and precise nature of the work and for worker safety.
A temporary floating causeway, extending from the Jones Point Park bulkhead to the Virginia- side drawbridge foundation has been installed and will be in place during drawbridge construction.
Work platform construction will be completed during the fall of 2003 on the new Maryland- side drawbridge foundation and falsework/formwork erection will continue for the new drawbridge.
Th ese activities will require intermittent day - time channel restrictions as a result of crane barge positioning.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when transiting this area for work barges, exposed piles, and anchor buoys.
Dredging is being done by Langenfelder Marine, and is expected to continue until further notice (probably 2 months).
Three barges are being operated in rotation, with one in tow at any given time.
Dredge scows are being staged from a mooring buoy located east of the Potomac River navigation channel, south of the bridge, in approx position 38 47.342 N and 77 02.130 W.
The mooring buoy and barges are marked and lighted.
For further information and updates to construction operations, contact Mr. Mike Baker, Environmental Construction Manager for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Project at 301-567- 0094 Ext 242 or visit the Project's website online at www.wilsonbridge.com.
