EFFECTIVENESS Dosage Characterization In vivo Enrofloxacin Titration
a.
Type of Study / Purpose: This controlled, double blind, in vivo study was undertaken to identify the appropriate ototopical concentration of enrofloxacin for the treatment of experimentallyÂ­induced canine otitis externa. b. Investigators: Michael Groh DVM H. Dennis McCurdy DVM Daniel K. Ciszewski DVM Bayer Corporation DeSoto Animal Research Facility 35040 W. 87th Street DeSoto, KS 66018 c. General Design: 1.
Animals: Adult, male (n=6) and female (n=14), crossbred dogs with dependent pinnae 2.
Treatments: Treatments included 3 different enrofloxacin concentrations (0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%) and a negative control (placebo).
All treatments were packaged in opaque 10-mL dropper-tip bottles that were identified by coded laboratory labels.
Study investigators were blinded to the identities of the treatments.
3.
Treatment Group Assignment / Randomization: A computer-generated randomization schedule was used to assign dogs to treatment groups.
4.
Experimental Infection: The epithelium of the external auditory meatus was mechanically and chemically irritated and a culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with low enrofloxacin susceptibility (MIC = 16), was instilled into the canal.
5.
Treatment Dose, Route, Frequency and Duration: A standardized volume of 0.5 mL (~10 drops) per treatment, was selected.
Treatments were administered ototopically, 2X daily, for 14 consecutive days.
6.
Clinical Examination / Clinical Scoring: Challenged ears were examined otoscopically and scored at pretreatment, mid-treatment, late-treatment, final treatment and 3-4 days post-treatment.
During each examination, ears were examined for the characteristic clinical signs of otitis externa (erythema, swelling, exudate, ulceration/erosion, malodor and pain) and a composite clinical score, based on severity (range: 0 to 12), was assigned.
A score of at least 6 was required to qualify for entry into the study.
Otoscopy and clinical scoring were consistently performed by the same blinded investigator.
NADA 141-176 Page 2

In Vitro Susceptibility Study
a.
Type of Study: This study was conducted to determine the in vitro susceptibility of select organisms to enrofloxacin and to silver sulfadiazine (SSD). b. Investigator: John N. Berg, DVM, PhD Department of Veterinary Microbiology 104 Connaway Hall University of Missouri Columbia, MO 65211 c. General Design: 1.
Objectives: The study had 2 objectives.
(1) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of enrofloxacin and SSD to canine aural bacterial and fungal organisms, and (2) to identify the minimal in vitro concentration of each anti-infective required to ensure broad antimicrobial activity against all organisms studied.
2.
Samples: A total of 72 microbial isolates, originating from clinical cases of canine otitis externa, were evaluated.
NADA 141-176

BaytrilÂ® Otic
3.
Procedure: An agar dilution method, described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [" Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically" (Vol. 10, No 8, 1990)], was used to determine the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs).
Serial twofold dilutions of enrofloxacin and SSD, in concentrations from 0.004 Â­ 32 and 3.125 Â­ 500 micrograms per mL, respectively, were used to determine the in vitro susceptibility of the microbial organisms.
Test Duration: January to May, 1993 Measured Variables: Enrofloxacin and SSD MIC ranges were determined and recorded for the 72 isolates.
Whenever possible, MIC50 and MIC90 were also reported.

e. Conclusions: Enrofloxacin did not inhibit in vitro growth of Malassezia or Candida spp. at concentrations up to 32 mcg/mL.
Enrofloxacin exhibited its lowest in vitro activity against the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 16.0 mcg/mL).
SSD exhibited its lowest in vitro activity against the fungi Candida spp (upper limit of MIC range = 300 mcg/mL).
Therefore, to be clinically effective for mixed infections, an enrofloxacin and SSD combination product should be able to deliver sufficient in vivo concentrations of each active ingredient (enrofloxacin, 
The concentrations of the two drugs in the final market formulation of BaytrilÂ® Otic exceed these amounts.
B. Drug Interactions Associated with the Combination of Enrofloxacin and Silver Sulfadiazine 1.
Type of Study: This in vitro study was conducted to characterize the types of interactions occurring between enrofloxacin and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) in the presence of assorted canine aural microbial organisms.

General Design
a.
Objectives: The objectives of this laboratory study were: (1) to calculate fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI) for strategic enrofloxacin/SSD combinations (combinations in which the enrofloxacin: SSD concentration ratios equal the ratios of their MICs), (2) to classify each FICI into the appropriate interactive category: synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic, and (3) to demonstrate, in accordance with 21CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v), that each drug makes a contribution to the antimicrobial effect.
b. Samples: Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) to enrofloxacin and SSD were determined for 72 microbial isolates cultured from clinical cases of canine otitis externa.
Sixty-five of these isolates, and their corresponding MICs, were used to determine FICIs. c. Procedures: An agar dilution method, described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards ["Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically" (Vol. 10, No 8, 1990)]
FICIs were calculated with results obtained from a standard checkerboard evaluation of the antimicrobial combination versus the 65 aforementioned microbial isolates.
Concentrations of antimicrobial combinations used in test wells were determined by MIC results and included levels at approximately 3 dilutions above and 3 dilutions below the MIC.
The experimental procedures used for this portion of the study are similar to those described by Eliopoulos and Moellering (Antimicrobial combinations.

Table IV.2 lists 41 Fractional Inhibitory Concentrations.
Unequivocal evidence, supporting either antagonism or synergy, can only be found in 1 Proteus and 1 E. coli comparison (2 of 41 or 4.9% of the overall total), respectively.
Most of the critical FICIs (34 of 41 or 83% of the total) were between 0.5 and 2.0, and as such, were indicative of either additivity or indifference.
Furthermore, of these 34 FICIs, 22 (54% of the total) closely approached the 0.5 value (FICI 
g. Conclusions: Results of in vitro tests to determine FICIs demonstrated a lack of interference between the 2 active ingredients.
Minimal inhibitory concentrations indicate that enrofloxacin is a potent antibacterial with marked efficacy against gram negative bacteria (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and that SSD, while possessing some antibacterial activity (including gram positive bacteria, i.e. Streptococci sp.), is uniquely active against yeast and fungi.
Therefore, to ensure consistent effectiveness against the range of microorganisms (gram negative and gram positive bacteria, yeast and fungi) commonly associated with canine otitis externa, both active ingredients are essential.

b. Animals: One hundred and sixty-nine dogs qualified for study enrollment.
Gender distribution included 19 intact females (11%), 59 neutered females (35%), 41 intact males (24%) and 50 neutered males (30%).
Patient ages ranged from 4 months to 15 years.
Forty-one different breeds were represented with the predominant breeds being Mixed (29/17%), Labrador Retriever (24/14%), Cocker Spaniel (21/12%), Poodle (13/8%), Golden Retriever (13/8%) and Shih Tzu (7/4%). c. Enrollment Criteria: Ears were examined for the characteristic clinical signs of otitis externa (erythema, swelling, exudate, ulceration/erosion, malodor and pain) and a composite clinical score, based on severity (range: 0 to 12), was assigned.
To qualify for study inclusion, a clinical score 6 was required.
d. Exclusion Criteria: Recent systemic antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory therapy, ruptured tympanic membrane, concurrent infections with Otodectes cynotis, poor general health or poor anesthetic risk were reasons for exclusion.
e. Treatment Groups and Controls: Animals were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.
The appearance, physical characteristics, packaging and labeling of the 3 treatments were identical.
Treatments A and C contained active ingredients and were identical in formulation to the product intended for market.
Except for the absence of active ingredients, Treatment B (placebo) contained all other formulary components (negative control).
Throughout the study, the identity of the experimental treatment remained unknown to both investigators and clients.
By study conclusion, 113 (67%) and 56 (33%) cases had been randomly assigned to the BaytrilÂ® Otic and placebo treatment groups, respectively (approximately a 2:1 active: placebo ratio). f. Challenge: Natural infection g. Dosage Form: The formulation used during the clinical trial was identical to the product intended for market.
h. Route of Administration: Ototopical i. Dose, Frequency and Duration: Investigators were instructed to prescribe a quantity of experimental treatment sufficient to coat the aural lesions.
As a general guide, dogs weighing less than 35 lbs. would receive 5-10 drops per treatment while those weighing greater than 35 lbs. would receive 10-15 drops per treatment.
Treatments were applied twice daily for a duration of 7-14 days.
j. Treatment Success or Failure: Success/failure was based on clinical response.
The otic exams and scoring were repeated on Day 7.
If the clinical score for the ears was 2 or less, treatment was stopped.
Dogs that showed improvement but not resolution at Day 7 were treated for 7 additional days.
The final assessment was performed 3 to 4 days following administration of the last dose.
Final scores of 2 or less were considered treatment successes.

Microbiology: During this investigation, 299 microbiological specimens, obtained from 169 cases of unilateral and bilateral otitis externa, were submitted for bacterial and fungal culture.
Twenty-four of the samples produced "no growth."
The remaining 275 samples yielded 277 bacteria and 149 yeast/fungi for a total of 426 microbial isolates.
All bacterial isolates were subsequently subjected to in vitro disk diffusion susceptibility testing according to NCCLS-established guidelines.
Sensitivity testing was performed for enrofloxacin only.

Clinical Results: There was not a direct correlation between the in vitro susceptibility testing and the clinical results.
Although Enterococci species were assessed as "intermediate" responders, 5/5 of the clinical cases in which Enterococci were isolated had successful treatment results.
Similarly, treatment for 7/10 cases in which "resistant" Streptococci species were cultured was successful.
Treatment failed for all cases of Bacillus species, Micrococci species, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Serratia marcescens, although these organisms were reported as "susceptible."
Successes by treatment site, after 14-days of treatment, are presented in Table IV.5 Table IV.5 Therapeutic Success by Site and Treatment, After 14 Days Site Clinical Cure Rate Treated Groups (successes / total ears) 18/24 (75.0%) 12/24 (50.0%) 3/10 (30.0%) 11/26 (42.3%) 37/43 (86.0%) 32/37 (86.4%) 9/19 (47.3%) 122/183 (66.7%)** Clinical Cure Rate Placebo Group (successes / total ears) 0/13 0/9 0/2 6/12 (50.0%) 3/22 (13.6%) 0/23 4/12 (33.3%) 13/93 (14%)**

**Due to different recruitment rates, total successes, as reported for the active and placebo groups, are not equivalent to the treatment group average.
6.
Adverse Reactions: Two of 113 cases (1.8%) treated with BaytrilÂ® Otic displayed responses compatible with a local hypersensitivity reaction to one of the components within the formulation.
Following 2 Â­3 days of treatment, aural erythema, swelling, vesicles, pain or pruritis either developed or intensified in these patients.
Neither reaction was life threatening and both resolved when treatment was stopped.
7.
Statistical Analysis: Therapeutic success occurred in 67 % of aural infections treated with the active formulation and in 14% of aural infections treated with placebo ( = .0143) after a treatment period of 14 days.
The odds for therapeutic success was 14.78 times greater with the active formulation than with the placebo.
A mixed model with a logistic link was used to analyze the success variable.
The fixed effects were treatment, side (left or right ear), and treatment by side.
The random effects were clinic and treatment by clinic.
Side and treatment by side were not significant.

8.
Conclusions: The data demonstrate that BaytrilÂ® Otic, 0.5% enrofloxacin / 1.0% silver sulfadiazine emulsion, is effective for the treatment of otitis externa complicated by the presence of Malassezia pachydermatis, coagulase-positive Staphylococci species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococci species, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Aspergillus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans.
This conclusion is based on the fact that at least 10 isolates were collected for each of these organisms during the field trial, and ears from which the organisms had been cultured showed clinical cures following treatment with BaytrilÂ® Otic for up to 14 days.
Differences between clinical cures and the microbial culture and susceptibility testing results are to be expected because the NCCLS categorical assessments are linked to plasma concentrations of antimicrobial drugs.
When a drug is applied topically, the concentration at the site of infection can be higher than that attainable in plasma.
Therapeutic failures are also to be expected because factors other than the presence of fungi and bacteria contribute to otitis externa.

c. Control Animals: Four male and four female beagle dogs, 5.9-13.2 kg in weight
NADA 141-176
Page 13
BaytrilÂ® Otic
d. Ear Condition: Prior to the initiation of treatment, all dogs received a complete aural and otoscopic examination and a hearing evaluation.
All dogs had normal ear canals, intact tympanic membranes, and normal hearing.
e. Dosage Form: The study used the final market formulation of BaytrilÂ® Otic supplied in 30-mL bottles.
Individual syringes were filled with the appropriate amount of test article for each dog.
All syringes were masked with tape and the plungers withdrawn to the same level for each syringe, thereby blinding study personnel to the dose group.
The control article was equivalent to the test article in all aspects except for the absence of active ingredients.
f. Route of Administration: Otic topical g. Dosage Used: 10, 30 or 50 drops of BaytrilÂ® Otic were administered in both ears twice a day for 42 consecutive days.
This resulted in 1, 3, and 5X the labeled dose given for 3X the labeled duration of treatment.
The control group received 50 drops of vehicle control article in the right ear and no treatment in the left ear. h. Test Duration: 60 days i. Parameters measured: The study included clinical observations, measurement of body weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, aural and otoscopic exams, and hearing tests.
Hearing was evaluated using a hidden noisemaker to test for responses to sound.
Aural erythema and edema were each evaluated using a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being normal and 4 being severe erythema or edema.
4.
Results: a.
Clinical Results: The most notable clinical abnormality was aural erythema.
This affected all dogs in the study, and occurred to the same extent in all treatment groups.
It began on Day 1 or Day 2, was present in all study dogs by Day 3, and resolved within 2 days after stopping treatment.
The erythema was always mild, with scores of 1 or 2 for the duration of the study.
Edema was never reported in any dog.
No changes in hearing were reported.
b. Hematology/Clinical Chemistry: No clinically significant changes were reported for hematology or clinical chemistry values.
c. Urinalysis: All urinalysis values were within normal reference ranges.
5.
Conclusions: Twice daily administration of BaytrilÂ® Otic at doses up to five times the recommended dose volume and for as long as 42 days produced reversible erythema of the ears.
No other adverse effects or signs of toxicity were reported.

Oral Safety Study
1.
Type of Study: This blinded, controlled laboratory study was undertaken to evaluate the local tolerance of healthy canine oral tissues to intentional and repeated misapplications of BaytrilÂ® Otic. 2.
Study Director: Daniel K. Ciszewski, DVM Bayer Corporation Agriculture Division / Animal Health Shawnee Mission, Kansas 3.
General Design: a.
Purpose: To determine, by clinical observation, the reactivity of canine oral tissues following intentional and repeated misapplications of BaytrilÂ® Otic. b. Animals: Twelve healthy adult dogs (5 males and 7 females) of assorted breeding, weighing between 8.6 - 20.5 kg.
The dogs were free of active gingivitis. c. Control: Prior to initiation, dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 different treatment groups.
Throughout the study, one person intentionally misapplied BaytrilÂ® Otic to the dorsum of the tongue and to the left buccal region of Group 1 dogs (n=6).
Group 2 dogs (n=6), maintained as controls, were treated similarly but with physiological saline.
At predetermined intervals during the study, a second person, blinded to treatment group assignments, carefully inspected the oral cavities of all dogs for the development of adverse, treatment-induced, local reactions.
d. Dosage Form: The test article, a 0.5% enrofloxacin / 1.0% silver sulfadiazine emulsion, was identical to the formulation intended for market.
e. Dose Amount: Each dog was treated with approximately 7 drops of either BaytrilÂ® Otic or physiological saline twice daily for 14 consecutive days.
f. Route of Administration: Both the test article and the placebo (saline) were directly applied to the dorsum of the tongue and to the left buccal mucosa. g. Study Duration: 25 days.
h. Pertinent Measurements/Observations: On study days 0, 4, 8, 15 and 22, a blindedinvestigator carefully examined the oral cavities of all study dogs, particularly the lingual and left buccal surfaces, for erythema, edema and other local abnormalities.
A numerical scoring system was used to describe and score any identifiable lesions.

AGENCY CONCLUSIONS
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of section 512 of the Act and section 514.111 of the regulations.
The data demonstrate that BaytrilÂ® Otic (enrofloxacin and silver sulfadiazine), when used under labeled conditions, is safe and effective for the treatment of otitis externa in dogs.
Under section 512 (c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this product qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application contains substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the drug involved and studies of animal safety required for the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
This drug product is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian because professional expertise is required to determine the existence of, and microbiological components of, otitis externa.
Additionally, veterinary expertise is needed to ensure that the tympanic membrane is intact prior to initial administration of the drug.
