Ron? 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 MR. MILBERG: Okay, thank you, Mike.
This (indicating screen) is my telephone number and E-mail, if anyone needs to contact me, if you have any questions after today's meeting.
Today I'll provide some background on the IFA program, then talk about how it's evolved over the years and finally, discuss today's situation.
To begin with, IFA was introduced into the southern United States about 60 to 80 years ago.
And after the ants were first observed in 1920, landowners began applying whatever was available, calcium cyanide dust, et cetera.
With the advent of chlorinated hydrocarbons to cost effectively control ants, a federal quarantine was established in 1958 to regulate infested areas.
The quarantine currently regulates all or portions of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
The quarantine regulates movement of articles known to spread IFA, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 including nursery stock and soil.
The early program goals, originally the original program was a cooperative effort between APHIS and the states in three areas, including detection, define and eradicate isolated infestations, regulatory activity to slow IFA's spread by controlling the movement of regulated articles, and finally control activity to reduce ant 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 populations using wide area pesticide applications.
As registrations and food tolerances for chlorinated hydrocarbons were cancelled in the 1960s and '70s, wide-area pesticide applications were no longer practical.
Eradication programs were also limited by poor efficacy of available pesticides.
The IFA program then shifted to baits and organophosphates.
Unfortunately, some of these compounds, such as chloropyrophos, were less effective than previously used materials.
During the 1980s with the continued loss of chemicals, the federal program shifted its focus towards methods development, primarily testing of new treatments to certify regulated articles for interstate movement.
And that takes us to today's situation where during the 1990s, appropriations for federal domestic programs declined or were capped, and states assumed more IFA survey and regulatory responsibility.
State activities were conducted in part using cooperative funding agreements 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 with APHIS.
Most federal dollars were passed through to the states, to ensure compliance with the federal quarantine.
And I have a chart here that shows the funding over the last ten years or so.
As shown in this graph, continued pressure on domestic budgets caused funding for the IFA program to decline from about $5 million in 1990 to a $100,000 in 2000.
Of this year's $100,000 appropriation, 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 $58,000 was earmarked by Congress for regulatory activity in New Mexico.
So given the current funding level, essentially no dollars are available to pass through to the other states.
Now despite the low funding level, APHIS continues to maintain the federal quarantine by annually updating the list of infested areas contained in the Federal Register.
In addition, our investigative and enforcement services staff looks at about 10 to 20 quarantine violations annually.
About a third of these cases are closed with warnings issued by the local PPQ officer for first-time violations.
Another third are closed with no action, if the shipping facility was under a compliance agreement and treatments were applied in accordance with the agreement.
The last third are assessed civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation, which is the maximum allowed by statute.
The typical fine ranges from $500 to $2,000, depending on the severity and the number of violations that are charged.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 In addition to our IES activity, APHIS continues to focus on the development of new regulatory treatments and nursery compliance protocols to control or reduce ant levels in nursery production areas.
About $350,000 is allocated annually to the Gulfport, Mississippi Methods Development Center.
To our knowledge, Gulfport is the only facility in the country that's developing IFA regulatory treatments.
10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 And moving on to the main topic of today's meeting, the potential options we have at this point, given the above information, background and so on, we decided to hold public meetings to get input on what direction the IFA program should take.
And to stimulate discussion on this, we came up with these three options.
That's not to say these are the only three, but these are the three we came up with: Under option one, we would maintain our Imported Fire Ant program with minimal regulatory activity in line with current funding.
This option would provide uniform standards and consistent interstate shipping requirements for the regulated industry.
Under this option, most states would enforce the federal quarantine without federal dollars.
Under option two, we would eliminate the federal quarantine and develop model guidelines for the states to use in harmonizing their quarantines.
This option would reduce federal costs, and may provide uniformity without 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 federal regulation.
However, under this option, the states may impose more or less stringent requirements.
These requirements could vary from state to state.
Under option three, we would eliminate the imported fire ant regulations, and would participate in establishing a voluntary nursery certification program.
This option would reduce federal costs and may provide 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 uniformity without federal regulation.
However, such a certification program is not mandatory, and could result in less than 100-percent participation.
At this time, the agency has made no decision on how to proceed.
All options, including any submitted in writing or presented at these meetings, will be considered before a final decision is proposed.
Thanks again for your participation and interest today.
And that concludes my briefing.
MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
Our first registered speaker is Mr. Herman Jackson, please.
MR. HERMAN JACKSON: Good Morning.
My name is Herman B. Jackson, and I'm representing the Department of Plant Industry, Clemson University, in the state of South Carolina.
I've been involved in plant regulatory and quarantine work and programs for 25 years.
Throughout this time, I've had the opportunity to work cooperatively with the USDA, APHIS, PPQ on many programs.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Today, I am here to speak to Docket Number 000008-1 regarding the imported fire ant quarantine.
The APHIS program budget has been virtually eliminated for fiscal year 2000.
And as a result, APHIS is proposing to severely curtail their involvement with the imported fire ant program, or to eliminate the Imported Fire Ant quarantine and regulations altogether.
12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 As a state regulatory official, I strongly urge and recommend USDA, APHIS to maintain the imported fire ant program and do everything possible to reinstitute funding to support the infested states in conducting surveys, compliance monitoring and enforcement of quarantine violations.
The nursery industry in my state supports this same position.
The imported fire ant quarantine provides for a coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant's spread.
The quarantine also provides a uniform set of regulations and guidelines that the nursery and greenhouse industry, and all infested states, must follow to certify regulated articles for interstate shipment.
The continuation of the fire ant program and quarantine is of paramount importance to the states and the industry.
Without USDA, APHIS involvement, we can expect to see a multitude of different state quarantines, restrictions and requirements.
This would seriously impact the nursery 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and greenhouse industry in the infested states who market their products throughout the United States, Canada and foreign countries.
Likewise, state regulatory officials, who are already understaffed and underfunded as it is, will be impacted by the sheer amount of information to comprehend in order to provide advice and service to their industry.
The nursery industry in South Carolina is growing 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 by leaps and bounds.
In 1994, the ornamental and turfgrass industries in South Carolina generated sales estimated at 726 million.
Of this amount, over 50 percent was due to sales of plants, shrubs, trees and turf.
Net income from sales was estimated at over $255 million.
Now five years later, I am positive that these figures have increased.
Cash receipts from the greenhouse, nursery and horticultural industries have surpassed tobacco as the number 2 crop in South Carolina, and now ranks secondly only to poultry amount the state's top 10 commodities.
Thus, in summary, I strongly urge USDA, APHIS to one, maintain the imported fire ant quarantine, two, maintain its involvement with the fire ant program, three, restore adequate funding, approximately $3.5 million to the 2201 budget and, four, partner with the industry, the American Nursery and Landscape Association, and the states through the National Plant Board, to strengthen the total fire ant program.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Likewise, I recommend that Congress, if there are any Members or Representatives present, support the nursery industry, USDA, APHIS, and the affected states by appropriating or restoring approximately $3.5 million in the 2001 budget.
I thank you for this opportunity.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our next speaker is Mr. Ken Glenn.
14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 MR. KEN GLENN: Good Morning.
I am Ken Glenn, Currently Chairman of the Southern Plant Board, whom I represent this morning.
I'm also a member of the Department of Plant Industry in South Carolina, Clemson University.
I appreciate the opportunity to be representing the Southern Plant Board this morning.
We are made up of 13 member states and serve to promote better understanding and efficiency in the administration of laws and other written instruments of regulatory authority between states, and to protect agricultural and horticultural industries on state, national and international levels.
The imported fire ant is a pest now found in 13 southern and western states.
The seriousness of this pest to the nursery industry, farmers and the human health threat is well documented.
The nursery industry is highly concentrated in the South and West.
Extremely important to this industry are markets in other states.
The fire ant quarantine is important to maintaining those markets.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Due to budget support efforts by the nursery industry and affected states, PPQ funding at a level of $1 million for about the last five years or so, has provided limited support to state regulatory agencies for cooperative survey and regulatory activities.
Despite lobbying efforts, the APHIS 2000 budget did not include funds to continue these cooperative efforts.
15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Without proper funding, pressure within APHIS of course is mounting to rescind the fire ant quarantine.
Members of the Southern Plant Board feel strongly that this would create a very negative impact in the regulated community.
Since 1958, the quarantine has provided uniform rules under which regulated articles, including nursery stock, could be moved from infested to noninfested areas.
This is important to the nursery establishments because the quarantine provides a consistent set of regulatory treatments for nursery stock and other regulated articles.
In the absence of a federal quarantine, there would be as many state fire ant quarantines as there are states.
Historically, each state's quarantine would be different and likely would be more restrictive than the present federal quarantine.
This scenario would impose confusion and hardships, including a greater financial burden, on the regulated community.
Obviously, a federal 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 quarantine avoids this situation by providing for certification consistency.
The Southern Plant Board urges USDA, APHIS, PPQ to maintain the federal imported fire ant quarantine, even though it is not perfect and probably needs updating.
We also feel that due to the importance of this issue to the regulated industry, especially the nursery industry, 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 adequate funding should be restored.
However, the federal quarantine is needed, regardless of the funding status.
On the matter of funding, the Southern Plant Board supports the proposal by the National Plant Board to increase the baseline budget of PPQ by 7.5 million to fund the IFA quarantine program.
For the quarantine to work as intended, sufficient resources are critical to provide fair and uniform oversight and quarantine enforcement.
Another important issue is that research on the imported fire ant pest conducted by the IFA laboratory in Gulfport continue.
Without the federal quarantine, it is doubtful that it would.
The regulated community must have viable control alternatives for safely marketing regulated articles.
The laboratory provides those alternatives.
Promising new insecticides are coming along, which would greatly assist the nursery industry.
The nursery industry is an important part of agriculture throughout the Southeast.
It ranks near the top 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 in agricultural cash receipts in this region.
Such a growing industry needs certification services that we provide to market their products.
The federal quarantine is an essential tool in providing fair and uniform certification services to that industry and others in agriculture, while protecting our own environment and that of other states.
17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 As Southern Plant Board Chairman, I received a letter from the South Carolina Nursery and Landscape Association, Donna Shealy Foster, Executive Director.
I'd like to read that letter and include it as a part of this paper.
It's addressed to me, "Dear Ken, I am writing to you to express our concern about the recent APHIS budget cut for imported fire ant quarantine, control and research.
We think these regulatory activities are very important to the well-being of the nursery industry.
The federal domestic imported fire ant quarantine has provided a set of uniform rules for the movement of nursery stock from infested areas to uninfested areas.
This consistent set of rules for treating and certifying nursery stock has worked for the good of the industry, despite the record keeping burden that comes with the rules.
Without these federal regulations, each state will develop its own rules, which will be a nightmare for those who ship plants into other states.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 As Chairman of the Southern Plant Board, I hope that you and the representatives from the other states can work with groups such as the American Nursery and Landscape Association and the Southern Nursery Association to encourage federal funds to be reinstated for the imported fire ant quarantine.
Thank you for considering this request, Sincerely, Donna Shealy Foster, Executive 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Director."
Again, the Southern Plant Board supports continuing the federal fire ant quarantine.
We have been supporters through the years and will continue to work with PPQ to secure funding for the IFA program and cooperatively enforce the quarantine.
Southern Plant Board members include the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
On behalf of the members of the Southern Plant Board, thank you for this opportunity to publicly emphasize the importance of this issue.
We will continue to partner with PPQ to improve, administer and support adequate funding for the fire ant quarantine programs.
Thanks.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our next speaker is Mr. Lloyd Garcia, please.
MR. LLOYD GARCIA: Good Morning.
My name is 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Lloyd Garcia.
That's G-A-R-C-I-A.
I'm here on behalf of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, to provide comment to this panel concerning the future direction of the regulations concerning fire ant.
I'd like to provide four basic statements prepared by the NCDA, and premise these statements by stating that the North Carolina Department of Agriculture 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and Consumer Services recommends that the USDA continue to implement the existing imported fire ant regulations, and reinstate adequate funding necessary to implement a full and robust regulatory program.
The first point I'd like to make is that the federal regulations, as they are currently adopted provide the minimum framework necessary to govern the interstate movement of regulated articles from areas quarantined due to the fire ant.
Further, federal regulations enhance the North Carolina Department of Agriculture's state-adopted fire ant regulations by providing necessary resources for the investigation of noncompliance issues.
The second point, USDA imported fire ant regulations provide a uniform set of guidelines for interstate movement of commodities considered as regulated articles under the existing regulations.
Uniform regulations should be maintained to ensure regulated commodities are allowed to move competitively and without 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 arbitrary restrictions to U.S. and also to international markets.
The third point, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services supports the imported fire ant methods development and evaluation currently conducted at the Methods Development Center in Gulfport, Mississippi.
Continued and targeted control technologies are vital to 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ensure an effective regulatory program is implemented.
The critical elements include the delivery of national standards for the selection, application and documentation of controls for fire ant.
These program components are paramount in preventing the establishment of the fire ant at sites outside the generally infested area.
Without federal imported fire ant regulations, there would be limited justification for this vital center.
The final point is that the NCDA urges the USDA to further explore long-term strategies designed to reduce the overall impact of the imported fire ant.
Long-term strategies include the development and implementation of imported fire ant biological control programs, along with the continued development of specific and environmentally benign tactics and materials for the control of fire ant.
In conclusion, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture urges continued support of the imported fire ant program, along with allocation of adequate funding necessary 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 to fully implement an effective regulatory program.
Thank you for the opportunity.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Don Alexander, please.
MR. DON ALEXANDER: Good Morning.
I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak to this panel this morning concerning Docket 00-0008-1.
I am Don Alexander.
I 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 am the Director of the Arkansas State Plant Board.
That's A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R.
We're the primary pest agency within the state.
That's not pest, but pest control agency within the state.
We perform the activities that exclude and eradicate those pests.
Since the fire ant was introduced in Mobile, Alabama, the federal imported fire ant quarantine has been the primary tool for regulation of its artificial spread, both north, east and west.
It has been responsible for the limitations of the pest's movement to within its full ecological range in the interim decades.
The quarantine has been successfully limiting the fire ant's range in the past.
It is currently working, and will continue to perform in the future, if USDA, APHIS, PPQ will continue to support the quarantine.
The foresight of the quarantine's creators has allowed the states to implement this important and vigilant task.
It is important that this effort continue to receive 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 this vital support from USDA, APHIS, PPQ in order to effectively limit the spread of this alien invasive species.
To efficiently provide quarantine continuity across the nation, USDA must furnish the support umbrella in the limitation of this pest.
It is in the interest of PPQ's five-year mandate to invest their dollars into interstate trade that the fire ant issue continues to garnish their 22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 fullest support.
Without the federal imported fire ant quarantine protection, uninfested states will be forced to enact individual external quarantines for their own protection.
Thirty-five potentially disparate quarantines could result in a trading quagmire whose outcome would be both economically and politically adverse.
One can only just imagine the shipping and regulatory nightmares that such an action would produce in the daily trade between and across these individual states.
One mission of USDA is to protect the nation from alien invasive pest species.
The fire ant not only affects native ant populations and impacts the trade of agricultural commodities, but also is a human health threat, as well.
Because of the wide nature of its impact on the American public, the continued advancement of the fire ant into virgin territories has made the fire ant issue high in citizen awareness.
For the past decade, many of the chemical control 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 tools have been withdrawn or are now only marginally effective.
In addition, there has also been a continued erosion of funding and resolve.
This lethal combination of events has allowed expansion of fire ants into previously free zones, thus affecting more people's lives than ever before.
I am here to ask you not to despair, but to find 23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 a renewed hope for the future.
While attending the annual IFA Research Conference over the past years, my staff members have learned of new tools for the battle and with that, new optimism.
Researchers across the South have been diligently searching for new ways to manage and mitigate the fire ant's impact on the human, animal and plant populations.
They have a clearer understanding of the fire ant, and are developing biological controls, and new chemical control tools.
These are proving not only ingenious, but effective for the management of this very serious threat.
I ask you not to look on the failures of the past decade, for we have survived.
We are standing on the brink of a wave of real progress through the use of more effective IPM tools.
This is not the time to abandon the fight.
This is the time to infuse crucial funding for the effort and support, not to rescind the regulatory framework.
Thank you 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 for your time.
I also have a letter that I would like to enter on the record from the Arkansas Legislative Joint Ag Committee.
It is signed by the senator, cochair, senator and representative.
I will not read it, but I would like to enter it in the record.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our next speaker is Mr. 24 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Robert Balaam.
MR. ROBERT BALAAM: Good Morning.
My name is Bob Balaam.
That's B-A-L-A-A-M.
I'm one of the few people here who doesn't talk Southern.
So, I hope you'll understand me.
As President of the National Plant Board, I am here representing the state plant regulatory agencies of the 50 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The National Plant Board provides leadership in plant protection and certification, and pest prevention and management, while striving to harmonize efforts to protect American agriculture, forestry, horticulture and the environment from harmful organisms.
We work to ensure a healthy and abundant source of food and fiber, and an economically viable agricultural industry, while practicing environmental stewardship.
We applaud the USDA, APHIS, PPQ for holding these meetings and permitting affected stakeholders to comment on the course of action that the agency should take in dealing 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 with plant protection programs that affect us all.
This provides the transparency parameter that stakeholders have been requesting from the agency.
It also provides a forum whereby congressional leaders -- those who provide the agency with the necessary legal and funding authorities -also have the opportunity to listen to the concerns of the agency's stakeholders.
25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 The imported fire ant is a serious pest currently found in 13 states.
This soil inhabiting pest creates serious problems for property owners where the pest is found.
The insect is not so much of a plant pest as it is a health risk for those individuals who may be stung when they come in contact with the fire ant mounds.
This includes agricultural workers, recreational program managers and everyday property owners.
The minimization of artificial spread of this pest has been the reason for a federal quarantine.
The federal quarantine provides a uniform, level playing field for those industries that ship nursery stock and other regulated articles interstate.
Without the existence of the federal quarantine, individual states would most likely promulgate their own quarantines based on specific concerns and pressures within their own states.
Such action would create havoc for those industries that might have to adhere to as many as 50 different quarantines.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 In recent years, imported fire ant populations within the quarantined area have increased in size exponentially, due to the loss of effective control tools and due to underfunding of quality-control measures within the federal regulatory programs.
As this pest population has increased within the infested area, it has put additional pressures on the 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ability of the regulatory programs to prevent imported fire ant spread through both natural and artificial means.
The states need USDA's continued and increased involvement to prevent imported fire ant spread to new areas, and to develop and implement biological control tools for suppression of imported fire ant populations within the infested areas.
Shipments of currently regulated articles that are certified as free of imported fire ant are arriving in uninfested states with imported fire ant present.
This should not happen if a plant quarantine were effective.
The USDA, APHIS, PPQ needs to provide increased oversight of cooperative agreements with state plan regulatory agencies for quarantine compliance in infested states or nurseries.
The current funding allocated by PPQ to infested states for ensuring such compliance is not sufficient.
Enforcement of a federal quarantine within an underfunded, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 infested state may not be a high enough priority of that state cooperator to dedicate the state funds for delivery of such a federal program.
The USDA needs to adequately fund these states and provide sufficient oversight of the state programs to ensure that the quarantine is adequately addressed.
Uninfested states are demanding the protection 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 that the federal quarantine is designed to afford them.
Since 1996, PPQ has funded the imported fire ant quarantine through a $1 million annual appropriation.
Prior to 1996, funding was at a much higher level.
A $1 million program has not been sufficient to contain the pest.
Additional infestations have broken out in New Mexico and California, because the $1 million fund has not provided that adequate protection.
Artificial spread has been substantive in recent years, due to reduction of federal resources into the program.
California alone will spend over $10 million annually for the next five years in an effort to eradicate imported fire ant from that state.
Natural spread can not be thwarted because of the loss of important pesticide treatments.
For fiscal year 2000, PPQ is proposing three options, as we heard Ron talk about earlier: One, maintain the federal quarantine, two, rescind the federal quarantine and develop model guidelines or three, establish a voluntary 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 nursery self-certification program.
The National Plant Board recommends that USDA, APHIS, PPQ at least maintain the current funding level of $100,000 for the current fiscal year.
More money is needed, if possible.
In addition, we are proposing a fourth option for fiscal year 2001, and that is increasing the baseline budget 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 of PPQ by $7.5 million to fund the imported fire ant quarantine program.
This will require additional money from Congress, and will require that Congress mandate that this money not be allowed to be redirected to other PPQ programs.
We recognize that PPQ has higher plant protection priorities within their current funding level.
An increase in global trade, new emerging plant pests and emergency plant protection programs such as the Asian Longhorned Beetle in New York and Illinois, Citrus Canker Disease in Florida, Medfly in California and Florida, and now Plumpox in Pennsylvania, have caused Plant Protection and Quarantine to place increased emphasis on Agricultural Quarantine Inspection activities -- that's AQI activities -- and have diminished the amount of available funds for domestic plant protection programs.
These AQI and emerging pest programs have been rightfully identified as high priorities for the agency and the states as PPQ cooperators.
There is still a need, however, for PPQ to maintain a presence in oversight 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and enforcement of domestic plant quarantines and other domestic programs.
Therefore, any additional money specifically directed to the agency as a result of this effort must be dedicated specifically for imported fire ant quarantine and methods development activity, or they will be quickly targeted by the agency for AQI activities and emerging plant 29 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 pest programs.
We feel that $1 million of the 7.5 million should be dedicated to development and implementation of a biological control of imported fire ant initiative.
From a long term standpoint, biological control programs are needed within the infested areas to reduce the pressure that causes natural spread and also to reduce the populations within nurseries, and thereby reduce the risk of artificial spread of imported fire ant.
Effective chemical tools for imported fire ant suppression and eradication are quickly becoming non-existent.
If the currently high imported fire ant population pressures can be reduced within the infested areas, the need for federal oversight and quality control of a federal quarantine will probably be lessened.
The National Plant Board thanks the USDA, APHIS, PPQ for the opportunity to publicly comment on this issue, and offers our continued cooperation in developing and delivering an adequately funded program that will support 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the needs of our members and stakeholders.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our next speaker is Mr. Gray Haun, please.
MR. GRAY HAUN: Good Morning.
My name is Gray Haun.
That's H-A-U-N.
As a state plant regulatory official for Tennessee and Plant Certification Administrator, I am here representing the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.
30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing in order that the consequences of potential decisions that can be made regarding the federal IFA quarantine will be better understood.
It also provides a forum whereby congressional leaders also have the opportunity to listen to the concerns of the agency stakeholders.
There are three basic options that are available for us for fiscal year 2000: One, maintain our imported fire ant program with minimal federal regulatory activity in line with the current funding; two, eliminate the imported fire ant regulations and develop model guidelines for states to use in harmonizing their quarantines; three, eliminate the imported fire ant regulations and establish a voluntary nursery certification program.
One of the major goals of Tennessee Plant Certification Section is the effective and efficient prevention of artificial movement of quarantined pests, including the imported fire ant. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 As a partially IFA infested state, Tennessee understands the benefits associated with a single set of federal IFA quarantine regulations, as opposed to many differing state IFA quarantines, and the importance of adequate enforcement of existing federal IFA quarantine regulations, as Tennessee has experienced numerous artificial introductions in noninfested areas.
31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 If the federal IFA quarantine is rescinded, there will be many state IFA quarantines, each of which will likely be considerably different from one another, and be more difficult and expensive to comply with than the existing federal IFA quarantine.
This will increase the cost of production of regulated articles for nurseries and other businesses affected by the quarantine, as well as limit their potential market because of the struggles and even impossibility of being able to track and meet differing state-by-state rules for how a crop must be grown, treated, shipped and the paperwork that must be kept.
Individual states could arbitrarily quarantine areas and make buffers in other states that are not actually IFA-infested, or increase the cost and time that the state in question would have to spend on survey activities to verify that an area is not IFA-infested.
Also, if the federal imported fire ant quarantine was rescinded, it is likely that the IFA laboratory in 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Gulfport, Mississippi assigned to finding ways to certify shipments free from IFA would be minimized, or totally eliminated in the future.
The facility provides much-needed research in the development and refinement of quarantine treatments for certification of regulated articles, biological control and the preparation and distribution of technical information on control, quarantine procedures and 32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 other IFA-related information.
If the federal IFA quarantine is continued for any appreciable amount of time, but underfunded, this will cause law-abiding businesses to be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace, due to the reduced enforcement of violations, compliance monitoring and fire ant surveys.
An underfunded federal IFA quarantine will result in a higher number of artificial IFA infestations in the noninfested area and cause political pressure to be exerted to rescind the federal IFA quarantine in favor of more strict state IFA quarantines.
An adequately funded federal IFA quarantine will result in a low number of artificial IFA infestations, a competitively fair marketplace, and appropriate levels of quarantine enforcement, monitoring and survey activities, as well as research for insecticide development, biological control and public awareness of the imported fire ant.
The serious impact of the pest and its ability to become 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 established in new areas by artificial movement makes quarantine activities against IFA necessary.
There is widespread consensus among the regulated businesses and state departments of agriculture that the federal IFA quarantine should continue, but at an increased level of funding so that both federal and state plant protection personnel can adequately perform the various 33 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 tasks associated with the quarantine.
The state of Tennessee is in agreement that the federal IFA quarantine should continue, and that funding should be increased considerably, at least to $7.5 million, as outlined by the National Plant Board.
The current fiscal year 2000 budget for the federal IFA quarantine calls for only $100,000, with over half of that money devoted to a research project in New Mexico.
This is totally unacceptable.
In reality, this budget level would make the federal IFA quarantine a law that is not enforced by federal officials because of a lack of funds to pay for the salaries and expenses of the employees who would perform the work.
Any enforcement or other quarantine-related activities would fall to the individual states to perform as best they could without the federal funding.
Imported fire ants were believed to have been first introduced in the U.S. in 1918 in Mobile, Alabama, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 through the removal of ballast soil from ships from South America.
There are numerous, well-documented problems associated with IFA.
These include medical, economic, agricultural, environmental, industrial, legal and political problems.
34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 In a small percentage of the human population, even a small number of IFA stings can cause a lifethreatening situation, due to anaphylactic shock.
While human deaths due to IFA are rare, they probably occur each year in the United States.
The most vulnerable are the very young and the very old, which may not be able to receive medical attention soon enough.
The actual number of human deaths due to IFA is not known due to underreporting and misdiagnosis of cause of death.
Other medical problems include secondary infections, cosmetic effects and pain.
The fear of IFA stings deters many outdoor activities.
Types of economic damage include structural damage to roads and sidewalks, electrical equipment damage, lawn, garden and ornamental damage, and problems with pets.
Much expense and time are given for only temporary management, as well as the use of noneffective products against IFA.
Other IFA costs include of course research and quarantine compliance and enforcement.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Agricultural problems include the death of animals, blindness and veterinary expense, decreased animal quality, crop damage due to a number of factors, such as damage and removal of seeds, damage to roots, tubers, stems and fruit, herding of aphids, mound interference with mechanical harvesting equipment, discouraging the use of hand labor, interference with biological control efforts, 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 damage to irrigation systems, and the expenses in use of control measures.
Environmental problems include pesticide overuse, damage to plants, reducing the invertebrate fauna, and impacting endangered species.
IFA interferes with hunting and fishing, and causes reduced utilization of parks and recreation areas.
IFA are attracted to and damage outdoor groundplaced industrial lighting, and destroys equipment involved in communication, electrical distribution, traffic control and cooling.
IFA may also bore through waste containment liners.
The various types of damage caused by IFA may generate liability suits due to death or injury from fire ant damage to equipment, fire ants in recreation areas and parks, hotels, businesses and nursing homes.
Fire ants cause political problems because of the differences as to who should deal with the ant, as well as how to deal with 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the ant.
All or part of 27 counties in southern Tennessee are already in the regulated area.
However, at least with the federal IFA quarantine, there is a consistent set of rules and approaches for all nurseries in the regulated area to produce and ship their plants into nonregulated areas.
In the next five to ten years, it is anticipated that a much 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 greater part of the nursery industry in Tennessee will be adversely affected by IFA as the natural migration northward continues.
It is important to protect this industry in Tennessee, as well as all the people of Tennessee, from the effects of the loss or underfunding of the federal IFA quarantine.
Even a small percentage decrease in the nursery industry in Tennessee would result in several millions of dollars of lost income and hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost state and local tax revenue annually.
We therefore, out of the above-mentioned options agree with option one, to maintain our imported fire ant program with minimal federal regulatory activity, in line with current funding for FY2000, although it is understood that more funding is necessary, if possible.
Option two, a harmonization plant would only work if states agreed to what were regulated items and how they would be cleared for movement.
Most states would probably prefer to set up their 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 own regulations without harmonization.
Option three, a voluntary nursery self-certification program is really not an alternative.
States are currently seeing new artificial infestations when nurseries are required to follow the federal program.
Again, Tennessee supports the National Plant Board's fourth option for fiscal year 2001, increasing the 37 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 baseline budget for PPQ by $7.5 million to fund IFA quarantine programs.
Tennessee appreciates USDA, APHIS, PPQ for giving us time to make comments as to how the imported fire ant program needs to administered, and what to do in the short term FY2000, prior to additional funding becoming available.
Thank you, sir.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our next speaker is Mr. Eelco Tinga.
And I hope I've pronounced that correctly.
MR. EELCO TINGA: Good Morning.
My name is Eelco Tinga, Jr., T-I-N-G-A.
I am president of Tinga Nursery, Incorporated, a family-owned business since 1913.
And we employ 20 to 30 people.
I'm also vice president of the North Carolina Association of Nurserymen.
And I am in favor of the current IFA program.
Two things interest me here, the continuity of the national program to regulate the fire ant.
And that would be to have all the states and all the businesses that 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ship plants know the rules and the ability to ship, and also to provide health and safety to the public and workers in a manner that's understood by all the people.
And I think that's very important.
And thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of the current IFA program.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Michael Worthington, please? 38 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 MR. MICHAEL WORTHINGTON: Hi, I'm Mike Worthington, W-O-R-T-H-I-N-G-T-O-N, of Worthington Farms in Greenville, North Carolina.
I am in a federal quarantine area.
If I knew there would be no regulation of nurseries located in fire ant infested areas, and there would be no restrictions on where I could ship my plant material, I might not be here today.
I do not expect that to happen.
I commonly ship plants to seven states.
Many are not under the federal fire ant quarantine.
I believe many of those states would choose to continue a slow-the-spread program.
My primary concern is that a uniform set of rules exist.
And if compliance is maintained, my company and others can ship to any state without any restriction.
I also have a concern that negative publicity generated from accidental shipments of fire ant-infested plants to noninfested areas could greatly damage the nursery industry as a whole.
"Child is injured by fire ants at local garden center," would not be a good headline for our 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 industry.
I intend to keep fire ants in check at my nursery for the safety of my employees and my customers.
Can we do the same for the health of the public and the plant industry? The nursery industry is one of the few profitable, growing areas of agriculture in the U.S.
I hope 39 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 we will continue to protect it from this potential pitfall.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. David Hyatt, please? MR. DAVID HYATT: This is in response to reference to Docket Number 00-008-1.
My name is David Hyatt.
I am the owner of Panoramic Farm, a wholesale nursery operation located in Union County, North Carolina.
My nursery, like many others around the nation, is a small, family owned farm business.
I employee 15 fulltime employees.
At this time, we have approximately 20 acres devoted to the production of nursery stock.
We offer a wide variety of plant material, including shrubs, trees, ornamental grasses and perennials.
Our material is shipped throughout the southeastern United States, from Georgia on up to New York.
The loss of the fire ant quarantine program could jeopardize our ability to market plants in many of these states.
Because of USDA, APHIS involvement in the quarantine, we have a consistent set of rules for all 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 nurseries to follow.
If the quarantine were not in place, individual states would develop their own rules, which would make it very difficult to nearly impossible for us to comply with the differing rules for each state concerning how a crop must be grown, treated, shipped and the records that must be kept.
The imported fire ant is both an invasive 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 species, and a human health threat.
Because of this, preventing the spread of imported fire ants is a legitimate public goal, and I feel a reasonable expenditure of public funds for the quarantine and research is warranted.
A standardized policy and adequate enforcement are needed to ensure that businesses such as mine, which are in compliance, are not at a competitive disadvantage with nurseries in other states that have differing regulations.
This is possible only if adequate funding is available for a nationwide quarantine program.
We bear a considerable cost to comply with the quarantine requirements.
In 1999, we spent $7,000 on fire ant treatment.
Because of additional production space to be added this year, our costs will increase to over $10,000 annually.
If we hope to reduce these costs over time, we need measures in place that will continue the research into more efficient and cost effective means of control.
At this time, our industry is the most promising 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 growth segment in American agriculture.
It has grown approximately 5 percent annually during the last decade.
If we hope to continue this steady growth, I feel we must implement a partnership between the federal and state governments which would restore the $3.5 million in funding for the USDA, APHIS fire ant program.
The continued funding of this program, along with contributions from those within 41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 the industry, will help to ensure an effective quarantine for years to come.
In closing, it is imperative that the USDA, APHIS standardize regulations pertaining to the fire ant quarantine program.
If this vital program is abandoned, the millions spent by nursery owners and operators to comply with the current regulations will have been for naught.
In addition, the lack of a standardized policy covering all states will place additional financial and logistical burdens on nursery operations.
It is our industry's hope that you will see the benefits of this program, and implement measures that will ensure its viability and effectiveness for years to come.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Roger Spivey, please? MR. ROGER SPIVEY: It's Spivey, S-P-I-V-E-Y.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Good Morning.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to present the Tennessee Nursery and Landscape Association's comments as they concern Docket Number 00-0008-1.
I'm the Executive Vice President of the Tennessee Nursery and Landscape Association.
TNLA is a 95-year-old association with 650 plus members.
Our membership has seen the industry progress 42 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 through good times and bad.
Every day they accept the challenges of the elements and the marketplace.
The fire ant not only challenges their ability to conduct business, it also presents a health hazard to their families and neighbors.
If it were an industry problem, they would deal with it.
But it is much more, potentially a national health problem.
The federal government must assist our industry in research and containment of this infestation.
The only way to contain it is federal sanctions for anyone who does not follow guidelines.
Individual states do not have the authority or strength to enforce a quarantine that threatens the public welfare.
The Tennessee Nursery and Landscape Association members are in support of continuation of the imported fire ant quarantine.
There are presently three options available.
If we must choose, we vote to continue the quarantine as it presently exists.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 We however feel the quarantine is not sufficient.
For the future of the green industry in Tennessee, this quarantine must be given more strength, and that means additional funding.
Mr. Gray Haun of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the Southern Plant Board and the National Plant Board have given you a fourth option.
And TNLA supports 43 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 this option.
This is one of, as most of the people in this room know, two of the busiest times of the year for the nursery industry, and especially in Tennessee.
For that reason, I, as the executive vice president, will present statements, if permissible, from TNLA members who could not make the trip to Raleigh.
First, Mr. Ed Porter, Porter Farms, past President of ANLA, TNLA and past commissioner of agriculture for the state of Tennessee: "As a past commissioner of agriculture for the State of Tennessee, I see the chaos that will be caused, should the USDA, APHIS quarantine be suspended.
An already overloaded state department would be required to administer an individual quarantine, and then oversee compliance of 49 other state quarantines."
He also states, "as a grower, it will be difficult to adhere to additional regulations that would be promulgated by individual states.
We now must follow only one set of regulations.
This is how it should remain."
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Mr. Frank Collier is vice president of Pleasant Cove Nursery, also of Tennessee.
"Should the existing quarantine be lifted, it will create a tremendous impact and burden on the ball and burlap industry in Tennessee.
Growers who have been conducting business for years will be forced to retool in order to comply with regulations each state will enact."
44 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Our fourth member is Mr. Greg Dunn, the owner of Morning Star Nursery and a past president of TNLA.
He states, "fire ants involves not only the nursery industry, but the sod, cattle and any other nontilled land in Tennessee.
The possibly more important question than how it affects the agricultural industry, but what is the possible hazard to small children and animals.
This now becomes a public safety question, which USDA and other federal agencies must maintain a firm control of the program.
This is now too important a program to turn over to the individual states to administer."
And last, Mr. Jerry Blankenship, past president of TNLA, and a past employee of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture: "The areas that are now most infested ship within the infested area.
With the introduction of the fire ant into Tennessee, North Carolina, and other states, the situation has changed completely.
Tennessee ships 90 percent of its half billion dollar nursery production to now 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 non-infested areas.
A firm and enforceable quarantine must remain in place.
In coming years, it must be improved to continue to ensure the spread of fire ants does not continue.
This will require continued USDA and other federal agencies' involvement."
As you have heard from these industry leaders in Tennessee, this is a priority and concern for our members.
45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 I want to thank you for the opportunity to share the Tennessee green industry's concern for the fire ant, not just a question of how to maintain or improve the quarantine, but the more important concern of the potential public health question.
Thank you, Gentlemen.
MR. LIDSKY: Mr. Ted Bilderback, please? MR. TED BILDERBACK: My name is Ted Bilderback, that's B-I-L-D-E-R-B-A-C-K.
I'm the Nursery Extension Specialist at North Carolina State University.
And I am here to speak to 00-008-1, the imported fire ant program.
The nursery and greenhouse industry in the U.S. is the fastest growing segment, you've heard an increase of 5 percent each year.
The nursery and greenhouse industry is becoming increasingly important to local, state and federal economies.
In North Carolina, 1997 figures from the Ag Research Service provided by Doyle Johnson, in North Carolina it was a $943,000,000.00 industry.
That was large 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 enough to place us third in the U.S., and 13.4 percent of the farm receipts in North Carolina, which ranks us currently either first or second.
When I tell you that the nursery greenhouse industry ranks first or second in North Carolina, that's a big statement when you go back to historically, the position of tobacco, and what the tobacco economy has meant to North 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Carolina.
So this industry is increasingly becoming important to the economy of North Carolina, and throughout the U.S.
As a Nursery Extension Specialist, I am familiar with the impact and the effect of the imported fire ant on the nursery industry.
I'm familiar with the advancing front, as it moves through our state each year, and how many more new growers each year have to begin fire ant free programs.
For this to have a good set of rules is very important, as people try and attempt to comply with these rules.
And we need this uniform method of compliance which is administered by USDA, APHIS.
Also, having experienced bites from fire ants in a nursery setting, although not in North Carolina -- because we do a good job of maintaining those -- I have firsthand experience that a uniform set of rules should be enforced, to reduce the movement of this invasive species.
And we 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 need further research in the control, to reduce the movement and control of this invasive species.
The North Carolina nursery industry then, strongly urges the continuance of the USDA, APHIS imported fire ant quarantine, and the funds need to be reinstated and actually increased for this program.
This option provides a uniform set of regulations for slowing the movement of the 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 imported fire ant.
The loss of this option, one, will likely create chaos in the enforcement and fail in slowing the movement and controlling the movement of the imported fire ant.
Although the funding is limited, this option needs to be continued considering the exponential growth of the nursery industry.
With the increase in numbers of growers that's occurring and with the increased acreage that's grown and with the importance of this industry, being the most rapid segment of increased production in the U.S., it is critical that this budget be reinstated, and actually increased -- increase the expenditure for this quarantine program.
Thank you very much.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Joe Stoffregen.
I hope that's pronounced correctly.
MR. JOE STOFFREGEN: Good Morning.
My name is Joe Stoffregen, that's S-T-O-F-F-R-E-G-E-N.
My family operates Homewood Nursery and Garden Center in the north 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Raleigh area.
We are a retail nursery garden center and greenhouses that includes greenhouse production facilities.
We grow a wide variety of flowering and foliage plants, including bedding plants, geraniums, hanging baskets, perennials and poinsettias.
We employ just under 50 people.
I am also the president of the North Carolina Association of Nurserymen, a trade association that represents over 900 48 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 members in North Carolina, and is one of the largest and most active state associations in the Southeast.
On behalf of my family business and NCAN, I urge you to continue to fund and enforce the fire ant quarantine.
My reasons are as follows: A consistent set of rules from the federal government makes more sense than each state grappling with this issue individually, and coming up with separate rules that will vary from state to state and make interstate business more difficult and confusing to conduct.
Loss of the quarantine will threaten market access affecting nurseries in the south and west trying to ship to other parts of the country.
The quarantine is also consistent with the current Executive Order on Invasive Species.
The nursery industry is the bright spot in agriculture in our country.
We do not often seek or desire federal assistance.
But this is an area where the 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 government is needed, and whose involvement would be appreciated.
My last reason is a bit more personal.
Fire ants are an aggressive and invasive species that do pose a health threat to all of us.
I have three small children and live in a neighborhood that does not have fire ants.
For my children's sake, I would like to keep it that way.
49 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 I urge you to restore the 3.5 million in funding to the USDA fire ant line item to ensure a viable and effective quarantine.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our last registered speaker is Mr. Craig Regelbrugge, please.
MR. CRAIG REGELBRUGGE: Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.
My name is Craig Regelbrugge, R-E-G-E-L-B-R-U-GG-E, with the American Nursery and Landscape Association.
And ANLA expresses its appreciation to APHIS for scheduling this, as well as the three other public hearings which will take place over the next two weeks around the country to receive testimony on the status and the future of the federal domestic quarantine for imported fire ant.
ANLA is the national trade organization for the nursery and landscape industry, directly representing 2,300 nursery and greenhouse growers, landscape professionals and independent retail garden centers, and as well through the membership of state and regional associations, helping to 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 represent the views of an additional 15,000 small and family businesses in the industry.
According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, the nursery and greenhouse industry remains the fastest growing agricultural sector in terms of cash receipts.
Others have already spoken to the fact that we are the bright spot in American agriculture at a time 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 when much of agriculture is in very difficult times, or even in decline.
The 1997 Census of Agriculture shows that nursery, greenhouse and floriculture crop sales totaled 10.9 billion in 1997, which represents a 43-percent increase in sales over the previous census.
And frankly, we believe that the census numbers are low compared to other USDA estimates.
Together, our crops make up 11 percent of total U.S. farmgate receipts, up from 10 percent in 1992.
We now rank as the third largest plant crop, behind corn and soybeans, but ahead of such major crops as wheat, cotton and tobacco.
Nursery and greenhouse crop production now ranks among the top five agricultural commodities in 24 states and among the top 10 in 40 states.
The environment for this industry's growth and for orderly commerce and the marketing of nursery crops has been enhanced by nursery licensing, inspection, certification and quarantine programs of the federal 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 government, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its state counterparts.
A continued investment in such programs is warranted, given our industry's growing importance and economic contribution.
ANLA vigorously supports the continuation and adequate funding and enforcement of the federal imported fire ant quarantine.
I'd like to comment on several aspects 51 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 of that position.
But also for those of you, particularly of the industry who are present here today, I'd like to state to you that this position has been developed over ten years of extensive consultation with the industry in both infested and in uninfested areas.
IFA, as we've heard already, is a serious and costly invasive pest.
Its impacts on agriculture, other industries, natural resources and as a nuisance and human health pest have been well documented.
Management of IFA impacts remains a major research effort at both the federal and state level.
And early predictions of a very limited favorable range for IFA in North America have already been proven wrong.
At a minimum, it is reasonable to expect that much of Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Hawaii are vulnerable to IFA 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 infestation.
Evidence also suggests that IFA may survive in much colder climates associated with buildings and other structural protection.
If this is true, most of the continental United States and Hawaii could ultimately be affected.
Minimizing both the rate of spread of IFA to uninfested areas, and the impacts within infested areas are 52 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 matters of sound public policy.
ANLA finds it astounding that for many years, USDA has not sought budgetary resources to maintain an effective quarantine program.
The contiguous area of IFA infestation now stretches from eastern North Carolina through Florida and west, through much of Texas.
Huge areas of the U.S. are still uninfested, and want to stay free of this significant human health and agricultural pest for as long as possible.
Given that the major IFA quarantine purpose is to minimize the long distance artificial spread of the pest, from a nursery perspective, the quarantine has worked rather effectively over the years.
Infested states in the south and southeast are major plant producers and shippers to points north.
Florida is the second largest nursery and greenhouse production state in the U.S. Texas and North Carolina are duking it out for third, as we speak, but both are very major players.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Millions of plants are shipped up the eastern seaboard, to the Midwest and even in some cases, to the West each year with very infrequent quarantine violations.
In recent years, though, quarantine violations and localized infestations of imported fire ant seem to be on the increase.
To the extent nursery plants are contributing to 53 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 this situation, the evidence suggests that the problems are mostly associated with the movement of uncertified plant material, which is a failure of the quarantine from the standpoint of enforcement and oversight.
We think, as Bob Balaam alluded to already, that there is a direct correlation between decreasing funding, decreasing enforcement and oversight, and the increase in such quarantine violations.
In the end, it's a case of "you get what you pay for."
Talking a little bit about the consequences of deregulation, the quarantine, as we've already heard, establishes a framework for the coordinated and consistent approach to slowing the fire ant spread.
Without USDA involvement, states will have to endure alone the burden of trying to deal with these pests.
Experience with other quarantine pests and noxious weeds has clearly demonstrated that meaningful federal participation enhances the effort.
States have varying resources and priorities.
If 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 efforts are not unified, one state's vigilance is easily undermined by a neighboring state with a lax quarantine program.
Several factors associated with the national marketplace for nursery stock, including short interval delivery and brokerage, also contribute to a greater risk when certification and shipping regulations vary from state 54 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 to state.
All this translates to a less effective effort to slow IFA's spread.
APHIS has suggested that it could play a role in the development of a model quarantine for states to consistently adopt.
The closest model for such an effort has involved Japanese Beetle.
While the harmonization effort for Japanese Beetle has made some progress, there is still not full adherence to the framework that was set up through the Japanese Beetle Harmonization Program, after nearly 10 years of effort and considerable investment and negotiations by USDA, states, and the private industry.
Neither APHIS, nor the states has an adequate transition strategy that would allow for a uniform, consistent, binding and effective approach to managing the fire ant risk.
Only the umbrella of a federal quarantine creates the environment for such an approach.
Uninfested states should be especially concerned over deregulation now, just as IFA is beginning to spread 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 into middle Tennessee, further east in North Carolina and towards southeast Virginia, these are very major nursery areas which will likely contribute to the long distance spread of IFA, if we no longer have consistent expectations for nursery stock certification.
The same may hold true for southern California.
Eventually IFA will spread by natural means, and 55 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 accidental artificial spread to occupy its potential natural range in North America.
There will be a point somewhere between now and then when the cost of maintaining the quarantine will exceed the benefit to uninfested areas.
We do not believe that we are anywhere near that point at this time.
IFA quarantine revocation will be disruptive for states and for private industry.
A decision to revoke the quarantine should only be made after an economic analysis of the quarantine's cost, versus the resources that would otherwise be spent controlling the pest in currently protected pest free areas.
I'd like to make a couple of comments on the resource side of the equation.
USDA, APHIS seems to suggest that the loss of funding for the quarantine effort indicates a lack of congressional and public support.
Such an assertion is only partly true, at best.
For years the administration has played a game with the appropriations 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 process, proposing elimination of funding for the IFA program, while knowing that congressional leaders would restore funding.
Unfortunately, last year IFA funding finally slipped through the cracks of an increasingly complex appropriations process, leading to the current crisis.
Prior to the worsening federal funding shortfalls 56 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 of the last few years, the quarantine was truly a partnership effort.
The federal share covered certain administrative activities, and assisted with state level efforts such as survey and compliance monitoring efforts.
Affected state departments of agriculture provided most of the funding and the staffing to carry out in-state responsibilities.
And the regulated industry absorbed the cost of treatments and inspections needed to certify their product for movement.
Unfortunately, the funding burden has shifted increasingly to the states with growing inconsistencies and shortcomings in the process.
Some have suggested that if industry benefits from the quarantine, industry should fund a greater share.
In reality, the benefits of the quarantine accrue broadly to governments, industry and the residents of areas that are protected from infestation.
There is a legitimate role, therefore, for government funding most of the quarantine activities.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Individual nurseries participating in the fire ant free nursery program incur direct treatment costs, often in excess of tens or even over a $100,000 annually for some of the larger operations.
The labor associated with scouting, record keeping and similar administrative expenses is over and above those direct treatment costs.
In short, industry has given at the office, and should not be looked 57 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 to for funding general quarantine activities.
In conclusion, IFA is a national problem.
Considerable areas of the U.S. are vulnerable to its infestation over time.
A coherent regulatory partnership between USDA, APHIS, the states and industry can effectively slow the spread of IFA to new areas.
The program, properly funded, is consistent with and supportive of U.S. goals relative to mitigating invasive species impacts.
Deregulation will jeopardize efforts to protect areas that are presently free, and shift an undue burden onto states in the affected industry.
The quarantine should be maintained, and federal assistance should be restored.
The administration should vigorously support reinstatement of adequate federal funds for the federal government to fulfill its partnership obligation to the IFA quarantine.
According to the National Plant Board, who has done some recent calculations, federal funding of 7.5 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 million beginning in FY2001 will accommodate an effective regulatory program.
We have attached to our testimony a copy of the detailed funding analysis developed by the National Plant Board.
Finally, USDA, APHIS has maintained an imported fire ant methods development program, which has contributed immeasurably to an effective and cost-effective quarantine.
58 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Funding is derived from a separate line item of the APHIS budget.
This methods development effort should continue.
There is major work to do, for example, in the area of finalizing some potentially promising treatments, which would make certification of field grown ball and burlap nursery stock easier and most cost effective.
Thank you for this opportunity to present the views of the American Nursery and Landscape Association on this issue.
We pledge to work with APHIS, with the National Plant Board, with Congress and others to ensure an effective, consistent and reasonable imported fire ant quarantine.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Regelbrugge is the last registered speaker.
Are there any other persons who have not registered, who have any comments they would like to make? Sir? MR. JAMES SCOGGINS: Good Morning, and thank you.
I appreciate the opportunity to provide input in this public 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 hearing.
My name is James Scoggins.
I'm with White Nurseries of North Carolina, where I manage that facility.
I'm speaking on behalf of Horticultural Farms, Incorporated who owns White Nurseries of Cairo, Georgia.
They own White Nurseries of North Carolina, and they own Berry Hill Nurseries in Springfield, Ohio.
White Nurseries in Cairo, Georgia has been in 59 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 business as a wholesale nursery for a 113 years.
We were there before the fire ants.
It employs about 650 team members.
Berry Hill Nurseries in Springfield, Ohio is outside of the quarantine area, but it has been in business for 86 years.
It employs 120 team members.
The site at LaGrange, White Nurseries of North Carolina, has been in business for four years.
We employ 45 team members.
When I walked that property, there were two hills of fire ants on it.
We have numerous fire ants in the area today.
As a group, we grow more than 3,000 line items of plant material, and ship into more than 30 states, just about every state east of the Mississippi and some on the other side.
As a nursery, we bear considerable cost to comply with the quarantine requirements.
If you go back to the first period of time when the regulations came into effect, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 our costs were about $40,000 on the chloridine system.
When Talstar came into effect, it went up to over $200,000.
Currently with Fire-Ban, it's costing us more than $80,000.
We need to continue operation of the fire ant research station in our opinion in order to search for and provide better ways to control the fire ants.
If you've ever stepped in a bed of fire ants and 60 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 it's crawled up your leg and bit you about a hundred times, you don't want that rascal around anywhere.
Those of us who have it are having to live with it.
We don't need to share that with people that don't have it.
In fact, I suspect that if the people outside of the quarantine area knew what was in store for them, if fire ants were to intrude into their area, there wouldn't be enough room in this entire complex to house the people who would be here giving input into this hearing.
We're on the side of the growers' side, so we see what's happening.
So hopefully we can provide input that you can carry back, and do something gainful with.
We'd like to continue to work with the imported fire ant research lab, as I said, to search for better control.
We ask that you maintain the federal imported fire ant regulation program and continue this quarantine program, and we ask for funding for the USDA, APHIS fire ant line item of $7.5 million.
Thank you.
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 MR. LIDSKY: Any other persons that would like to speak, comments, questions? Sir? MR. MIKE EVANS: My name is Mike Evans, E-V-A-N-S.
I'm the Director of the Plant Protection Division within the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
I'd like to take a few minutes this morning reiterate what my colleagues from the other state regulatory agencies have 61 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 stated.
The green industry in Georgia is growing by leaps and bounds, as well as in other states.
The fire ant regulations in place even the playing field for the large nurseries likewise, down in Cairo, as well as the small nurseries that are starting up.
If the fire ant quarantine were to be lifted, it is my opinion and the opinion of many of the nursery folks with whom I've spoken, that this would create an uneven playing field, put them at an economic disadvantage, trying to compete with larger nurseries.
Georgia is in support of the National Plant Board proposal of $7.5 million for fire ant, and for leaving the fire ant quarantine in place.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Any other persons who would like to speak? I have a few brief remarks.
I'd like to thank everyone for coming out and showing their support for the program.
I can assure you that these comments will 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 be carefully considered, both by the PPQ management team, the regional and national plant board, and we certainly appreciate the unequivocal support that has been shown today for this program.
Mr. Milberg or Mr. Collins, do you have any comments that you'd like to make before we close? MR. COLLINS: I just want to mention about three or four emerging technologies that some people may be 62 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 interested in here.
I think the next insecticide that you'll see available for use in nursery stock is a product called fipronil.
It's highly effective at low dose rates, applied at .1 pounds AI per acre on grass sod, we get season long control.
At 25 ppm in potting media, we get two years of control.
Probably the next emerging technology beyond that is a product called Spinout which contains biphenthren impregnated into that technology inside the container.
So, that eliminates the necessity of blending the toxigen into the media.
We're starting to work with some Promethean film, which is laid down as a weed barrier, has insecticide.
So that's what to be looking for.
MR. MILBERG: I'd just like to thank everyone again for attending.
And a special thanks to Edna Suggs for setting this facility up for us.
It worked out very well, Edna, and we appreciate all your efforts.
MR. LIDSKY: And lastly, if you have the time, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 there is the survey form, and I have extra copies of it here.
And there are some on the registration table.
You can leave your completed survey either here or on the registration table.
Thank you very much.
(Whereupon, at 10:45 a.m., the hearing was concluded.)
