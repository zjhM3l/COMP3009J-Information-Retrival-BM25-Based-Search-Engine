Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts # Consistent with the realignment of the Office of the Chief Information Officer as a direct report to the Secretary, the Office of Security and the Office of the Chief Information Officer are separately identified in this budget submission.
The Office of the Chief Information Officer is also funded within the Other Defense Activities account and comparability adjustments have been included for FY 2001 and FY 2002.
# Consistent with the realignment of the Critical Infrastructure Protection program from the Office of Security to the Office of Emergency Operations, this budget reflects no funding for the Critical Infrastructure Program in the Office of Security.
Funding is shown in the Office of Emergency Operations budget which is also a part of Other Defense Activities.
Comparability adjustments have been included for FY 2001 and FY 2002.
# The development of advanced safeguards and security technologies has resulted in the modernization of numerous protective measures for the Department, as well as the ability to mitigate new and emerging threats that otherwise represent critical vulnerabilities.
# Training technology applications have been enhanced and a broader range of technologies has been applied to Departmental training, i.e., expanded use of interactive television, mobile training teams, and televideo conferences to provide requisite training for a larger number of students without funding increases.
Since the attack on September 11, the DOE Nonproliferation and National Security Institute (NNSI) conducted DOE Basic Security Police Officer Training courses to accommodate increased security force personnel needs.
In addition, as part of support for other government agencies, the NNSI is developing critically needed training support for the US Capitol Police; training for FBI regional teams, training foreign police officers for the State Department Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program to protect the U.S. Embassies, and providing staffing expertise for the State Department Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism.
The NNSI has conducted numerous international vulnerability assessments and training to international officials.
Finally, to keep security training sharply focused and standardized, a formal security Professional Development Program is in the process of being implemented.
# The Classification/Declassification program has played a key role in protecting our national security by developing new and revising existing classification and control guidance that identifies information that warrants protection in the interest of the national security.
The program continues to implement P.L. 105261, section 3161, by: (1) Removing from public access classified nuclear weapon design and utilization information (Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD)) inadvertently released in records declassified under EO 12958.
All inadvertent releases are identified to the source agency for training purposes and are documented in quarterly reports to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and to Congress.
(2.)
Preventing further inadvertent releases of RD and FRD by providing training and accreditation of other-agency reviewers and by providing quality control oversight of their work.
# The DOE Information Security program continues to provide support to the Department in analyzing and deterring major incidents involving the compromise of classified information.
This includes expansion of the Other Defense Activities/Security/ Nuclear Safeguards and Security
FY 2003 Congressional Budget
computer forensics capability to support investigations and prosecutions of unauthorized disclosures of classified information and expansion of the Technical Surveillance Countermeasures program.
# The Office of Security (SO) provided critical leadership to support the DOE's foreign visits, assignments and travel (FV T) responsibilities and competed implementation of PDD-61.
SO accomplishments A include automated tracking and accountability of PDD-61 requirements, reestablishing the Department's standing with the Department of State as an Exchange Visitor Program sponsor, establishing a Departmental training academy for FV T policy/system implementation, completing the transition of the A Department's Foreign Travel Program from the CFO to SO, and replacing a retired main-frame legacy foreign travel system with a centralized, secure web-based application accessible by multiple DOE sites, using any computer and current Internet browser.
# The Office of Security completed consolidating and institutionalizing responsibilities for the accurate tracking and reporting of sensitive nuclear materials inventories under one office.
This has resulted in improvements in inventory information and accounting systems used to support Departmental nuclear materials missions and decision-making.

Classification/Declassification Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives The Department of Energy (DOE) has a unique, statutorily based responsibility to implement the Governmentwide program to classify and declassify nuclear weapons-related technology (classified as Restricted Data).
DOE is also responsible for implementing the requirements contained in Executive Order 12958 to classify and declassify other information that is critical to the national security (classified as National Security Information).
To fulfill these responsibilities, the mission of the Classification/Declassification program is to develop (1) Government-wide policies and technical guidance to identify nuclear weapons-related information that warrants protection and (2) DOE-wide policies and guidance to identify other information that is critical to protecting the national security.
This critical program is a cornerstone of the United States nuclear nonproliferation and security program since an asset cannot be protected until it is identified as requiring protection.
Consistent with this mission, the Classification/Declassification program funds support service contractors at Headquarters and management and operating contractors in the field who provide highly technical support through: Â· Assisting in the development of general policies, procedures, and guidance to ensure that classified and controlled information is identified consistently by personnel within the Department and other Government agencies.
Conducting appraisals of DOE, including NNSA, organizations and visits to other Government agencies to ensure they are conforming with these policies, procedures, and guidance.
Assisting in the development of detailed technical classification and control guidance to identify information that requires protection in the interest of the national security.
Conducting training within the Department and for other agencies to ensure that personnel identify and protect sensitive nuclear weapon design information and other national security information.
Conducting declassification reviews and audits of documents required under statute and Executive order.
Developing state-of-the-art technology to enhance the classification and declassification process, making it more efficient and effective.

FY 2003 Congressional Budget
Security Investigations Program Mission The Security Investigations Program funds background investigations for all Department of Energy (DOE) Federal employees and contractors who, in the performance of their official duties, require access authorizations for Restricted Data, National Security Information, or certain quantities of special nuclear material.
Program Performance Goal Reduce DOE's vulnerability to espionage, theft, diversion, loss, or unauthorized access or use of the Department's critical assets and information.
This will be accomplished by ensuring the proper allocation of security investigations funding to DOE program and operations offices.
(This line-item budget's primary function is to distribute funding for security investigations Department-wide for the cost of FBI and OPM investigative services.
A very small portion of the funding also supports related miscellaneous costs associated with maintaining the Security Investigations Program.)
Performance Indicator # Track DOE operations offices' monthly investigation requests, invoices, and costs to ensure security investigations funds are properly allocated between the field offices and are being used only to reimburse the FBI and OPM for services rendered.
Monitor annual case submissions and costs for accurate forecasting of future security investigations funding requirements.
#
Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts # In FY 2001, for the first time since FY 1998, the security investigation costs for field non-federal employees' security investigations were directly funded in the Security Investigations budget, rather than from the program office budgets (excluding those from the Office of Naval Reactors).
The Security Investigations budget was appropriated at $33 million in FY 2001.
Prior-year carryover of $8.2 million was available to supplement the appropriated funds which precluded major funding shortages for investigations in FY 2001.
#
Other Defense Activities/Security Security Investigations
FY 2003 Congressional Budget
#
In FY 2002, full funding was required for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigations, as a result of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y 2000 (S.1059, Section 3144), which ear requires that personnel in positions that are of such a critical nature that any compromise could gravely impact U.S. national security have background investigations conducted by the FBI.
People in less sensitive positions will continue to have their investigations performed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
The FBI investigations are more expensive than OPM investigations, resulting in a significant budget increase.
In order to ensure that the number of access authorizations (personnel security clearances) is consistent with mission requirements, the number of "Q" access authorizations is expected to gradually increase in FY 2002 and FY 2003 due to heightened security requirements and Congressional add-ons to the Weapons Appropriation which will accommodate a larger work force for the Defense Programs mission.
In response to heightened security concerns following September 11, 2001, the DOE complex will be increasing the number of Security Police Officers, thereby creating a need for additional initial investigation funding.
After 5 years of little activity, "L" reinvestigations will resume in FY 2002, which will require increased funding.
The reinvestigation interval for "L" access authorizations, which requires a National Agency Check (NAC), changed from 5 to 10 years in March 1997.

Site Description Operations Offices The Security Investigations budget provides funding to the personnel security offices to pay for background investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for DOE Federal employees and contractors.
Background investigations are required for personnel who, in the performance of their official duties, require access to classified information or certain quantities of special nuclear material.
The investigation is one of the tools used by DOE security personnel to determine if an individual will receive a DOE access authorization (personnel security clearance).
Washington Headquarters The Security Investigations budget provides funding for background investigations conducted by the FBI and OPM for DOE Headquarters Federal staff and contractors.
This budget also supports programs under Related Security Investigations Activities required to assure a viable personnel security function.
This includes enhancements to the Electronic Transfer Program and DOE Integrated Safeguards and Security (DISS) personnel security databases to support additional functionality and security features.
Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, provides DOE with technical support for implementation, training, operation, and quality assurance of the personnel security process, and a variety of research and analysis activities in support of personnel security functions.
ORISE conducts these programs for DOE through a management and operating contract with Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU).
Albuquerque Operations Office The Albuquerque Operations Office receives funding for background investigations and for costs to maintain the DOE Test Center/Accelerated Access Authorization Program (AAAP).
Support through the Nonproliferation and National Security Institute (NNSI) is also provided to develop and distribute briefing materials as required by the refresher briefing provisions in DOE O 470.1, Chapter 4, "Safeguards and Security Awareness Program."
Materials are posted on the NNSI web-site and made available to all DOE Federal and contractor sites required to provide refresher briefings to employees.

FY 2003 Congressional Budget
Security Investigations Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives The Security Investigations budget funds background investigations for DOE Federal employees and contractors who, in the performance of their official duties, require access authorizations for Restricted Data, National Security Information, or certain quantities of special nuclear material.
Security Investigations are required in order to be in compliance with Section 145 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 710; and Executive Order 12968.
The Department primarily utilizes the services of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct security investigations which serve as the basis for these access authorizations.
FBI investigations are required for individuals in positions that are of such a critical nature that any compromise could gravely impact U.S. national security.
The cost of security investigations depends on the type and level of investigation needed.

Headquarters Other Related Expenses provides funding for administrative expenses that support the Federal workforce in training, computer hardware and software acquisitions, commercial timesharing services, telecommunications, office supplies, publications and subscriptions, and other miscellaneous items necessary for day-to-day office operations.
Funds increased due to upgrading the required equipment necessary for the protection and safekeeping of the Secretary of Energy.
Similar support is provided to the Federally staffed New Brunswick Laboratory in addition to fixed funding for building and ground maintenance; custodial services; environmental, safety, and health services; utility costs; and technical information services.
Funding is also provided to fund its share towards health care services and the campus Fire Department.
Headquarters Working Capital Fund provides funding for mandatory administrative costs, such as automated office support, telephone services, postage, printing and graphics, supplies, copiers, building occupancy (rent, space, and utilities), and payroll services.
Payments to this fund reflect usage of services which are priced and charged to users in accordance with policies established by the Working Capital Fund Board.
Increase of funding for the Working Capital Fund will provide for escalation costs and support of 11 additional employees.
The performance measure for the support of the activities funded under the Working Capital Fund is to control costs associated with these activities where possible and to adequately fund them through the budget process.
SO regularly monitors all expenditures in the Working Capital Fund and has reduced, to the extent possible, utilization of services provided through this fund.
Further per capita reductions, in keeping with good business practices, is a performance measure SO sets for itself in this account.
