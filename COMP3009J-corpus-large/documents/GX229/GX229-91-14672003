Human Services Human Services Department Venerria Knox, Director Contact Information Department Information Line: (206) 684-0100 City of Seattle General Information: (206) 684-2489 TTY: (206) 615-0476 On the Web at: http://www.cityofseattle.net/humanservices/ Department Description The Human Services Department's (HSD) mission is to find and fund solutions for human needs so that lowincome, vulnerable residents in greater Seattle can live and thrive.
HSD contracts with more than 230 community-based human service providers and administers programs to ensure that residents of Seattle and King County have food and shelter, productive education and job opportunities, adequate health care, and many more of life's basic necessities.
HSD has adopted a set of community goals to guide its investments.
HSD works towards ensuring that all people have: - food to eat and a roof overhead; - supportive relationships within families, neighborhoods, and communities; - a safe haven from all forms of violence and abuse; - health care to be as physically and mentally fit as possible; and - the education and job skills to lead an independent life.
To accomplish these goals, HSD is organized into the following lines of business that encompass a continuum of care for the neediest populations: - Area Agency on Aging - Senior and Adult Self-Sufficiency - Child Development - Youth Development - Family Development - Children, Youth, and Family Resource Development - Emergency and Transitional Services - Community Facilities - Community Services System and Resource Development - Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention - Leadership and Administration The professionals who work at HSD are committed to working with the community to provide appropriate, culturally competent services.
Policy and Program Changes The Human Services Department (HSD) contracts with community-based organizations to provide programs and services to clients.
Approximately 72% of the Department's budget goes toward contracts with communitybased organizations.
Through this funding, HSD maintains a continuum of services, including crisis intervention, stabilization, and prevention programs.
HSD undertook an extensive community process in the spring of 2002 to allow input into categorizing services funded by the Department into core and non-core in order to provide a funding framework.
The community process yielded the Human Services Policy Framework, City of Seattle 2003 Adopted and 2004 Endorsed Budget 145
Human Services which identified core services that informed decision-making for the 2003 Adopted and 2004 Endorsed Budget.
Those services are as follows: 1.
Food banks and emergency meal programs 2.
Shelter, rent assistance, and transitional housing 3.
Domestic violence and sexual assault services 4.
Case management services that help to maintain the health of elders and people with disabilities 5.
Childcare subsidies that support working families and early learning programs that support child development and school readiness 6.
Utility assistance 7.
Intervention services for homeless and at-risk children and youth 8 Youth development, including programs that focus on academic achievement Illustrating the services categorized as non-core is the following list: 1.
Non-emergency meal programs 2.
Support services to maintain housing, including utility assistance 3.
Family support services, including support for teen parents, and citizenship and English as Second Language services for refugee and immigrant families 4.
Community programs for elders that increase nutrition and physical activity and reduce social isolation 5.
Domestic violence and sexual assault prevention education and training 6.
Senior wellness services 7.
Employment and training programs for youth and elders 8.
Educational programs for parents, children, and youth that build individual and family stability 9.
Human services supports that enable people to attain and maintain livable wage jobs Before any service reductions were made, HSD cut internal administration by 9%.
Another 3% was cut during budget deliberations.
Every effort was made to propose service reductions only in non-core areas, thereby maintaining, to the greatest extent possible, the current safety net.
In addition to specific service cuts, no cost-ofliving adjustments (COLA) are allocated in contracts with community-based organizations.
The effect of providing no COLA will vary depending on the agency.
In addition to this policy change, the designation applied to Human Services Program (HSP) resources is eliminated in this budget.
While that label suggests a revenue source other than the City's General Subfund (GSF), HSP resources are, and always have been, GSF resources.
The allocation of GSF includes those services that were previously funded under the HSP designation.

Program Summary Reduce funds available for contracts with community-based organizations for advocacy and capacity building by 21%.
Contracts will be awarded for the first six months of 2003, and the Human Services Department will develop a competitive process for distributing the remaining funds.
While the 2002 level of advocacy and capacity building will be scaled back due to reduced funds, there is adequate funding remaining to sustain strategic advocacy efforts and maintain a strong non-profit infrastructure capacity.
See Council budget provisos for details.
Reduce planning capacity and various operating costs in Leadership; these cuts will affect the ability of the Director's Office to coordinate certain Department-wide issues and partnerships with community organizations.
Staff support will only be provided for mandated and top priority functions.
Increase General Subfund resources to Leadership to facilitate the effective use of the Community Development Fund (CDF).
The CDF, which is managed by a the non-profit Rainier Vally Community Development Fund, is a loan fund intended to lessen the impact of light rail on Rainier Valley businesses and property owners by providing business loans for relocation and improvements.
The loan fund, administered by the Office of Economic Development, requires the use of Community Development Block Grant Funds rather than General Subfund.
General Subfund for Leadership is increased but a corresponding entry under the Community Development Block Grant Program reduces Leadership by the same amount.
Transfer position from Office for Economic Development to Leadership.
This consolidates the administration of "Help for Working Families" into the Human Services Department.
Help for Working Families is a service that helps low- to moderate-income families enroll in public benefits for which they are eligible.
It provides a single point of contact and application for state- and city-funded public benefits, including utility rate assistance, Basic Health Plan and other low-cost insurance, food assistance, and child care subsidies.
