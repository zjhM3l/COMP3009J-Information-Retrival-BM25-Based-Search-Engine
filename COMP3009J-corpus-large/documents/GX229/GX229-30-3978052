MR. LIDSKY: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
We are here to convene a USDA Animal and Plant Health 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Inspection Services public meeting to discuss issues related to the administration of the Imported Fire Ant Program by Plant Protection and Quarantine in light of reduced funding for fiscal year 2000.
My name is Mike Lidsky.
I have been asked by the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine to be the moderator for today's meeting.
With me on my right is Mr. Ron Milberg, and Mr. Homer Collins on my left.
Mr. Milberg is an Operations Officer for the invasive species and pest management Staff in Riverdale, Maryland.
This is the staff that provides headquarters support to the Imported Fire Ant Program.
Mr. Collins is the Research Leader at the Gulfport, Mississippi Plant Methods Lab.
And that lab is charged with developing regulatory treatments for the Imported Fire Ant Program.
The purpose of today's meeting in Orlando is to give interested persons an opportunity to present their views on the three options APHIS has presented for comment, as well as to present other possible options for administering the Imported Fire Ant Program in light of 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 reduced funding.
Notice of today's meeting was published in the Federal Register on March 2nd on pages 11281 through 11283.
Extra copies of the notice are available at the registration table.
Today's meeting in Orlando is the second of four public meetings we are holding to solicit views from interested persons.
The first meeting was held in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 21st.
The third meeting will be held in Austin, Texas on March 28th at the Clements Building, Committee Room 5, Fifteenth and Lavaka Streets in Austin.
And our fourth meeting will be held in Santa Ana, California on March 30th at the County of Orange Administration Building at 10 Civic Center Plaza in the Board of Supervisors Anteroom.
These addresses, of course, appear in the Federal Register notice.
The format for today's meeting is as follows: After I complete my remarks on the procedural aspects of today's meeting, Mr. Milberg will make a short presentation on the history of the Imported Fire Ant Regulatory Program, 21 22 23 24 25 as well as the regulatory options we have asked persons to comment on.
Should any questions arise about the regulatory treatments that are currently available or new regulatory or control strategies that the agency is pursuing, Mr. Collins would be the best person to answer those questions.
5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Persons who have registered to speak will be given an opportunity to speak before unregistered persons.

After Ron Milberg's presentation, I will call the first registered speaker.
At this time, Ron, if you would commence.
MR. MILBERG: All right.
Thank you, Mike.
Today I will provide some background on the IFA Program and then talk about how it has evolved over the years, and then finally discuss today's situation.
To begin with, imported fire ants, or IFA, were introduced into the southern United States 60 to 80 years ago.
After the ants were first observed around 1920, landowners in infested areas began applying available insecticides such as calcium cyanide dust.
With the advent of chlorinated hydrocarbons to cost effectively control ants, the federal quarantine was 23 24 25 established in 1958 to regulate infested areas.
The quarantine currently regulates all or portions of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
The federal quarantine regulates the movement of articles known to spread IFA including nursery stock and soil.
The original program was a cooperative effort between APHIS and the states in three areas including detection, confining and eradicating isolated infestations, regulatory activity to slow IFA's spread by controlling the movement of regulated articles and, finally, control activity to reduce populations using wide area pesticide applications
.
As registrations and food tolerances for chlorinated hydrocarbons were canceled during the 1960s and '70s, wide area pesticide applications were no longer practical due to the poor efficacy of available pesticides.
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 The IFA Program then shifted to baits and organophosphates.
Unfortunately, some of these compounds such as chlorpyrophos were less effective than previously used materials.
During the 1980s with the continued loss of chemicals, the federal program focused on methods development, primarily testing of new treatments to certify regulated articles for interstate movement.
And moving to today's situation, during the 1990s the appropriations for many federal domestic programs declined over cap. and states assumed more IFA survey and 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 regulatory responsibility.
State activities were conducted in part using cooperative funding agreements with APHIS.
Most federal dollars were passed through to the states to ensure compliance with the federal quarantine.
Let me just briefly put up a graph here that shows IFA funding over the past few years.
As shown on this graph, continued pressure on domestic budgets caused funding for the IFA Program to decline from about five million 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 dollars in 1990 to $100,000.00 in 2000.
Of this year's $100,000.00 appropriation, Congress earmarked about $58,000.00 for IFA work into Mexico.
Given the current funding level, essentially no dollars are available for pass-through to other states.
Despite the low funding level, APHIS continues to maintain the federal quarantine by annually updated the list of infested areas contained in the Federal Register.
In addition, our investigative and enforcement services staff looks into about ten to 20 quarantine violations annually.
About one-third of these cases are closed with warnings issued by the local plant protection and quarantine officer for a first-time violation.
Another third are closed with no action if the shipping facility was under a compliance agreement and the treatments were applied in accordance with that agreement.
The last third are assessed civil penalties of up 10 1 to $1,000.00 per violation which is the maximum allowed by 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 statute.
The typical fine ranges from $500.00 to $2,000.00 depending on the severity and the number of violations that we can charge.
In addition to our IES activity, APHIS continues to focus on development of new regulatory treatments and nursery compliance protocols to control or reduce ant levels in nursery production areas.
About $350,000.00 is allocated annually to Gulfport, Mississippi for methods development work.
To our knowledge, Gulfport is the only facility in the country that is developing IFA regulatory treatments.
And the focus of today's meeting, of course, are potential options for the program.
Given the above information, we decided to hold these public meetings to get input on what direction the IFA program should take.
To help stimulate discussion on this issue, we proposed the three options shown.
Under option 1, we would maintain our Imported Fire Ant Program with minimal regulatory activity in line with current funding.
This option would provide uniform standards and consistent interstate shipping requirements for the regulated industry.
Under this option, with the current federal funding level, most states would enforce the federal quarantine without federal dollars.
25 Under option 2, we would eliminate the federal 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 quarantine and develop model guidelines for states to use in harmonizing their quarantines.
This option would reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity without federal regulation.
However, under this option, states may impose more or less stringent requirements.
These requirements could differ from state to state.
Under the third option, we would eliminate the IFA regulations and would participate in establishing a voluntary nursery certification program.
This option would also reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity without federal regulation.
However, such a certification program is not mandatory and could result in less than 100 percent participation.
At this time, the agency has made no decision on how to proceed.
All options including any submitted in writing or presented at this meeting will be considered before a final decision is proposed.
Thank you again for 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 your interest in the -- today's meeting.
And that concludes my briefing.
MR. LIDSKY: Thanks, Ron.
Our first registered speaker is Mr. Randy Jacobs.
MR. JACOBS: Hi.
I am Randy Jacobs -- that's J-AC-O-B-S -- representing Flowerwood Nursery.
Flowerwood is a wholesale nursery.
We grow mostly woody ornamentals.
We employ about 800 people.
We have 12 nurseries in Alabama, 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Georgia and Florida.
We ship to some 37 states and we feel that a unified rule concerning the fire ant issue is very important to us economically.
The fact that dealing with -- the possibility of dealing with 37 different rules scares us.
So we feel like Congress should restore the funding for the imported fire ant quarantine and the USDA should continue to enforce the quarantine in its present form.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Mr. Bill Klinger, please.
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 MR. KLINGER: Good morning.
My name is Bill Klinger.
That's K-L-I-N-G-E-R.
I represent Lake Brantley Plant Corporation.
We have several locations here in the central Florida market.
Our main market is in the Florida area.
We do ship to some of the states outside the quarantine.
We feel though that the current program needs to be maintained.
One of our biggest concerns is even though we don't ship outside the state that much, we do bring in materials from California and other states.
This generates a large amount of revenue for our company.
It also generates a lot of revenue for the state of Florida.
We collect a lot of sales tax.
The majority of our customers that we provide this material for, we collect the sales tax for the state.
So the lost revenue that the 13 1 2 3 state will receive from this will put undue pressure if the Federal Government goes ahead and implements this program as they are talking about doing.
And that is pretty much what 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 I have to say right now.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Bill Reese, please.
MR. REESE: Good morning.
My name is Bill Reese, R-E-E-S-E.
I own and operate Greenbriar Nurseries in Marion County, Florida in the north central part of the state.
I have approximately 100 acres in our growing areas and I have 35 full-time employees.
This is a family-owned and operated business.
We grow hearty woody ornamentals in containers for shipment in the southeastern United States.
Over -- a little over 50 percent of our product leaves the state of Florida.
And I would say over 25 percent of our product leaves the quarantine area in the southeastern United States.
We presently spend about -- between $20,000.00 and $30,000.00 a year in meeting the compliance requirements for shipment of product outside of the quarantine area.
We are happy to do so.
I should say -- maybe happy is not the right word.
But we feel obligated with the imported fire ant pest problem that exists in our area to maintain the proper controls that would require us to spend this type of money to keep this pest from spreading and to maintain 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 controls over it.
We think that the de-funding is not a good option and that, in fact, option 1, to maintain the federal quarantine is our position.
And some of the reasons are not just to maintain it, but we think that the funding needs to be increased to the point where adequate protections and enforcement can be maintained.
I have served as a president of our Florida Nursery and Growers Association and now am serving as the immediate past president of the Southern Nurserymen and Growers Association.
And I can say that the vast majority of the producers and nurserymen that belong to these groups are small, independent, family-run operations.
And the adverse effects of having to deal when we ship plant material out of the state of Florida and especially out of the quarantine area of meeting all of the requirements that could be in place if each state was allowed to set their own requirements, their own regulations would be devastating.
20 21 22 23 24 25 It would be very hard for us as an operation.
It would wreak some economic havoc on us to try to meet all the requirements that different states could put up.
We also feel that the third option, the voluntary option, would not be workable because it just would leave too many people open to allow for this pest to be spread 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 beyond where it is at now.
Also, I feel very strongly over the fact that the federal controls and the federal guidelines -- this is an incidence where I think the Federal Government is in the proper position of exercising control.
With uniform standards and uniform enforcement, everyone knows what we need to do and how we should be operating.
I can give a personal example.
Over 12 years ago, when we deal with just state regulations on state-to-state shipments, we had a load of plant material that was going into Texas.
And it was about the time that there was -- the state of Texas and the state of Florida were having some 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 discussions over grapefruit being shipped into Florida, so grapefruit stock.
And so the Florida Department of Agriculture had stopped some shipments of grapefruit from Texas coming into Florida.
Well, we had plant material which had been inspected and met all the requirements that we felt we were under going into Texas.
But at that time, the state of Texas decided, their Department of Agriculture, they were going to hold up our shipment into Texas because they had some issues with some of Florida's regulations.
So as an example, we had a whole load of plant material that basically did not reach its destination and because of the perishable nature of it never arrived in 16 1 2 3 4 5 sellable condition.
No fault of ours.
But it was just an example of where from state to state, as each state defines its own regulations and as each state tries to enforce, there wasn't a uniform standard in that particular instance.
So I have a big fear of what could happen if each 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 state were to be allowed to determine their own standards and how we would try to meet those.
So I would strongly urge not only that option 1 be the option that is followed, but that we do all we can to increase funding.
And I know I am up here speaking for myself as an individual family farm owner and operator.
But the nurserymen that I deal with also feel strongly over the fact that funding should be increased to maintain these programs and what is being done at Gulfport and that this is something for the protection of the citizens of the country and for the protection of our industry that needs to continue on.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
George Hackney.
And I'm not sure I'm pronouncing this right.
MR. HACKNEY: George Hackney from Hackney Nursery.
That's H-A-C-K-N-E-Y.
First, I would like to comment that obviously all our other brethren in the nursery business must not have gotten to page 11000 and something of the Federal Register to realize where the meeting was.
They must be slow readers.
17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 But I am here to urge to maintain the federal quarantine.
Hackney Nursery is located in Gadsten County, Florida which is one of the poorest counties in Florida.
We are a family-owned and managed operation.
We employ over 50 full-time people year-round.
A little bit about a quick history of the agricultural industry in Gadsten County.
We went from shaved tobacco.
And that was phased out.
Then we went to fruit and vegetables with a lot of tomatoes growing in that area.
And that is real shaky now with the Mexican problems they are having.
And through it all, the nursery business has been the most stable and growing industry in our county.
And we would like to keep it that way.
Most of the plants in our county are grown and shipped out of the quarantine area.
I spent in my nursery -- and we are probably one of the small ones -- spent in excess of $25,000.00 last year having Talstar incorporated in our mix.
To do away with the federal quarantine and make it difficult to ship out of the quarantine area and have different rules for each state would be bad I think for the 22 23 24 25 consumers of this country because nursery plants are historically grown in the south for a reason.
And that is because we can grow them cheaper with a longer growing season we have.
So it is cheaper to have 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 plants grown here and shipped north.
And the consumer up there if this quarantine is done away with most likely will end up paying more for plants.
The federal quarantine would level the playing field.
Everybody here has to abide by it now if you are going to ship out of the quarantine area.
So what we do to make sure we are in compliance, we incorporated the Talstar in our mix.
And so every plant we grow is -- you know, we can ship it within the quarantine area or out.
I really think that it would be -- it would wreak havoc on our industry.
And I think we are a fast growing industry.
And our reason we don't have more representation here is that people don't realize that -- the quarantine has worked so well that people don't realize what would happen - 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 - a lot of the newer people in the industry don't realize what would happen if they were trying to ship plants without the federal quarantine in place.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
I am going to need some help with the proper pronunciation of our next speaker's name.
I believe it is John Sparmann.
MR. SPARMANN: Sparmann.
My name is John Sparmann, S-P-A-R-M-A-N-N.
I am with Imperial Nurseries in Quincy, Florida which is a division of Growth in the Land of Nurseries.
At the present time, the company maintains two growing operations, one in Quincy, Florida and one in 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Grandview, Connecticut.
We also maintain eight distribution centers in the mid-Atlantic to New England and the midwest regions.
At the present time, we expect sales in excess of eight million this year out of this which are between 99 and 100 percent out of the quarantine area.
The present treatment that we have is an approximately $100,000.00 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 budget item.
We feel that it is of utmost importance that we have a uniform code throughout all the states in this nation regarding the fire ant quarantine.
It would be detrimental if we would have to deal with each state individually.
I personally think we wouldn't even be able to survive those conditions.
So I strongly urge for the position 1, to maintain the present quarantine regulations.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Fred May.
MR.
MAY: My name is Fred May, excuse me, M-A-Y.
I have a nursery.
I am a co-owner of a family-held operation in Gadsten County, also, a little community called Havana which is just five miles south of the Georgia line.
As has already been stated, we are in an economically deprived area.
Our operation is approximately 185 acres.
We spend approximately $75,000.00 a year to comply with federal fire ant regulations between Talstar incorporated in the mix 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 and Amtro applied twice a year in the surrounding areas.
We feel like that to eliminate the quarantine would be a tremendous burden on our little operation.
Like I say, it is a family-held operation.
And the added regulations and all we would have to deal with would be a tremendous burden to us.
We feel that out of your options, to keep the quarantine really is the only option you have.
To make it voluntary just wouldn't work.
To allow each state to make its own regulations, like I stated, would be a tremendous burden not only to us, but to everyone else in the industry.
As has been stated also, it would level the playing field for all of us.
And we strongly urge you not just to maintain the quarantine, but increase the funding there, as well.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Thad Beshears.
MR. BESHEARS: Good morning.
My name is Thad Beshears, B-E-S-H-E-A-R-S.
I represent Simpson Nursery in Monticello, Florida.
We are a deciduous tree grower, employ about 100 to 125 people full-time annually.
We spend about $45,000.00 to $50,000.00 a year on Talstar to keep regulations and compliance up with the regulations.
And we ship from Maryland to Texas and in between.
24 25 And to deal with just the paperwork alone would just probably -- it would just be a burden to all of us like 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 everybody says.
And as much government paperwork as you have to do already, another couple of steps wouldn't be too fun I'm sure to deal with.
So I just urge you to keep up with -- or to maintain the federal act you have right now and not require anymore paperwork on us than as it is.
Thanks.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Matt Powers, please.
MR. POWERS: Good morning.
I am Matt Powers, P-O-W-E-R-S.
I am representing Florida Potting Soils who is in the custom soil-blending business, managing facilities in both Florida and Georgia.
We have 50 to 60 permanent employees and 100-plus contract employees.
We feel that it is going to be to the best need to maintain the federal quarantine and to restore funding if possible.
Currently, we are mixing Talstar for approximately ten percent of our customer base.
Not all of 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 this is for certification, but a tremendous amount of it is.
We have some experience in operating under different state regulations as it affects our business.
And we don't want to go that route if we can help it.
Every state that we do business in we have to operate a little differently.
And the paper trail can just be a nightmare.
We don't need more regulation.
We do feel that we do need to maintain the federal quarantine as it is.
Thank you.
22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Mr. Danny Phelps.
MR. PHELPS: Good morning.
My name is Danny Phelps, P-H-E-L-P-S.
I am here representing the Florida Department of Agriculture Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry.
We appreciate the USDA holding these meetings and permitting affected stakeholders to comment on the course of action that the agency should take in dealing with plant protection problems that affect us all.
USDA's imported fire ant quarantine has been very 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 effective.
Over the years, we have contained the artificial spread of IFA.
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry has been a cooperator in the IFA Program since April of 1988.
The FDACS DPI is committed to providing and carrying out the essential regulatory quarantine provisions of the IFA Program.
Currently, there are 1,318 nurseries with 12,560 acres in Florida under compliance for IFA certification to ship regulated articles out of the IFA quarantine area.
The FDACS DPI has continually provided this important certification service to the Florida nursery industry in spite of having federal funds cut from the initial $202,000.00 during federal fiscal year 1989 to zero for this fiscal year.
The FDACS DPI has continually provided this 23 1 2 important certification -- excuse me.
During the past 11 years, the DPI has worked closely with the USDA in resolving 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 problems associated with the minimal number of IFA-infested shipments that were shipped out of the fire ant quarantine area.
This included a close working relationship with Homer Collins at the IFA Research Station in Gulfport to find a solution to chemical treatments that were no longer effective in eliminating fire ant from shipments of nursery stock.
IFA is still considered to be a serious agricultural pest, as well as a public nuisance.
And, therefore, USDA's leadership and involvement to maintain an IFA-funded, biologically sound IFA certification program is well justified.
The continued success of the IFA certification program is very much dependent upon maintaining an adequately funded, unified and proven federal quarantine program.
Eliminating the fire ant quarantine would only create additional burdens, confusion and hardships for the affected industries, state regulatory agencies and general public as non-infested states implement inconsistent and unjustified regulations.
A perfect example from a Florida perspective is the unreasonable, non-uniform and very expensive nematode 24 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 regulations currently promulgated by several states.
It is imperative that an IFA quarantine be maintained to ensure a uniform set of regulations and level playing field for all affected parties.
It is for these reasons that DPI's position is that the federal quarantine program must remain in place and receive the necessary funding for its continuation.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: That's fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Monty Knox, please.
MR. KNOX: Good morning.
My name is Monty Knox, M-O-N-T-Y K-N-O-X.
I am vice president of Knox Nursery, Incorporated.
We are now the ninety-second greenhouse operation in the United States.
I ship to all 50 states, Canada and the Caribbean Islands.
In 1996, we built a six-million-dollar plug facility that is state of the art.
It has all of the latest and greatest in high tech. amenities.
On the imported fire ant quarantine, this past fall, the National Pest Council 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 was given a proposal to certify what a fire ant-free greenhouse operation would be.
And it had -- some of the proposals were it had to be a positive pressure greenhouse.
It could have no openings.
It could have -- and it had to have concrete floors with double doors.
And it had to have a concrete lip I think either three or five feet surrounding the entire greenhouse.
25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Being a past president of the Action Chapter of FNGA, I believe that there would only be eight operations out of 200 in the Action Chapter that could possibly live up to that.
And those eight would be tissue culture labs which have to be sterile.
Any container-growing nursery, any plug operation, my six-million-dollar facility would not comply with that because I have got retractable-roof greenhouses which is the latest in high tech. state of the art.
And it would not qualify.
I spent six million dollars to make a growing facility to help me grown my plants.
And if I can't ship 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 outside of the imported fire ant quarantine, then I just wasted it.
Those are some of the regulations that if the Federal Government doesn't maintain the quarantine and doesn't maintain a level playing field, then there is no use for it.
There is no use for us to even try to ship out of the state because there are states that will put in -- that will put in regulations that we can't meet.
Two hundred and fifteen years ago, we dropped a system of government called the Articles of Confederation and we went to a Constitution form of government that created a Federal Government.
And one of the reasons was to prevent noxious and unattainable regulations between the states and to create a Commerce Department that prevented 26 1 2 3 4 states from putting up barriers to interstate trade.
And if -- this is a perfect example why the Federal Government is in place and why we have a Commerce Department and why we have a Department of Agriculture.
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 One of -- another main thing -- and if you really want to have an idea as to how other states will do this is we are now selling plants over the internet.
And we have teamed up with garden.com to sell annuals.
And we have begun shipping.
And we have gotten a burrowing nematode certificate that is effective in the country.
And California is refusing our shipments because we don't have -- on our burrowing nematode certificate, we don't have mail order shipments only on it.
They accept our plugs that go to commercial without any problem.
They wave it right on through.
But with our garden.com boxes, they are stopping at the airports and going you don't have a mail order shipment.
I said, okay.
So I called the Department of Plant Industry.
We got our inspectors.
And he goes -- and Robbie who is our chief inspector says, Monty, you better sit down and you better have a cold bottle of ice water.
I said, why.
He goes, well, let me put it to you this way, it is the exact same certificate, it is the exact same number, it is the exact 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 same name.
All I have to do is put on it mail order shipments only.
I said, you must be kidding.
He goes, no, and guess what, California is a good state.
I said, what do you mean.
He goes, Arizona won't accept it.
Arizona will not accept mail order shipments off of internet-driven orders from anywhere outside of the state of Arizona.
I said, they accept our plugs.
He goes, that is commercial; they can't stop that.
But they are flat going to stop you on internet.
And I thought, boy, this is kind of interesting since, you know, progress and the way this country's economy is going, that the royal state of Arizona is going to block out 49 other states' products.
So that is why we must maintain at a federal level the imported fire ant quarantine.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Ms. Nancy McDonald, please.
MS. McDONALD: Nancy McDonald, M-C-D-O-N-A-L-D.
My company name is MGM Productions, Inc.
I am in Mount Dora, Florida.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I am the current 21 22 23 24 25 president of the Action Chapter of the Florida Nursery Growers Association.
And I reiterate what Monty had to say about laboratories being the few that would meet those standards.
The operation, which I am lucky enough to be 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 purchasing as of November 1st, was built by a gentleman who has been in Florida 17 years, had 14 facilities and has sold ten to the management.
And I am the tenth buy-out.
I am purchasing a 2.4-million-dollar operation.
I employ 13 people full-time, one office/shipping person handling the paperwork.
My number one customer where I would say 95 percent of our product leaves the area -- my number one customer is in California.
We adhere to all the nematode regulations.
We have had difficulties with Louisiana, Texas and Arizona periodically, just different states pulling their ranks.
My nursery is the state of the art.
We have 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 rolling benches off the ground, pot-to-pot irrigation, overhead shade.
Not only do the fire ant regulations, but the industry is gearing for the nitrate, et cetera, pesticides.
The point made there this morning already was available products.
And that is another issue.
Protocol on our nursery on sanitation is extraordinary.
I mean, we follow it to a T. Like I said, November, December, January February, March, I am so excited that this opportunity -- my product has got to move and we cannot deal with the current -- anything worse or above Georgia.
I think some of the folks aren't here today 29 1 2 3 4 5 6 because they can't bring it to themselves to be asking for more bureaucratic or Washington involvement, but we need it.
And we need to keep that level playing field definitely.
I personally need it to keep my market viable.
Gentlemen, I hope your final answer is option number 1.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Our last registered 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 speaker is Mr. Ben Bolusky, please.
MR. BOLUSKY: Good morning, Mr. Lidsky, Mr. Milberg, Dr. Collins.
I am Ben Bolusky, B-O-L-U-S-K-Y, executive vice president of the Florida Nurserymen's Growers Association based here in Orlando, Florida.
We are very pleased the United States Department of Agriculture is holding a hearing here in Florida, the second largest nursery production state in the nation, and you are seeking public and industry input in the -- on the impact of possibly rescinding or not enforcing the federal quarantine on imported fire ants.
Previously, before coming to the FNGA in the spring of 1998, I was for 12 years the director of government affairs at the then-American Association of Nurserymen, now the American Nursery and Landscape Association.
And you can never take Washington out of an individual.
So exercising the right to uphold that age old Washington, D.C. tradition of filibustering, I do have a 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 written statement that I would like to read into the record.
The Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association represents Florida's leading 2000 production nurseries, landscape firms, retail garden centers and horticultural suppliers.
As noted earlier, Florida is the second largest nursery production state with growers' farm-gate sales estimated in 1997 at 1.464 billion dollars.
Florida is this nation's largest producer of foliage or indoor houseplants.
And lastly, it is significant to note that the nursery industry is one of the three largest segments of agriculture in Florida.
The nursery and landscape industry employs approximately 140,000 workers in the Sunshine State and makes a 5.4-billion-dollar impact on Florida's economy according to a 1999 study by the University of Florida.
What I would like to do is give -- since given an indication -- or an illustration of the size and scope of the industry here in Florida, tie that into an overview of the nursery industry nationwide, just touch briefly on the imported fire ant issue, and then address a couple of questions.
One is the federal quarantine still needed, what are some additional reasons that the Federal Government 23 24 25 should be involved, what federal funding is needed, and then just some concluding remarks, if I may.
The nursery and greenhouse industry is an exciting 31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 success story and perhaps the most promising growth segment of American agriculture.
According to USDA's economic research service, the nursery and greenhouse industry remains the fastest growing agriculture sector in terms of cash receipts.
In 1998, nursery and greenhouse operations had estimated national sales in excess of 12 billion dollars.
Grower cash receipts from nursery and greenhouse sales have grown steadily over the last two decades.
They are increasing at approximately a half billion dollars per year, representing five percent growth annually.
Now, while the number of U.S. farms of all types has declined over the last two decades, the number of nursery greenhouse operations, farms, has increased.
The United States is the world's largest producer and marketer 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 for nursery and greenhouse crops.
These crops represent an important and unique segment of agriculture whose positive impact is felt on the national, state and local levels.
In terms of economic output, nursery and greenhouse crops represent the second most important sector in U.S. agriculture, ranking seventh among all commodities in cash receipts nationwide and among the highest in net foreign income.
The nursery industry has achieved this growth and success without any federal subsidies or federal price supports.
32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Imported fire ant, as you demonstrated earlier, is an invasive insect pest accidentally introduced into the United States near Mobile, Alabama early in the 1900s.
While eradication has largely failed except for small isolated infestations outside quarantined areas, efforts at controlling and slowing the rate of spread have had a very positive effect and merit continuation.
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 APHIS, maintains a quarantine to slow the spread of imported fire ant to uninfested areas.
This is squarely in keeping with USDA's basic policy to maintain federal quarantines with pests such as the imported fire ant so long as the pests are either of limited distribution or under eradication.
The quarantine includes rules for shipping fire ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants, quarantine activities such as pest surveys, compliance monitoring and enforcement of violations has been declining for years.
In recent years, USDA has expressed an interest in rescinding the federal quarantine.
This desire was reflected in declining federal funds over the last few years for the quarantine.
For at least ten years as you demonstrated earlier, USDA's formal budget request to Congress included no funds for the imported fire ant quarantine a specific 33 1 line item in APHIS's budget.
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Nonetheless, through these last ten years, Congress properly recognized the importance of the IFA quarantine.
And despite USDA's failure to request such, Congress appropriated federal funds to maintain it.
However, in the current 2000 fiscal year, funding was virtually eliminated.
It is leading to some pressure within USDA to revoke the federal quarantine all together which brings us to this public meeting today.
This shifts an undue burden onto states and affected industries.
As you heard from Danny Phelps of the Florida Department of Agriculture Consumer Services and its Division of Plant Industry a few moments ago, there are 1,318 nurseries with 12,560 acres in Florida under compliance for imported fire ant certification to ship regulated plants out of the imported fire ant quarantine area.
USDA's funding share for Florida was cut from a high of $202,000.00 in the 1992 fiscal year to zero dollars in the current fiscal year.
FNGA strongly and vigorously believes federal funding assistance must be restored.
Let's address the question is the federal quarantine still needed.
Imported fire ant has spread throughout the southeast from eastern North Carolina, south to Florida, and west through much of Texas.
25 Several counties in southern California are also 34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 partly infested.
Huge areas of the United States are still uninfested and understandably want to stay free of this significant human health and agricultural pest as long as possible.
The federal quarantine allows for a coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant spread.
Without USDA APHIS involvement, states will be forced to endure alone the government's share of the burden in dealing with this pest.
Let's take a look for a moment at the loss of marketplace uniformity which you have heard from several of the growers who have testified here this morning.
For the nursery and greenhouse industry, the federal quarantine means one set of uniform rules for shipping products interstate.
Florida, other southern states and southern California are major production areas for nursery and 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 greenhouse plants, growing literally billions of dollars worth of trees, shrubs, flowers and other plants.
Many of these plants are shipped to other parts of the country.
Revocation of the federal imported fire ant quarantine would open up the opportunity for uninfested states to pass their own rules.
This would relegate nursery growers to struggle to try to comply with confusing, perhaps conflicting demands for chemical treatments and shipping 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 certifications.
It is extraordinarily difficult, as you heard here this morning, for a nursery, the vast majority of which are small family-run businesses, to meet differing state-bystate rules for how a crop must be grown, how it must be treated, how it must be shipped, and what sorts of paperwork must be filled out and kept.
The track record of individual states is not very good, not very good at all in following a federally developed set of model guidelines.
This is why the option 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 number 2 that you had on the screen earlier is not workable, is not advantageous and is not worthwhile to proceed.
Nurseries already bear considerable consists to comply with quarantine requirements.
While FNGA hopes those costs can be reduced over time, the nursery industry and the state governments are certainly shouldering their respective shares of the burden.
USDA APHIS must not abandon its mantle of responsibility to slow imported fire ant spread.
Moreover, adequate imported fire ant quarantine enforcement is needed to ensure that law abiding nurseries are not put at an unfair competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.
This is why the third option in terms of voluntary nursery compliance certification is a non-starter.
Let's take a look for a moment at an issue with 36 1 2 3 the loss of research funding and coordination.
Currently, much of the applied research dealing with fire ant quarantine controls and treatments is conducted by USDA 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 APHIS and USDA's Agricultural Research Service.
This invaluable work would likely cease without a federal quarantine in place.
And in the absence of the federal quarantine, nursery growers would still face the need for research.
In fact, a proliferation of different state quarantines would create an even greater research need for imported fire ant controls and treatments.
Let's take a look at a couple of additional reasons why the Federal Government should remain involved.
National concern over invasive species is at an all time high.
Imported fire ant is just one of these species.
The USDA's imported fire ant quarantine is consistent with both the recent Executive order on invasive species and the increasing Congressional concern over invasive species.
Imported fire ant is also a troublesome public health and agricultural pest.
Since it is both an invasive species and a human health threat, preventing the spread of imported fire ants is not only a legitimate public policy goal, but its quarantine and research program is a reasonable expenditure of public funds.
Preventing or slowing its movement to the many uninfested states is a shared goal.
And the Federal 37 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Government must share in the funding.
What funding then, what federal funding is needed? Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association agrees with the findings, the recent findings of the National Plant Board that continuation of APHIS's shared involvement in the federal IFA quarantine requires an estimated 7.5 million dollars.
Such funds would be directed as follows: For oversight and quality control; 1.3 million dollars, information and outreach, $100,000.00; investigation of violations, $100,000.00; methods of development and possible implementation of biological control, one million dollars; state quarantine enforcement and monitoring, two million dollars; and state surveys, three million dollars.
This approach must involve a partnership of the federal and state governments.
Restoration of 7.5 million dollars in the 2001 fiscal year funding for USDA APHIS's fire ant line item will ensure a viable and effective quarantine.
20 21 22 23 24 25 It will ensure a viable and effective marketplace for the nursery industry.
And it will ensure a viable and effective research program to address the continuing -- to address the spread of imported fire ant into uninfested areas.
FNGA strongly urges USDA to incorporate and embrace such funds its budget discussions and negotiations with 38 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Congress over the weeks ahead.
As the voice of Florida's nursery and landscape industry and in full concert with the American Nursery and Landscape Association, FNGA implores USDA APHIS to maintain a viable and effective federal imported fire ant quarantine.
Nursery growers are already shouldering their cost of the burden and are doing it willingly in order to maintain a uniform, consistent set of rules to have uniformity -- or unity in the marketplace.
State governments such as Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and particularly its Division of Plant Industry are trying to do the same even in 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the face of a current absence of USDA support in funds.
USDA APHIS must not abandon its share of responsibility.
And it is a share of that responsibility.
The fire ant quarantine must be actively maintained and fully funded.
And thank you, gentlemen, for the opportunity.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Are there any persons who have not registered that would like to make some remarks for the record? MR. PECKETT: My name is Chet Peckett, P-E-C-K-E-T-T.
I just signed the wrong sheet out there I think.
But we are a wholesale foliage operation.
We have about ten acres of greenhouses.
We have about 25 employees.
We -- I could say ditto to everything everybody said in 39 1 2 3 4 5 here.
We ship about 98 percent of our product out of the state of Florida into some of these restricted areas.
We also ship about 15 percent of our product probably to the state of California.
California is by far, no doubt, as 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Monty said, the most difficult to deal with.
But we are dealing with them.
And I also repeat what everybody else says.
I am in favor of option number 1.
I don't think we have any choice.
I think when we have the opportunity to have the Federal Government involved to help us in this case, then we should certainly avail ourselves of it.
We are -- most everybody that you are seeing in this room complies with these regulations.
I think it is not difficult.
It is so easy.
Maybe there are some things we can do through FNGA, some other task forces and so forth that -- just have everybody -- everybody does not have to incorporate Talstar and some of these chemicals in their soil mixes.
Today it is voluntary regulation.
But probably most people do.
It is not an extensive option.
And maybe there are some additional regulations that can be looked at perhaps in reviewing this whole process that might make it a little easier for other states to accept our product and so forth.
40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 The other thing that hasn't been mentioned here today that I think should be mentioned is -- well, Ben mentioned I guess -- but there is a lot of money coming out of the state of Florida.
And I know you are going to hold these hearings elsewhere in the country, in the southeast anyway.
But I can't even imagine what kind of havoc it would wreak on these other states if they couldn't get this product out of the state of Florida, I mean, this product that these people retail.
And I know it is going to be hard to get mass markets and the large retailers to get involved and voice their opinions.
But we have -- all this product that you see, even you heard the woody ornamental people, lots and lots of this product goes into those other states.
And if those other states for whatever reason can't or won't accept our product, most of who you are going to hear from are going to be wholesale producers.
And I dare say with the amount of product that is produced in the state of Florida, it is going to take them years and years and years, if ever, to be able to replace 22 23 24 25 that kind of production.
I just don't think they can do it.
So we are in favor of number one.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Please come up, sir.
MR. MILLER: Good morning, everybody.
My name is 41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Jack Miller.
I am the co-owner of Botanics Wholesale in Homestead, Florida.
We are a 90-acre operation and employ 35 people.
As I was driving up here this morning, I was thinking about what Monty spoke of, the fact that in some of my history classes, I remembered one of the reasons why the states were formed.
And that was to facilitate interstate commerce.
As I recall, there were different forms of currency and it was basically a major bottleneck.
Approximately 25 percent of our product is shipped to Arizona and California.
In the last, oh, year or so, the capriciousness of some of the states has become really evident.
And it has become increasingly more difficult.
We incorporate Talstar in all our soil.
We additionally drench 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 everything that goes to California and Arizona.
We also ship throughout the world.
We ship to probably five of the seven continents.
And I would guess that California and Arizona are as difficult as any of the countries with the exception of Japan to ship to which we have shipped to.
In our effort to help facilitate greater knowledge, we co-funded reniform nematode research with the University of Florida that proved that certain palms would not support reniform nematodes.
And that has been acted upon in foreign countries, but it doesn't seem -- Danny, is 42 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it not correct, they haven't responded to that in California and Arizona? So we have through objective research at the University of Florida established that.
Yet states refuse to recognize that.
Let's see.
As Ben also pointed out, horticulture is not subsidized as a lot of agriculture is.
If there was 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ever going to be any help for horticulture, I think something of this nature should be done because we do employ a lot of people.
As the farms across the U.S. and, of course, in Florida shrink and diminish and become corporate entities, a lot of that labor that was employed on farms now is being employed by nurseries.
Let's see.
Bear with me.
We were the 1996 Grove of the Year for the state of Florida.
And as such, we try to adhere to the highest standards, which we do.
And in spite of that, we have had episodes when we have shipped to California and Arizona where possibly a dead ant, be it a fire ant or more recently a big-headed ant has been found.
And we have had to have an entire shipment brought back to Florida.
The changing rules of the game that these states have demonstrated causes me to shutter to think if the Federal Government was no longer involved in the fire ant regulation.
And I do, in fact, implore you to maintain your 43 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 position with regard to the federal fire ant regulations.
And I fundamentally believe that is it.
And I hope you listen to us.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Please come up, sir.
This is the opportunity for additional comments, questions.
This is your time.
So please feel free.
MR. COBB: Thank you very much for the opportunity.
My name is Gary Cobb.
I flew up this morning from Mobile, Alabama where we have a container nursery, Cottage Hill Nursery.
It is a 100-acre facility.
And we employ about 125 people year-round.
We ship our ornamentals all through 48 lower states as well as into Canada.
And when I recently became aware of the loss of the federal fire ant quarantine program, I immediately became very concerned about that issue.
And I tried to think it through and think about some of the consequences that may be impacted by that.
And I really ended up focusing on two of those.
The first area of impact that I think is important is on the health and well being of the public in general.
I don't know whether you gentlemen have any exposure to the imported fire ant.
But it is a very painful bite.
And they are very aggressive insects.
24 25 But beyond the pain, they are also quite toxic.
I had an employee who has worked with me for seven or eight 44 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 years who has reactions to these insects.
It requires immediate attention.
And even with immediate medical attention, he typically is bedridden for 24 to 48 hours.
So the spread of this pest into other areas that are not currently infested certainly poses new problems for the public that would be exposed under that situation.
The second major concern is much of what I have heard in here so far, is the negative economic impact that the loss that this quarantine will have on the ornamental horticulture industry and I think ultimately on the consumer.
Much of the ornamental horticulture production is located within fire ant infested areas.
And this is due primarily to a good climate and good economic conditions that favor our production in areas where we have to co-exist with the imported fire ant. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 But regardless of that situation, we as producers within those areas have been very effective in eliminating our products as vehicles for the transport of the fire ant into non-infested areas.
In fact, we have and we continue to ship clean product throughout the United States and in Canada as I mentioned earlier.
And, of course, this has been achieved by compliance programs and regulatory oversight that was developed and administered by the USDA in cooperation with 45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 various state agencies.
Without a federal quarantine, regulation of product shipment from areas inside of the fire ant infested areas to locations outside of those areas will no longer be controlled by a single effective and fairly administered set of rules.
Instead, regulation will be relegated to numerous dissimilar and less effective programs that will have to be developed by individual states.
Lack of a centralized regulatory agency 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 responsible for administering the quarantine can only decrease the effectiveness of the effort to slow or prevent the spread of this pest.
In addition, when you leave the regulatory efforts to individual states, it politicizes the issue and thus threatens the fair market access that the previous speaker was addressing.
Individual states may feel pressure to regulate and promulgate the fire ant quarantines or restrictions to benefit their own state -- own in-state industries.
This, of course, would deny fair interstate commerce.
And that ultimately would increase the cost of goods to the consumer.
Of course, the fire ant has economic impact far beyond our industry.
The introduction of fire ants into uninfested areas can occur in many situations that are not 46 1 2 related to ornamental horticulture.
Because of the scope of the very issues that are being discussed today, I think it 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 serves as a great example of why the Federal Government should be involved in this program.
I think it is essential and warranted that the federal process stay in place to assure that there are -that the public interests are met, to keep an effective fire ant control measure in place and to ensure free and open commerce within the affected industries.
So for whatever reason Congress did not fund the USDA's fire ant quarantine program this year, I think we have to go back and re-look at that issue.
What we are asking for you to do is to join with us in recognizing that it is essential to maintain this federal fire ant quarantine.
And then once -- I believe once we convince you of that, only option 1 really serves that purpose.
That is certainly the option that myself and my fellow nursery people that I have spoken to in Alabama would support.
Thank you for the few minutes and the opportunity.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Please come up.
MR. TURK: Thank you, gentlemen, for the opportunity to come and speak and express our point of view.
And thanks to you -- I didn't get to hear many of you -- for coming, fellow nurserymen and representatives to come and 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 express your point of view.
It is important.
My name is Bill Turk.
I am from Martin's Nursery.
We are located in Simms, Alabama which is just outside of Mobile on the Alabama Gulf Coast.
I was fortunate to get to fly up with Mr. Cobb on the airplane this morning.
When he invited me the other day, I almost jumped at the chance when he said there was an extra seat on the plane.
And then he told me he was flying.
And I almost crawfished out, but it was quite a pleasant flight this morning.
Thanks, Gary.
We are a small, family-owned nursery growing primarily azaleas.
On nearly 60 acres of irrigated area, we employ 15 to 20 people year-round.
Our markets are typically within 600 miles.
And we ship about 20 to 30 percent of our product outside of the fire ant quarantine area.
Last year, we shipped to 16 different states including Alabama.
But Alabama only accounted for about ten 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 percent of our sales.
As you can see, interstate commerce is very important to us and we are pleading with you to protect it.
The consistent set of rules through the USDA APHIS involvement does just that, it protects our avenues for trade.
We are committed to the quarantine and the quarantine requirements.
And we spend approximately 48 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 $10,000.00 annually.
We respectfully ask for your continued commitment from the USDA.
Not only do I represent Martin's Nursery, but I am also a board member of the South Alabama Nurserymen's Association as well as the Alabama Association of Nurserymen.
These associations represent hundreds of small, medium and large nurseries who simply would not be able to comply with multiple state quarantine rules and regulations.
In summary, I am asking for the restoration of a minimum of 3.5 million in funding for the USDA APHIS fire 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ant line item to help ensure a workable, viable and effective quarantine.
I am asking this on behalf of many in our industry, the nursery industry which is quietly growing and shining and doesn't usually ask for much.
And once again, I appreciate the opportunity to talk.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Please come up.
MS. HNDERSON: My name is Carolee Henderson, H-E-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
I represent the Florida Farm Bureau Federation.
I would like to thank the United States Department of Agriculture APHIS for providing this hearing for us today to review the fire ant quarantine.
I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Florida Farm Bureau Federation.
Florida Farm Bureau is a general farm organization.
We represent all of Florida agriculture.
49 1 2 3 4 Nursery growers make up a large percentage of our membership.
The Florida Farm Bureau Federation believes that the federal quarantine should remain intact.
The federal quarantine is easier to comply with than several 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 different state quarantines.
Furthermore, states that do not currently have a problem with the fire ants do not want a problem with the fire ants.
We support the Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association and their comments.
Thank you for this opportunity to provide public comment to you on this very important issue.
And I have -- thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Are there any other persons that would like to make any remarks for the record? Mr. Bolusky, I assume that the two gentlemen from Alabama were the people that we were waiting for.
MR. BOLUSKY: Yes.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
So we are not aware of anyone else that may be attending this meeting.
MR. BOLUSKY: Correct.
MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
Well, what I would like to say is I would like to thank everyone on behalf of USDA for coming out and showing your strong support for the program, taking time away from your businesses to express your comments.
50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 I can assure you that your comments will receive very close scrutiny by the APHIS management team, that is the deputy administrator, the regional administrators, as well as the regional plant boards and the national plant board.
We have heard very unequivocal statements and messages delivered today.
And that is very helpful.
And we thank you very much.
And just as a reminder, I do have some survey forms up front if you did not pick on up at the registration table, if you would take a minute or two to fill those out before you leave.
Thanks and have a safe trip home.
(Whereupon, at 10:31 a.m., the hearing in the above-entitled matter was concluded.)
