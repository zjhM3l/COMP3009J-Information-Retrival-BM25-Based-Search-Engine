What is Bullying? Bull ying = Peer Abuse A definition... ?? Intentional, repeated hurtful acts, words or other behavior, such as name -calling, threatening and/or shunning committed by one or more children against another.
?? An imbalance in real or perceived power must exist between bully and victim.
?? Not intentionally provoked by the victims.
?? Includes various forms of hazing ("initiation rites").
"Approximately Â¾ of Midwestern school children reported some episodes of bullying, with about 14 percent experiencing severe reactions to abuse."
Hoover, Oliver 
Is it just "part of growing up"? "A look at social development shows this isn't normal, healthy behavior.
Bullying is an indication of poor social development."
Tonja Nansel, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
?? Begins in elementary school, peaks in middle school and tapers off in high school.
?? School size, racial composition, school setting are not factors in predicting the occurrence of bullying.
NOT "part of growing up" or "rite of passage."
Types of Bullying Direct Bullying ?? Teasing ?? Taunting ?? Threatening ?? Hitting ?? Stealing Indirect Bullying ?? Social isolation through intentional exclusion

A Bullying Prevention Plan
9
The following information is based on the "blueprint" bullying prevention plan evaluated through the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
This program was modeled after the research of Dan Olweus, Ph.D., at the University of Bergen, Norway.
Core Components There are many components to the Olweus model; however, there are certain program components that are more essential than others.
Olweus calls these "core" components for an effective anti -bullying program, and recommends that they be included in any implementation of a program.
They include: Prerequisite Measures ?? Awareness and involvement on the part of adults Measures at the School Level ?? Questionnaire survey ?? School conference day (in-service training) ?? Better supervision during recess and lunch time Measures at the Class Level ?? Class rules against bullying ?? Class meetings Measures at the Individual Level ?? Serious talks with bullies and victims ?? Serious talks with parents of involved students The Step-by-Step Plan to Help Change Bullying/Harassing Behaviors that follows includes all of the above mentioned core components.
Each one is indicated in bold.
10
A Step -by-Step Plan to Help Change Bullying/Harassing Behaviors (Excerpted from the Kansas Bullying Prevention Program)
FIRST...
1. Make sure you have buy-in from the entire school staff.
The principal really should take the lead in supporting the program.
2.
Survey the staff to find out if they will support such a program.
3.
Involve parents.
NOW YOU'RE READY! Step 1: Identify those adults in the school who are willing to serve on a Bullying Prevention Coordinating committee.
This committee will coordinate and help develop a strategic plan against bullying/harassing behaviors.
Teachers, cafeteria works, janitors, and paraprofessionals should all be asked if they would like to participate.
This group should be representative of your school.
For example, the principal, the counselor, a PTA/PTO member, at least one teacher from grades K-2, 3-4, 5-6, as well as perhaps one cafeteria worker and the building janitor.
Step 2:
Use an anonymous student questionnaire to determine the amount of bullying/harassing problems that are present in your school and where they occur (Core Component).
Create an effective form of documentation of all bullying/harassing behaviors.
Develop a "parental rights" form or other document that is used for parental notification.
Step 3:
Reach a consensus about what student behaviors will no longer be allowed.
These behaviors might include: 1.
Name calling, making faces, noises, or other remarks when a victim walks by.
2.
Telling other children they can't play in a game or on a certain piece of playground equipment.
3.
Aggressive physical contact of any kind.
Reinforce "keep your hands, feet and objects to yourself."
Step 4:
Negotiate a list of grade level appropriate escalating consequences for inappropriate behavior.
All inappropriate behaviors will be documented in school records.
The sequence might be: 1.
Verbal warning, documentation includes parent notification.
2.
Lose one day of recess or lunch with peers, documentation includes parent notification.
3.
Lose one week's recess or lunch with peers, documentation includes parent notification.
4.
Lose two weeks' recess or lunch with peers, documentation includes parent notification.
5.
Lose three weeks' recess or lunch with peers, documentation includes parent notification.
11
6.
Parents are asked to take the child home for school for one day.
You could say: "(Student's name) is not ready to be in school today safely."
Note: These consequences are to be administered uniformly for any violation of the behavior code.
It is crucial that the intervention not involve the examination of the student's reasons for the behavior.
Reinforce that the standard for behavior has been violated.
This uniformity makes it easier for students and parents to accept the consequences, and also sends a clear message to the entire school community that students will be protected.
Positive consequences are developed for people who do not violate the behavior code.
Typically this could be a reward activity once a month.
Step 5:
Expectations and consequences are shared with parents, students, bus drivers, after school care, and any one els e who works in or visits the school community.
This is accomplished by using school newsletters, posting behavior expectations in hallways and in classrooms.
School-wide assemblies and teacher/staff in-service training can also raise awareness and communicate the school's policy (Core Component).
Utilizing a parent meeting about bullying/harassment would be appropriate at this step.
Be sure to encourage parent participation: a request for parent volunteers to assist in recess and/or lunchroom duty may be appropriate.
Step 6: Step 7:
Based on the results of the student survey in step two, increase adult supervision of students in those areas where bullying occurs the most, such as playgrounds, hallways, restrooms, cafeterias, etc.
(Core Component) Develop empathy for victims and empower the 65-70% of students not affected by bullying/harassing behavior to do something to stop it when they see it happen.
This can be accomplished by teaching and modeling good citizenship.
A good citizen does not stand by and allow someone else to be victimized.
Children should be able to identify what a good citizen looks like and then develop posters than can be displayed in school hallways.
Reporting versus tattling should be taught in all grade levels.
Establish a reporting system for students and parents.
Receive and listen receptively to parents who report bullying (Core Component).
Step 8:
Classroom meetings should be lead by the teacher weekly and should stress why it is important not to bully or harass others (Core Component) .
Topics for discussion could be: 1.
How do they feel about being in a safe school? 2.
What should they do if they see others being picked on or excluded? 3.
What is the important of diversity? 4.
How do they resolved conflicts without fighting? Meetings can also be used to develop a classroom action plan to ensure students know what to do when they witness a bully/victim confrontation.
Step 9:
Teaching students problem -solving techniques is the next training technique.
One suggested model is as follows: 1.
Define the problem.
12
2.
Why is this a problem for me right now? 3.
Brainstorm at least three solutions.
4.
Find the positive and negative consequences for each solution.
What will happen next if I do this? 5.
Choose a safe next step--one of the solutions you think will work best.
6.
Try it out and see if it works.
Step 10:
No Bullying/Harassing Rules Throughout your planning process make certain to emphasize three basic rules: 1.
We will not bully or harass others.
2.
If we see someone bullying or harassing another, we will do everything we can to stop it.
3.
If we see someone who is left out, we will invite him or her in.
Involve students when establishing classroom rules against bullying.
Step 11:
Talk individually with bullies, victims and parents of involved students (Core Component).
Confront bullies in private; challenging them in front of peers may enhance their status and lead to further aggression.
Notify parents of both victims and bullies when a confrontation occurs.
Step 12:
Re-evaluate.
Use the same evaluation forms at the end of the year and determine how well your plan is working.
Always re-evaluate your efforts and make changes where needed.
Understand the bullying/harassing behaviors will always follow the flow of least resistance.
NOTE: Many teasing or bullying or harassing interventions give students the responsibility of changing established patterns of behavior.
Law Enforcement has learned that our efforts to reduce sexual harassment, spouse abuse, or any other behavior, in which a stronger person abuses a weaker one, cannot be accomplished by education alone.
The first and most powerful step is to discourage the abuser from continuing the same behavior.
Then it is possible to help the victims, the abusers, and the unmotivated bystanders to internalize this new standard of behavior.
Repeat offenders will need counseling or other support in learning more positive ways to interact with others.
Some may benefit from being charged with assault or battery through the legal system.
Aggressive children will not abandon the excitement of hurting others without consistent, sustained consequences for every incident of aggression.

14
What do I do when... ...I suspect bullying but I'm not sure? 1.
Intensify observations of possible victim.
2.
Confer with colleagues.
3.
Collect information from students.
Ask them: How do students get along in class? How many good friends do you have in this class/at school? Is anyone in this class bullied? 4.
Contact parents.
Ask them: How does your child like school? What kinds of things does s/he say about school/classmates? Does s/he have some good friends at school?
...I need to distinguish bullying from rough play? 1.
Determine the relationship among the parties.
2.
Observe facial expressions and the general atmosphere.
3.
Is there repetition of activities? 4.
Where is the balance of power?

15.
I discover bullying?
Intervene immediately.
Talk to the bully and victim separately, even if more than one student is bullying.
Ask another adult to be present if necessary.
Talk with bullies separately in rapid sequence (you don't want to give them time to collaborate their stories).
Begin with the "lead bully."
Expect bullies to minimize and deny their actions.
Remind bully about school and classroom rules, reiterate what behavior is expected and sanctions that will be imposed for future bullying behavior.
Follow up and gather bullies for a summary meeting (if needed) Reassure the victim that everything possible will be done to prevent a recurrence.
Make other students aware of consequences of bully behavior; reiterate your school's policy against bullying.
Phone the parents of both the bully and victim as soon as possible.
If possible, invol ve the parents in designing a plan of action.
Continue to monitor behavior of the bully and the safety of the victim.
Consult administrators, teachers, and staff members to alert them to the problem and get a better understanding of it.
Have a follow -up meeting with the bullies in 1-2 weeks.
If the situation doesn't change, remove the bully--not the victim --from the classroom.
...a parent reports bullying? 1.
Receive and listen receptively to parents who report bullying.
2.
Establish and follow procedures whereby such reports are investigated and resolved expeditiously.
15
*Remember:
"It's much easier for the teacher to have these discussions with bullying students if some of the measures previously described [for a bullying prevention program] have already been implemented, for example the class rules against bullying.
Such measures constitute a background for the students' understanding of the problems and there are suitable "tools" for counteracting them, such as sanctions and the class meeting."

Bullying is unacceptable and against school rules.
The bullying must stop immediately.
As a result of your behavior, you will be punished (if necessary).
We will be keeping ourselves informed about your behavior.
We expect it to improve.
If it does not, there may be additional sanctions.
8.
Your parents will be notified (if appropriate).
*Rememb er:
It is crucial that interventions don't involve the examination of the student's reasons for the behavior.

Gauge the student's distress and be gentle.
Collect info about the incident.
Encourage the student to express his/her emotions.
Provide support and encouragement.
7.
Inform student of your intended actions with the bully/bullies.
At the end of the meeting with the victim...
1.
Form a safety plan with the student.
2.
Have the student agree to report future bullying.
3.
Arrange a follow -up meeting with the victim within one week.
*Remember:
The victim's safety is the primary focus.

Strategies for Parents of Victims
Be careful not to convey to a child who is victimized that something is wrong with him/her or that s/he deserves such treatment.
It is appropriate to call the school if your child is involved in a conflict as either a victim or a bully.
Work collaboratively with school personnel to address the problem.
You may wish to arrange a conference with a teacher, principal or counselor.
They may be able to offer some practical advice to help you and your child.
If you talk with the bully or his parents, be careful in your approach.
Speaking with the parents of a bully may not accomplish anything since lack of parental involvement in the child's life is a typical characteristic of parents of bullies.
Offer support to your child but do not encourage dependence on you.
Do not encourage your child to be aggressive or to strike back.
Teach your child to be assertive.
Search systematically for talents and positive attributes to be developed.
Encourage your child to make contact with friendly student(s) in his/her classes.
Encourage your child to get to know peers in new situations.
Encourage him/her to participate in physical training or sports.
Be patient--conflict between children more than likely will not be resolved overnight.
If the problem persists or escalates, you may need to seek an attorney's help or contact local law enforcement officials.

Instructional Materials and Resources
19
(What to consider when looking for quality bullying prevention materials) There are many materials available to schools that claim to address bullying.
While many of these materials can be extremely helpful and effective, just as many offer improbable quick fixes and are not research-based.
The Kansas Bullying Prevention Program uses much of the information from the "blueprint" bullying prevention plan evaluated through the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
This program was modeled after the research of Dan Olweus, Ph.D., at the University of Bergen, Norway.
Schools that follow the blueprint protocol have experienced about a 40% reduction in bullying within the first two years of the program.
(Ordering information about the Blueprint materials is listed below.)
The following is a list excepted from the Kansas Program that outlines those characteristics that distinguish the Olweus model.
This list provides excellent guidelines for what to look for when considering instructional m aterials and curricula addressing bullying: ?? Main responsibility for the program rests with the adults at school (teachers, administrators, and other school staff), though it is important to also involve parents and students in various ways.
Administrative support of the program is important.
It aims to create collective commitment to and involvement with the program among staff.
?? Designed to send the consistent message that bullying is not accepted and will be stopped.
Strongly encourages coordination of a school's "mental" resources: attitudes, behaviors, and routines .
?? Both systems -oriented (restructuring of the social environment) and individualoriented.
Works at school-, class - and individual levels.
Important mechanisms for change: change of opportunity and reward structures for bullying behavior (resulting in fewer opportunities and rewards for such behavior).
?? Both preventive and acutely problem-solving.
Both long-term and short-term goals.
?? Consistently built on research-based knowledge .
Various program components form part of a conceptually integrated system.
Program may be somewhat modified in light of new research findings.
?? Clear focus on measurement of problem behaviors (student questionnaire) and evaluation of processes and results.
Important to create awareness and involvement.
?? Universal, aimed primarily at the whole school population with the goal to create a safe and positive learning environment, and only indirectly at particularly targeted groups of students.
This is likely to increase schools' willingness to "take ownership" of the problems and the intervention program.
?? Designed to permeate the school environment to become part of the every day life of a school--it's not a time -limited campaign.
Although positive results may come
Characteristics of the Olweus Program
20
relatively quickly, systematic efforts over time are needed to maintain program effects.
There is no magic bullet.
?? Broad positive effects of the program on students--both with regard to bully/victim problems and related issues such as antisocial behavior and classroom climate--have been documented in scientific evaluations of the program, both in Norway and countries such as the U.K. and the USA.
Blueprints for Violence Prevention Bullying Prevention Program is available from the Center of the Study and Prevention of Violence, Institute of Behavioral Science, University of Colorado at Boulder, Campus Box 442, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0442, Phone 303-492-8465, FAX 303443-3297.
List price is $10.
Some cautions against the use of Peer Mediation in si tuations of Bullying (Dan Olweus) ?? Bullying is NOT a conflict, but is ABUSE.
To call it a conflict is a distortion and a trivialization of the victimization.
?? There is not "some right" and "some wrong" on both sides.
This thinking places blame on the vic tim and frees the bully from responsibility.
(Only 20% of victims are "provocative victims") ?? Peer mediation assumes that both sides have the same negotiating power, creating further infringements upon the victim.
The "playing field," or balance of power, is not level.
?? Peer mediation is based on the fundamental concept of NOT taking moral stand, or remaining neutral.
We must take a moral stand that bullying is unacceptable.
?? There is far too great a responsibility in instances of bullying to place upon child mediators.
Adults need to claim responsibility.
