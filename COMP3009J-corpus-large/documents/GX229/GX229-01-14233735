Date: April 9, 2002 Sweet potato growers intend to plant 95,600 acres of sweet potatoes in 2002, down 2 percent from the last two years for comparable states.
Two states expect higher acreage than last year, five states look for declines, and two are unchanged.
Georgia sweet potato estimates are discontinued this year.
All wheat planted area is expected to total 59.0 million acres in 2002.
This is down 1 percent from 2001 and the lowest level since 1972.
Area planted to Durum wheat is intended to total 2.84 million acres, down 2 percent from 2001.
The 2002 other spring wheat planted acreage is estimated at 15.1 million acres, down 3 percent from last year.
Of the total, about 14.2 million acres are Hard Red Spring wheat.
Winter wheat planted area for the 2002 crop is 41.1 million acres, nearly identical to the previous year's acreage.
This is the lowest acres seeded to winter wheat since 1971.
Of the total, about 29.3 million acres are Hard Red Winter, 8.4 million acres Soft Red Winter, and 3.4 million acres White Winter.
Barley growers intend to seed 5.08 million acres for 2002, up 2 percent from the record low of 4.97 million acres seeded a year ago.
Increases in 11 States were partially offset by declines in 8 States.
The intended acreage in Montana is up 150,000 acres from last year's drought reduced crop.
Acreage in Minnesota is rebounding 50,000 acres from last year when cool wet weather limited planting.
Fewer acres are expected in California as well as the Pacific Northwest states where dry conditions and concerns over water availability exist in some areas.
Corn growers intend to plant 79.0 million acres of corn for all purposes in 2002, up 4 percent from 2001, but down 1 percent from 2000.
Expected acreage is up in many areas of the United States and in virtually all areas of the Corn Belt.
Compared to last year when producers had problems getting their crops in due to persistent precipitation, conditions so far this year have been cooperative and have increased farmer's hopes of planting their corn crop on time.
Farmers intend to plant fewer corn acres than last year in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado because of concerns about dry conditions.
Hay producers expect to harvest 63.7 million acres of hay in 2002, up less than 1 percent from 2001.
Increases in 21 states are expected to offset declines in 18 States.
Oregon, up 13 percent, has the largest increase where producers are responding to strong prices and an increase in cattle inventory.
California expects to increase harvested acres by 6 percent in response to the strong dairy market.
Record high acreages are expected in Florida, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah.
Producers in Montana intend to harvest 10 percent fewer acres than last year, when they harvested large acreages of CRP and grain hay.
Growers in Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin expect to harvest record low acreages of hay.
Soybean producers intend to plant 73.0 million acres, down 2 percent from last year.
Reduced soybean acreage was offset by an expected increase in corn plantings in most areas.
Crop rotations, farm bill uncertainty, and price considerations were cited as primary reasons for the reduced soybean acreage.
Producers in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas intend to shift from cotton to soybeans.
Expected acreage in North Dakota is up 450,000 acres from last year replacing wheat acreage.

The 2002 Census of Agriculture is Coming The Census of Agriculture is a process by which we contact every farm operation in the nation so that they can provide information about their agricultural operation.
This farm information is then aggregated to provide the only source of uniform, comprehensive data on agricultural production and operator characteristics for each county, state, and the Nation.
All individual reports are kept completely confidential, and are even protected from disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act.
There are many important uses of the Census of Agriculture Data: i Federal Government policy makers use the Census of Agriculture data in drafting legislation to help resolve agricultural problems.
New Jersey state and local governments use the data for planning rural development, agricultural research, or extension programs.
Farm organizations use census data to develop and evaluate programs and policies that affect farmers and ranchers.
Farm cooperatives, commodity and trade associations, and agribusinesses use the data to aid in locating new plants and service distribution centers, allocating research funds, forecasting markets, and making advertising and other marketing decisions.
Economists use the Census of Agriculture to benchmark data for current statistical series such as the Gross Domestic Product, Producer Price Index, and Farm Income Accounts.

The New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service will begin collecting Census of Agriculture data in December of this year.
Your report (if you are a farm operator) is very important to all New Jersey farmers.
We can show that New Jersey agriculture is important to New Jersey's economic well-being.
It is extremely important to count all of our agriculture.

March Agricultural Survey.
Prices Received Index Up The preliminary Prices Received by Farmers Index for All Farm Products in March was 106, using a 1990-92=100 base period, up 7 points (7.1 percent) from the February index.
A record price for lettuce, along with other increases for eggs, cattle, and tomatoes, more than offset decreased prices for broilers, milk, hogs, and broccoli.
The seasonal change in the mix of commodities farmers sell often affects the overall index.
Higher marketings for strawberries, lettuce, milk, and tomatoes more than offset decreased marketings of cattle, oranges, corn, and cotton.
Compared with March 2001, the Prices Received Index was up 2 points (1.9 percent).
Higher prices for lettuce, strawberries, potatoes, and apples more than offset lower prices for broilers, hogs, cattle, and tomatoes.
The Food Commodities Index increased 9.0 percent over last month and was 3.8 percent above March 2001.
Prices Paid Index Unchanged The Prices Paid by Farmers Index for Commodities and Services, Interest, Taxes, and Farm Wage Rates (PPITW) in March was 122 percent of the 1990-92 average.
The index was unchanged from February, but 2 points (1.6 percent) below March 2001.
Lower prices in March for feeder cattle, complete feeds, nitrogen fertilizers, and feeder pigs were offset by higher prices for diesel fuel, gasoline, hay and forages, and potash and phosphate materials.
