GEOMETRY Course Description: Geometry is a course that uses problem situations, physical models, and appropriate technology to investigate geometric concepts, relationships, and systems.
Problem-solving situations provide all students an environment that promotes communication, engages student reasoning, and fosters connections within mathematics, to other disciplines, and to the real world.
Students will use physical models to represent, explore, and develop abstract concepts.
The use of appropriate technology will help students apply mathematics in an increasingly technological world.
The concepts/topics emphasized in the course include measurement, geometric patterns, coordinate geometry, two- and three-dimensional figures, transformational geometry, congruence, and similarity.
