After the filing of such complaint, the proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 621, RSMo.
Upon a finding by the administrative hearing commission that the grounds, provided in subsection 2, for disciplinary action are met, the board may, singly or in combination, censure or place the person named in the complaint on probation on such terms and conditions as the board deems appropriate for a period not to exceed five years, or may suspend, for a period not to exceed three years, or revoke the license, certificate, or permit.
The board may impose additional discipline on a licensee, registrant or permittee found to have violated any disciplinary terms previously imposed under this section or by agreement.

If the board concludes that a pharmacist has committed an act or is engaging in a course of conduct which would be grounds for disciplinary action which constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health and safety, the board may file a complaint before the administrative hearing commission requesting an expedited hearing and specifying the activities which give rise to the danger and the nature of the proposed restriction or suspension of the pharmacist's license.
Within fifteen days after service of the complaint on the pharmacist, the administrative hearing commission shall conduct a preliminary hearing to determine whether the alleged activities of the pharmacist appear to constitute a clear and present danger to the public health and safety which justify that the pharmacist's license be immediately restricted or suspended.
The burden of proving that a pharmacist is a clear and present danger to the public health and safety shall be upon the state board of pharmacy.
The administrative hearing commission shall issue its decision immediately after the hearing and shall either grant to the board the authority to suspend or restrict the license or dismiss the action.
5.
If the administrative hearing commission grants temporary authority to the board to restrict or suspend the pharmacist's license, such temporary authority of the board shall become final authority if there is no request by the pharmacist for a full hearing within thirty days of the preliminary hearing.
The administrative hearing commission shall, if requested by the pharmacist named in the complaint, set a date to hold a full hearing under the provisions of chapter 621, RSMo, regarding the activities alleged in the initial complaint filed by the board.
6.
If the administrative hearing commission dismisses the action filed by the board pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, such dismissal shall not bar the board from initiating a subsequent action on the same grounds.
