Types of Nuisance Problems _________________________________________________________________ Because they are so adaptable, coyotes live in the fringes of big cities, suburban areas and small towns, as well as in the country.
As people continue to move out to the country and as coyotes continue to move into the cities, more opportunities for conflicts develop.
Conflicts with people
Typically shy, elusive animals, coyotes don't normally pose a threat to humans.
Most people who live in areas of high coyote populations rarely see one.
When coyotes seem aggressive towards humans, it is typically in situations where they have been protected and allowed to co-exist with people.
In these cases, coyotes can become quite bold.
Coyotes exhibiting threatening behavior should be reported to the local authorities or the Missouri Department of Conservation.
In these cases, removing the coyote by lethal means may be the only recourse.

Problems at airports
Coyotes sometimes pose a threat to airplanes that are landing or taking off.
A small aircraft could have its landing gear damaged by striking a coyote.
There also is the possibility that a large jet airliner could strike a coyote with its landing gear and flip the animal into the air and suck it into an engine.
A high fence around an airport will help keep out most coyotes.
Trapping, snaring and shooting are other options.
Killing or injuring pets Coyotes occasionally kill or injure small domestic dogs or cats.
Larger breeds of dogs, such as full-size collies, German shepherds and Labrador retrievers, are not in danger from coyotes, except when they are puppies.
The best solution is to keep small pets inside or an eye on them when outside.
If that is not possible, lethal methods, such as shooting, trapping and snaring, are options in areas that permit their use.
Keep pets inside when traps and snares are set.
Coyotes with pups sometimes become aggressive to dogs that come near their den in April and May.
If the den can be located, removing the pups will solve the problem.
Human disturbance at the den usually will cause coyotes to move the pups

[image5.gif] Most coyotes in Missouri do not kill calves, but some will prey on a young one if the mother has left it alone to find food or water.

Loss of livestock
In Missouri, coyotes usually can find an abundance of food in the wild.
Most livestock predation takes place when coyotes are feeding pups in spring and early summer.
Some people believe that leaving farm animals that have died from natural causes in a field will cause coyotes to start killing livestock.
Although coyotes sometimes feed on livestock carrion, it usually doesn't attract them.
Coyotes do not seem to care for the carrion of cattle, sheep or goats, although they do visit these carcasses to roll on them, leave droppings and mark nearby objects with urine.
They will feed on hog carrion, but it is doubtful that this behavior is a reason for Missouri coyotes to begin killing livestock.
Calves
Most coyotes in Missouri do not kill calves, and many farmers have raised cattle for years without experiencing problems.
Coyotes seen in and around calving pastures usually are not a cause for alarm.
Some may be attracted to calving cows by the smell.
After the calves are born, coyotes may clean up the afterbirth and eat the rich colostrum manure left by the newborns while leaving the calves alone.
Occasionally, a coyote or a family of coyotes may kill young calves to feed their pups.
Most healthy calves killed by coyotes are less than a week old and have been left alone by their mothers.
Cows often leave the main herd when they give birth.
The newborn calf becomes vulnerable to predators when its mother leaves it to seek food and water.
When the cow rejoins the herd or the calf is at least 10 days old, the danger from coyotes is usually over.
Just after calving, a cow may be too weak to drive coyotes away from its calf.
Coyotes occasionally kill calves during the birthing process.
In some cases, if coyotes find a cow having a long, hard labor, they may prey upon the calf while it is protruding from the cow, sometimes mutilating the mother in the process.
Coyotes may kill a weak and sick calf, especially if the cow is weak and unable to defend it.
Calves that have scours or other diseases are especially vulnerable to coyote attacks.
Sometimes it may appear that a coyote has killed a calf, but instead it was just feeding on one that died from natural causes.
Good animal husbandry practices can help reduce calf losses.
First, it is important to know when cows are going to calve.
Young cows or mature ones that have not been good mothers in the past should be watched closely.
When a cow has a calf away from the herd, it should be fed and watered so it doesn't have to leave its calf alone.
Sometimes cows can be brought close to the farmhouse until their calves are old enough and vigorous enough to be turned out with the rest of the herd.
Guard animals also can provide protection to cows that are calving.
These trained animals bond with livestock but are aggressive to wild dogs and coyotes.
Guard animals lose their effectiveness, however, if the cows go off by themselves to calve.
For more information on guard animals, see page 11.
Sheep
Not all coyotes kill sheep.
Coyotes often make routine trips through a sheep pasture without killing sheep.
Coyotes that kill sheep prefer lambs to larger mature ewes.
Occasionally, two or three coyotes collaborate in bringing down a large ewe.
In these cases, the wounds resemble those made by a dog because of the difficulty that 25- to 30-pound coyotes have in pulling down such a large animal.
Coyotes are more likely to kill lambs during June and July when they are feeding pups.
They usually kill one sheep at a time and feed on it until it is devoured.
A coyote looking for food approaches a flock of sheep much like a border collie.
When a lamb breaks away from the flock, the coyote runs beside it and sinks its upper canine teeth just behind the ear and its lower canine teeth in the throat.
The coyote clamps down tightly in this strangle hold and holds on until the lamb is unconscious.
The coyote usually begins feeding in the flank area while the lamb is still alive.
On rare occasions, a coyote may forego the throat bite, grab the lamb in the flank, throw it down and begin feeding.
Coyotes may develop a pattern of killing sheep every day, every other day or sometimes every third day.
They often kill another sheep as soon as the last one has been devoured.
A high-tensile predator-proof electric fence around a pasture can keep coyote and dog losses to a minimum.
If the cost of fencing an entire field is too high, a high woven-wire or predator-proof fence should be used for a night lot.
Coyotes sometimes kill sheep during the daylight hours, but putting animals in a lot at night is one of the best ways to minimize losses.
The lot should be near the farmhouse, with a 7-foot woven-wire fence close to the ground that coyotes can't crawl under.
A night lot with any kind of fence close to the farmhouse is better than allowing the sheep to roam in a pasture at night.
Lights and music played all night may help keep coyotes away.
If a guard animal is used, it should be with the sheep in the night lot.
Once coyotes have started killing sheep and have developed a pattern, trapping or snaring the problem animals is the best short-term solution.
If traps are set in the pasture, sheep should be temporarily fenced out of the area.
If this is not possible, the traps can be covered during the day and uncovered when the sheep are in the night lot.
This makes the traps less effective because they are only being used part time.
If using snares at fences, it is seldom necessary to remove livestock.
Goats
Coyotes kill goats in a similar manner to sheep; therefore, husbandry and prevention methods for these two species are the same.
Because Angora goats are especially vulnerable to coyotes, guard animals should be used if at all possible.
Pigs
Coyotes often kill small pigs on a daily basis when they are feeding pups and may wipe out several litters in a relatively short time.
Pigs several days to a few weeks old may be taken one or several at a time.
Sometimes coyotes snatch small pigs away from the sow as they nurse.
Busy farmers may not notice small pigs are missing until a number of them are gone.
An irritable and aggressive sow is a good indication that coyotes have been feeding on the litter.
Coyotes may take pigs from the nest when sows farrow in the open or go into farrowing hutches.
When pigs are no longer in the nest with the sow, it may be harder to notice that they are disappearing.
Pigs weighing around 10 pounds may be found partially eaten and bitten in the throat.
Small pigs are often bitten through the head.
It is rare for coyotes to kill pigs larger than 30 pounds, but they have been known to kill pigs larger than 75 pounds.
A high woven- or net-wire fence at least 7 feet tall can keep coyotes out of hog lots.
If the hog lot is relatively small, an existing woven-wire fence that is tight and extends to the ground can be raised to a height of 7 feet.
To do this, add tall posts at the corners and at intervals along the fence.
Then add another 48-inch roll of woven wire above the existing fence.
The fence should be carefully maintained.
Adding an apron of wire at the ground can help prevent coyotes from digging under the fence.
A high-tensile electric predator-proof fence can be an effective way to control coyote damage to pigs and also serves as a good hog fence.
Unlike cattle or sheep pastures, hog lots are small and can be fenced at a reasonable cost.
If a woven- or net-wire fence already is in place, an electric predator-proof fence can be installed just outside the existing fence for added protection.
Because almost all coyotes will take a small pig if given the opportunity, snaring or trapping is the best short-term solution until preventative measures, such as erecting a fence, can be taken.
Some farmers in Missouri keep a guard donkey in their hog lots to control damage from coyotes and dogs.

[image4.gif] Because coyotes will kill chickens whenever they get a chance, the best protection is to build a predator-proof pen.

Poultry
Poultry, such as chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys, are easy prey, and any passing coyote bold enough to approach an area where they are ranging will help itself.
Removing problem coyotes will only make space for other coyotes to move into the area.
To stop poultry killing, predators would have to be trapped or snared close to the house, and this would endanger pets that are a part of most households.
The best precaution, therefore, is to house the poultry at night where predators can't get to them and build a high, predator-proof pen for the fowl during the day.
Exotic animals
Coyotes can be a problem to pen-raised birds and animals, such as deer, rea birds and exotic sheep.
The best step to prevent coyote damage is to tighten or modify the high pens where these exotics are kept.
Use snares where coyotes may crawl under the fence.
Guard animals, especially llamas, also can be effective.

Dog or coyote - who's to blame?
Coyotes often get blamed for livestock injuries and deaths caused by wild or domestic free-running dogs.
Here's how to tell if a coyote or a dog is causing the damage.
Coyotes: * usually go for an animal's throat.
* do not chase cattle.
* do not kill larger calves or grown cattle.
* usually kill one animal at a time and feed on it.
* on rare occasions bite the tails off young calves.
These "bob-tailed" calves usually survive.
* on rare occasions hamstring a larger calf or deer and feed on the still-living animal.
Dogs: * attack wherever they can get a hold on the animal - often the hindquarters. * chase cattle until the livestock become overheated or stressed.
* kill or injure several or all the livestock in an area u usually abandon their kill without feeding on it. * chew on legs, ears and tails and often mangle the animals rather than killing them.
* leave dead animals over a large area where the pack chased them.
* usually make indiscriminate wounds all over the animal but most often in the rear area.
* sometimes kill or maim larger pigs. * leave deep gashes, slashes and other wounds.
[image1.gif] Dogs, unlike coyotes, usually attack from the rear, chase livestock and abandon their kills without feeding on them.
