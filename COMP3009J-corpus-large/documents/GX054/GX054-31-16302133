Barton Springs salamanders found dead, with deformities -- March 2, 2002 Researchers from Austin to Madison, Wis., are trying to discover what killed three endangered Barton Springs salamanders during the past week.
Salamanders and some fish began turning up with unusually severe deformities last Friday: Gas had collected into bubbles inside the salamanders 2 1/2-inch-long, translucent bodies.
Three salamanders died, and three others showed symptoms.
