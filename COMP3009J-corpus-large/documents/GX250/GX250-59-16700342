SPR03-39 Title Summary Adoption (amend Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 1464; revise forms ADOPT-200, ADOPT-210, and ADOPT-215) The proposed revisions to the adoption forms and the proposed amendment to rule 1464 of the California Rules of Court would assist litigants and practitioners in completing the adoption process.
Rule 1464 would be amended to require court clerks to provide form ADOPT-200 to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) along with any adoptive placement agreement.
The rule also would be amended to require that where there is no adoptive placement agreement, court clerks submit the child's birth name and birth parents' names on a separate cover sheet, along with form ADOPT200, in lieu of CDSS form AD 3.
Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee Hon. Michael Nash and Hon. Mary Ann Grilli, Co-chairs Jennifer Walter, 415-865-7687, jennifer.walter@jud.ca.gov Shortly after the plain-language adoption forms became effective, a number of people, including court research attorneys, practitioners, clerks of the court, and the representatives of the California Department of Social Services, contacted the Administrative Office of the Courts with suggested revisions to the adoption forms and an amendment to rule 1464.
The proposed revisions to ADOPT-200 include the following: 1.
In item 1, there is a need for the petitioner's/requester's address even if the person has a lawyer, and therefore the parenthetical, "skip this if you have a lawyer," would be deleted.
The agency conducting the home study of the adopting parents requires the address of the adopting parents.
2.
In item 5, the child is more accurately described as a dependent of the court rather than the county if there is an open juvenile court case.
3.
On page 1, the box for the hearing date, would include the statement "To be completed by the clerk of the superior court, if a hearing date is available."
In most independent adoptions, the hearing date will not be issued by the clerk upon the filing of the Adoption Request.
Additionally, it was not clear that the Source Staff Discussion clerk, and not the petitioner/requester, is to complete this box.
4.
A new line was added to former item 10, new item 9, for stepparent and domestic parent adoptions, to indicate whether the birth parent is out of state, in which case his or her consent is required to be signed before a notary under Family Code section 9003(b).
5.
Former item 14, new item 10, pertaining to the adoption of children conceived through artificial insemination, was amended to clarify that it did not exclude in-home inseminations.
6.
New item 20 was added to provide a line for the lawyer to sign the Adoption Request as the line was present on the original Adoption Petition; however, the lawyer need not sign under penalty of perjury, as was the case on the original form.
7.
Spaces were added to former item 12, new item 13, to clarify that consent is not necessary for any of the persons checked.
8.
Items were reorganized to more clearly direct those completing the form to the items to be completed depending on whether they are seeking an agency, independent, or stepparent/domestic parent adoption.
The items were renumbered as a result.
9.
The legal terms for possible parents (i.e., "birth mother," "presumed father," and "biological father") in former items 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (new items 14, 15, 7, 8, 16, 17) were replaced with "name" and "relationship to child."
The current legal terms omitted the possibility of "legal mothers" and "legal fathers" in stepparent and domestic partner adoptions where there would not necessarily be a birth mother or a birth father.
Adding more legal terms would be more confusing to the layperson.
The "plain-language" change is preferable to the current legal terms, which both are limiting and ask the layperson completing the form to make legal conclusions.
10.
In sections relating to agency and independent adoptions, where persons state that they agree to the adoption, these statements have been revised to include that the persons agreeing have also signed the appropriate forms for consent and relinquishment required by the California Department of Social Services.
Users deemed the plain-language wording, "agree to 2 the adoption" as too vague.
With the reference to the CDSS forms added, the person completing the form will learn that additional forms must be completed.
11.
Cites were added to assist with distinctions among agency, independent, and stepparent/domestic parent adoptions.
The proposed revisions to ADOPT-210 include the following: 1.
All items requiring signatures were amended to include a parenthetical direction "sign at hearing," so that court users do not sign the form in advance of their court date hearing; otherwise they must complete a new form and sign before the judge.
The signature line for the child over 12 (item 3) was amended to include a statement that the child must sign at the hearing as required under Family Code section 8602.
2.
Also in item 3, the request that the child's birth name be listed so relatives would be able to contact the child was deleted, because it might give the false impression to children that relatives would contact them.
3.
Former items 4.a.(1) and 4.a.(2) and former items 4.c(1) and 4.c(2) had separate boxes suggesting that one need not agree to both statements, when in fact the adopting parent(s) do not have a choice and must agree to both statements.
For this reason, the boxes were deleted.
4.
Former item 4.b became its own item, number 5, as it only pertained to stepparent and domestic partner adoptions.
The wording of the statement was clarified by adding the words "of the child," because the way the statement read it was unclear whether the parent was the parent of the child to be adopted or of the spouse/domestic partner.
Additionally, the signature line read "Adopting Parent," which was erroneous, because the person signing is the legal parent (e.g., domestic partner/birth parent or stepparent/legal parent who already adopted the child).
The proposed revisions to ADOPT-215 include the following: 1.
Former item 2, new item 3, was revised to include the state and country of the child's birth.
3 2.
New item 2 was added to indicate the type of adoption order granted.
3.
Former item 4, new item 5, which lists the people present in court, was moved above the box that the judge completes, because the person completing the form is not able to complete this item in advance of the hearing.
4.
Former item 5b, which asked for the child's birth name to be listed so relatives would be able to contact the child, was deleted because it might give the false impression to children that relatives would contact them.
5.
Former items 9 and 10 were consolidated into new item 10, and the boxes pertaining to the child's adoptive name and the establishment of the adopting parent(s) as the legal parent(s) of the child were removed to show that the judge does not have a choice in making these orders as part of an adoption order.
Rule 1464 would be amended to help expedite the adoption process as it applies to form ADOPT-200.
Judge will fill out section below.
8 The child is an Indian child.
The judge finds that this adoption meets the placement requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act and that there is good cause to give preference to these adopting parents.
The clerk will fill out 11 below.
The judge approves the Contact After Adoption Agreement As submitted As amended on ADOPT-310 The The The the (ADOPT-310) 9 10 judge believes the adoption is in the childÃ¯Â¿Â½s best interest and orders this adoption.
child's name after adoption will be: _________________________________________________________ adopting parent(s) and the child are now parent and child under the law, with all the rights and duties of parent-child relationship.

Clerk's Certificate of Mailing 11 For the adoption of an Indian Child, the Clerk certifies: I am not a party to this adoption.
I placed a filed copy of: ADOPT-200, Adoption Request ADOPT-215, Adoption Order ADOPT-220, Adoption of Indian Child ADOPT-310, Contact After Adoption Agreement in a sealed envelope, marked "Confidential," and addressed to: Chief, Division of Social Services Bureau of Indian Affairs 1849 C Street, N.W. Mail Stop 310-SIB Washington, DC 20240 The envelope was mailed, with full postage, by U.S. mail from: Place: Date: Rev. January 1, 2004 on (date): Clerk, by , Deputy Adoption Order 14 ADOPT-215, Page 2 of 2
(Fam. Code, Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 8714(b), 8802(a)(2), 8912(a).)
Court clerks have been providing this notice by sending a CDSS form, Notice of Pendency (form AD 3), to the CDSS.
The CDSS would like to revoke form AD 3 and use form ADOPT-200 in its place.
The CDSS reports that form AD 3 often lacks all the information required to complete the adoption.
The need to collect this information delays the adoption process.
Form ADOPT-200 is a mandatory form and contains all the information the CDSS requires to expedite the adoption process, except for the child's birth name and the names of the birth parents.
The CDSS has requested that Judicial Council adopt a rule of court that would direct the clerk of the court to forward to the CDSS a copy of Judicial Council form ADOPT-200, along with a copy of the adoptive placement agreement.
If there is no adoptive placement agreement, the clerk would instead provide the child's birth name and birth parents' names on a separate cover sheet accompanying form ADOPT-200.
The suggestion that form ADOPT-200 be revised to include information about the child's birth name was considered and rejected as being contrary to current law.
The prohibition on including the child's birth name on ADOPT-200 is found in Family Code section 8714(d) regarding agency adoptions, section 8912(b) regarding intercountry adoptions, and section 9000(e) regarding stepparent and domestic partner adoptions.
Technical amendments to the rule that would be made include updating the titles of the adoption forms to reflect their current plainlanguage names.
The text of the proposed amended rule is attached at pages 67.
The proposed revised forms are attached at pages 814.
