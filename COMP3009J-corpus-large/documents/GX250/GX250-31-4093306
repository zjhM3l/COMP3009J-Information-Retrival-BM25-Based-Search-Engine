August 2, 1999
FY 1999 Mass Media Regulatory Fees The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in FY 1999.
If you are a licensee or permittee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review this Public Notice.
WHO MUST PAY REGULATORY FEES IN FY 1999 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in FY 1999.
This Public Notice concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM 
Noncommercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations, remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly owned non-commercial educational stations.
Emergency alert system (EAS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees.
Governments and nonprofit entities (exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code) are not required to pay regulatory fees and should not submit payment.
The Commission requires that each exempt entity submit, or have on file with the Commission, a current IRS Determination Letter documenting its nonprofit status, a certification of governmental authority, or certification from a governmental authority attesting to its exempt status.
The regulatory fee to be assessed is based upon the nature of the authorization (e.g. construction permit or license) held as of October 1, 1998.
Responsibility for payment of that fee rests with the current holder of the permit or license at the time payment is due.
A regulatee is responsible for summing all of its services in order to determine if a fee is due.
If the sum of all services owned is less than $10, then the regulatee is exempt from paying the fee.
WHY THE COMMISSION MUST COLLECT REGULATORY FEES The requirement to collect annual regulatory fees is contained in Public Law 103-66, "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993."
These regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, are used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public information, international and policy and rulemaking activities.
These fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission.
WHEN FEES WILL BE DUE Fee payments must be received by the Commission during the period beginning September 13, 1999, and ending September 22, 1999.
Any payment not received at Mellon Bank by 11:59 p.m., September 22, 1999 will be assessed a 25% late payment fee.
FCC FORM 159 Regulatory fee payments must be accompanied by FCC Form 159 ("FCC Remittance Advice"), dated July 1997.
A copy of this form, with specific instructions, is attached to this Public Notice and may be used to submit fees.
Reproduced forms are acceptable.
Please see "Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 and 159-C" for detailed information on how to correctly complete these forms.
Unless you are submitting your information on diskette, you must list each Call Sign separately on Forms 159/159-C. Written attachments are not acceptable.
Failure to properly complete FCC Form 159/159-C will delay the processing of your regulatory fee payment.
Any regulatee paying for more than 25 entities may do so by submitting the Form 159 information on diskette.
Information on how to file electronically on diskette will be made available in a subsequent public notice.

Specific instructions regarding diskette submission will be issued separately.
No more than twenty-five (25) Form 159-C's should be manually submitted for payment.
If more than twentyfive (25) Form 159-C's are to be submitted, we encourage the public to file the information on diskette.
Only properly filled out Form 159's or diskettes will be accepted.
Attached listings of call signs or other identifiers will not be accepted.
WIRE TRANSFER PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS A wire transfer is a transaction that you initiate via your bank.
It authorizes your bank to wire funds from your account to our lockbox bank, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, PA.
All payments made by wire transfer must be supported by a completed FCC Remittance Advice (FCC Form 159) and Advice Continuation Sheet (FCC Form 159-C), if required.
The FCC Form 159 must be faxed to Mellon Bank at (412) 236-5702 at least one hour before the wire transfer on the same business day.
Indicate on the top of the FCC Form 159 "Wire Transfer - Regulatory Fee Payment."
In Box (1) - Lockbox#, located at the upper left hand corner, indicate "358835."
Failure to submit the completed FCC FORM 159 will result in a delay in crediting your account.

Arrangements for using this process must be completed 14 days prior to submitting payment of the regulatory fee.
After you have been set up for this program, you have until September 21, 1999 to submit payment to ensure processing by the deadline of September 22, 1999.
Please contact the Credit and Debt Management Center at (202) 418-1995 to request the Customer Initiated Payment Program Package.
COMPLIANCE Please make sure your total remittance and the amount indicated on the FCC Form 159 are in agreement.
Failure to do so will delay processing.
Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.
Any data omission, erroneous or incomplete data submission, or payment deficiency may result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation of any authorization.
You are strongly urged to submit your payments on time and accurately in order to avoid a penalty.
Additionally, the Commission will invoke any lawful authority it may possess under the Debt Collection Act to collect any fees due or outstanding against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.
WAIVERS, REDUCTIONS AND DEFERMENTS OF REGULATORY FEES The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory costs.
Your regulatory fee must be paid by the due date even if a request is made for a waiver or reduction.
This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied.
The regulatory fee will be refunded later if the request is granted.
Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver or reduction request.
All requests for deferments must be received before September 22, 1999, to avoid the 25% latepayment penalty.
Please submit your written waiver or reduction request to the following 4
