Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum Is A Clean Marina Partner ______________________________________________________________ ANNAPOLIS, MD (June 5, 2001) - Talbot County's Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels today became, is the first museum to be named a Maryland Clean Marina Partner.
The Clean Marina Partner designation indicates that museum managers minimize pollution from their own operations and actively promote clean boating habits.
For example, at the counter where transient boaters register for slips the museum features a display featuring clean boating tips.
The museum has also incorporated environmental policies into its boater's guide.
In addition to educating boaters about how to minimize their environmental impacts, the museum has taken steps to mitigate against any potential pollution from their operations which includes developing an oil spill response plan and keeping oil spill response equipment on site.
"We are glad to do our part to protect the Chesapeake Bay through this voluntary effort," said dock master and support service manager Robin Newberg.
"The best way to show our respect for the heritage of the Chesapeake Bay is to preserve it for future generations."
The Department of Natural Resources' Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from recreational boating.
Operators of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs qualify for Clean Marina certification by adopting measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff, and facilities management.
The Clean Marina Partner designation was created to recognize boating facilities other than marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs that are implementing pollution prevention measures.
"We are extremely pleased to recognize Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum as a certified Clean Marina Partner," said Elizabeth Fuller Valentine, Clean Marina Coordinator.
"Thousands of people visit the museum annually to learn about the history of the Bay.
Now they can learn about specific steps toward its preservation as well."
The goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify 25 percent of Maryland's 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners by 2004.
To date, 122 boating facilities have taken the first step and signed the Clean Marina Pledge.
Of these, 34 have been certified as Clean Marinas and 5 have been certified as Clean Marina Partners
