Judicial Branch Showcases Historic Murals
[image006.jpg] Justice
The Beginning--1886.
The murals were designed by August Knorr, a Des Moines decorator, who was responsible for decorating the State Capitol in the 1880s.
Knorr's designs were sent to Germany to painter Fritz Melzer who was "much in vogue as a decorative artist" at the time.
The murals are oil paint on linen canvas.
They cost $949.76 in 1886.
Themes of Justice.
The largest mural, entitled Columbia, shows Columbia sitting on her throne, which is perched on a large globe.
To her left is Justice, paying homage, and to her right is Iowa holding a club and a coat of arms, ready to defend Columbia.

Another large mural shows Justice and Peace seated together in a throne atop clouds.
Justice holds a scale in one hand and a sword in her other hand, poised ready to strike.
Peace looks on serenely as a partially robed man whose face is said to resemble President Ulysses S. Grant puts down a one-man Roman rebellion.

There are six small oval murals, each contains a cherubic looking child called a "genius" (a tutelary deity or guardian spirit).
Each genius is engaged in an agricultural task.
The six ovals were originally located around the Ceres mural.

The murals were removed from the courtroom in 1904 after a fire that damaged the House chambers one floor above the courtroom, and were placed in storage.
In 1907, the murals were installed in the old State Historical Building.
Restoration--2001.
The Supreme Court retained Art conservator (and former Iowan) Randy Ash of Denver, Colorado, to remove the murals, clean and stabilize them, and prepare them for installation in the new building.
Ash and an assistant worked around the clock for one week in mid-December to carefully peel the murals off the walls and wrap them for shipping.
According to Ash, the murals were mounted directly on the wall with a simple adhesive probably made from wheat flour and water.
Because the adhesive had substantially deteriorated, Ash was able to pull the murals off the wall using a cake spatula and artist's knife.
Some of the murals had cuts and tears that likely occurred when they were removed from the Capitol.
Prior to removal, Ash secured the tears with a special conservation tool--duct tape.
Ash attributes much of the dark appearance of the murals to smoke damage from the 1904 fire.
In addition, when the murals were installed in the Old Historical Building, an artist painted the wall surrounding the murals to create a larger background.
The artist even took care to mix the paint so that it matched the dark colors caused by the smoke damage.
After the murals were cleaned and restored, Ash mounted them on aluminum honeycomb panels so that in the future they can be easily moved.
The restoration project will cost up to $174,000.
Funds for the project came from the building construction budget as part of the mandatory art requirement for new State buildings.
