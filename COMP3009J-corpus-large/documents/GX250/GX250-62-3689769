SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Electronic Access For additional information on Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins, refer to the draft 2002 Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs).
The reports can be accessed via the internet at: http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/protlres/ PR2/StocklAssessmentlProgram/sa rs.html.
Background NMFS intends to develop and implement a BDTRP pursuant to section 118(f) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).
The purpose of the proposed action is to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of the Atlantic coastal stock of bottlenose dolphins in commercial fisheries to below the PBR level for the stock.
The BDTRP will address mortality and serious injury of Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins incidentally taken in the following Category II commercial fisheries: Mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet; North Carolina inshore gillnet; Southeast Atlantic gillnet; Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet; Atlantic blue crab trap/pot; MidAtlantic haul/beach seine; North Carolina long haul seine; North Carolina roe mullet stop net; and Virginia pound net.
Section 118(f) of the MMPA requires NMFS to convene a take reduction team to assist in the recovery and prevent the depletion of each strategic stock that interacts with Category I or II fisheries.
The western North Atlantic coastal stock of bottlenose dolphins is a strategic stock.
More information about the stock is available in the draft 2002 SAR, which can be obtained via the internet (see ELECTRONIC ACCESS) or by contacting Katie Moore or Emily Menashes (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).
Strategic status was initially assigned because the stock is designated as depleted under the MMPA as a result of a large-scale mortality event that occurred in 1987Â­1988 (58 FR 17789, April 6, 1993).
However, the stock also qualifies as strategic because mortality and serious injury of this stock incidental to commercial fishing exceeds the PBR level of the stock.
The immediate goal of a take reduction plan for a strategic stock of marine mammals is to reduce, within 6 months of plan implementation, the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to levels

Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 140 / Monday, July 22, 2002 / Notices less than the PBR level.
The long-term goal of the plan is to reduce, within 5 years of its implementation, the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing state or regional fishery management plans.
The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may establish a take reduction team to address mortality or serious injury of strategic stocks of marine mammals interacting with Category I or II fisheries.
Not later than 6 months after the date of establishment of a take reduction team, the team is required to submit a draft take reduction plan for such stock to the Secretary, consistent with the other provisions of section 118 of the MMPA.
The Secretary is required to take the draft take reduction plan submitted by the team into consideration and publish in the Federal Register a summary of the draft plan submitted by the team, any changes proposed by the Secretary with an explanation of the reasons therefore, and proposed regulations to implement such plan, for public review and comment.
Public Scoping Process The Bottlenose Dolphin Take Reduction Team (Team) was established on November 7, 2001.
A Federal Register notification announcing the convening of the Team and their first meeting was published on October 24, 2001 (66 FR 53782).
The Team met a total of five times before delivering consensus recommendations for the BDTRP to NMFS on May 7, 2002.
The dates of the five meetings were: November 7Â­8, 2001, January 23Â­25, 2002, February 27Â­March 1, 2002, March 27Â­28, 2002, and April 23Â­25, 2002.
Team meetings were open to the public and a public comment period was held following each day of meetings.
Additionally, NMFS held three public meetings with potential Team members and other interested members of the public on May 15Â­16, 2001, July 11Â­12, 2001, and November 6, 2001.
No additional scoping meetings are scheduled.
This document provides additional opportunity for public involvement in the scope of the issues to be addressed in the EIS. NMFS hired a commercial fisheries liaison to involve potentially affected sectors of the commercial fishing industry in the Team process by providing information about the purpose of the Team, meeting dates and locations, and discussion topics for upcoming meetings.
The liaison used dockside visits, commercial fishing publications, and a commercial fishing expo to disseminate the information.
NMFS generated and distributed a fact sheet about the Team and upcoming Team meetings and used mail and electronic mail to distribute information about meeting logistics and summaries to over 200 interested persons.
Analysis of Alternatives NMFS will be analyzing alternatives that are reasonably expected to reduce mortality and serious injury of Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins to less than the PBR level within 6 months of implementation of the BDTRP.
NMFS will be analyzing all reasonable alternatives, which include a status quo alternative and the recommendations submitted by the Team.
The Team's recommendations can be obtained by contacting Katie Moore or Emily Menashes (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Notice of Area the Public Is Requested To Temporarily Avoid During Coral Reef Restoration Activities in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary AGENCY: National Marine Sanctuaries Program (NMSP), Office of Ocean and Coastal Resources Management (OCRM), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC).
ACTION: Notice of area to be temporarily avoided.
SUMMARY: NOAA requests that users of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) avoid, from June 28, 2002 through August 15, 2002, an area of approximately 0.58 acres marked by construction buoys in the vicinity of 25Â° 0.67 N, 80Â° 22.37 W, which is at ``Molkasses Reef'' and is located 6 nautical miles (11.1 km) off the southeastern portion of Key Largo, Florida.
Avoidance was previously requested for the same region from May 15, 2002 through June 28, 2002.
Due to
unusual weather conditions, the work was not able to be completed.
During the time of avoidance, NOAA and authorized contractors will be conducting physical restoration activities of a coral reef where the M/V Wellwood grounded in August 1984.
The public is requested to avoid the area during this period due to the presence of heavy construction materials and equipment (e.g., barges and cranes), avoid the area during this period due to the presence of heavy construction materials and equipment (e.g., barges and cranes), moorings, surface air supply hoses of divers and increased localized boat traffic.
The intent of this notice is to ensure the timely and successful completion of the restoration and the protection of life and property during these complex activities.
DATES: The public is requested to avoid the area from June 28, 2002 through August 15, 2002.
If less or more time is needed, NOAA will so inform the public.
Public notice of this request also will be provided through local news media, a Notice to Mariners, and posting of placards or bulletin boards in public areas in Key Largo.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harriet Sopher, Program Manager, Resource Protection Team, National Marine Sanctuaries Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, SSMC4, 11th Floor, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910.
Telephone number: 301Â­713Â­3125, ext. 109.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 4, 1984, the M/V Wellwood, a 122-meter Cypriotregistered freighter, ran aground on the upper forereef of Molasses Reef within the FKNMS.
The grounding site is a bank reef located 6 nautical miles (11.1 km) off the southeast portion of Key Largo, Florida (centered at approximately 25Â°0.67 N, 80Â°22.37 W).
The impact of the grounding and the shifting of the vessel created large scars on the Molasses Reef forereef.
Significant injuries were inflicted to the coral reef colonies, substrate, and other resident marine organisms such as sponges and sea fans.
The unconsolidated coral rubble and ship debris have been removed.
Storm events, including Hurricane Georges in the autumn of 1998, have caused additional damage to the grounding site.
Section 312 of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA; 16 U.S.C. 1443) authorizes NOAA to pursue claims for response costs and damages when sanctuary resources are destroyed, lost
