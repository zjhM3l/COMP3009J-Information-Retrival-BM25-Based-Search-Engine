2002 New Jersey Vegetable Summary 2002 Vegetable Season: The mild winter, warm spring, persistent dry summer, and favorable fall weather each had varying effects upon the vegetable crops this season.
The spring planting started out early.
Temperatures were about normal, while topsoil moisture was short during late spring.
Growing conditions and quality of spring vegetables were generally good.
The persistent dry conditions during the summer had adversely affected yield and shortened the harvest period for certain summer crops.
Production of sweet corn, bell peppers, summer squash, and pumpkins was significantly lower.
Fall planting was lower than the normal level due to dry soil conditions.
Overall, prices were generally good because of limited supplies.
Vegetable Estimate vegetable estimates These crops include Jersey Agricultural program.
Program Changes: As a result of federal government budget constraints, some of the were dropped from the National Agricultural Statistics Service official estimate program.
asparagus, eggplant, escarole 
The New Statistics Service, however, will keep these estimates through our state estimating Vegetables for Fresh Market: There are 17 fresh market vegetables in the New Jersey Agricultural Statistics Service estimating program.
Area harvested for these fresh market vegetables in 2002 totaled 36,200 acres, compared with 36,900 acres in 2001; down 700 acres.
Production amounted to 5.64 million hundredweight, a decrease of 5 percent from the 5.94 million hundredweight produced in 2001.
Overall yield in 2002 averaged 156 hundredweight per acre, down 5 hundredweight from the previous year.
Season average price was $25.40 per hundredweight compared with $23.50 in 2001, up $1.90 per hundredweight.
Among the fresh market vegetables, only cabbage and cucumbers had higher harvested acres in 2002 than in 2001.
Asparagus, collards, eggplant, escarole 
Despite the decline of acreage and production, the higher season average price was enough to offset the decrease of production.
The value of production increased $4 million to a total of $143 million.
Ranking New Jersey's fresh market vegetables by value of production showed that Jersey Fresh tomatoes were first with $27.3 million, and bell peppers were second with $26.2 million.
Sweet corn, cucumbers, and cabbage, were third, fourth, and fifth with $17.2 million, $11.9 million, and $10.7 million, respectively.
Vegetables for Processing: Harvested acreage in 2002 of the eight major processing vegetables (carrots, cucumbers, lima beans, green peas, snap beans, spinach, sweet corn, and tomatoes) totaled 11,600 acres, compared with 10,500 acres in 2001.
Harvested acres increased for green peas, snap beans, and sweet corn, while acres decreased for carrots, lima beans, spinach, and tomatoes.
Total production, at 73.6 thousand tons, was a 6 percent decrease from 69.7 thousand tons in 2001.
The season average price was $124.30 per ton, compared with $134.90 per ton in 2001; down $10.60.
The 2002 value of production at $9.15 million was down 3 percent from $9.40 million in 2001.
2002 New Jersey Fruit Summary Five major fruit and berry crops grow in the Garden State: apples, blueberries, cranberries, peaches, and strawberries.
During the 2002 growing season, cold spring weather and drought conditions during the summer months significantly reduced the apple and peach production.
There was no weather damage to berry crops despite the minor frost damage to blueberry blooms.
Rainfall during the later part of September was too late to benefit the fruit crops.
Total production of the five fruit and berry crops during 2002 amounted to 185 million pounds, down 18 percent from 2001's production of 226 million pounds.
Value of utilized production of the above crops totaled $89.9 million, a gain of $6.20 million from the 2001 total of $83.7 million.
During 2002 among all major fruit and berry producing states in the nation, New Jersey ranked second in blueberry production; third in cranberry production; fourth in peach production; and seventeenth in apple production.
Crops by value of production within the state resulted in blueberries rated first with $46.8 million.
Peaches ranked second with $25.2 million, while cranberries ranked third with $11.0 million.
Apples and strawberries ranked fourth and fifth with $4.83 million and $2.08 million, respectively.
Early spring frost had significantly damaged apple and peach blossoms.
Only a few orchards located in higher elevations were able to avoid frost damage.
Unfavorable growing conditions adversely affected apple and peach production.
Some orchards abandoned their apple crop completely due to sizing problems.
Peach utilized production totaled 57.0 million pounds, down 13.0 million pounds from 2001.
Apple production dropped 36% to 35.0 million pounds.
Value of utilized production was $4.83 million and $25.2 million for apples and peaches, respectively.
Both values are down from a year ago.
The value of utilized production for the 2002 blueberry and cranberry crop was $46.8 million and $11.0 million, respectively.
The blueberry crop's bloom set was average despite some frost damage.
Blueberry production, a record high, totaled 43.0 million pounds, an increase of 13 percent.
Cranberry harvest was hindered in some areas due to low reservoir levels caused by lack of rainfall.
Cranberry production was 430,000 barrels, down 24 percent from 566,000 barrels produced in 2001.
