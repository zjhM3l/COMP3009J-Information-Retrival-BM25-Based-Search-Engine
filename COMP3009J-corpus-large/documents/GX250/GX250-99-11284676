15.2.5.8 ENTRIES AND NOMINATIONS:
A. ENTERING: No horse shall be qualified to start unless it has been and continues to be entered.
B. PROCEDURE:
(1) Entries and nominations shall be made with the racing secretary and shall not be considered until received by the racing secretary, who shall maintain a record of time of receipt of them for a period of one year.
(2) An entry shall be in the name of the horse's licensed owner and made by the owner, trainer or a licensed designee of the owner or trainer.
Any horse which is in a race or on the also-eligible list may not be sold or transferred until that obligation is completed, except with permission of the stewards.
(3) Numbered races printed in the condition book shall have preference over extra races.
Should any race fail to draw seven (7) separate wagering interests, it may be called off.
(4) An entry must be in writing, by telephone, electronically or facsimile machine to the racing secretary.
The entry must be confirmed in writing should the stewards or the racing secretary so request.
(5) The person making an entry shall clearly designate the horse so entered.
(6) No alteration may be made in any entry after the closing of entries, but an error may be corrected with permission of the stewards.
(7) No horse may be entered in more than one race (with the exception of stakes races) to be run on the same day at the same track on which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted.
If a horse is entered in more than one stakes race to be run on the same day, at the time of draw, the trainer must declare which race the horse will run in.
(8) Any permitted medication must be declared on the original entry at each race meet.
No further declaration will be required at that meet unless there is a change.
(9) Any approved change of equipment must be declared at time of entry.
Any changes after that time must be approved by the stewards.
C. COUPLED ENTRIES:
(1) Two or more horses which are entered in a race shall be joined as a mutuel entry and single betting interest if they are owned or leased in whole or in part by the same owner or are trained by a trainer who owns or leases any interest in any of the other horses in the race.
(2) For trial races, entries will be split by owners, trainers and leased horses consecutively.
If a leased horse draws into the same trial race of a horse that is owned or leased in whole or in part by the same owner, or trainer who owns or leases any other horse in the race, it will be coupled.
(3) No more than two horses having common ties through ownership or training may be entered in any overnight race.
When making a coupled or uncoupled entry in an overnight race, the horse with the better date will be preferred.
If both horses have the same date, the trainer must make a first and second choice.
Under no circumstances may both horses of a coupled, or uncoupled, entry start to the exclusion of a single preferred entry unless the race conditions specifically state otherwise.
No two preferred horses entered by the same trainer or owned by the same owner shall start to the exclusion of a single preferred entry in overnight races.
D. NOMINATIONS:
(1) Any nominator to a stakes race may transfer or declare such nomination prior to closing.
(2) Joint nominations and entries may be made by any one of joint owners of a horse, and each such owner shall be jointly and severally liable for all payments due.
(3) Death of a horse, or a mistake in its entry when such horse is eligible, does not release the nominator or transferee from liability for all stakes fees due.
No fees paid in connection with a nomination to a stakes race that is run shall be refunded except as otherwise stated in the conditions of a stakes race.
(4) Death of a nominator to a stakes race shall not render void any subscription, entry or right of entry.
All rights, privileges and obligations shall be attached to the legal heirs of the decedent or the successor owner of the horse.
(5) When a horse is sold privately or at public auction or claimed, stakes engagements shall be transferred automatically to its new owner; except when the horse is transferred to a person whose license is suspended or who is otherwise unqualified to race or enter the horse, then such nomination shall be void as of the date of such transfer.
(6) All stakes fees paid toward a stakes race shall be allocated as provided by the conditions for the race.
If a stakes race is not run for any reason, all such nomination fees paid shall be refunded.
E. CLOSINGS:
(1) Entries for purse races and nominations to stakes races shall close at the time designated by the association in previously published conditions for such races.
No entry, nomination or declaration shall be accepted after such closing time; except in the event of an emergency or if an overnight race fails to fill, the racing secretary may, with the approval of a steward, extend such closing time.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in the conditions for a stakes race, the deadline for accepting nominations and declarations is midnight of the day of closing, provided they are received in time for compliance with every other condition of the race.
F. NUMBER OF STARTERS IN A RACE: The maximum number of starters in any race shall be limited to the number of starting positions afforded by the association starting gate and its extensions.
The number of starters may be further limited by the number of horses, which, in the opinion of the stewards, can be afforded a safe, fair and equal start.
G. SPLIT OR DIVIDED RACES:
(1) In the event a race is cancelled or declared off, the association may split any overnight race for which postpositions have not been drawn.
(2) Where an overnight race is split, forming two or more separate races, the racing secretary shall give notice of not less than 15 minutes before such races are closed to grant time for making additional entries to such split races.
H. POST POSITIONS: Post positions for all races shall be determined by lot and shall be publicly drawn in the presence of a steward or steward designee.
I.
ALSO-ELIGIBLE LIST:
(1) If the number of entries for a race exceeds the number of horses permitted to start, the racing secretary may create and post an also-eligible list.
(2) If any horse is scratched from a race for which an also-eligible list was created, a replacement horse shall be drawn from the also-eligible list into the race in order of preference.
If none is preferred, a horse shall be drawn into the race from the also-eligible list by public lot.
Horses which gain a position in a race from the also-eligible list take the outside post position in the order drawn from the also-eligible list.
(3) Any owner or trainer of a horse on the also-eligible list who does not wish to start the horse in such race shall so notify the racing secretary prior to scratch time for the race, thereby forfeiting any preference to which the horse may have been entitled in that race.
(4) If a scratch card is deposited for a horse listed as also-eligible, and if that horse is offered an opportunity to run by being drawn at scratch time, the horse shall lose its position on the preferred list.
J. PREFERRED LIST: The racing secretary shall maintain a list of each horse's registration date, entry date, and racing date.
Preference will be given to the best date.
No date will be kept longer than sixty (60) days.
A registration date can only be established when the foal certificate is on file with a racing secretary.
An entry date is any time a horse passes the entry box, whether or not the race is in the condition book, or an extra, is used or eliminated.
When the earliest entry date reaches sixty (60) days and expires, the next best entry date for that horse becomes its preferred date.
Entry dates have preference over race or registration dates of the same date.
Any horse, which is scratched, will lose its date and must re-establish a date.
All horses placed on the steward's, veterinarian's, starter's or identifier's list will be posted on the bulletin board and will lose their dates.
(An exception may be made, when in the opinion of the board of stewards, a horse would be unduly penalized.)

15.2.5.9 DECLARATIONS AND SCRATCHES: Declarations and scratches are irrevocable.
A. DECLARATIONS:
(1) A "declaration" is the act of withdrawing an entered horse from a race prior to the closing of entries.
(2) The declaration of a horse before closing shall be made by the owner, trainer or their licensed designee in the form and manner prescribed in these rules.
B. SCRATCHES:
(1) A "scratch" is the act of withdrawing an entered horse from a contest after the closing of entries.
(2) The scratch of a horse after closing shall be made by the owner, trainer or their licensed designee, with permission from the stewards.
(3) A horse may be scratched from a stakes race for any reason at any time up until 45 minutes prior to post time for that race.
(4) No horse may be scratched from an overnight race without approval of the stewards.
(5) In overnight races, horses that are physically disabled or sick shall be permitted to be scratched first.
Should horses representing more than eight betting interests in the daily double or exotic wagering races, or horses representing more than eight betting interests in any other overnight race, remain in after horses with physical excuses have been scratched, then owners or trainers may be permitted at scratch time to scratch horses without physical excuses down to such respective minimum numbers for such races.
This privilege shall be determined by lot if an excessive number of owners or trainers wish to scratch their horses.
(6) Entry of any horse which has been scratched, or excused from starting by the stewards, because of a physical disability or sickness may not be accepted until the expiration of three (3) entry days after such horse was scratched or excused and the horse has been removed from the veterinarian's list by the racing veterinarian, and then only with the approval of the stewards.

(1) The Start:
(a) The starter is responsible for assuring that each participant receives a fair start.
(b) If, when the starter dispatches the field, any door at the front of the starting gate stalls should not open properly due to a mechanical failure or malfunction or should any action by any starting personnel directly cause a horse to receive an unfair start, the stewards may declare such a horse a non-starter.

(b) The offending horse may be disqualified, if in the opinion of the stewards, the foul altered the finish of the race, regardless of whether the foul was accidental, willful or the result of careless riding.
(c) If the stewards determine the foul was intentional, or due to careless riding, they may fine or suspend the guilty jockey.
(d) In a straightaway race, every horse must maintain position as nearly as possible in the lane in which it starts.

(d) The stewards may determine that a horse shall be unplaced for the purpose of purse distribution and trial qualification.
(e) In determining the extent of disqualification, the stewards in their discretion may: declare null and void a track record set or equalled by a disqualified horse, or any horses coupled with it as an entry; affirm the placing judges' order of finish and suspend or fine a jockey if, in the stewards' opinion, the foul riding did not affect the order of finish; disqualify the offending horse and not penalize a jockey if in the stewards' opinion the interference to another horse in a race was not the result of an intentional foul or careless riding on the part of a jockey.

(b) In the event of such disqualification, all monies wagered on the horse shall be refunded unless the race has been declared official.
(c)
If any jockey weighs in at more than two pounds over the proper or declared weight, the jockey shall be fined or suspended or ruled off by the stewards, having due regard for any excess weight caused by rain or mud.
The case shall be reported to the Commission for such action, as it may deem proper.
(11) Dead Heats (a) When a race results in a dead heat, the dead heat shall not be run off, owners shall divide except where division would conflict with the conditions of the races.
(b) When two horses run a dead heat for first place, all purses or prizes to which first and second horses would have been entitled shall be divided equally between them; and this applies in dividing all purses or prizes whatever the number of horses running a dead heat and whatever places for which the dead heat is run.
