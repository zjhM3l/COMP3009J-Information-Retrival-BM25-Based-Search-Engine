"Good Mate" Video for Boaters Available to Marinas! Promoting stewardship of America's waterways is the focus of this outstanding video, produced by The Ocean Conservancy.
According to The Conservancy, there are more than 10,000 marinas in the United States serving more than 22 million pleasure and work boats.
Small day-to-day changes in the ways boaters maintain and operate boats can make a big difference in protecting aquatic habitats.
The video focuses on four sources of pollution associated with recreational boating , and teaches simple, inexpensive techniques that boaters can follow to prevent water pollution from fuel and oil, sewage, boat maintenance, and debris.
Marina operators familiar with Annapolis will be treated to footage of some very familiar waters.
A simple and easy way to reach customers is playing the video either in the ship's store or other common area during the spring commissioning season.
This reinforces efforts to support clean marinas, and reminds boaters that everyone has a role in protecting the environment.
The video sells for $9.95 plus shipping .

Continued on page 2 "Good Mate" Video Available Page 4 1 Maryland's Two "No Discharge Zones" The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would like to remind boaters and marninas that Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays are no discharge zones (NDZs) for boat sewage.
These two NDZ designations (the first in Maryland) went into effect in 2002 and remain in effect.
It is illegal for a vessel to discharge raw sewage anywhere within three miles of the coast.
An NDZ is an area of water where it is also illegal to discharge sewage treated by a certified Type I or Type II marine sanitation device (MSD).
When operating in an NDZ, Type I and Type II MSDs cannot be used and must be secured.
Acceptable methods to secure these systems include locking the door to the head or disabling the seacock.
Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays were selected because there was very strong local support for the NDZ designations in both areas.
Additionally, both areas have living resources that are sensitive to the discharge of boat waste, both have a high concentration of vessels, and both have sufficient pumpout facilities to accommodate resident and transient boats.
Steuart Chaney, president of Herrington Harbour Marinas, is also a member of the Lower Western Shore Tributary Strategies Team which was instrumental in the implementation of the Herring Bay NDZ.
" The boaters and maritime community of Herring Bay are taking the lead in helping the environment by their support of the NDZ in Herring Bay," he said.
" We believe that this initiative will focus regulatory attention on the other, more significant sources of pollution.
Ultimately, the NDZ will lead to a cleaner environment for all of Herring Bay."
Dave Blazer is the executive director of the Maryland Coastal Bays Program.
Dave points out that an NDZ recommendation was included in the 1999 Comprehensive Management and Conservation Plan for the Maryland Coastal Bays.
"Clean water is the very lifeblood of both Ocean City and Worcester County," he said.
"The no discharge zone designation for the northern Coastal Bays fits perfectly into our plans to address all sources of pollution in this area."
For further information about the Herring Bay and northern Coastal Bays NDZs, visit www.dnr.state.md.us/ boating/pumpout/ndz.html or call DNR at (410) 260-8770.
Additionally, the Natural Resources Police (NRP) Reserve Officers are once again offering Courtesy Vessel Examinations at marinas throughout Maryland.
The Courtesy Vessel Examination program is a great way to provide boaters with safety and environmental information (including marine sanitation) in a very positive and non-threatening manner.

Anne Arundel County Waste Management estimates there are about 40 tons of shrink-wrap used in winter boat storage in the county.
In Cecil county, dumpsters will be placed at Kingfisher Environmental Service Inc., McDaniel Yacht Basin, and Duffy Creek Marina.
In Anne Arundel County, the public works department will place dumpsters at Clark's Landing Marina in Shady Side, Herrington Harbour North in Tracy 's Landing , Pasadena Boatel, Port Annapolis Marina, and Rhode River Marina in Edgewater.
Individuals are encouraged to call ahead to confirm hours of availability.

Two New Clean Marinas and One New Clean Marina Partner! Washburn's Boatyard (Solomons), Sunset Marina (Ocean City), and Anchorage Community Marina (Annapolis) have all recently been certified as clean facilities.
To become a certified Clean Marina or Clean Marina Partner, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management.
Chris Washburn, owner of Washburn's Boatyard, maintains a clean facility by conducting most work, such as engine repair, carpentry, and fiberglass, indoors.
Yard manager Don Reimers says, "Work outside is done using ground covers and/ or dustless sanders.
Anybody who wants to work on their own boat also has to adhere to the same strict yard rules as our own staff.
We work hard to educate all our customers about the importance of keeping trash and debris out of the water."
Washburn's is unique as it is the first boatyard to seek the award independently Don Reimers (left) and Chris Washburn happily accept their Clean Marina award.

Sunset Marina and Anchorage Cmmty.
Marina Although Sunset Marina does not currently have a service department, boat staff were not available at press time.)
owners may use independent contractors to work on their boats at the marina.
Marina manager Brian Tinkler says, "By having all slip holders and contractors work within a set of `environmental rules' we have a lot fewer problems.
Providing recycling for oil and antifreeze also makes it easier for contractors to work within these rules."
Brian also says, "Fuel docks are another big challenge.
We have spill kits in each fueling area and written emergency response plans that all employees are trained on.
I feel we are very well prepared if anything should happen."
At Anchorage Community Marina, all slip holders receive "clean boating tip sheets" on a variety of topics, in mailings throughout the year and clean boating tips are posted at the club house.
And while they do not store any fuel on site, they have prepared written emergency response plans and contracted with an emergency spill response company, in the event of a fuel spill from a boat in or near their marina.
Neighbors on either side of the small facility have a copy of the emergency response plan and all slip holders have the number of the spill response company.
"We are glad to do our part to support this program and to protect the waters surrounding our community," said dock chairman John Boaz.
"We felt this was a very worthy program and came together to participate and improve what we do here."

Enjoy Your Rewards.
Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps.
Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in program displays at boat shows and in the newsletter.
6.
Maintaining Clean Marina Status.
Certified Clean Marinas must annually confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards.
At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will set up a meeting to reaffirm Clean Marina status.
In addition to reviewing the certification process and assistance available, a highlight of this year's workshops was a detailed review of the many regulations and permits that apply to marina and boatyard activities.
On hand was Bob Daniel from the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) which is the agency that issues and enforces the permits and regulations in the state Mr. Daniel works in the Environmental Permits Service Center at MDE, a unit aimed specifically at helping business operators identify, apply for, and operate under necessary permits.
The Environmental Permits Service Center can be reached by calling (410)537-3772 or 800-633-6101, extension 3772.
In spite of the weather, which forced the change of the date of one workshop and the location of another, approximately 100 people attended the workshops, representing 65 marinas and boatyards.
Three marina managers signed a Pledge directly following a workshop and many more received Guidebooks to learn more about the program.
