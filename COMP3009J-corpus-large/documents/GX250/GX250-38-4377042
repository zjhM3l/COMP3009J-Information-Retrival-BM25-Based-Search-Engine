Through its various programs, HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by qualified lenders to people purchasing or refinancing a home of their own.
FHA's mortgage insurance programs help low and moderate income families become homeowners by lowering some of the costs of their mortgage loans.
FHA mortgage insurance also encourages lenders to make loans to otherwise creditworthy borrowers that might not be able to meet conventional underwriting requirements, by protecting the lender against loan default on mortgages for properties that meet certain minimum requirements.
Principal FHA Single Family programs include: Section 203(b) Mortgage Insurance to purchase or refinance a newlyconstructed or existing principal residence Â· Insurance for 97% mortgage financing available (as little as 3% downpayment).
Many closing costs can be financed in the mortgage.
Â· Borrowers pay an up-front insurance premium (which may be financed) at the time of purchase, as well as monthly premiums that are not financed, but instead are added to the regular mortgage payment.
Â· FHA mortgage limits are established by HUD.
Â· Any person able to meet the cash investment, the mortgage payments, and credit requirements can apply.
The program is limited to owneroccupants.
Applications are made through an FHA-approved lending institution.

MORTGAGE TAX CREDIT ORGANIZATION CONTACT MCC ADMINISTRATION CORPORATION PO Box 1568 Norman, Oklahoma 73070 405/364-6565 Mortgage Credit Certificates (Federal Income Tax Credit) The program provides assistance to low to moderate income level families for the purchase of a single family home as their principal residence.
Certain income limitations apply.
A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax due, not just a deduction from gross income.
A holder of a Mortgage Credit Certificate is entitled to a federal income tax credit equaling 25%-50% of the interest paid on the first $40,000 of the holder's home loan during the particular tax year in question.
The Certificate holder is limited by Federal law to a maximum of $2,000 per year federal income tax credit.
For example, if the home owner paid $4,000 of interest on his/her home loan during the applicable tax year, then the home owner would receive federal income tax credit of $1,000 to $2,000 (that is, 25% to 50% of the $4,000) and the home owner would thus pay $1,000 to $2,000 less in taxes than without the Mortgage Credit Certificate.
The amount of tax credit will vary depending on the interest rate on each loan.
In addition to the tax credit, a Mortgage Credit Certificate holder is still able to take the standard mortgage interest deduction.
That deduction is limited, however, to the mortgage interest paid during the year minus the amount of the tax credit for that year.
If a holder's tax liability is less than the amount of the credit for the year, the unused portion of the tax credit may be carried forward and used during any of the next three years.
The Borrower should consult his/her tax advisor or the Taxpayer Assistance Department of the Internal Revenue Service (1-800-829-1040) regarding the actual effect of the tax credit on his/her tax obligations.

Through its various programs, HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by qualified lenders to people purchasing or refinancing a home of their own.
FHA's mortgage insurance programs help low and moderate income families become homeowners by lowering some of the costs of their mortgage loans.
FHA mortgage insurance also encourages lenders to make loans to otherwise creditworthy borrowers that might not be able to meet conventional underwriting requirements, by protecting the lender against loan default on mortgages for properties that meet certain minimum requirements.
Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage on loans to purchase, or refinance and rehabilitate an existing one-to-four unit dwelling Â· Borrower can purchase or refinance a property and finance the cost of rehabilitation with a single loan closing.
Â· Repairs do not have to be completed before closing.
Â· Minimum of $5,000 in eligible repairs is required to qualify for 203(k) loan; additional repairs may be done as long as the total does not exceed the as-repaired appraised value.

Mortgage limits are the same as 203(b).
Â· A current list of 203(k) lenders is available on the Internet at www.hud.gov Â· For housing rehab that does not also require buying or refinancing the property, borrowers may also consider HUD's Title I Home Improvement Loan Program (see below).
Property Improvement Loan Insurance (Title I) insures loans to finance the light or moderate rehabilitation of properties, as well as the construction of nonresidential buildings on the property.
