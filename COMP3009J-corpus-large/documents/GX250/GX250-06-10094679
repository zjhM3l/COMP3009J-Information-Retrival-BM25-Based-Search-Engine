BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on June 14, 2001, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Kathleen G. Colvin, License Number TR-3849 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on March 23, 29, April 14, 28, May 4 and 7, 2001, Licensee, by her servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises.
An administrative hearing was conducted on December 4, 2001, at Two Parkway Center, 875 Greentree Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The Bureau was represented by Richard Parker, Esquire.
Licensee did not appear personally or through legal counsel.
After hearing the testimony presented, and upon review of the evidence submitted, the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are entered:
FINDINGS OF FACT: 1.
The Bureau commenced its investigation of Licensees premises on March 23, 2001, and completed its investigation on May 7, 2001.
(Exhibit C-1) 2.
The Bureau notified Licensee of the nature of the alleged violation(s) disclosed by its investigation by letter dated May 23, 2001, which was sent by certified mail and received by Licensee on May 25, 2001.
(Exhibit C-2) 3.
The citation was issued on June 14, 2001, and was sent by certified mail and received by Licensee on June 16, 2001.
(Exhibits C-3, C-4) 4.
The notice relative to the date, time and place of the evidentiary hearing was mailed to Licensees premises on October 23, 2001 by certified mail as well as first class mail.
5.
The aforementioned certified mailing of the notice of hearing was signed for and received by Licensee on October 25, 2001.

On March 23, 2001 at 10:40 p.m., Liquor Enforcement Officer Jamie M. Pottle entered Licensees premises in an undercover capacity and observed a female bartender heard to be called Gina rendering service of alcoholic beverages to 13 patrons.
Officer Pottle noted that Licensee maintained a New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine and a Cherry Master video slot machine on the premises.
During the course of this visit, Officer Pottle observed a patron heard to be called Angel place $5.00 into the New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine and proceed to play the machine and ultimately accrued 600 credits.
The patron identified as Angel was then observed pressing a button on the machine which caused the machine to dispense a ticket and further cleared the display screen.
Angel presented this ticket to the bartender, later identified as Regina Bartos, who made a notation on a slip of paper maintained in a drawer located to the left of the cash register and provided an undetermined amount of cash to Angel.
Officer Pottle placed an identifying mark on the New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine for purposes of future identification.
(N.T. 7-9) 7.
Officer Pottle made additional undercover visits to Licensees premises on March 29, 2001 at 9:15 p.m., April 14, 2001 at 4:00 p.m., April 28, 2001 at 6:15 p.m., and on May 4, 2001 at 10:10 p.m.
During each of these visits, Officer Pottle noted that Licensee was open for business and maintained the same two video slot machines consisting of the Cherry Master video slot machine and the New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine which contained the identifying mark which she had placed on that machine during her undercover visit of March 23, 2001.
These machines were operational during each visit.
(N.T. 9-13) 8.
On May 7, 2001 at 3:50 p.m., Officer Pottle assisted by a detail of Liquor Enforcement officers executed a Search Warrant and conducted an open inspection focused on the presence of gambling devices in the presence of Floyd Michael Colvin who was tending bar and in charge of the premises.
During the course of this inspection, Liquor Enforcement Officer Alan Sunday examined the New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine as well as the Cherry Master video slot machine and found that each contained video accounting reflecting coins in and coins out and also contained a method of clearing accrued credits which consisted of pressing the print ticket button on the New Fruit Bonus 96 machine and a white button located on the upper left portion of the machine of the Cherry Master machine.
Officer Sunday also determined that no skill was required to play either machine, and that the machine dispensed 20 credits for each dollar inserted into the machines.
As the result of this inspection, both video slot machines were seized along with a total of $1,186.75 found inside the machines.
(N.T. 13-22)
DISCUSSION:
Upon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has clearly established the violation as charged by a preponderance of the evidence.
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Leggens, 542 A.2d 653 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988); Omicron Enterprises, 449 A.2d 857 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1982).
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
1.
The notice provisions as prescribed by Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] have been satisfied.
2.
On March 23, 29, April 14, 28, May 4 and 7, 2001, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises, in violation of Section 5513 of the Crimes Code, which constitutes sufficient cause, as that term is used in Section 471 of the Liquor Code, thereby subjecting Licensee to the penalties provided by that Section.
PENALTY:
Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] prescribes a penalty of license suspension or revocation or a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00 or both for violations of the type found in this case.
Licensee is advised that the possession and operation of electronic poker machines, slot machines, or similar devices used for gambling purposes on its licensed premises constitutes a relatively severe gambling offense warranting more than a minimal penalty.
In mitigation, the record discloses that this citation represents Licensees first violation.
For the foregoing reasons, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount of $800.00.
ORDER:
THEREFORE, it is hereby ordered that Kathleen G. Colvin, License Number TR-3849, pay a fine of $800.00 within 20 days of the mailing date of this Order.
In the event the aforementioned fine is not paid within 20 days from the mailing date of this Order, Licensees license shall be suspended or revoked.
