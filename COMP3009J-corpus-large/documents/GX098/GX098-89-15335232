* Nutshell Summary of EPA's National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities - This is a summary that briefly discusses EPA's analysis of data from its National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities.
EPA conducted a the survey to answer five specific questions: (1) How many facilities are regulated by EPA's SPCC program; (2) What types of facilities does the SPCC Program regulate; (3) What do these facilities look like; (4) Which facilities pose the greatest oil spill risk; and (5) How effective is the SPCC Program in reducing oil spill risk? * Survey Questionnaire Parts A and B - A copy of the 1995 survey sent out to collect information from oil storage facilities.
* Analysis of the Number of Facilities Regulated by the SPCC Program - This analysis provides a national estimate of the number of facilities potentially regulated by EPA's SPCC Program.
To develop this estimate, EPA used the results from EPA's 1995 National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities.
Nation-wide estimates were developed using standard statistical techniques and comparison of the results to previous government and industry studies in order to calculate a 1996 Adjusted National Estimate.
* Analysis of the Relationship Between Facility Characteristics and Oil Spill Risk - This analysis investigates whether relationships exist between the characteristics of oil storage facilities and spill incidents.
The results of the analysis indicate that facilities with larger storage capacity are likely to have a greater number of oil spills, larger volumes of oil spilled, and greater cleanup costs.
Similar increases were found at facilities with more tanks and greater annual throughput.
* Analysis of the Effectiveness of EPA's SPCC Program on Spill Risk - This analysis examines the extent to which compliance with EPA's SPCC Program influences a facility's risk to the environment.
This analysis is based on the results of EPA's 1995 National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities, which provided information on facility and tank characteristics, spill incidents, and facility operations, and investigates whether a facility's overall compliance with the SPCC program, as well as its specific individual regulatory provisions, has an impact on certain measures of oil spill risk.
* Analysis of Trends in the Replacement of Underground Storage Tanks at SPCC-Regulated Facilities - This analysis examines SPCC-regulated facilities to identify trends in the replacement of underground storage tanks (USTs).
The analysis provides estimates of the number of SPCC-regulated facilities storing oil in USTs for the past two years, and the number of USTs that have been replaced by either aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or with other USTs.
* Analysis of the Applicability of EPA's SPCC Program to the Electric Utility Industry - This analysis of the electric utility industry examines the degree to which the SPCC program applies to electrical substations and transformer installations.
EPA's analysis provides estimates of the number of electric utility facilities that have one or more substations or transformer installations storing oil in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the SPCC program.
* SPCC Survey (National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities) Results: Industry Comparison Tables - This document contains the Industry Comparison tables from the SPCC survey.
The tables compare industries in seven categories; tank characteristics, tank spill prevention characteristics, piping characteristics, annual spill characteristics, spill response characteristics, facility oil storage and transport characteristics, and other facility characteristics.
* Question by Question Analysis - These graphs display the results from Part B of the National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities.
The graphs cover all of the facility information pertaining to the handling and storage of oil onsite.
* SPCC Survey (National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities) Final Response Rate Chart - A table detailing the final response rate statistics from the 1995 National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities.
* Results of the Survey (National Survey of Oil Storage Facilities) Non-Response Validation Exercise - Follow-up interviews with survey non-respondents were conducted to identify whether a potential bias in the survey response rate exists.
The effort involved contacting a sample of survey non-respondents for those industries that exhibited relatively low response rates, and asking questions about the facility's oil storage operations.
* Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Regulation (40 CFR 112) A Facility Owner/Operators Guide to Oil Pollution Prevention - The Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) regulation brochure is a guide for facility owners or operators to oil pollution prevention.
This regulation that became effective in January 10, 1974, may be found at Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 112 (40 CFR 112).
The prevention rule was revised on July 17 2002.
Facilities subject to the rule must prepare and implement a plan to prevent any discharge of oil into or upon navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines.
The plan is called a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.
* Facility Response Planning Compliance Assistance Guide - This guide is part of a series of compliance assistance guides that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed in order to help owners and operators of facilities that store or use oil, as well as other interested people, to better understand the Federal Oil Pollution Prevention regulation (40 CFR part 112).
If you own or operate a facility that stores or uses oil, these guides will help you to determine whether the regulation applies to you.
They also provide descriptions of some of the basic requirements you will be expected to meet if the regulation does apply to your facility.
* Use of Alternative Secondary Containment Measures at Facilities Regulated under the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation (40 CFR Part 112) - This memorandum from the Assistant Administrator of the EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response addresses the EPA's interpretation of the term "secondary containment" as it is used in section 112.7(c) of the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation (40 CFR Part 112), also known as the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) regulation.
It also addresses bulk storage containment in section 112.8(c)(2).

Y2K
* Y2K Issues in the EPA Oil Program - The Year 2000 problem (Y2K) has been identified as a potential glitch in existing computer databases, software applications, and hardware chips that could cause the disruption of, or completely stop computer operations.
This fact sheet discusses how the Y2K problem could affect the Oil Program, EPA's requirements for Y2K compliance, and what the Oil Program is currently doing about Y2K.
__________________________________________________________________
Bioremediation
* NRT Fact Sheet: Bioremediation in Oil Spill Response - The purpose of this fact sheet is to provide on scene coordinators and other decision-makers with the latest information on evolving technologies that may be applicable for use in responding to an oil spill.
Bioremediation is one technique that may be useful to remove spilled oil under certain geographic and climatic conditions.
For the purpose of this effort, bioremediation is defined to include the use of nutrients to enhance the activity of indigenous organisms and/or the addition of naturally-occurring non-indigenous microorganisms.
* Guidelines for the Bioremediation of Marine Shorelines and Freshwater Wetlands - The objective of this document is to present a detailed technical guidance document for use by spill responders for the bioremediation of marine shorelines and freshwater wetlands contaminated with oil and oil products.
Technical personnel who are responsible for designing and operating field bioremediation processes as well as consultants and equipment manufacturers will also find it useful.
The scope of the document is limited to marine shorelines and freshwater wetlands because of definitive results from recently completed, EPA-sponsored field studies.
