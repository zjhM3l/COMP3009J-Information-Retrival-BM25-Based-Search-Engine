Title: Lesson 3 -- Michigan Migrations (SS040203)
Abstract In this lesson, students examine five different cultural groups that have migrated to Michigan over time.
They analyze both push and pull factors resulting in the migration or immigration of these cultural groups to Michigan and draw conclusions from their analyses.
The lesson concludes with each student creating a biographical journal entry from the perspective of one of the cultural groups studied.

Sequence of Activities Students have developed a basic grasp of the chronology of some events in Michigan history through the creation of a class timeline and an investigation of Michigan history makers.
Students also have some prior experience reading and creating graphs, timelines, and flowcharts.
1.
The teacher begins the lesson by asking students if any of them has ever lived in a different place.
The teacher asks students to share some reasons why they moved or why other people they know have moved.
The teacher records the answers on the chalkboard or chart paper.
The teacher then describes and distinguishes "push factors" (reasons causing someone to want to leave) and "pull factors" (reasons causing someone to want to come to a specific location) using students' responses.
2.
The teacher divides the class into five groups.
Working in their small groups, students use the chart below and suggest answers to the questions in each column for each cultural group.
When did they arrive? Why did they come? Where did they settle? What problems did they encounter in moving/relocating? What contributions have they made? Africans/African Americans Arab/Chaldeans Asians/Hmong Eastern Europeans Western Europeans Hispanics 3.
The teacher assigns each group a reading on one of five cultural groups.
Students can read the information from a textbook, literature book, or Internet resources.
Once they finish reading, students work together to confirm or reject their original answers to the questions in the chart about their assigned cultural group.
They should revise their answers if the resources present conflicting or more detailed information.
4.
Students share the results of their investigations with the class.
During the presentations, students work individually to record the presented information on a chart (see step 2 for a sample).
The teacher also records the information using a large classroom wall chart similar to Step 2.
5.
The teacher then focuses students' attention on the reasons why people came to Michigan and asks students to categorize whether the reasons listed are "push factors" or "pull factors."
6.
After the presentations, students work in pairs to compare and contrast their earlier answers regarding the migration of people with the information learned through the small group presentations.
Working in pairs, students also graph the immigration of cultural groups to Michigan using census data from the 1800s.
Students share the census data with the case using overhead transparencies.
As students share their graphs with the class, the teacher leads a class discussion on the patterns of migration/immigration and analyze them in terms of the push and pull factors discussed earlier.
7.
Using the information learned in class, students create biographical or group migration journal entries from the perspective of a cultural group other than their own.
The entries should reflect the political, social, and economic push and pull factors, and highlight the personal and group expectations that people had for the future.
8.
Students peer review each other's journal entries.
As they read the journals, student reviewers should look for unclear statements and questions that should be answered.
The teacher reviews the final drafts.
Students then prepare their final product to be displayed in the school library.
Assessment The teacher may choose to assess the group presentations at the beginning of the lesson.
The presentation should address the time frame in which the cultural group moved to Michigan, why they came, where they settled, problems they faced, and contributions they made.
Specific references to the political, economic, and cultural conditions of their area of origin indicate the students' use of historical evidence.
Students' graph work and contributions to the class discussion may also be assessed.
The teacher may choose to assess students' journal entries that are prepared for display.
As an alternative, the teacher could construct a more formal assessment by posing a public issue such as "Should the United States government restrict immigration from other countries?" Students should take a position, support it with information learned in the lesson and core democratic values.
Application Beyond School Design a recreation center or meeting facility that meets the needs of a particular ethnic group.
Plan its location and predict locations of future facilities.
Examine migration and immigration trends and patterns in different regions of the United States.
Connections English Language Arts Students write biographical journal entries of migrants/immigrants to Michigan based on information learned in class and through resources.
Mathematics Students graph the populations of each cultural group reported on in five counties in Michigan, as well as the number of people immigrating to the United States and Michigan over several years.
