The Green Party is a new party that has arisen in response to the need for a new political vision free of the failed ideologies of both the right and the left.
The Green Party promotes an ecological vision which understands that all life on our planet is interconnected; that cooperation is more essential to our well-being than competition; and that all people are connected to and dependent upon one another and upon the natural systems of our world.
Politics must come to reflect this understanding, and political structures and processes must be based upon it if humanity is to continue to develop and prosper.
The Green Party was founded upon ten key values: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Social Justice, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Feminism, Respect for Diversity, Personal and Global Responsibility and Sustainable Future Focus.
