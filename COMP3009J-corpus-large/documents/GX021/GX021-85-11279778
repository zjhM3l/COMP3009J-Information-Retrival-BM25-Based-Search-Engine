For example, because these units use naturally heated geothermal steam as their energy source, the plant does not require the use of a fuel (e.g., natural gas) for steam generation, as do PG
The Geysers plant, therefore, does not have emissions from boilers (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and carbon monoxide) that occur as a byproduct of combustion at the fossil-fueled plants.
(4) Instead, the air emissions from the Geysers plant are principally due to naturally occurring constituents of the geothermal steam released to the air during condensation of the steam after it passes through the turbine.
One significant constituent is hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S), and all the units are equipped with hydrogen sulfide abatement systems.
The geothermal steam contains small amounts of "non-condensable gases."
These gases are removed from the condenser and transferred to a H[2]S abatement system.
The various H[2]S abatement systems at the Geysers plant are described below.
After converting the H[2]S component to other sulfur species, the non-condensable gases are routed into the cooling tower and exit to the atmosphere.

Hydrogen Sulfide Abatement Systems
Several different systems are used to remove most of the non-condensable H[2]S at the Geysers Plant.
These systems are:
Incinerator : This system burns H[2]S to form sulfur dioxide, which is then scrubbed in a quench tower and dissolved into the quench water.
The quench water is transferred to the cooling tower basin.
Caustic: Sodium hydroxide, which absorbs H[2]S, is added to the cooling water at the inlet of the condenser.
Stretford : This system chemically oxidizes the H[2]S to elemental sulfur.
Metal Chelate : An iron chelate solution and air are added to the circulating water.
The solution, oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide react to produce elemental sulfur, which is suspended in the circulating water.

The H[2]S abatement systems employed at the various units are given in [Table E-4]

Footnotes:
4.
The Geysers plant does have relatively minor emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and carbon monoxide that result primarily from the use of a burner/scrubber system for the abatement of hydrogen sulfide. (back) 5.
Some of the chelate solution comes from PG
EDTA combines with iron to form a metal chelate. (back)
