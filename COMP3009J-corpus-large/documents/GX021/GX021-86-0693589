This project emphasizes production and evaluation of new interspecific hybrids for transferring desirable traits from wild Helianthus species to cultivated lines, developing germplasm pools having wild Helianthus genes in domestic background, and evaluating sunflower evolution and interspecific relationships.
New sources of cytoplasmic male sterility are identified from among wild Helianthus species, interspecific hybrid progenies and the use of mutagens, and corresponding fertility restoration systems will be established.
Trisomic genetic stocks are being developed and will be used in studies of gene linkage and genetic mapping.
Molecular characterization and gene mapping for major sunflower morphological traits, disease resistance, cytoplasmic male sterility and fertility restoration, and QTLs are also investigated.
