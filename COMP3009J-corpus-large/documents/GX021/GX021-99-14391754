The process depends on a horizontal subsurface flow through the common reed rhizosphere.
The most important functions of macrophytes in the reeds beds are to supply oxygen to the aerobic microorganisms in the rhizosphere and to increase/stabilize the hydraulic permeability of the soil.

Therefore, NAL is viewed as a library of last resort.
SUBMIT REQUESTS FIRST TO LOCAL OR STATE LIBRARY SOURCES PRIOR TO SENDING TO NAL.
In the United States, possible sources are public libraries, land-grant university or other large research libraries within a state.
In other countries submit requests through major university, national, or provincial institutions.
If the needed publications are not available from these sources, submit requests to NAL with a statement indicating their non-availability.
Submit one request per page following the instructions for libraries below.
