September 21, 1998 Mr. Bruce Kaneshiro, Project Manager c/o Environmental Science Associates 225 Bush St., Suite 1700 San Francisco, CA 94104 Re: Draft Environmental Impact Report comments, CPUC Application #98-01-008 Geysers Geothermal Power Plant 
Dear Mr. Kaneshiro:
District staff has reviewed the referenced document sections related to the air quality issues involved in the pending sale of the PG
The District asks that major concerns identified below and the specific comments provided in Attachment #1 be addressed in the final EIR.
The background information provided regarding the pending sale and the potential new owners is informative, as are the discussions regarding the various projections for continued operations under the various scenarios, but we do consider them incomplete.
We are concerned about conceptual errors and the avoidance of identifying any suggestion of mitigation for the scenarios chosen in the DEIR.
Major Concerns [Begin H1]
Our major concern continues to be the possibility of plant management under a new owner incompatible with maintaining the integrity of the steamfields.
The document should emphasize repeatedly that adverse air quality impacts in Lake County are largely a result of the operations of the applicants power plants, and when the plants are not operating, the associated steamfields located in Sonoma and Lake counties.
[End H1] [Begin H2]
There are a number of reasons for our concerns in this regard for the Sonoma County units including less advanced technical designs, aged equipment, differing operating conditions and poorer steam quality among others.
[End H2] [Begin H3]
The issue of avoiding steam stacking is extensively noted, however we need to emphasize any condition which results in the atmospheric release of untreated steam is at issue and the cumulative impact of well field bleed flows at well pad locations is of equal or greater concern due to the closer proximity to residents, because of poor plume rise and reduced pollutant dispersion.
Additionally, when steamfields are extensively curtailed, well maintenance including the need for deep drilling rig utilization and increased numbers of well blow downs to remove water or rock bridges all contribute to increased emissions.
[End H3] [Begin H4]
The "must run" contracts have been offered as a reason that hydro or other curtailments should not be a significant concern.
Yet, must run class "B" may be needed only a few hours per year (Pg. C-ii).
This needs to be clarified as to how effective it is and what to expect in the future as regards to the minimum power generation available to the steamfield owners.
Apparently, except for Units 5-8, it is just a peak temperature requirement and is unlikely to be relevant to hydro curtailment.
Please clarify and explain.
[End H4] [Begin H5]
The situation as presented in the DEIR included a reference to a less than 2.2Â¢/KW power cost and periods of zero price during the present year.
Please explain how this will similarly affect the Geysers need for a minimum production to avoid steam venting.
If that can not be ensured in the future, consider the below scenario and suggested mitigation for inclusion in the EIR.
[End H5] [Begin H6]
Were AB 1890 funds used to stabilize the price, and if so at what level? Was the price driven down because of abnormally high availability of hydro power? What is considered an economic price? If you conclude as indicated at the 9/15/98 meeting that this is unlikely because of the price of power and the production cost, state and support your assumptions clearly in the EIR. AB1890 apparently provides limited funding to stabilize pricing during the transition years.
Will this funding be available to the new owners, or once they are sold will they be considered merchant plants? How significant is the loss of resources of PG
[End H6]
Given the above discussion, please consider the following scenario and suggested mitigation for comment.
Scenario #1 [Begin H7]
Identified Potential Impact: The market economy is such that generation units are prevented from selling the power to the PX and no direct customer delivery is possible.
The plant owners shut down all the plants to zero production.
The units then must stack, by-pass and/or close in the steamfield with resulting water logging of wells, thermal stress and production well failure.
The impact on air quality, water quality and the land is significant from the vented steam and emissions associated with repair (none of the emissions are necessarily stacking).
The steamfields become less profitable and threaten the overall viability of electrical power generation and a loss of this green power resource.
Suggested Mitigation: Ensure that a minimum production is allowed and deliverable from each of the two facilities (Lake 
Methods to accomplish this could include: 1) a reserve of approximately 50 and 110 Megawatts at the ISO being set aside specifically for the Lake and Sonoma Geysers plants respectively that would be under a must run continuous agreement; 2) requiring the purchaser (and future purchasers) to operate the facility using a continuous direct purchase customer for at least the sustaining portion of the production; 3) committing the smaller negotiated quantity of generation as a RMRA "A" to include hydro-curtailments; or 4) utilize a distribution benefit charge through the PX/ISO that will support and make viable this minimum production capacity for this specific existing (stranded) green power and ensure that it is bid into the PX (with a general benefit subsidy, if necessary, much like the AB 1890 is now providing).
[End H7] [Begin H8]
We are in agreement that Alternative 3 (sale to steam suppliers) is likely the environmentally best alternative, provided they have the financial strength to maintain the facilities and this green power remains cost competitive.
The District is not in agreement with the conclusions in Table S.2 regarding the air impacts being less than significant, as that assumes an approximate 10% change on an annual basis.
This does not consider the significant impact of a single or several individual events.
There is no mitigation to assure that the plants will be operated at a level at all times sensitive to preserving air quality.
[End H8] [Begin H9]
The modeling analysis for the geothermal units predicts emissions variability of between -13% and + 39%, depending on the analysis scenario, with the Sonoma County units accounting for the majority of the increase.
Many of these units are approaching their design life span and have higher air emissions potentials due to their date of construction, less advanced technical design, increased maintenance requirements and poorer steam quality.
As the emissions from these units predominantly impact the Lake County public, and have been the source of significant air quality complaints and AAQS exceeds in the past, a 40% increase in emissions is considered by the District as significant and thus we would require mitigation.
In reality such is not likely to happen unless a choice to change the abatement systems operational techniques is implemented by a new owner, as the abatement systems (especially of newer plants) perform superior to present permit emission limitations.
(See Exhibit A attached that lists the permitted and actual emissions as tested recently for units being divested.)
Again, this is a case of performance superior to what is required under regulations, especially for the newer units.
Similarly the use of mercury scrubbers (while under permit) are not regulatorily required, since cooperation was high and a variety of incentives existed.
[End H9] [Begin H10]
The Geysers Air Monitoring Program (GAMP) represents a consortium, and while the regulatory alternative exists, participation is voluntarily renewed by MOU.
Present PG

[End H10]
Given the above discussion please consider the following scenario and suggested mitigation for comment.
Scenario #2 [Begin H11]
Identified Potential Impact: The new owner takes only the steps that are specifically required by permit as an economy measure and decides not to participate in efforts jointly or separately.
These efforts include seismic monitoring, air monitoring, the use of an iron chelate catalyst in secondary abatement and the use of mercury scrubbers on the Stretford equipped units.
This results in less information on which to document environmental management success, less public trust, greater emission releases and less efficient management approaches to the overall resource area.
[End H11] [Begin H12]
Suggested Mitigation: Ensure that the new owner participates in GAMP, the seismic monitoring program continues, they continue to use Hg scrubbers and use innovative H2S technologies presently installed.
[End H12] [Begin H13]
The DEIR is long on discussion but slightly off target as to the interaction of the power plant and steamfield operations.
The policy implications of green power also need to be further enlarged upon as part of this first significant green power divestiture decision by the CPUC.
The document provides little in finding significance in the divestiture of the subject plant and thus avoids having to recommend mitigation measures.
The major issue for the AQMD is not just steam stacking but managing (production assurances) in a manner that ensures the physical integrity of the steamfields without stacking, field wide emission or threatening the long term integrity of field operations and production.
We do not believe that we are being overly cautious in attempting to be protective of our air resources and requesting assurances that the Geysers steam resource is adequately protected from misuse and abuse, be it intentional, market driven or unwitting.
The remarks regarding the economic incentive to defer maintenance and utilize plant malfunctions to increase the rate basis is disturbing, and is counterproductive to both resource management and air quality.
The knowledge regarding the wise management of the Geysers resources and compatibility with good environmental management has been an acquired learning experience gained over a period of more than 30 years.
It is imperative that this knowledge and understanding be retained and that we wisely proceed and assure that this goal is nurtured to the extent possible.
[End H13] [Begin H14]
We are concerned that this first sale of green power by a monopoly utility is occurring without an assessment of policy or the implications of a lack of policy and we ask that such be incorporated into the EIR as a relevant and necessary part of the scope required.
We will not repeat past comments of the uniqueness and environmental advantages of the Geysers and green power in general, as we have all been educated by the past events and prior or existing state policies.
[End H14] [Begin H15]
In discussions before the Lake County Board and elsewhere, two responses have always come forward from CPUC/ESA staff: 1) that there is a willingness for consumers to pay more for green power, and 2) that the federal legislation gives the Geysers a 1.5-cent/KW advantage.
While we hope this is correct, we want such to be clearly and correctly evaluated as part of the EIR.
[End H15] [Begin H16]
Renewables (green power) are apparently 11% of the present PG
Is the present niche market for green power that large? Is it likely, given that the label "green power" need only to include 50% green power, that this niche market can adsorb 10-22% of the existing total market? Will the niche market be sustainable in times of a depressed economy? What specifically are the state policies that are in place which recognize the advantages of indigenous green power to our state and country? Please summarize the hidden environmental, national defense, green house gas, economic, and other costs of nuclear and fossil fuel and the advantages to society of nurturing and promoting "green power"? Please at least summarize a response in the final EIR.
[End H16] [Begin H17]
Please consider in your discussion the timing and status of the CPUC green power certifying/ labeling and emissions disclosure on customer billing; the possibility of an ISO distribution benefit charge to enhance green power sustainability; reduced charges on the PX exchange; preferential financing; lessening the PX buy in cost; and other suggestions as are contained in the National Association of State Energy Officials "Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sources: A Primer" dated July 1998.
These issues in are relevant to our society and should be relevant to the CPUC decision to approve the sale with or without mitigation.

Attachment #1
Specific Items of Comment [Begin H18]
In Tables S.1, S.3, S.5 (and elsewhere) and Table 2.1 (Description of Facilities) there appears to be a significant difference between the projected scenario annual capacity factors for the Lake County units shown which should be elaborated upon.
The DEIR states that the Analytical Maximum Scenario is the "conservative" approach and in the case of the Geysers represents a minimum operating level (worst case).
While we understand what this is attempting to convey, it is somewhat confusing and represents approximately a 10% reduction in capacity over the no project alternative.
The DEIR is vague on the factors which result in this being the "worst case" and does not recommend if this is the minimum level of operation necessary to preserve the existing air quality (Section 3.6.2 end of paragraph 2) or that this will be a regulatory limit imposed on the buyer.
This is where the "must run" contract requirements need to be specific enough to ensure that adverse air quality impacts are minimized, or it acknowledged that they are of little relevance.

More correctly, the steam contains hydrogen sulfide and other reduced sulfur compounds which exist in both a dissolved and gas phase.
A portion of the hydrogen sulfide remains dissolved in the liquid condensate and is subsequently chemically treated to maintain solubility and prevent "air stripping" in the cooling tower.
The non-condensible gas is treated to convert the H2S to elemental sulfur or SO2 using a Stretford or Incinerator system respectively.
The elemental sulfur is more commonly produced as a "sulfur cake or slurry" product more so than a molten material (both are elemental sulfur); the SO2 is removed using a scrubber system and the resulting solution re-injected.
The description in Table 2.2 contains a better description of the process.

Geothermal air pollutants are not generally emitted from steam wells, steam transmission lines and steam stacking facilities under normal operations.
Steam is emitted during well construction, testing and maintenance operations.
Most of the geothermal emissions are from the cooling towers and gas treatment facilities.
While well bleeds and well maintenance is currently the largest "steam field" emission source, steam field emissions are relatively insignificant when the power plant is operating.
[End H34] [Begin H35]

Paragraph (2): Steam Stacking is more properly a result of the power plants inability to utilize the available steam rather than a slowdown in use of the steam wells.

Paragraph (3): Of greater concern now is a condition where a power plant is not operated (for mechanical or perhaps economic considerations) and the steam wells have to be shut-in to a sustaining steam bleed rate consistent with maintaining well integrity for extended periods of time.
The cumulative impact of such action has a greater impact potential due to the large number of wells involved, their location closer to residents and the lower air dispersion characteristics of the bleed flows as compared to the massive stacking flow rates.

Are the Baseline and Analytical Maximum emissions estimates in these tables different than those presented in the Executive Summary and Section 3 where analytical maximum was a minimum capacity factor? Are the emissions factors utilized based on test data or permit limits? If permit limits are the basis, emissions would not be expected to change, if operating data is utilized, do the estimates consider that the new owner will continue to control emissions to less than (at times considerably below) the permit limits? The difference between actual and permitted emissions can be significant.
For Lake County Unit #16, actual emissions are approximately 3.5 times lower than allowed by the permit for H2S and 16.5 times lower for particulate matter.
The EIR should address whether or not the new owner will operate the plants similarly.
If realized, the projected 40% increase in emissions from the Sonoma County units would appear to be capable of a significant impact.
Of greater concern to the LCAQMD is an increase in "uncontrolled" emissions due to economics, reliability or maintenance factors.

Cumulative steady state "controlled" emissions are capable of, and have been the source of both nuisance complaint generation and AAQS exceeds.
These events are typically associated with episodes of regional air stagnation and a "flushing" of built up pollutant concentrations from West Geysers area into Lake County during the early afternoon wind flow reversal from a westerly direction.

Page 25 describes the probable certainty of a single plant operator shutting down operations during periods of abundant hydro power, low energy demands and low pricing.
This discussion appears to address combustion units and not geothermal, however a complete shut down of the geothermal plant may have unacceptable consequences to the steam field and air quality.
A alternate scenario of hydro curtailment is a low load cycling operation which increases stress on components and has higher associated maintenance costs and potential air quality impacts due to breakdown emissions.
Power plant cycling from a shut down situation is a less efficient use of the resource and has a much higher excess emissions potential due to equipment failures (unit trips) during plant start up operations.
This type of operation should be discouraged and regulated to the extent feasible.
This should be discussed and mitigation proposed.

This discussion outlines the negative impact on maintenance and spares availability due to price structuring of deregulation.
Deferred maintenance and equipment failure is represented as having an increased profit incentive to the portfolio holder of a number of various types of power plant facilities.
Equipment failures, start ups and shut downs all typically have associated excess air emissions.
For geothermal plants, the emissions can be significant and unscheduled outages also can have severe consequences on the steam suppliers equipment and the geothermal reservoir.
These should be discussed with mitigation recommendations.

Page C-33, Section 3.2.4 Geothermal Steam Supply Contracts.
The steam supply contracts have historically impacted air emissions due to a variety of reasons.
Where contracts were tied to electrical production there was little incentive for the efficient utilization of steam resources, often to the detriment of air quality where there is no other purchaser available for the steam and the steam flow cannot be fully curtailed because of the potential for well damage.
It would appear to be in the best public interest to manage the steam resource for the most efficient utilization of this unique, environmentally superior commodity.

Page C-34, Section 3.3 The Influence of Must-Run Status on Operations.
In order to minimize air emissions associated with cycling, excessive startups or shutdowns and consequent impacts on the steam fields causing well bleeds and/or maintenance related breakdowns, the Geysers Power Plants should be required to maintain a minimum sustaining level of availability and operation.
This may be accomplished under a specific must run agreement or other similar regulatory requirement crafted to address these issues.
We believe that this type of agreement or approach should be included in the mitigation required for this project.
The issue would not be startup costs as much as the cost to the steam supplier and environment of having to shut down.
This is missed and needs to be assessed.

Page D-5, NOP, Environmental Effects.
(Bottom of page, paraphrased) The sale of the Geysers Plant could have an effect on the environment, which might be significant, if the sale causes changes such as: the amount or pattern of generation; maintenance practices; etc. (among others).
The DEIR concludes that the pattern of generation and maintenance practices may change.
The analysis included scenarios which considered a operating capacity range of -9% to +16% from the a 1999 baseline.
The air emissions evaluation described more variation with up to a 40% increase, however the analysis did not include emissions from the steam wells or steam field maintenance associated with changes in plant operations.
The cumulative impact is believed significant, given that a malfunction at a single plant is capable of causing an exceed of the AAQS and although none is offered, mitigation should be required.

Page G-5, Footnote 10.
The model heat rate utilized 10,000 Btu/kWh instead of the more technically correct 22,000 Btu/kWh.
The footnote stated that this did not affect the total potential generation nor economic dispatch position of individual plants.
The reference is in the context of emissions and we fail to understand how a factor of 2.2 is essentially the same value unless the notations in the footnote are incorrect.

Tables G-1 through G-17; Apparent program or program input error for geothermal units.
Power plants #13 and #16 are shown with identical capacities, similar generation and capacity factors and share a similar steam resource yet the H2S emissions of Unit #13 is approximately a factor of (6) higher.
The H2S values reported in Table G-1 are 28 tons per year and 5 tons per year for Units #13 and #16 respectively.
H2S emissions are limited by permit at Unit #13 to 9.47 lb/hr and at Unit #16 to 5 lb/hr.
Actual emissions as tested at either unit are similar and typically less than 2 lb/hr (approx.
1.5 - 4 tons per year for each unit), see Exhibit A.
The Title V applications (referenced as the source of input data) cite annual emissions at Unit #13 as 14.4 tpy and Unit #16 at 6.2 tpy (total 20.6 tpy).
Table 4.5-27 lists 38 tpy for existing and 33 tpy as the 1999 baseline (Table G-1 total for both units is listed as 31 tpy).
We also note that the ROG emissions factor (0.01#/Mwh) is the same for all units, however the NC gas concentration (source of ROG) is highly variable on a unit by unit basis.
The Appendix G Tables are unclear as to the basis for the underlying emission factors and should be clearly identified.
