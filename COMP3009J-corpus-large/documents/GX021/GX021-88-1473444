Dr. Laurence D. Charlet, Research Entomologist (Adjunct Professor, Dept. of Entomology, NDSU) charletl@fargo.ars.usda.gov; (701) 239-1313
Research directed to reduce crop losses and input costs for the sunflower producer by developing integrated management systems for the sunflower stem weevil, Cylindrocopturus adspersus, the sunflower beetle, Zygogramma exclamationis, the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes, the sunflower midge, Contarinia schulzi, and the red sunflower seed weevil, Smicronyx fulvus.
Investigations are conducted to develop an understanding of the biology, population dynamics, and plant-insect interactions of the pest species.
The efficacy of different management strategies are determined including cultural and biological control and plant resistance.
Studies are also conducted to identify the natural enemies of the sunflower pests and elucidate their biology and impact as mortality factors.
