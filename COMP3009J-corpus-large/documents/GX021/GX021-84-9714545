Research focuses on the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants.
Specific research includes the characterization of pathways by which oxygenated fatty acids are formed by lipoxygenase action, and then subsequently transformed enzymatically into other metabolites.
The physiological role of oxygenated fatty acids in plant metabolism is investigated.
Conducts experiments to alter the fatty acid composition of oilseeds.
Studies insect-plant interactions.
