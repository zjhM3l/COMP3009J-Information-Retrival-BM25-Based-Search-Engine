What's Up newsletter banner graphic issue 02-11 November, 2002 In the Spotlight graphic Sr. Assistant Compliance Officer sees new position as a learning opportunity Jeff Nagle photo
While he wasn't necessarily looking for a career change, the challenge of a new position has been enthusiastically accepted by HCA's Senior Assistant Compliance Officer, Jeff Nagel, Ph.D., who has been with the Agency for a dozen years.
Jeff started with HCA in 1990 after earning his Doctoral Degree in Clinical Child/School Psychology.
His first assignment was at the Clinical Evaluation and Guidance Unit (CEGU), where he worked with clients from Orangewood Children's Home and Juvenile Hall.
Following the devastating 1993 Laguna Beach fire, he moved to the Behavioral Health Children and Youth Services clinic in that community to provide counseling to children whose homes and lives had been affected by the fire.
"I was stationed at a Junior High school where the fire had burned right up to the property.
It was the same Junior High that I had attended years before," remembered Jeff.
His other assignments with HCA have included work in hospital case management, as a member of the Quality Review and Training Department and as an administrative Service Chief.
That position allowed him to interact with contract providers and agencies, community collaboratives and outside organizations.
His diverse background working with children and youth helped to prepare him to serve as Children's System of Care Program Manager, the position he held immediately before moving to the Office of Compliance.
His recent move was an unexpected career turn for Jeff.
"I don't think I was really thinking of Compliance when the opportunity became available," stated Jeff.
He was selected for the

And the winner is IRIS
Maybe it was the chance to put a personal touch on a major Agency project.
Maybe it was the creativity of HCA staff members finding a once-in-a-lifetime outlet.
Or maybe it was the gift certificates offered as prizes.
Whatever it was, HCA employees took to heart the opportunity to participate in the "Name the System" contest staged to provide HCA's own unique name for the Enterprise Management System (Cerner).
A total of 167 entries were submitted in the contest, representing almost all of HCA's service areas.
Both the number of entries and the tremendous depth of creativity provided quite a challenge for the contest's judges, who debated the merits of their favorites during a closed-door session.
When all was said and done, the judges selected their top three favorites for review and final selection by the Agency Director and Information Technology Manager.
And the winner is: IRIS -Integrated Records Information System.
The winning entry was submitted by Hal Maloney of Animal Care Services, who will receive a $60 gift certificate.
Selected as first runner up in the contest was Healthstar (Health Services, Technology, Administration and Research), submitted by Craig Aguilera of Public Health Services.
The entry of Behavioral Health's Alan Directo, which was OASIS (Orange County Health Care Agency Service Information System), was selected as the second runner-up.
Agency Director Julie Poulson was impressed by the creativity and thoughtfulness of the entries.
"I know the judges had a very difficult time making their selections because there were so many wonderful names submitted.
I appreciate the time that each entrant put into this contest and their participation in this important project."
The name IRIS will become HCA's "handle" for our organization's information system incorporating registration, scheduling, electronic medical records and billing functions for client services.
Stay tuned for more information about the IRIS system and plans for rollout of the project! __________________________________________________________________
Program educates OC's Cambodian/Hmong residents OCTA bus ride photo Participating in Health Promotion's Multi-Ethnic Health Education Services' health event, Buddhist Monks are among the several Cambodian passengers on a demonstration OCTA bus ride.
For some, this was their first time riding a bus.
Health Promotion's Multi-Ethnic Health Education Services Program recently hosted a series of informational health events, which gave members of the older adult Cambodian and Hmong population in Orange County an opportunity to receive important information on various health services, community programs and available transportation services.
Thirty Hmong and thirty-five Cambodian older adults participated in the Multi-Ethnic Education Services' event held at the First Baptist Church and Cambodian Temple in Santa Ana.
Attendees were able to obtain valuable information on medical screenings and available health services and/or programs in their community.
The Alzheimers Program was also on hand to educate attendees on how to utilize the Orange County Transportation Authority's (OCTA) bus system.
The event included an actual field trip ride on an OCTA bus that drove the attendees to several medical facilities where bus access services are available.
Upon the conclusion of the day's event, all individuals received a full day's pass to continue to utilize OCTA's bus services.
Health Promotion's Multi-Ethnic Health Education Services provides health education support for the Latino, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong and Laotian populations in Orange County.

We are dedicated to protecting and promoting the optimal health of individuals, families and our diverse communities through:
Partnerships
Community Leadership
Assessment of Community Needs
Planning and Policy Development

Beginning this month, What's Up will include a regular feature called HCA's Mission In Action, providing concrete examples of how our mission statement has been put to work for the benefit of the people of Orange County.
This month, we focus on our Partnerships with the community and how the Children's Healthcare Access Initiative (CHAI) is helping the Agency achieve its goal of ensuring access to quality healthcare services.
CHAI is a strategic partnership between HCA, Social Services Agency, Orange County Department of Education, CalOptima, Children's Hospital of Orange County and many community based organizations concerned about the health of children.
The goal of this initiative is to insure every child has comprehensive health insurance and a medical home.
Working together, these partners have developed nine strategic priorities targeted at reducing the number of Orange County children who do not have health coverage, a number currently estimated at almost 70,000.
CHAI has also hosted a community conference featuring experts from throughout California who shared current information and their expertise regarding best practices to provide health coverage for children.
CHAI participants continue their mission by identifying resources to support the strategic priorities as they develop the action plans that will be necessary to ensure a healthy future for Orange County's children.

Holiday programs bring good cheer
Tis' the season for good spirit and cheer as several HCA holiday programs created to help Orange County residents in need begin this month.
The gift-giving programs including Holiday Hope, Operation Santa Claus, Senior Santa and Friends and Angel Tags aim to provide individuals with the joys of the holiday season that they are sometimes unable to provide for themselves and their families.
Designed to supply HCA's neediest clients with adequate food during the holidays, the Holiday Hope program provides food and grocery gift certificates to families that may be at nutritional risk because of their low-income level.
The gift certificates and/or cash donations to purchase other certificates are made possible through the generous donations from members of the community and HCA staff.
A program created to help needy children in Orange County is Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
OSC is a collaborative effort between the Orange County Foster Care Auxiliary, Social Services Agency, Health Care Agency, Orange County Sheriff's Department and Housing and Community Development Department.
The program helps collect and distribute gifts to children of all ages throughout the county.
Gifts are supplied by many generous HCA staff members as well as through the contributing efforts of the U.S. Marines Toys for Tots program and the County of Orange Firefighters Spark of Love toy drive.
Another children's gift-giving service is the Angel Tag program that links HCA staff members and the community with a needy child in Orange County.
Donors are able to pick an Angel Tag from various HCA locations and facilities that will display a child's name and age.
Participants then purchase and drop off an unwrapped gift for that specific child.

Along with helping Orange County children this season, the Senior Santa and Friends program was created to provide seniors with presents, cash and/or gift certificates that will help them purchase items they need the most.
Share in the joys and good spirits the holiday season brings by taking part in one or all of the HCA holiday programs.
For more information on the programs as well as how to donate, call HCA Volunteer Services at (714) 834-3874.
Angel Tags may also be picked up from the Volunteer Services office located on the 3^rd floor of the 405 W. 5^th Street building.
Your participation in this worthy cause will help Orange County residents feel the true spirit of the holidays.

HCA celebrates Orange County's cultural diversity during the holidays
Sights and sounds of the holiday season are once again upon us and the planning of parties and holiday shopping has already begun.
As the holiday spirit of the season begins to unfold, HCA highlights the rich, cultural diversity of Orange County residents and demonstrates how these various cultures combine heritage, tradition and religion to celebrate the unity of love, life and family during Christmas, Las Posadas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Ramadan.
Christmas for many is a time of gift giving, tree decorating, kissing underneath mistletoe, sending Christmas cards, caroling and jolly old St. Nick.
But before these long-standing customary traditions of today existed, the celebration of Christmas or Christmastide marked the day that Mary gave birth to Christ in Bethlehem on December 25^th.
From Christmas day to January 6^th also known as the Twelve Days of Christmas, marks the celebration of the Feast of Epiphany, a commemoration of the baptism of Jesus and the arrival of the Three Wise Men of the East who present him with gold, frankincense and myrth.
The Christmas holiday is also celebrated on the evening of December 24^th, often signifying the arrival of St. Nicholas or Santa Claus.
The customary traditions that we associate with the holidays today did not originate until the rise of Modern America in the 19^th century.
Before then, Christmas had been an ordinary workday in many communities and to others it was a boisterous event characterized by huge feasts and raucous public revelry.
Through the evolution of time, we have come to celebrate the familiar traditions of the Christmas holiday as a time to reflect on what we are thankful for and to place special value on home and family.
Similar religious traditions associated with the birth of Christ are also celebrated amongst the Mexican culture.
During Christmastime, the Mexican culture rejoices by taking part in a religious tradition called Las Posadas or "resting place," and refers to Joseph's search for a place to stay when he and Mary reached Bethlehem before their son, Jesus was born.
The tradition includes a nine-day period where people in a neighborhood join together to form a posada.
At the front of the group are the figures of Mary and Joseph, which are carried by children or perched on a burro.
Children in brightly colored, handmade costumes, dressed as angels, the Three Kings and a host of shepherds follow along.
The group journeys from house to house in search of a place to stay.
At the end, one family informs the group that there is no room inside, but that they may take shelter in the stable.
Afterwards an evening of sweet treats, games and laughter begins.
The meaning of this event incorporates the significance of nativity, family and the Mexican tradition.
Another celebration known as Kwanzaa, Swahili for "first fruits of the harvest" is a seven-day African-American festival based on seven core principles: unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibility (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamma), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani).
A key part of this holiday involves the lighting of the kinara candle, which holds seven candles to represent the seven principles.
A candle is lit each day from December 26^th to January 1^st signifying each principle.
Each day is then spent discussing the principle and formulating ways to work it into the daily lives of family members.
The Kwanzaa holiday originally began in 1966 when Dr. Maulana Karenga, a California State University, Long Beach professor, thought to create a holiday that would unite African-Americans and remind them of their culture and heritage.
This cultural celebration also includes feasting and the giving of gifts.
Similar to the seven-day lighting of the kinara, is an eight-day lighting ceremony of a special candelabrum called a menorah or chanukiah in celebration of the midwinter Hanukkah holiday.
Celebrated by the Jewish community, Hanukkah commemorates the victory of the Maccabbes over the Syrians in 165 B.C.
The Jews of Palestine successfully fought a war against King Antiochus, who forced all of his people to practice the religion of Greece.
When the victors were able to return to their temple, there was only enough sacred oil to light the holy menorah for one day.
However, the lamp continued to burn for eight days, and it was considered a divine miracle.
Hence the eight-day menorah-candle lighting activity.
Jewish families celebrate the "Festival of Lights" event by first lighting a candle at sundown on the 25^th day of the Hebrew month of Kislev.
A "servant" candle called the shamash is lit first and is used to light the other candles.
As each evening passes, another candle is burned until all eight candles have been lit.
At this time, family members send blessings of gratitude to God.
Families then take part in playing dreidel games and exchanging gifts.
Along with the games and gifts, another Hanukkah tradition involves the making of latkes potato pancakes, usually served with applesauce, sour cream and/or jam.
Another holiday event observed by Muslims is Ramadan, celebrated on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, which is determined by the sighting of the new moon.
This celebration commemorates the time when God began revealing contents of the Quran to the prophet Muhammad in A.D. 610.

Project Together hosts holiday Bou"Tea"que
Holiday spirit and cheer filled the air at the 405 W. 5^th Street building as Behavioral Health's Children and Youth Services' (CYS) Project Together program hosted its annual Holiday fundraising boutique on November 21^st to help raise funds for activities and items for the program's children and their families.
Visitors enjoyed a delicious cup of coffee or tea as they browsed from a collection of handmade and hand-painted holiday items, decorations and goodies.
Many were able to purchase Christmas gifts for others, while some bought items to decorate their own homes and Christmas trees.
New and quite popular at this year's boutique was the original "Sweet, Savory and Sassy" cookbook, which included a collection of innovative recipes donated by HCA employees.
Proceeds raised from the annual holiday boutique help send children to camp, pay for special tutors, buy food certificates during the holidays and provide funds for activities and outings for mentors and children.

Sr. Asst.
Compliance Officer
continued from page 1 position after interviewing with Agency Director Julie Poulson and Chief Compliance Officer David Riley and quickly discovered the position is one of great interest.
"I like to learn, and this job is one in which I will need to gain a working knowledge in many service areas where I have not had direct experience," Jeff explained.
"While I have the clinical background and an understanding of the day to day operations in areas like Children and Youth Services, there are many different pieces of the `puzzle' that I am still learning.
It's a challenging and important role for the Agency."
A native of Laguna Beach, Jeff loves water sports.
Away from work, you may find him enjoying his favorite pastime, saltwater fishing, although he didn't share any "fish" stories with us.
He also enjoys spending time with his wife and 5-year-old son.
As Senior Assistant Compliance Officer, Jeff's responsibilities include supervising the Office of Compliance staff and taking the lead on certain Compliance investigations and matters.
"I feel very fortunate to have a great staff including Ruth Zamora, Jody Barrera and John Van Sky.
They are all fabulous!" Jeff views the role of the Office of Compliance as providing the tools that Agency staff need to do their jobs well.
"HCA operates in an increasingly regulated environment.
We are here to provide guidance and assess risks so that the Agency can meet its goals and thrive."
He takes a positive approach, believing the Compliance Program allows the Agency to focus on what is necessary to provide quality health care services and programs.
A major challenge for the Compliance Program will be keeping pace with changes in health care delivery and the regulatory environment.
Jeff believes HCA will be up to that challenge.
"We are exploring the possibility of offering computer based Compliance training to keep HCA staff up-to-date.
The responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are also being incorporated into the duties of the Office of Compliance, so there will be lots of work ahead to meet the deadlines established by HIPAA."

Holidays
continued from page 5
observance includes the Five Pillars that define the Islamic faith: fasting, declaration of faith, prayer, giving to the poor and pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a holy site in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
During this month-long period, Muslims will fast during daylight hours to purify body and soul and promote compassion and self-discipline.
Along with fasting, the faithful give some percentage of their income to charitable organizations and read the entire Quran for the duration of the event.
Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Power, marks the time when God first revealed the scriptures to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel.
The culmination of Ramadan takes place on December 5-6 with Id al-Fitre known as the breaking of the fast.
Families and mosques then celebrate with prayers and festive meals.
No matter what beliefs, traditions, or ethnic background, the holiday season holds a special feeling that warms everyone's heart.
Send some good wishes and holiday cheer this year by taking part in your neighborhood's holiday celebrations and cultural events and share in the reflection and celebration of love, life, family and religion to acknowledge our culture and heritage with those you know.
May the joys of the season bring you peace and happiness throughout the year!
