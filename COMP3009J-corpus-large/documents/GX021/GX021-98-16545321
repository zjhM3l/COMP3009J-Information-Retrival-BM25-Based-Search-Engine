An Overview of Obesity Obesity is an American disease of excesses--an excess of caloric intake in relation to the calories burned and an excess of prejudice and misunderstanding for the overweight person.
Obesity most commonly strikes inactive individuals who have a family history of obesity.
It may include individuals who chronically diet and others who make poor food choices.
But there is more to understanding obesity than assuming these individuals have no will power and are gluttonous eaters.
There are possible physiological and psychological causes.
Obesity Prevalence
Obesity is defined as being 20% over ideal body weight.
As many as 20-25% of all Americans are obese by this definition.
Americans see themselves as fatter than that.
As much as 46% of the women and 32% of the men in one study stated that they were overweight in spite of the fact that many were within their ideal weight range.
Our society has an obsession with weight.
Physical Factors
Physical causes, like metabolism, relate in some way to every obese person, but only 5% are actually caused by medical problems.
Your metabolism burns up calories; obese individuals usually have lower metabolic needs.
That can be caused by having a higher percentage of body fat or a very efficient system that uses each calorie to its optimum level.
Frustrating as it is, when the body's fat percentage increases, the calories burned decreases.
The activity level also usually drops further complicating the picture.
Studies have shown that the obese tend to move their bodies less and this inactivity increases the likelihood of obesity.
Heredity is also linked to obesity.
If both of your parents are obese, your changes of becoming obese are 80%; one parent, 40%; and with lean parents, 10%.
It is important to note that the link is not 100%.
Even if your entire family is overweight, obesity is not inevitable!

By exercising regularly, you will increase muscle and decrease body fat.
Psychological Factors
Obesity is rarely caused by psychological problems.
But being obese in our thin-craving society can cause a multitude of emotional stresses which, in turn, can trigger the tendency to overeat.
Research has found that as a group, obese persons may be more sensitive to sweet tastes, more responsive to eating cues in the environment, and overeating can more often be stimulated by the thoughts of good food.
(Chronic dieting may influence this, too).
Stresses in the environment such as work, family and relationships can increase the susceptibility towards overeating.
Stress can imbalance self-control and increase making frequent poor food choices.
Hope for the Obese
Society must learn to treat the obese with the respect they deserve as valued members.
Accepting this disease as a complex problem with no easy answers, frees the obese to accept that the disease is not all their fault and that they are battling a disease that they may conquer slowly over time.
Whether they lose weight or not, the goal of the battle is to grow in self-acceptance and love.
