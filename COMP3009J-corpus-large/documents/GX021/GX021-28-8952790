The well documented prevalence of obesity in the United States has led to an increase in bariatric surgery.
It is incumbent upon the AME to understand complications and prognosis associated with the various bariatric surgeries, so that the aviator is properly certified post operatively.
The most serious complications associated with bariatric surgery occur within 30 days of operation and represent the greatest risk for sudden incapacitation.
Accordingly, the author recommends waiting this period post-operatively, prior to medical certification.
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, from 1999 to 2000, the number of overweight adults rose from 56% to 65% of the United States population.
Given the prevalence of obesity in the general population, it behooves the aviation medical examiner to become familiar with surgical procedures that pilots may opt for in their "battle of the bulge."
Admittedly, obesity is not an automatically disqualifying condition (1) and is not queried as part of the medical history (Box 18 on FAA 8500-8).
However, the mortality associated with obesity is well known, i.e., a two fold mortality rate for men 50% above average weight.
This is attributable to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factor such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
In addition, the prevention of secondary complications of morbid obesity is an important goal of management, with data from the Framingham study to support the estimate that a 10% reduction in body weight corresponds with a 20% reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease.
As with smoking cessation, the aviation medical examiner should have an interest in providing dietary and exercise counseling for the pilot, since we all play a role in preventing sudden incapacitating events.
However, when diet modification has failed, and morbidity and mortality become a significant risk, then bariatric surgery may be the only viable option.
The option of surgical treatment should be reserved to patients who are morbidly obese, well-informed, motivated, and willing to accept the operative risk.
In addition, the patient should be able to participate in treatment and long-term follow-up.
Surgical treatment of morbid obesity focuses on a body mass index of over 40kg per meter squared, or with being 100 pounds overweight.
Bariatric surgery is a recognized sub-interest in the field of general surgery and has been endorsed by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference of 1992.
Surgery generally involves a reduction in size of the gastric reservoir, with or without a degree of associated malabsorption.
Subsequently, eating behavior improves dramatically and reduces caloric intake; thereby ensuring that the patient practices behavior modification by eating small amounts and chewing each mouthful well.
The AME should realize that operations vary according to an individual surgeon's recommendation, patient choice, and availability.
Complex operations combine gastric restriction and gastric bypass, whereas simple procedures are purely gastric restriction.
The percentage of complex procedures has increased steadily from 1991, with 97% of the procedures performed in the year 2000 categorized as being complex; compared with 11% in 1986.
Overall, 79% of operations submitted to the International Bariatric Surgery Registry's pooled report were indicated as being complex.
The mean percentage excess weight loss at five years ranges from 48-74% after gastric bypass and from 50-60% after vertical banding gastroplasty.
In a ten-year follow-up series from the University of Virginia, weight loss was reported as 60% of excess weight at 5 years and as 96% of excess weight at 14 years.
This weight reduction in a pilot would certainly improve several co-morbid conditions -glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, and obesity-associated hypoventilation, hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities.
Despite its benefits, the pilot who wishes to undergo such treatment must assess the risk of surgical treatment, which includes the operative, peri-operative, and long-term complications.
Specifically, the obese pilot has an increase in morbidity in the early post-operative period from wound infection, gastric or anastamosis leaks from staple breakdown, stenosis, marginal ulcers, various pulmonary problems, and deep thrombophlebitis, which may be more than 10%
.
Splenectomy is necessary in 0.3% of patients to control operative bleeding, and the risk of the most serious complications of gastrointestinal leak and deep vein thrombosis is less than 1%.
Such conditions would obviously require grounding and deferral upon medical certification.
The current trend toward decreased length of post-operative hospital stay has increased the importance of the AME when examining or screening for medical events within 30 days of the operation.
Indeed, some complications may not be recognized until after hospital discharge, with approximately 0.1% of the patients requiring a re-operation within 30 days of the primary operation and death occurring in 0.3% of the patients.
The most common complications reported within 30 days of operation for severe obesity are respiratory (2%); minor complications (atelectasis, hyperventilation, plural effusion pluritis, and pneumonitis) represented the greater part; and major respiratory complications (pulmonary embolism and respiratory failure) only 0.3% of all complications.
Bowel obstruction and gastric leaks of the digestive juices into the abdominal cavity require immediate attention and occur approximately 0.3% of the time.
As a general grouping, when staple breakdown, peritonitis, and sub-hepatic abscess were combined with the percentage of GI leaks, the incidence rose to 0.45%.
Thirty percent of all 30-day deaths are associated with a GI leak.
In summary, the three most serious major complications associated with bariatric operations for severe obesity are pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal leaks.
Eighty percent of all deaths occur within 30 days of the operation; therefore, when confronted with an airman who presents post-operative from bariatric surgery, the AME should keep in mind these complications and defer medical certification, until at least 30 days post operatively.
In addition, a search for complications associated with bariatric surgery by review of systems should be conducted.

Pursuant to FAR part 67.113/213/313, obesity would fall under a "general medical condition" and would be disqualifying if it rendered the airman unable to safely perform duties.
