Story Corner
The Market
By M. E.
The market at my village in Vietnam opened twice a week, on Thursdays and Sundays in a field about one-half the size of a football field.
We could find everything from joss sticks to candles, from cooking food to live animals, from doctors to fortune tellers.
One Sunday after church, before we entered the market, my mother abruptly pulled my arm and gently forced me to a halt; she half-sat and half-knelt on the ground bringing her face close to mine.
Her eyes narrowed, she solemnly whispered, "Huong, daughter, the famine isn't over yet; don't forget to watch Mama's basket while I am busy bargaining and choosing food."
"Of course, Mama!" I replied.
My mother's eyes widened again as she nodded at me approvingly.
Bravely following my mother into the chaotic crowd and its clamor, I felt as proud and confident as a good soldier on a trusted mission did.
I skipped into the market, and had I known how to whisper like my cousin, I would have done so.
Our first purchase was a kilogram of pork shoulder since my father's favorite dish was sweet and sour pork.
While my mother was getting her change, I hung on to our bamboo basket.
Suddenly a middle-aged lady in a pretty blue blouse stopped and smiled at me, but I didn't smile back as I would usually do.
To my suspicious eyes, her glance at our basket seemed threatening.
My stomach squirmed! I reached out for my mother's hand and shook it violently until she turned around to look at me.
I let go of her hand, and still speechless, I pointed my little finger at the "blue" lady's face.
My mother looked at the lady and then at me again, and for a moment, I thought she was either embarrassed or nervous.
To my surprise, my mother smiled charmingly at the lady; the lady smiled back and she stroked my long, silky, black hair before walking away.
When we reached the vegetable corner, my mother, with the same gesture as before (except her eyes didn't narrow this time), whispered into my ear,
"Huong, daughter, the thieves usually wear ragged clothes."
"Yes, Mama."
I nodded.
We went on with our purchases while this time I carefully watched out for suspects with ragged clothes.
We bought beef, shrimp, dried mushrooms, vegetables and fresh fruits.
The last item was cooked rice noodles for my favorite dish, "Bun Bo" (fried beef and noodles).
When my mother pressed our noodles into the over-filled basket, I let go a sign of relief and followed her happily outside the market area.
I envisioned our dinner that night and could almost smell the fried beef with onions and feel the taste of the coarsely pounded fried peanuts sprinkled over the bowl of "Bun Bo."
My mother mixed the best "Nuoc Mam" (mixed fish sauce with water, sugar, vinegar or fresh lemon juice, and freshly crushed garlic).
My mouth watered.
I was trying to swallow my saliva when my mother's piercing scream brought my attention back to the surrounding market.
Following my mothers scream was the thudding sound of her basket dropping to the ground; our purchases scattered all over.
Following the strings of noodles on the ground, my eyes found two filthy feet with long toenails filled with dirt.
The skinny body (also covered with dirt) was wrapped in rags, and one of the filthy hands was full of noodles; the other was helping to stuff the delicious strings of noodles into the widely-opened mouth.
The two big, hollow eyes stared at us with out blinking once.
To my horror, at his touch the milky noodles turned brown.
By the time I had recovered from my shock, my mother had already gathered the rest of her purchases and shoved them all into the bamboo basket.
Her face twisted as if in pain, and she muttered under her breath as if she was saying a prayer, but I knew it was the opposite.
When my mother picked up the banana leaves used for wrapping food, they still contained some left over noodles with brown and black marks, she hesitated for a second; then to my amazement she threw them at the robber.
From one shock to another, I saw the man expertly catch the banana leaves with just one of his empty hands.
My mother was too angry to return to the market for another bag of noodles, but I couldn't have cared less because I had lost my appetite for my favorite dish, "Bun Bo." Bun Bo photo _________________________________________________________________

Cultural Competency 
Open House
The Cultural Competency 
The office welcomed a few hundred visitors who met and familiarized themselves with all aspects of the Behavioral Health Services department.
People toured the Resource Library, and sought consultation on their various programs that could benefit from a multicultural perspective.
The guests were treated to a diverse luncheon buffet from staffs various ethnic backgrounds.
Rather than attempt to familiarize guests with foods from around the world, all members of the department chose to share some of their favorite dishes from their own cultures.
Music and traditional clothing were also shared.

Hmong Health Survey
Sara Murrieta, PhD, MPH
HMONG HEALTHCARE PRACTICES IN ORANGE COUNTY: Results From the Hmong Health Survey is in print and on the web.
The Hmong Health Survey initiated by Chongge Vang of Orange County Public Health/Health Promotion Multi-Ethnic Health Education Services is the first to be conducted in Orange County of Hmong Americans.
The 105 Hmong individuals surveyed were all born in Asia.
Travers Ichinose oversaw the epidemiological aspects of the study.
The Hmong are a people with a history of migration in Asia of over 5,000 years.
Twenty years ago as a result of their aid to the U.S. in the War in Vietnam, about 13,000 immigrated to Orange County.
More than 10,000 have left the county.
The Hmong can pose a challenge to the Western health care system.
They have maintained their integrity as a people and their memory of their 5,000-year-old traditions of life and death.
Now in the United States, poverty, no health insurance, lack of education and linguistic isolation can further prevent them from readily joining the mainstream.
Results From the Hmong Health Survey disclosed that Hmong Americans need to be approached in a language that they can understand and in a cultural environment that they can trust in order to become more integrated into the U.S. education, employment, and health care systems.
