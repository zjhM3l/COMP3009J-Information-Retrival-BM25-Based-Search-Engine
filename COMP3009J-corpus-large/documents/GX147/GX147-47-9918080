Congresswoman Jane harman - Press Release September 11, 1998 STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN JANE HARMAN ON TODAY'S HOUSE VOTE TO RELEASE THE TEXT OF THE REPORT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL KENNETH STARR WASHINGTON -- US Congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Torrance) released the following statement after today's House vote to release the text of the report of special counsel Kenneth Starr: "I voted for the resolution to publicly release the report of special counsel Kenneth Starr with mixed emotions.
I believe the American people are entitled to see the evidence Starr has presented, but I also believe President Clinton was entitled to procedural due process, as was President Nixon in 1974 and President Reagan during the Iran-Contra scandal.
"As a result of the effort to rush the report to public view, the American people will initially see only one side of the case against the President.
They deserve, indeed our democracy deserves, better.
"Not only is the President on trial,' but so is Congress, and how we handle our Constitutional responsibility will also be under close scrutiny.
In the end, we have to reach the right' judgment -- a judgment that is based on a careful weighing of all of the evidence and is respected in the country and elsewhere.
"I urge my constituents to reserve judgment and to insist on procedural fairness.
My office will help facilitate access to the information released today, both the Starr report and the White House rebuttal, as well as other material released during the course of this proceeding.
