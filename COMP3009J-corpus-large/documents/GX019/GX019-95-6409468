VI J. Meeting the Performance Standards in 7 CFR 340.3(c) for Additional Plant Species _________________________________________________________________
General Considerations
The performance standards in 7 CFR Part 340.3(c) may be met by many protocols that are designed according to the individual circumstances.
APHIS has sponsored, cosponsored or participated in several workshops to discuss safeguards for planned introductions of genetically engineered crops.
These include workshops on corn, tomatoes, and potatoes (for which containment conditions have already been discussed in Section VI-I (5) of the User's Guide) and wheat, rice, flax, oilseed rape and sorghum.
Applicants should seek additional guidance for individual circumstances by consulting the reports of these workshops and by consulting appropriate breeder's literature and breeder's practices on ensuring genetic isolation (e.g., 7 CFR 201.76).
Applicants may also discuss with BSS any relevant biological consideration associated with meeting performance standards for particular plant species.
It remains the duty of the applicant/responsible person, however, to determine the specific procedures that will need to be used to meet the performance standards and to certify that those standards are being met.
Additional guidance for meeting each performance standard is provided below.
(1) Shipping and maintenance at destination
Suggestions are provided in Section VI-I (1) of the User's Guide on how to ship, store, and handle plant material at and in transit to the destination point in such a way as to (1) prevent accidental release of the regulated article into the environment, (2) prevent accidental mixing of regulated and nonregulated material, (3) prevent pollen flow to receptive plants within or outside of contained facilities, and (4) devitalize seeds and other material capable of propagation prior to disposal.
Since these suggestions apply to any plant species, no additional guidance is offered.
(2) Inadvertent mixing of materials in environmental releases
Suggestions are provided in Section VI-I (2) of the User's Guide on how regulated articles can be planted in such a way as to prevent inadvertent mixing of the regulated article with other plant species that are not part of the environmental release.
These should be adequate for most crops.
Persons granted access to the test site need to be made aware of the performance standards to ensure that their actions at the site will be consistent with those requirements.
Alleys between the transgenic field plot and neighboring plots should be sufficient to allow movement of planting and harvesting equipment and other farm implements in such a way that seed or vegetative propagules do not become deposited outside of the transgenic field test site and mixed with plant species that are not part of the field trial.
Farm implements that can retain viable seed or other propagules should be cleaned on the transgenic field test site or otherwise treated to meet the performance standards.
(3) Identity and devitalization
Section VI-I (3) of the User's Guide addresses how the identity of plants and their parts can be maintained while in use, and those materials devitalized when no longer in use.
Methods that could be used for final disposition and devitalization include the following: (1) harvesting all seed or other reproductive material and (2) incorporating into the soil for decomposition at the test site all remaining vegetative material, or (3) treating the remaining vegetative material with an appropriate registered herbicide, or (4) in the case of woody perennial species, trees, and vines either removing the plants to a contained facility or cutting and mulching, chipping or exposing the plants to high temperature treatment (i.e., autoclaving, oven baking, or incineration [in accordance with local regulations]) and ensuring that any underground plant parts capable of reproduction are removed and likewise destroyed.
Part of ensuring devitalization is monitoring for volunteer transgenic plants and taking measures to ensure that they are destroyed.
For plants allowed to set seed during the field trial, the occurrence and duration of seed dormancy are factors that should also be considered in the design of proper monitoring protocols.
For example, some hard-seeded seed may not be destroyed by fumigation.
(4) Elimination of viable vector agents
Appropriate methods are discussed in Section VI-I (4) of the User's Guide.
(5) Persistence in the environment
Performance standard #5 stipulates that the field trial be conducted such that the regulated article will not persist in the environment and no offspring can be produced that could persist in the environment.
APHIS has described persistence in the environment to mean "producing feral or sustained populations of the regulated article or its offspring that can persist in agricultural or nonagricultural habitats without human intervention" (58 FR, 17049, March 31, 1993).
Devitalization methods, such as those described in paragraph (3) above, should be used to ensure that the regulated article itself does not persist at the field site.
To minimize dispersal to and persistence in the environment outside of the field test site of vegetative propagules or seed produced from regulated articles planted as part of the environment release, the applicant should consider the following:
* the possible mechanisms by which seeds or vegetative propagules of these plants could become dispersed from the field test site (e.g., by the elements, field personnel or visitors, farm implements, foraging birds or other animals, etc.) * whether the selected site is located adjacent to waterways that are prone to flooding * the range of distance of possible dispersion * whether seed or propagules are likely to persist (as described in the previous paragraph) within the range of environments to which they might be dispersed * methods to prevent such dispersion * whether the selected site and security measures are appropriate and adequate
Seeds or fruits from some plant species are easily dispersed long distance by wind (e.g., lightweight seeds such as those from orchids, and plumed, winged, or wooly fruits such as those of many trees; ash, elm, maple, cottonwood, pine, willow, poplar, etc.).
In addition, seeds or fruits from some species can be widely disseminated in a viable manner by foraging birds or other animals (e.g., cherries, raspberries, grapes, mulberries, etc., or fruits or seeds with burrs or spines that adhere to fur or feathers).
In these cases it may be necessary to either prevent seed set, or to harvest seed or employ the use of appropriate netting or bagging in such a manner and at an appropriate time to prevent the seed from inadvertently escaping outside the range of the test site.
Section VI-I (5) of the User's Guide provides guidance for ensuring that no offspring are produced that can persist in the environment, particularly for the 6 crops tomato, corn, cotton, soybean, tobacco, and potato.
General points to consider to minimize the likelihood of pollination and successful fertilization of receptive plants outside the field test site are discussed below.
If the transgenic plants to be field tested either do not produce viable pollen or will not reach reproductive maturity during the course of the field trial, then no special steps should need to be taken to prevent outcrossing.
If the purpose of the field trial is only to evaluate some aspect of vegetative growth and not to harvest fruit or seed, it may be desirable to terminate the field trial prior to flowering.
This may be the case for some vegetable crops and herbs, such as lettuce and those from the Umbelliferae family (e.g., carrot, celery, parsley, parsnip, etc.), many of which are biennial or perennial in nature, and for many deciduous trees, shrubs, vines, and canes.
If viable pollen is to be produced, one needs to consider the following:
* whether the transgenic plant is self-pollinated or outcrossing * the extent and distance of pollen dissemination by wind and/or pollinating insects, birds, or other species (and the occurrence of these species) * the distance between the field test site and sexually compatible crops, especially those being grown for seed * the ability of the transgenic plant species to produce viable, fertile progeny with sexually compatible wild or weedy relatives, and the distribution of the latter within pollination distance of the test site * whether the flowering cycle of the transgenic plant will overlap with sexually compatible crops or wild or weedy relatives located within pollination distance of the test site * precautions taken to minimize pollen flow (such as bagging flowers or using border rows as a pollen trap for pollinating insects) * the ability of any transgenic hybrid progeny to persist in the environment
It is important to note that for perennial species, field trials may continue over more than one growing season, and for certain of these species, particularly trees and some small fruit crops the regulated articles may reach sexual maturity only several years after initial planting.
For example, depending on the species, cultivar, and growing conditions, woody perennial fruit species, with few exceptions, take at least 3-8 years from orchard planting to begin bearing.
Many small fruit crop species such as highbush blueberry, cranberry, currant, gooseberry, grape, and raspberry may take from 2-5 years to begin bearing (see Tables 4 and 5, Helgason and Storgaard, 1987, Botany of Crops Plants In CRC Handbook of Plant Science in Agriculture, Vol. I., B. R. Christie (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL).
Therefore, it may be that the procedures utilized to ensure reproductive confinement of the regulated articles in the first year of a field trial may prove inadequate at a later time in the trial.
Yearly certification for multiyear trials requires that applicants consider the stage of maturity of the transgenic plants (with measures in place to address precocious flowering as well, if it occurs) in designing appropriate confinement protocols.
The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies publishes minimum plant isolation requirements for maintaining seed-stock purity (7 CFR 201.76, Table 5).
This can be a good starting point for designing containment features for many experiments as long as one takes into consideration the percentages of outcrossing assumed in those isolation distances.
It should be noted that in the preamble of the rule establishing the notification procedure (58 FR, pg. 17049, March 31, 1993) APHIS indicated "When the regulated article is male fertile and allowed to flower, it must be separated from any foundation or breeder seed production of nonregulated plant material of the same species by at least the isolation distances for foundation seed production given in 7 CFR 201.76".
This also applies to other plant species now eligible for notification for which standards have been established in 7 CFR 201.76.
In Section VI-I (5) of the Users Guide, APHIS stated that generally, those methods that are used to ensure purity of certified seed may be adapted successfully to otherwise minimize development of persistent offspring outside the trial.
It was also noted that methods that have been shown to give genetic isolation equal to certified seed standards are also acceptable.
However, for plants with sexually compatible wild or weedy relatives, more stringent requirements may be necessary for the applicant to certify that no progeny will be produced that can persist in the environment.
It may be necessary to survey the area surrounding the test site for the presence of these plants or select a test site where no sexually compatible species are known to exist.
A guide to wild germplasm that has been successfully introgressed with cultivated species can be found in the CRC Handbook of Plant Science in Agriculture, Vol. I., 1987.
B. R. Christie (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL in the chapter on Introgressive Hybridization by S. R. Bowley and Norman L. Taylor.
This guide may provide references on wild species that are sexually compatible with crop species, however these species may or may not exist in the United States.
Information on the geographical distribution of specific wild and weedy species is available from various published flora and from other sources including the following:

Examples of commercially important species that can hybridize with closely related, wild taxa in the United States, some of which are considered weeds, are shown in Table 1 of this section.
This list is by no means exhaustive.
APHIS will continue to update and expand this list of such species, and we welcome any comments or additional information.
Please forward comments to Ray Dobert at rdobert@www.aphis.usda.gov.
The following subsection "Points to Consider for Sunflower, Strawberry, and Populus sp." provides some examples of points to consider for containment for these plant species which have already been field tested and for which sexually compatible wild or weedy relatives occur in the United States.
It would be impractical for APHIS to list all of the possible containment protocols which could be used to prevent gene dissemination and persistence in the environment for all plant species and their progeny that would be potentially eligible under the revised notification rule.
If an applicant has any doubts about containment protocols that could be used to meet this performance standard for a particular proposed field trial, he or she is encouraged to either consult with APHIS well in advance of submitting a notification letter or to submit a permit application.
(6) Volunteer plants
Points to consider on managing volunteer plants so as to prevent their persistence in the environment were covered under Section VI-I (6) of the User's Guide.
Devitalization methods discussed in paragraph (3) above could also be considered.
These should be sufficient to cover all eligible plant species.
_________________________________________________________________
Points To Consider for Sunflower, Strawberry, and Populus sp.
The following points should be considered to prevent gene dissemination and persistence in the environment for three plant species (sunflower, Helianthus annuus; strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa; and poplar trees, Populus species) for which sexually compatible wild or weedy relatives occur in the United States.
Field trials for these species have been conducted under APHIS permit.
SUNFLOWER
Background Information
Distribution, Biology, and Taxonomic Considerations-
Sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., is an important annual rowcrop.
Top producing States are Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Texas (Hunst, 1993).
Sunflower is also distributed across all of the continental United States, as either a native species or as a common or serious weed of cultivated land and disturbed areas, with particular economic importance in the Midwest and eastward (Munz, 1968; Reed, 1970).
It is a common volunteer in field crops, developed from stray seed of the previous season (Robinson, 1978).
Sunflower belongs to the genus Helianthus, a genus of 67 species, all native to the Americas, and most to the United States (Heiser, 1978).
The genus consists of both annuals and perennials; some, such as H. annuus, are very common; some are quite rare; some are very weedy; and some are grown as ornamentals.
Cultivated sunflower crosses readily with wild and weedy forms of H. annuus.
Cultivated sunflower is also potentially capable of crossing with many other species of Helianthus, and naturally occurring hybrid swarms are known in the United States (Heiser, 1978).
Interspecific hybridization involving H. annuus ranges from easy and generally fertile crosses, such as with many of the other annual species, to high levels of incompatibility (Whelan, 1978).
Pollination- The sunflower head (capitulum) consists of 700-8000 individual florets, the outer whorl consisting of sterile, showy, ray flowers and the inner whorl consisting of perfect, seed-bearing disk flowers (Knowles, 1978).
The process of anthesis and fertilization of an individual floret is complete within 2 days; however, pollen dissemination from an individual capitulum or plant can occur over long periods of time.
Traditional cultivars have been maintained as open pollinating populations, but more recent breeding approaches have involved hybrids dependent on male sterility/restorer systems introduced from wild Helianthus species (Fick, 1978).
Sunflower inflorescences will also continue to develop and shed viable pollen even after removal from the stalk (Smith, 1978).
Dissemination of the large spiny pollen grains from one flower to another by wind cannot occur farther than a few feet.
Honey bees are the primary pollinators of sunflower.
Bumble bees, wild bees, and other insects may also be pollinators.
Movement of sunflower pollen to other cultivated, wild, or weedy sunflowers by bees can occur over considerable distance.
Certified seed distance in 7 CFR Part 201.76 is 2640 feet (0.5 mile), and is increased to 5280 feet (1 mile) between seed fields and wild or volunteer sunflower plants.
Growers in the Sacramento Valley of California use distances of up to 4 miles or temporal isolation (Smith, 1978).
Seed dispersal- Sunflower seed is very attractive to many birds, particularly blackbirds and the house finch (Besser, 1978; Smith, 1978).
Although most of the seed is consumed by the birds and becomes nonviable, there is an inevitable fraction that is moved but not consumed.
A certain percentage of seed always falls to the ground before and during harvest of commercial sunflower fields.
This frequently results in the appearance of volunteer plants in the next season.
Rats and mice are also attracted to sunflower seeds and can aid in their dispersal.
Confinement Considerations Genes may move out of test sites by fertile pollen or by seed.
Because insect-vectored sunflower pollen may readily transfer genes to wild, weedy, or cultivated H. annuus, or other Helianthus spp. outside test areas across the United States, some means, such as flower removal and disposal, caging, the use of male sterile lines, etc., must be used to prevent such movement in order to meet performance standards for field trials under notification.
Male sterility systems may prove to be particularly useful for this species if they are demonstrated to be effective in preventing production of viable pollen.
Spatial isolation is probably not realistic for most suitable agricultural sites in the United States due to the wide prevalence of sexually compatible species.
Some means (almost certainly physical), of preventing seed dispersal by birds and rodents, must be implemented.
Some single methods may at the same time effectively exclude pollinators as well.
The integrity of any physical method used needs to be monitored throughout the trial.
The dispersal of shattered seed at harvest needs to be prevented.
Use of transgenic sunflowers beyond the field testing stage is likely to require additional information about the behavior of the new varieties and their interactions with wild and/or weedy relatives.
For certain experiments designed to investigate these parameters, it may be appropriate to perform field trials under permit.
STRAWBERRY
Background Information
Distribution, Biology, and Taxonomic Considerations- In the U.S., commercial production of the cultivated strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa, occurs primarily in California and Florida, but also in New York, North Carolina, Michigan, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin (Hunst, 1993).
In the northwestern U.S., the cultivated strawberry is also reported to be a weed in some perennial and no-till systems (Rissler and Mellon, 1993), although it is not listed by the Weed Science Society of America as a weed (1992).
The primary cultivated strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa, is a hybrid derived from two New World species, F. chiloensis and F. virginiana (Darrow, 1966).
All three species are octoploids (2n = 56) with wide geographic and climatic distributions within and outside the U.S. (Bringhurst, 1990; Galetta and Bringhurst, 1989; and references therein).
F. chiloensis (L.) Duch. is reportedly distributed along the moist pacific coasts from California to the Aleutian peninsula of Alaska and of the Hawaiian Islands.
Four subspecies of F. chiloensis have been distinguished with different distribution areas: ssp. chiloensis (including the forms F. patagonica and F. chiloensis), ssp. lucida, ssp. pacifica, and ssp. sandwicensis (Staudt, 1962).
The North American species F. virginiana Duch., an herbaceous perennial, includes four subspecies: ssp. virginiana, ssp. glauca, ssp. platypetala, and ssp. grayana (Staudt, 1962).
In contrast to F. chiloensis, F. virginiana is found primarily in Eastern North America (Galetta and Bringhurst, 1989; and references therein) and is reported as a weed of unknown status in the U.S. (Holm et al., 1991).
F. ovalis (Rydb) Lehm (synonomous with ssp. glauca) is a cold-resistant species occurring in Oregon, Idaho, the Rocky Mountains and British Columbia (Bauer and Gruber, 1962; Galetta and Bringhurst, 1989).
F. vesca (L.), a diploid (2n = 14) woodland strawberry, is also reported as a weed of unknown status in the U.S. (Holm et al., 1991).
F. virginiana, F. vesca, and the hexaploid F. moschata Duchesne are also occasionally cultivated in home gardens (Maas, 1984), although the latter is native to Europe and is not naturally distributed in the U.S.
Introgressive hybridization of each of these species with cultivated strawberry has been reported, although in some cases, chromosome doubling was used to obtain the F1 or backcross (Bowley and Taylor, 1987; and references therein).
At least four other species are known to be introgressed into cultivated strawberry: F. moupinensis, F. nubicola, F. orientalis, and F. viridis.
None of these are native to the U.S., although they may be used in breeding programs here.
Pollination and propagation- Cultivated strawberries are perennial plants with normally biennial fruit development, wherein flower buds initiated in one growing season expand and form fruit in the following growing season.
Flowering and fruiting habits in both commercial cultivars and in wild populations of F. virginiana, F. chiloensis and F. ovalis can range from single-fruiting, short-day types ("June bearing") to almost continuous-blooming, day-neutral types.
Therefore, depending on the cultivar or population, flowering is possible from early spring until growth is stopped by cold temperatures (Maas, 1984).
Short-day seedlings will not bear any flowers or fruit in the season of planting.
The commercial strawberry is predominantly hermaphroditic (bisexual), although plants of some strawberry species are dioecious (i.e., having male and female flowers on separate plants).
Strawberry flowers are genetically self-compatible (Hughes, 1951), but substantial inbreeding depression occurs in the cultivated strawberry such that inbred seedlings are much less vigorous than outbred seedlings (Niemirowicz-Szcytt, 1989).
Some pollination may occur by wind or gravity over very short distances, but stigmas are receptive long before the anthers dehisce; therefore, cross-pollination by insects is favored (Free, 1970, pg. 417).
Bees and occasionally other insects are important pollinators (Antonelli et al., 1988).
Honey bees are sometimes added to commercial fields to increase pollination success, since fertilization of the ovules is essential for hormone-stimulated development of the fruit (receptacle).
Honeybees also promote outcrossing by their habit of visiting relatively few of the available flowers per plant and visiting a large number of plants (Free, 1968).
Commercial varieties differ in their ability to attract pollinators and in their dependency on insects as pollinators (Bagnara and Vincent, 1988).
Consequently, some varieties have higher selfing rates than others.
Strawberry cultivars do not breed true to type.
Therefore, in commercial operations, plants are propagated vegetatively from runner plants that are produced from the distal end of runners (stolons) or by division of branch crowns bearing roots, rather than from seed.
The number of runners produced varies depending on the seasonal conditions and the cultivar, from none (particularly with certain everbearing and day-neutral cultivars) to a dozen or more (particularly with June-bearing cultivars).
Seed dispersal- The seeds (achenes) are borne externally on the fleshy edible receptacle.
Volunteers from seed are uncommon (personal communication, Dr. Gene Galetta, Strawberry Breeder, ARS, Beltsville, MD).
Seed germination is slow and nonuniform (6-90 days), and requires scarification and/or afterripening (stratification and refrigeration 2.5-3 months) for optimal results (Galetta and Bringhurst, 1989).
Deer, raccoon, groundhogs and birds are common foragers of the berries, and the latter may assist in occasional long-distance dissemination.
Confinement Considerations
Genes may move out of test sites and/or persist in the environment as a result of cross-fertilization of sexually compatible relatives by pollen, by seed dissemination, or by vegetative propagation from runners or crowns.
Depending on cultivar, photoperiod, climatic conditions and whether the transgenic plant material is derived from seedlings or runners, flower emergence may not take place until the second season.
In addition, flower induction can be chemically inhibited by gibberellic acid (Galetta and Bringhurst, 1989).
If pollen from a transgenic strawberry plant pollinates a commercial strawberry plant, this would be unlikely to lead to introduction of the new genes into commercial lines because all commercial cultivars are propagated vegetatively.
In order to meet performance standards for field trials under notification, tests using transgenic strawberries planted within pollination distance of sexually compatible species occurring in the U.S. (such as F. virginiana, F. chiloensis, F. vesca, and F. ovalis) and/or other strawberries being grown for seed should be conducted in such a way as to prevent bee and other insect pollinators from transporting pollen to these species.
Bees have been shown to forage up to 5.6 km from their hives, but most work within 4 km (Free, 1970).
Regular harvesting of berries or use of netting may reduce or eliminate the possibility of seed dissemination by foragers.
Removal or devitalization (e.g., by herbicide treatment) of plants and runners would be necessary to ensure that plants do not persist through vegetative propagation.
Use of transgenic strawberries beyond the field testing stage is likely to require additional information about the behavior of the new varieties and their interactions with wild and/or weedy relatives.
For certain experiments designed to investigate these parameters, it may be appropriate to perform field trials under permit.
POPLAR
Background Information
Distribution, biology, and taxonomic considerations- The genus Populus Linnaeus, which contains species referred to as poplar, aspen, cottonwood, abele, tacamahac, popple, and others, consists of fast-growing deciduous trees of great ecological range across the temperate Northern Hemisphere and East Tropical Africa, forming extensive natural stands and large tracts of manmade plantations (Everett, 1981; Slabaugh, 1958; Hutchinson, 1968).
Ten species have been listed as weeds of unknown status in the U.S. by Holm et al. (1991).
(The common tulip poplar or yellow poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera] does n
Kartesz (1994) lists 12 species in the genus Populus in the United States, Canada, and Greenland (P. alba L., P. angustifolia James, P. balsamifera L., P. deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh., P. fremontii S. Wats., P. grandidentata Michx., P. heterophylla L., P. nigra L., P. simonii Carr., P. tomentosa Carr., P. tremula L., P. tremuloides Michx.).
They recognize 12 more natural hybrids, and numerous rejected synonyms.
The degree of hybridization, together with large stands of clones, complicate the taxonomy of the genus (Everett, 1981).
All are potentially sexually compatible with any tested species of Populus.
Schreiner (1974) reports that natural hybridization has been reported between almost all sympatric poplar species and between introduced exotics and native poplars both in the United States and Europe.
Natural and artificial intraspecific and interspecific hybridization is common and heterosis is frequently observed and exploited to achieve enormous gains in yield (Douglas, 1989).
Diploids (2n = 38) as well as monoploids, triploids, and tetraploids are known (Einspahr and Winton, 1977).
Pollination and propagation- Poplars are generally dioecious trees (only rarely are staminate and pistillate flowers on the same tree, or the flowers perfect).
Flowers are in pendulous, anemophilous (wind-pollinated) catkins.
The seeds are small and comose (bearing a tuft or tufts of hair) making them wind borne (Hutchinson, 1968).
Minimum seed-bearing age is 5-20 years (Schreiner, 1974).
Poplars naturally reproduce from suckers, root sprouts, and other vegetative plant parts that readily root in soil (Einspahr and Winton, 1977).
Regular scarification of soil cuts the roots near the surface and induces suckers.
Artificial vegetative reproduction is easily accomplished by hardwood cuttings (Everett, 1981) and most cultivars of commercial value are propagated vegetatively from ripened wood of the stem.
Populus species are relatively easy to regenerate from tissue culture; however, a wide range of morphological variation has been reported in regenerants from tissue culture (Douglas, 1989); therefore, regenerants are generally examined for variation from normal reproductive biology.
Confinement Considerations
In transgenic poplars, genes can easily escape by windborne pollen and seed, or by vegetative means.
Because of this, and the wide distribution of sexually compatible species within the U.S., steps must be taken to prevent gene flow and persistence of plants in the environment by these methods in order to perform field trials under notification.
A wide range of poplar nursery practices for pollination, fertilization, and cloning have been developed over decades (Schreiner, 1959).
After trees reach reproductive maturity, some means to either prevent flowering, remove flowers, or prohibit pollen shedding must be made to preclude gene escape to other sexually compatible poplars in the general area.
Some means must also be taken to prevent seed set or to restrict shedding of the seeds.
Finally, steps must also be taken to prevent movement of vegetative parts out of the site, and to destroy any vegetative parts, both above ground and below ground, which may remain after the test is complete.
For example, transgenic poplars could be cut down and the vegetative material killed by a broad spectrum herbicide prior to flowering.
The remaining stumps and root systems could be treated with an appropriate herbicide.
The dead tree stumps could be removed from the test site and along with any plant stems, roots, and suckers removed from the site for analysis, these could be killed by high temperature treatment (autoclaving, oven baking, or incineration).
Following removal of transgenic plant material, the test site could be treated with an appropriate herbicide and cultivated to control any volunteers prior to flowering in subsequent seasons.
Use of transgenic poplars beyond the field testing stage is likely to require additional information about the behavior of the new varieties and their interactions with wild and/or weedy relatives.
For certain experiments designed to investigate these parameters, it may be appropriate to perform field trials under permit.

2 Cultivated species that have been the subject of field trials under APHIS permit or notification are underlined.
Wild relatives that have been recognized as weeds (i.e., unwanted species in agricultural or natural habitats) are also underlined.
This is not an exhaustive list, especially with regard to commercially important grasses and woody species, which often occur in unmanaged populations.
Also, for many cultivars the extent of hybridization with wild relatives has not been studied.
