The burden of cancer is determined by many measures, including the number of cases each year (incidence), the number of deaths, survival rates, and probabilities (the chance of being diagnosed or dying from cancer).
For most of the 20th century, cancer incidence rates and death rates had been increasing, but early in the 1990s, these rates have reached a turning point.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has published a 25-year survey of cancer mortality rates, cancer-by-cancer, for all 3,000 U.S. counties.
The Burden of Cancer [cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
o Almost 44 percent of U.S. men and 38 percent of U.S. women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.
o In 1999, about 563,100 people are expected to die from cancer; 291,100 men and 272,000 women.
o Cancer is the second most frequent cause of death in the United States, causing 23.3 percent of all deaths - up from 17.7 percent in 1973.
Almost 24 percent of men and 21 percent of women will die from cancer.
o People who die from cancer lose an average of 15 years of their life.
o The number of cancer survivors is growing.
About 8.37 million people in the United States are living with cancer - more than 3.4 million men and 4.9 million women.
This includes people who have been recently diagnosed and are undergoing treatment, as well as those who have completed treatment.
o The medical cost of treating cancer is estimated to be about $37 billion per year.
[cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
Cancer rates overall reached a peak in the early 1990s - after steadily increasing since 1950, when reliable statistics became available - and are now declining.
Focusing on incidence rates from 1992 to 1996 shows the progress being achieved.
All Cancers Combined
From 1950 to 1990, the incidence rate for all cancers rose more than 45 percent and the death rate rose 10 percent.
From 1992 to 1996 incidence rates dropped 6.4 percent and death rates dropped 2.4 percent.
Overall five-year survival rates for cancer have increased from 35 percent in 1950 to 1954 to almost 60 percent in 1989 to 1995.
Most of the decline in cancer death rates can be attributed to decreases in deaths from lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers.
Major Sites
o Lung cancer Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer in men and women, with 94,000 new cases expected in men this year and 77,600 cases in women.
Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death causing 90,900 deaths in men and 68,000 deaths in women each year.
Decreases in the rates of incidence of lung cancer and deaths from the disease are due to the overall decreased rate of smoking over the past 30 years - fewer than 25 percent of adults now smoke compared to 42 percent in 1965.
However, men are giving up smoking more quickly than women, who also began smoking later.
Declines in lung cancer rates for women will depend on them giving up the smoking habit.
From 1950 to 1990, lung cancer incidence tripled in men and increased fivefold in women, but from 1992 to 1996, lung cancer incidence dropped 6.1 percent overall, mainly due to a 10 percent decline in rates for men.
Women's lung cancer incidence rates declined less than 1 percent.
From 1950 to 1990, lung cancer death rates increased exactly as incidence increased for both sexes.
From 1992 to 1996, lung cancer death rates dropped 1.9 percent overall, but the decline is due to the 5.3 percent drop in men's rates.
The rate of dying from lung cancer actually increased 2.9 percent for women between 1992 and 1996.
Five-year survival rates for lung cancer have increased from 5 percent to 12.4 percent for men and from 9 percent to 16.1 percent for women from 1950 to 1995.
o Breast cancer Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer in women (over 175,000 cases each year) and the second most common cause of cancer death (43,300 deaths per year).
Between 1950 and 1990, breast cancer incidence rates increased 52.3 percent - although incidence rates have leveled off overall from 1992 to 1996.
For women younger than age 50, incidence declined 0.8 percent.
Both Black and White women under age 50 have a declining incidence rate.
For women 50 and older, the incidence rate in White women increased 1.6 percent and the incidence rate for Black women increased 1.2 percent.
From 1950 to 1990, breast cancer death rates increased 4 percent, but have dropped almost 5 percent since 1992.
For women younger than 50, the death rate has dropped 5.7 percent and for women 50 and older the death rate has declined 4.5 percent.
These reductions were mainly for White women and for Black women under age 50.
Black women age 50 and older had a 0.5 percent increase in breast cancer death rate from 1992 to 1996.
The widespread incorporation of breast cancer screening into routine medical care and the increased use of adjuvant treatments may account for the overall decreased rate of death.
The five-year relative survival rate for breast cancer has increased from 60 percent in 1950 to 84.7 percent in 1995.
o Prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer in men (estimated 179,300 cases each year) and is the second most common cause of cancer death (estimated 37,000 deaths per year).
Changes in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer are likely due to several interacting factors.
From 1950 to 1990, the prostate cancer incidence rate more than doubled, but showed a sharp turnaround from 1992 to 1996 and decreased 24 percent over 26 percent for White men and almost 19 percent for Black men.
The sudden use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in the late 1980s and early 1990s caused an increase in diagnoses of previously undetected cancers.
From 1950 to 1990, the prostate cancer death rate increased 17.8 percent but decreased 7.5 percent overall and 8 percent for White men from 1992 to 1996.
Black men had a 4.1 percent decline in prostate cancer death rates in this time period.
The five-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer increased from 43 percent in 1950 to almost 92 percent in 1995 due mainly to cases diagnosed by PSA.
o Colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer.
It is the second most common cause of cancer death for men and women.
About 62,400 men and 67,000 women will be diagnosed with the disease this year and 27,800 men and 28,800 women will die from it.
The cause of the declining colorectal cancer rates are not well understood.
The use of fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy screening tests is low, signaling that factors other than screening tests are at play.
Increased removal of polyps (which often become cancerous), better treatments, and other factors may be contributing.
From 1950 to 1990, the incidence rate for colorectal cancer increased 9.9 percent, and has dropped 6.6 percent from 1992 to 1996.
Men had a slightly faster decline than women, dropping 8.4 percent compared to 5.1 percent for women.
For Blacks, the colorectal cancer incidence rate dropped 14.8 percent in men and 4.6 percent in women.
From 1950 to 1990, the death rate for colorectal cancer decreased 28.2 percent and from 1992 to 1996, death rates from colorectal cancer have declined 4.9 percent overall.
Rates for White men and women mirror the overall numbers, but rates for Blacks do not.
Black men saw a slight decrease in deaths from colorectal cancer - 1.5 percent - although this signals a slowdown in increasing rates since 1973.
Black women also had a small drop in their colorectal cancer death rate - down 1.6 percent from 1992 to 1996.
The five-year relative survival rate for colorectal cancer increased from 37 percent in 1950 to63 percent in 1995.
Problem Areas
Although overall cancer rates are declining, led by declines in cancer rates of the major cancers above, rates of two major cancers - melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - are still rising.
Since 1950, melanoma incidence rates increased fivefold and mortality rates more than doubled.
More recently, from 1992 to 1996 incidence rates climbed 9.9 percent and mortality rates have increased slightly (1 percent).
Among the strongest risk factors for melanoma is a history of sunburns, which are preventable.
More than 44,200 cases of melanoma are diagnosed each year and 7,300 people die of the disease.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence rates nearly tripled between 1950 and 1995 and its death rate more than doubled.
About 56,800 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma each year and 25,700 die of the disease.
Only part of the increase in rates is due to AIDS.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about 60 times more common in AIDS patients than the general population.
Researchers are looking at other possible causes.
Basal and squamous cell skin cancers account for 1 million diagnoses of cancer each year.

Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed nonskin cancer among women in the United States and second only to lung cancer in causing cancer-related deaths among women.
The vast majority (99 percent) of breast cancers occur in women.
Estimated new cases, 2001: 192,200 in women
Estimated deaths, 2001: 40,200 in women Trends, 1990-1997: * change in new cases annually: 0.4 percent * change in deaths annually: -2.1 percent
Five-year survival, 1989-1996: * all stages: 85.0 percent * localized: 96.5 percent * regional: 77.0 percent * distant: 21.4 percent
Breast cancer is largely a disease of aging.
Much more research is needed to pinpoint breast cancer's causes, create better treatments, reduce the number of women who get the disease, and increase the likelihood of survival for those who do get it.

Although most cases of breast cancer cannot be attributed to a specific cause, recent research has found contributing factors: [cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age.
The majority of breast cancer cases occurs in women older than age 50.
o Breast cancer among first-degree relatives (sisters, mother, daughters).
Having one or more first-degree blood relatives who have been diagnosed with breast cancer increases a woman's chances of developing this disease.
o Age at menarche (first menstrual period).
Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer.
o Age at first live birth.
Women who had their first full-term pregnancy after age 30 and women who have never borne a child have a greater risk of developing breast cancer.
o Breast biopsies.
These women may be at increased risk because of whatever prompted the biopsies, not because of the biopsies themselves.
Women who have needed breast biopsies have an increased risk of breast cancer, especially if the biopsy showed a change in breast tissue known as atypical hyperplasia.
o Race.
White women have greater risk of developing breast cancer than Black women.
Although Black women diagnosed with breast cancer are more likely to die of the disease.
o Personal history of breast abnormalities.
Two breast tissue abnormalities - ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) - are associated with increased risk for developing an invasive breast cancer.
o Genes.
An estimated 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancers can be attributed to genetic factors.
Genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in about 3 percent or 4 percent of breast cancer cases.
Other breast cancer-related genes may yet be discovered.
Breast Cancer (Prevention)
Until recently, there was no proven way to prevent breast cancer.
In 1998, the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial showed a 49 percent reduction in breast cancer among the high-risk women who took the drug tamoxifen, compared with participants who took a placebo (an inactive pill that looked like tamoxifen).
The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored research network, conducted the trial throughout the United States and Canada.
This trial enrolled more than 13,000 premenopausal and postmenopausal women considered to be at increased risk for breast cancer.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tamoxifen to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women in October 1998.
Tamoxifen does have side effects, the most serious of which are an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer and an increased risk of blood clots.
For this reason, researchers have developed a new clinical trial that will compare tamoxifen's effectiveness in reducing risk for breast cancer with that of the osteoporosis prevention drug raloxifene.
Early studies have suggested that raloxifene may have the preventive benefits of tamoxifen with fewer side effects.
The Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) has already enrolled more than 7,000 postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer, nearly a third of the way toward its goal of 22,000 total participants.
The trial is designed to determine whether raloxifene is as effective in reducing the chance of developing breast cancer as tamoxifen has proven to be.
NCI and NSABP researchers have also developed the "risk disk," a computer-based breast cancer risk assessment tool.
It allows health professionals and others to estimate a woman's breast cancer risk based on known risk factors (the first seven listed above).
The disk will help women and their doctors decide whether taking tamoxifen may be appropriate treatment.
Preventive or prophylactic mastectomy may also prevent breast cancer.
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., found that, in women at high risk of breast cancer, a history of preventive mastectomy of both breasts was associated with a 90 percent to 95 percent reduction in the incidence of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer (Screening and Early Detection)
Mammography screening has been shown to decrease breast cancer mortality.
NCI recommends that women age 40 and older receive a mammogram every 1 to 2 years.
NCI is also supporting research to improve methods to screen for and detect breast cancer.
High-quality mammography, an X-ray technique that visualizes the internal structure of the breast, is the most effective early detection technology currently available.
However, it is not foolproof.
For example, this technique may miss up to 25 percent of breast tumors in women in their forties, and about 10 percent in women over age 50.
New imaging methods are under study to improve on this technology while reducing unnecessary biopsies.
Digital mammography may offer better resolution, and the NCI is now supporting efforts to develop and test this technology.
MRI and ultrasound may improve the sensitivity of breast cancer detection and staging without using X-rays.
Image-guided, needle breast biopsy, also called stereotactic biopsy, is being studied as an alternative to the more invasive surgical biopsies (80 percent of U.S. women who undergo surgical breast biopsies do not have cancer).
By using a computer-guided needle, stereotactic biopsy also removes less tissue than does surgical biopsy.
A multi-institutional research program is now testing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of needle biopsies compared with more extensive surgical biopsies.
Molecular markers are being developed to detect signs of breast cancer in blood, urine, or nipple fluid.
These markers could work as noninvasive tools to profile breast cancers, helping women and their doctors choose the most appropriate treatments.
Breast Cancer (Treatment)
Breast-conserving therapy lumpectomy (removal of the tumor and a small amount of surrounding tissue) plus radiation therapy has replaced mastectomies for many women with early stage breast cancer.
This therapy yields survival rates similar to those for radical mastectomy.
For breast cancer that has spread locally, women are commonly treated with chemotherapy first (called preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy).
Preoperative chemotherapy is also being studied for its role in early stage breast cancer: by shrinking the tumor before surgery, the treatment may allow more women to choose breast-conserving therapy over mastectomy.
Doctors used to routinely remove extensive networks of lymph nodes near breast tumors to see if the cancer had spread.
A method under study called sentinel node biopsy may soon offer less invasive diagnosis.
Using a dye or radioactive tracer, doctors locate the first or "sentinel" lymph node closest to the tumor, and remove only that node to see if the cancer has spread.
Currently, NCI-sponsored clinical trials are comparing this procedure to the more radical removal of all regional lymph nodes.
Researchers are also investigating better ways of treating women with breast cancer that has spread regionally or even throughout the body.
Clinical trials are investigating a combination treatment of high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplants.
"Autologous" means that the patient donates some of their own cells before the chemotherapy is given.
These cells are specially treated and then replaced after the high-dose therapy.
Researchers hope that this combination will be more effective than standard treatments, but this approach is not yet proven.
In fact, a few clinical trials have shown that this procedure provides no significant survival benefit.
However, further testing is necessary before researchers can make a final judgment.
Trastuzumab (HerceptinÃ¯Â¿Â½) is a monoclonal antibody that targets cancer cells that produce too much of a protein called Her2.
This protein is overexpressed in 25 percent to 30 percent of women with metastatic breast cancer.
HerceptinÃ¯Â¿Â½ was approved by the FDA in October 1998 for use in women with advanced cancer that expresses Her2.
The drug's success in advanced Her2-positive cancers raised hopes that it would prove at least as effective if used immediately after surgery in earlier-stage disease.
Now, two large clinical trials have been launched that will evaluate the use of HerceptionÃ¯Â¿Â½ in breast cancer patients who do not have metastatic disease.
These NCI-sponsored trials are taking place at multiple sites in the United States and Canada.
A test that identifies patients who could benefit from HerceptinÃ¯Â¿Â½ has also been recommended for approval.
Other more general findings about cancer treatments may also help people with breast cancer.
Findings from a clinical trial conducted by The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), a large cooperative group of researchers, show that the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel combined with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin benefits patients with metastatic tumors.
This cocktail improves overall survival as well as disease-free survival.
It may someday prove useful for postsurgical treatment of some women with localized breast cancer.
Advanced genetic and cellular therapy is also in the research pipeline.
A genetically engineered virus is being developed to target cells with a dysfunctional gene called p53, which helps control cell division.
About 50 percent of all cancer cells harbor the dysfunctional p53 gene.
Because proteins called mucins are often overexpressed on tumor cells, researchers are developing modified mucins that may elicit an immune response that kills cancer cells.
Although exciting, this work is still years away from standard clinical use.
Childhood Cancers
Although cancer in children is rare, it is still the leading cause of nonaccidental death in children between the ages of 1 and 19 in the United States.
It is responsible for 8 percent of deaths in this age group, and it is also the leading cause of death from disease at these ages.
Since the 1970s, overall death rates for most childhood cancers have declined and survival rates have improved markedly.
For example, the 5-year relative survival rate for children and teenagers diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) between 1974 and 1976 was 49.3 percent.
By the 1989-1996 time period, that number had climbed to 78.7 percent.
Similarly, the five-year survival rate for non-Hodgkins lymphoma climbed from 43.3 in 1974-1976 to 74 percent in 1989-1996.
The incidence rate for all childhood cancers combined (that is, the number of cases that occurred) increased from the early 1970s -- when rates were first measured by NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program -- until 1991, and then leveled off and declined slightly through 1996.
About 30 percent of cancers in children are leukemias (blood cell cancers), with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) being most common.
Nearly 20 percent are brain and other central nervous system tumors, such as gliomas and medulloblastomas.
Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas account for about 10 percent to 15 percent of childhood cancer cases.
Estimated new cases, 2001: 8,600
Estimated deaths, 2001: 1,500
Trends, 1985-1997: (estimated annual percentage change) * change in incidence: 0.0 percent each year * change in mortality: -2.3 percent each year
Five-year survival, 1989-1996: * All sites: 75.7% * Acute lymphocytic leukemia: 78.7% * Brain/other nervous system: 66.4% * Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: 74.0% * Hodgkin's lymphoma: 93.4% * Neuroblastoma: 69.2% * Soft-tissue: 70.7% * Wilms' tumor: 92.9% * Bone and joint: 66.4%
Other childhood tumors include neuroblastomas (8%), which develop from nervous system tissue and commonly occur in the abdomen; rhabdomyosarcoma (7%), a soft tissue tumor of muscle that may occur in various places in the body; Wilms tumor in the kidney (6.4%); and bone cancers (5%).
High levels of ionizing radiation, such as the use of X-rays during pregnancy, have been linked with one or more childhood cancers.
Chromosome disorders account for 80 percent to 90 percent of acute leukemias and for an unknown, but probably smaller number, of other childhood cancers.
There is little evidence that electronic magnetic fields from power lines and household appliances cause childhood cancers.
Other possible risk factors include parents' diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption before the child was conceived, as well as infectious disease agents, such as the Epstein-Barr virus in Hodgkin's disease.
In most cases, however, doctors can't explain exactly why certain children develop cancer and others don't.
Childhood Cancers (Prevention, Screening, and Early Detection)
Because the causes of most childhood cancers remain unknown, researchers have no specific recommendations about prevention.
Some have proposed that we try to screen for neuroblastoma, because the tumors secrete certain substances that can be found in the urine.
However, screening does not appear to decrease the numbers of deaths from the disease, and it tends to produce many false positives.
Researchers looking at chromosomal and genetic disorders that cause some childhood cancers are working toward diagnostic technologies that rely on genetics.
In other words, gene testing might be able to show whether someone is likely to develop a certain form of cancer.
However, much more work must be done before these advanced methods are reliable enough for clinical use.
For now, we can only watch children carefully when they have a parent or sibling who has had a form of childhood cancer.
For example, retinoblastoma (a cancer of the eye) sometimes runs in families.
Children with a family history may be at higher risk for developing it, and they should be followed closely for any signs of the disease.
Childhood Cancers (Treatment)
Progress in treating childhood cancers had been the direct result of clinical trials that enroll children.
For many years, the NCI has supported a nationwide clinical research infrastructure that focuses exclusively on children; it is devoted to conducting large-scale clinical trials to identify more effective treatments for children with cancer.
This involves hundreds of researchers from the United States and around the world who have joined forces through two large cooperative research groups, the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group.
The NCI also recently formed the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, a network of medical centers that will work together to evaluate promising treatments for children with brain tumors.
Furthermore, the NCI's own Pediatric Oncology Branch conducts Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for children whose cancer has recurred or has not responded to therapy.
Much of the progress in treating childhood leukemia and lymphomas has come from step by-step refinements in chemotherapy, including the development of intensive multidrug treatments.
For example, about 20 percent of children with ALL also have certain characteristics that mark them at high risk for recurrence of disease.
A recent clinical trial used a modified chemotherapy regimen to try to improve treatment for children prone to such high ALL recurrence.
Results of this trial showed a 70 percent drop in the rate of treatment failure in a group of high-risk ALL children under age 10.
Using the new regimen, 5-year event-free survival rates have climbed to 84 percent for ALL children at high risk for recurrent disease.
Researchers are now evaluating the effectiveness of giving very high doses of chemotherapy, followed by bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, to treat children's cancer.
The high doses of chemotherapy, which are designed to knock out the cancer, also destroy bone marrow and blood cells.
Basically, doctors then need to replace the bone marrow or blood cells that were destroyed.
For example, one recent study found that, for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous bone marrow transplantation was a better treatment than conventional chemotherapy.
"Autologous" means that the child is his or her own marrow donor; doctors use a special process to "cleanse" the marrow before returning it to the body.
The researchers found that this procedure improved the children's 3-year, event-free survival from 18 percent to 34 percent.
Many researchers are also looking into new and better bone marrow transplant strategies.
For example, some studies are evaluating the merits of various sources of bone marrow, such as sibling donors, unrelated donors, and the patients themselves.
Better donor matching techniques, which provide a wider range of possible donors, have also recently been reported in medical journals.
New drugs under study for childhood solid tumors include topotecan, phenylacetate, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.
One drug for neuroblastoma, a vitamin A derivative called 13-cis retinoic acid, recently showed promise when added to standard chemotherapy.
One study found that 47 percent of children who received the drug were event-free after 3 years, versus 25 percent of those who did not.
Researchers are also studying new substances that may help chemotherapy drugs cross the blood-brain barrier.
This "barrier" is the body's way of keeping harmful substances out of the nervous system; however, it also keeps out chemotherapy drugs that are needed to treat brain tumors.
Researchers are also looking at ways of harnessing children's own immune systems against cancer.
Some clinical trials are looking at ways of using proteins that signal the immune system into action, such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1.
Several monoclonal antibodies, which may also boost immune response, are under study for treatment of neuroblastoma and other solid tumors.
Radiation therapy has increased survival rates for brain cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma, but it can cause later problems with thinking skills as well as mental and physical development.
Many trials are now looking at alternative strategies, such as giving lower doses of radiation, using chemotherapy in place of radiation, and putting off radiation in infants and babies.
In fact, long-term side effects of cancer treatments are a concern for many childhood cancer survivors.
Specific research projects are now focusing on topics such as heart function following chemotherapy and radiation therapy, quality of life following bone marrow transplantation, and genetic and treatment-related risk factors for second cancers.
Also, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), an NCI-funded multi-institution project, is designed to help give physicians the information they need to understand and possibly prevent the later effects of cancer treatment.
The largest study of its kind ever undertaken, the CCSS is being conducted in 26 institutions in the United States and Canada and incorporates interviews from more than 20,000 individuals diagnosed with cancer prior to age 21.
Colorectal Cancers
Cancers of the colon and rectum are the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the third most frequently diagnosed cancers in men (after lung and prostate cancer) and women (after lung and breast).
The general population faces a lifetime risk of about 5 percent for developing the disease, while someone with a family
Estimated new cases, 2001: 135,400 Estimated deaths, 2001: 56,700 Trends, 1990-1997: * annual change in new cases: -1.7 percent * annual change in deaths: -1.8 percent
Five-year survival, 1989-1996: * all stages: 61.3 percent * localized: 90.0 percent * regional: 65.0 percent * distant: 8.3 percent
history of colorectal cancers has a 10 to 15 percent chance of developing the disease.
This risk rises to over 50 percent in people with ulcerative colitis and those whose family members harbor certain genetic mutations.
Researchers have identified two syndromes that demonstrate a clear link between family history and colorectal cancer: (1) Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare, inherited condition that leads to the development of hundreds or thousands of adenomatous (originating in the glands) polyps in the colon and rectum, usually at a young age, which are precursors of cancer.
(2) Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a condition in which people tend to develop colorectal cancer at a young age, without first having many polyps.
In general, however, colorectal cancers are rare in young people; the median age at diagnosis is 70 for men and 73 for women.
And most cases are not linked to these well-defined familial syndromes.
Studies have suggested that lifestyle factors, especially diet, contribute to colorectal cancers.
High-fat, low-fiber diets may increase risk, while exercise and vegetable consumption may decrease it.
(Two recent studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine actually found that a low-fat, high-fiber diet does not prevent the recurrence of colon polyps, growths that can turn into colon cancer.
However, earlier studies did observe that people who eat large amounts of fruits and vegetables [which are high in fiber] are less likely to develop colon and rectal cancer.
Clearly, then, more studies on this topic need to be done.)
Researchers have identified genetic mutations, or abnormal changes, that may be linked to the development of colon cancer.
They are working to untangle the precise mechanisms of these genetic changes.
Colorectal Cancers (Prevention)
Scientists continue to pursue leads on how certain foods may lead to colorectal cancer and how other foods may help to prevent it.
They are also investigating chemoprevention, which is the use of certain drugs to prevent cancer from developing in the first place.
For example, a class of drugs called COX-2 inhibitors, which were found to help prevent the formation of intestinal tumors in rats, are now being evaluated in people.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce the formation of large bowel polyps, which are a precursor for some colon cancers.
Colorectal Cancers (Screening and Early Detection)
Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which use lighted instruments to look inside the intestine, simplify the removal of abnormal growths (polyps) before they turn cancerous.
Colonoscopy allows a physician to view the entire colon through a special device called an endoscope, while sigmoidoscopy shows only the more easily reached sigmoid, or left-hand section of the colon.
The impact of both tests on reducing deaths is under study.
Two studies reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (July 20, 2000) showed that colonoscopy can detect a substantial number of precancerous polyps that sigmoidoscopy misses.
However, additional studies are needed to determine whether colonoscopy can actually reduce mortality rates.
Another screening practice, annual fecal occult blood tests, can identify candidates for further testing.
This test involves analyzing a stool sample for traces of blood.
Researchers are in the process of developing virtual colonoscopy, in which doctors employ 3-D computer graphics from computerized tomography (CT) scan images to view the entire colon.
This technology may reduce the need for sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies.
The NCI's PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial will also provide additional important information about whether sigmoidoscopy can reduce deaths from colon and rectal cancers.
The large-scale, long-term clinical trial, which involves 148,000 volunteers aged 55 to 74 at ten sites nationwide, is screening half of the participants (the test group) for colon cancer.
This group will be screened again three years later.
During a ten-year follow-up period, researchers plan to compare the test group with the control group (those who do not receive screening) to see if the number of colorectal cancer deaths is less in the test group.
Genetic screening of people at high risk may become more common in the near future as genes involved in colorectal cancer continue to be identified and understood.
The discovery of four genes involved in HNPCC provides crucial clues to the role of DNA repair in the development of colon and other cancers.
Genes for other familial colon cancers continue to be identified.
Using traditional screening methods on people from families that carry these genes may also be a way to identify cancers at an early stage and cut colorectal cancer deaths.
Colorectal Cancers (Treatment)
Researchers have found that a drug called camptothecin-11, when used with standard chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, improves the outcome.
Scientists are also working on new vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that may improve how patients' immune systems respond to colorectal cancers.
COX-2 inhibitors, which are being looked at as preventive agents, are also under study as a possible treatment for colorectal cancers.
New surgical techniques have significantly reduced the number of colorectal cancer patients who need to have a permanent colostomy, which is an opening made in the abdomen for feces to pass out of the body (essentially "bypassing" the colon or rectum).
In many cases, the colon can be resected or rejoined after the cancerous portion is removed, functioning just as it did before.
For more information about colon and rectal cancer clinical trials, visit the colorectal cancer section of the NCI's cancerTrials Web site.

Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the single largest cause of cancer deaths in the United States.
Hard to detect and treat, it is responsible for about 28 percent of cancer deaths in this country.
New treatments have improved one-year survival rates from 32 percent in 1973 to 41 percent in the 1990s.
However, five-year survival rates have risen only slightly from about 11 percent in 1973 to about 14 percent in the 1990s.
Estimated new cases, 2001: 90,700
Estimated deaths, 2001: 90,100
Trends: 1990-1997 * annual change in new cases: 0.4 percent * annual change in deaths: -0.5 percent
Five-year survival: 1989-1996 * all stages: 14.1 percent * localized: 48.5 percent * regional: 20.3 percent * distant: 2.3 percent
One promising development in lung cancer in recent years is the drop among men in incidence (the number of new cases diagnosed) and mortality (the number of deaths) rates.
With sharp declines in male smoking, lung cancer incidence rates for men have fallen steadily since 1984, and since 1992, so have mortality rates.
However, this is not the case for women.
Sadly, both lung cancer incidence and mortality rates continue to rise among women.
In 1987, lung cancer surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women, and the death rate in women increased an average of 1.2 percent per year between 1990 and 1997.
Cigarette smoking is the single largest risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for about 87 percent of cases each year.
The risk of dying from lung cancer is 23 times higher for men who smoke and 13 times higher for women who smoke than for people who have never smoked.
Quitting reduces the risk, but slowly; ten years after the last cigarette, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by 50 percent.
Environmental tobacco smoke, also called secondhand smoke, appears to increase the risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers.
Though sometimes controversial, this conclusion is backed by about 40 epidemiological studies (that is, studies of the disease in human populations), as well as laboratory work that shows secondhand smoke to be very similar to mainstream smoke..
Each year, about 3,000 nonsmoking adults die of lung cancer as a result of breathing secondhand smoke.
Exposure to substances like asbestos and radon account for many of the remaining cases.
Lung Cancer (Prevention)
Most prevention efforts focus on smoking education and cessation programs, which have helped cut tobacco use.
About 42 percent of adults in the United States smoked cigarettes in 1965, compared with about 25 percent in 1997.
Unfortunately, smoking rates have ceased to decline in recent years, and smoking by young adults actually has increased by 73 percent over the past decade.
Many smoking education programs now focus on reversing the increase in the number of women and young people who smoke.
Trials are assessing the effectiveness of certain agents in preventing second cancers in patients who have had early-stage lung cancer.
Delivery of preventive agents directly to the lungs through an aerosol spray is under investigation, as is a vaccine for nicotine addiction.
Common use of these treatments may be years away, however.
Potential preventive agents under study include 13-cis retinoic acid (CRA or isotretinoin) and retinyl palmitate, both vitamin A derivatives.
Another drug, N-acetylcysteine, which is used to treat cystic fibrosis, is being evaluated as a lung cancer preventive agent in a trial in Europe.
Lung Cancer (Screening and Early Detection)
The PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial is testing the effectiveness of regular chest X-rays, a commonly used lung cancer screening tool.
Since less than a third of lung cancer cases detected by chest X-ray are found at a potentially curable stage, additional research to identify better detection technologies is ongoing.
One screening method that shows promise is spiral computerized tomography (spiral CT), which can scan the lungs from the neck to the diaphragm in less than 20 seconds-a single breath-hold.
Preliminary studies of spiral CT have shown its promise in detecting small cancers.
The NCI is funding clinical trials to determine the size and types of abnormalities that spiral CT can detect.
Since many lesions detected with this technology may not be malignant, researchers are also considering how they will evaluate any abnormalities found (in order to avoid any unnecessary invasive and potentially dangerous biopsy procedures such as lung surgery).
Two technologies may prove useful in this regard: high-resolution CT, which helps to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous tissue, and positron-emission tomography (PET), which shows the differing uptake of radioactive isotope "tracers" in benign growths and malignant tumors.
Other diagnostic techniques are under investigation.
With the advent of new technologies that detect molecular and genetic alterations in cells, there is renewed interest in the use of sputum samples to detect precancerous conditions or cancer.
For instance, researchers are exploring the usefulness of a protein called heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein A2/B1, which may serve as a marker of precancerous changes in the lung.
Other potential sputum markers include alterations in the p53 gene and deletions on chromosomes 3, 9, and 21.
Researchers have recently identified several genes that apparently play a role in nicotine addiction.
Some of these genes control how quickly nicotine is metabolized; others determine the structure of the brain's nicotine receptors.
Future screening efforts may use these genes to identify who is at high risk for smoking.
Intervention resources could then be channeled to high-risk groups.
Lung Cancer (Treatment)
Researchers continue to assess various combinations and schedules of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation for different types and stages of lung cancer.
For instance, in one large study, combining radiation and chemotherapy concurrently was shown to increase five-year survival from about 6 percent to 16 percent in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer that had spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.
Another study showed that chemotherapy plus twice-daily radiation therapy led to better survival rates than chemotherapy plus once-daily radiation in some people with small-cell lung cancer.
The survival rates for patients receiving once-daily treatment were 41 percent at two years and 16 percent at five years.
For patients receiving twice-daily radiotherapy, the survival rates were 47 percent at two years and 26 percent at five years.
Other combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are being studied.
New chemotherapy drugs, such as vinorelbine (Navelbine), paclitaxel (Taxol) docetaxel (Taxotere), gemcitabine (Gemzar), topotecan (Hycamtin), and irinotecan (Camptos) have produced improved response rates in tests of each drug alone.
Various combinations of the new drugs with traditional agents, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, are now in clinical trials.
New ways to schedule and deliver radiation therapy are under study.
In computer-driven or conformal radiotherapy, for instance, the beam conforms precisely to the area of the tumor and avoids surrounding tissue.
Brachytherapy, also under study, delivers radiation directly to the tumor through the implantation of radioactive pellets.
These techniques have the advantage of reducing damage to surrounding normal tissues.
_________________________________________________________________
Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in American men.
Between 1950 and 1997, the age-adjusted rate of new cases of prostate cancer more than doubled, probably owing to more widespread screening for the disease.
(Age-adjusted rates show what the level of incidence would be if there were no differences in the age composition of the population from year to year.)
The rate has recently begun to decline.
Estimated new cases, 2001: 198,100
Estimated deaths, 2001: 31,500
Trends: 1990-1997 * annual change in new cases: -2.1 percent * annual change in deaths: -2.2 percent
Five-year survival: 1989-1996 * all stages: 93.1 percent * localized/regional: 100.0 percent * distant: 32.6 percent
Along with the rise and subsequent fall in the rate of prostate cancer diagnoses, there has been a rise and fall in prostate cancer death rates.
The reasons for the decline through the 1990s are unclear.
Such factors as more effective treatments and screening methods offer a possible explanation.
Research is ongoing to help explain the changing rates in recent years.
Prostate cancer is still the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in men, behind lung cancer.
Age is the most important and best-studied risk factor for prostate cancer.
The disease is extremely rare in men under age 40, but risk increases greatly with age.
More than 75 percent of cases are diagnosed in men over age 65.
Race is another major risk factor.
African-Americans and black Jamaican men have the highest rate of prostate cancer in the world, while Asian men have the lowest.
African-American men have more than one-third higher incidence rate and over 50 percent higher mortality rate for the disease than white men.
Genetic, dietary, and socioeconomic differences may explain these different rates.
Solving this mystery promises to lead to better ways to prevent prostate cancer.
Having a father or brother with the disease increases a man's risk two to three-fold, and other genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility to the disease, especially in younger men.
Prostate Cancer (Prevention)
Few potentially controllable risk factors have been pinpointed for prostate cancer.
Dietary fat, especially saturated fat, may be associated with an increased risk for prostate tumors.
And there is evidence that vitamins D and E, selenium, and soybean extracts called isoflavonoids may be protective.
Lycopene, an anti-oxidant found primarily in tomatoes, also may be associated with decreased risk.
Like many cancers, prostate malignancies are influenced by hormones, in this case the male hormone testosterone.
Drugs that block testosterone are a mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer, especially in its early stages.
It is possible that these drugs, called androgen blockers, may also protect against prostate cancer.
Research into genes responsible for testosterone metabolism may soon lead to new prevention drugs while also helping to explain racial differences in prostate cancer rates.
In the NCI's ongoing Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), 18,000 healthy men age 55 or older are taking either finasteride (currently used to shrink the prostate in men who have a noncancerous condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia) or a placebo every day for seven to ten years.
Smaller clinical trials are testing a variety of other medications and chemicals for their ability to prevent prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer (Screening and Early Detection)
Tests for biological markers that indicate the presence of early-stage prostate tumors are constantly being refined.
The best-known of these, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, is still being evaluated, as are new markers that are not yet commercially available.
Because current screening methods diagnose some men who do not need treatment, many doctors are still not certain if screening is effective in saving lives.
(Many prostate tumors remain confined to the prostate, progress very slowly, and may never need to be treated.)
An ongoing NCI screening study called the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial will help scientists determine whether screening with digital rectal examination (DRE) plus PSA testing can reduce the death rate from prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 74.
Also, researchers are studying a broad array of markers to find those that will tell which tumors have undergone the full set of genetic and biochemical changes that lead to metastasis, or cancer spread, and perhaps predict a man's response to treatment.
Several years ago, scientists confirmed that a gene located on chromosome 1 may be responsible for 5 to 10 percent of all prostate cancers.
The specific gene has not been identified yet.
More work in this area continues, and it may yield advanced genetic screening tests that identify men at high, medium, and low risk for the disease.
Prostate Cancer (Treatment)
Some experiments seek to "rewrite" cancer-causing genes, while others aim to boost the body's immune response to cancer cells.
While these new therapies are promising, they are years away from clinical viability (that is, use in large numbers of patients).
_________________________________________________________________
Skin Cancer
Skin cancer, which develops in the top layer of the skin, the epidermis, occurs in several different forms.
Nonmelanoma skin cancers, including squamous cell and basal cell tumors, are the most common but least lethal.
They account for 95 percent of skin cancer cases and 25 percent of deaths.
Melanomas, which are more likely to spread, comprise 5 percent of cases but 75 percent of deaths.
Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer in Whites and is considered to be 99 percent curable.
When detected early, these tumors can be excised with simple outpatient surgery.
Melanoma can also be treated with surgery when caught early.
In later stages, melanoma is often treated with radiation or chemotherapy.
Over the past few decades, the number of melanoma cases in the United States has skyrocketed, particularly among Whites.
Lighter-skinned people are at higher risk.
Skin Cancer (Prevention)
Cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun or artificial sources such as sunlamps and tanning booths is the main cause of skin cancer.
Most skin cancers appear after age 50, but the sun's damage begins at an early age.
Research shows a possible link between severe sunburns and an increased risk for melanoma later in life.
To help prevent skin cancer, it is necessary to minimize exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays by applying sunscreen with solar protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 and avoid excessive exposure when the sun's ultraviolet rays are strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
It also is prudent to wear sunglasses that block both types of ultraviolet rays (UVA and UVB), and protective clothing and hats.
Skin Cancer (Screening and Early Detection)
People with fair complexions and freckles are at increased risk for basal and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as for melanoma.
Those with moles are at increased risk for melanoma.
Basal and squamous cell skin cancers often look like a pale, waxlike, pearly nodule, or a red, scaly, sharply outlined patch.
Melanomas often start as small, mole-like growths that increase in size and change color, which usually starts as black or dark brown.
Signs of melanoma are:
o Asymmetrical spots
o Borders that are uneven or irregular
o Color that is uneven and unusual
o Diameter larger than a quarter inch
These are often called the ABCDs of melanoma.
Skin Cancer (Treatment)
There is a specialized surgery for nonmelanoma skin cancer known as Mohs fresh tissue technique.
The Mohs method offers high cure rates and maximum conservation of normal tissue, limiting the amount of scar tissue.
This is important because many nonmelanoma skin cancers occur on the face, near the eyes, ears, nose, and lips.
Surgeons are also investigating a new procedure to map lymph nodes affected by malignant tumors.
In this procedure, marker molecules are injected around the skin cancer.
The lymph node where the marker molecules first accumulate is called the sentinel node.
After removing this node, a pathologist will be able to determine if the cancer is spreading and if additional nodes need to be removed.
Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being used for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
The patients are injected with low doses of interleukin-2 -- a growth factor made by white blood cells -- to activate the body's immune system.
Then they receive an antibody that binds to specific markers on the outside of melanoma cells.
The goal is to have the patient's activated immune system kill the cancerous cells "marked" by the antibody.
A treatment similar to monoclonal antibody method uses cancer vaccines to treat and prevent melanoma.
Cancer vaccines are highly purified protein and synthetic peptides preparations that mimic tumor markers.
The vaccines are injected in the hopes that they "train" a patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.
Early studies show that patients given melanoma vaccines plus interleukin-2 fare better than those given just the vaccine.
Other clinical trials are looking at the use of lasers and photosensitive drugs to treat skin cancer.
Called photodynamic therapy, patients first receive photosensitive drugs, which are absorbed by malignant cells more quickly than by normal skin cells.
Lasers then home in on the photosensitive cancer cells and destroy them.
Interferon and tumor necrosis factor (another white blood cell growth factor) are being studied to see if, when added to standard chemotherapy, they increase survival time and improve quality of life for skin cancer patients.

Cancer Survivorship
Cancer, once considered incurable, is no longer a certain death sentence.
Since the 1971 National Cancer Act, much of the research into early cancer detection and treatment has paid off.
Mortality rates for most major cancers are declining, and today, more people survive cancer than ever before.
In fact, 8.4 million Americans - nearly one in 30 - are living with a history of cancer.
Recent survivorship milestones include: [cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
o One million men are prostate cancer survivors.
o The five-year survival rate for children with cancer increased from 65 percent in the early 1980s to 74 percent in the early 1990s.
o The five-year survival rate for all cancers increased from 51 percent in the early 1980s to almost 60 percent in the early 1990s.
However, surviving cancer can leave a host of problems in its wake.
Physical, emotional, and financial hardships often persist for years after initial diagnosis and treatment.
Many survivors suffer decreased quality of life following successful treatment, leading one cancer activist and survivor to say, "Surviving is not just about a cure, but about living the rest of our lives."
Long-term problems, many unique to cancer survivors, include: [cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
Physical problems can stem from the cancer itself or from treatments.
For instance, surgery to remove a tumor may also impair nearby organs.
Likewise, radiation therapy can damage surrounding tissue and cause hormonal changes.
Chemotherapy can be toxic to the heart, liver, lungs, nervous system, and other organs.
Persistent fatigue and pain are also common among cancer survivors.
In addition, childhood cancer survivors often suffer impaired growth and development.
o Sexual effects.
Sexual problems are a common consequence of cancer treatment - cited by as many as half of the women surviving breast and gynecologic cancers and as many as 70 percent of men surviving prostate cancer.
Loss of desire, pain during sex, erectile dysfunction, premature menopause, and infertility have been reported by cancer survivors.
o Psychosocial effects.
Coping with cancer can strain relationships and trigger depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and profound fear of recurrence.
In addition, a diagnosis of cancer can cause social stigmatization.
These problems can interfere with daily living as much or more than physical side effects.
o Economic effects.
Acute and long-term medical expenses and lost wages and lost jobs can leave cancer survivors deeply in debt - increasing worry and decreasing quality of life.
o Second cancers.
Of the 1.4 million new cancers diagnosed each year, almost 100,000 occur in people previously treated for cancer.
Patients surviving one cancer have almost twice the risk of developing a second cancer as the general population has of developing a first.
Children under age 15 who have survived cancer have eight times the risk.
The reasons for this are unclear, although genetic susceptibility and the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments are likely important factors.
[cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
In 1996, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) formally recognized the need to better understand the issues cancer survivors face by establishing the Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS).
In 1997, OCS awarded its first research grants, totaling $4 million over two years.
The primary goal of OCS is to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.
This is achieved through a range of initiatives.
Expanding research into cancer survivorship issues is the first step.
OCS has placed a priority on funding research on long-term survivors - those alive five or more years after diagnosis.
OCS is dedicated to developing the infrastructure, such as databases and researcher networks, that supports the followup needed to study long-term survivors.
The Office also supports programs to educate patients, physicians, and the public about cancer survivorship.
Finally, much of the research supported by OCS is aimed at interventions that can lessen the burdens for cancer survivors.
As more becomes known about the long-term effects of specific cancer treatments, clinicians and their patients will better understand the consequences of such treatments.
They will also be better equipped to face those consequences.
Examples of OCS-funded research include: [cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
o Complications experienced by breast cancer survivors.
o Cardiac risk factors for pediatric cancer survivors.
o Long-term survival after bone marrow transplant.
o Second cancers following childhood cancer.
Possible interaction between genetic predisposition and cancer.
[cleardot.gif] [cleardot.gif]
Surgery and radiation remain the primary methods for treating prostate cancer.
While these treatments can often cure early-stage prostate cancer, side effects such as incontinence, impotence, and overall decreased quality of life make them undesirable in many cases.
That is why researchers are developing better, less invasive treatments and also comparing the outcomes of radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) versus watchful waiting.
Nerve-sparing surgery, which can help to avoid some of the side effects of more radical surgery, is now more common; however, physicians cannot guarantee that no side effects will occur.
High-resolution computer imaging and advanced equipment that can tightly focus radiation beams on the prostate are also helping doctors minimize side effects.
A newer brachytherapy treatment implants radioactive pellets into the prostate.
This approach is becoming more common as more evidence of its effectiveness is gathered.
Because no single treatment is uniformly successful against prostate cancer, combination therapies are often used.
For instance, chemotherapy drugs and hormone treatments often are added to standard surgery and radiation
Hormone treatment may control prostate cancer for long periods by shrinking the size of the tumor, thus relieving pain or it may be given before or after surgery.
Much more research is needed to track down which combinations are most effective in specific cases.
But because prostate cancers are often slow-growing, many men with local disease diagnosed through screening may be better served by watchful waiting rather than aggressive therapy.
Slow-growing prostate tumors also present an attractive target for high-tech gene and immunotherapies currently in early-phase research.
Some experiments seek to "rewrite" cancer-causing genes, while others aim to boost the body's immune response to cancer cells.
While these new therapies are promising, they are years away from clinical viability (that is, use in large numbers of patients).
