The President and Congress focused intense attention and debate on the ethical issues surrounding human cloning and the use of human stem cells for treatment of disease.
After the President's August 9, 2001 announcement making funding available for limited research using stem cells, the Congress launched earnest deliberations on stem cell issues, and it was anticipated to be a major issue during the consideration of appropriations bills.
Following the events of September 11, Congressional focus shifted and stem cell issues were set aside in the interest of bipartisanship.
However, the announcements by private companies that their scientists have cloned human cells for the purpose of producing stem cells spurred renewed interest, and linked stem cell and cloning issues irrevocably.
There are two major camps of legislators who are particularly interested in this issue: one group wants to prohibit cloning for any reason, and the other wants to ban cloning for reproductive purposes while preserving the abilities of scientists and clinicians to use cloning technology in research and therapeutic pursuits.
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) promised that the Senate would take up the cloning issue in March.
However, informal debate continued throughout the spring and the issue remains unsettled.
House Conservatives remain committed to banning cloning for any purpose, while in the Senate, a measure that protects the legality of therapeutic cloning techniques is gaining key support.

H. Con. Res. 17 - Supporting Funding of Pluripotent Stem Cell Research.
Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced this resolution on January 30, 2001 to express the sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.
