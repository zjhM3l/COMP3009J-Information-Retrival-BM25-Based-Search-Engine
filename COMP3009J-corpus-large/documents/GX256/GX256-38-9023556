Rabbit on log Most wildlife don't like floods any more than people do.
Yet over the long haul, flooding makes a river system healthier and more biologically diverse, benefiting all native species that live there.
Waters of restoration
Though harmful to human development, floods revitalize river systems as part of natural ecological cycles
More than a year has passed since the brutal Red River flood devastated Grand Forks, North Dakota, and many communities and farms in the Red River Valley.
And it has been five years since the great Mississippi River and Minnesota River floods turned many towns into temporary lakes.
The mud stains on the sides of houses and the ropes and shredded plastic tangled in branches of trees remain as reminders in these previously flooded environments of a natural force of water that drowned entire regions.
Yet amidst these brutalized landscapes are changes for the better.
Seedlings of cottonwoods-trees that need periodic flooding to thrive-peak up from new sandbars along the riverbanks.
The thick, shady trees send down deep roots to anchor soil from eroding during normal spring floods.
Young northern pike are abundant, the result of adult pike spawning in huge new flooded shallows.
So are underwater insects, which have thrived on decayed leaves and other organic matter the receding rivers pulled in from the landscape.
These are a few examples of how a flood can be good for a river ecosystem, says Richard Sparks, an aquatic biologist at the Illinois Natural History Survey.
Floods systematically replenish and reshape land, vegetation, fish, and wildlife.
"It's like fire in the Yellowstone ecosystem: It can have a rejuvenating effect," explains Sparks, who in the lingo of ecology calls such patterns "disturbance regimes."
"A disturbance is basically anything that kills biomass," Sparks says.
"At first, that would seem like it could only be destructive.
But many ecosystems are actually maintained by disturbances.
And if you don't have a disturbance, then your ecosystem changes into something else.
That's true of prairies and prairie oak savannahs, and it's also true of the flood plain."
Sparks extensively researched the outcomes from the famous Mississippi River flood of 1993, particularly around its epicenter in Alton, Illinois.
While he notes that the flood was an economic disaster, "it was a boon to many plants and animals that live in the Missouri, Illinois, and Upper Mississippi rivers."
Often, a negative effect was balanced by a countering positive effect.
For instance, that flood killed off some large trees by inundating them for too long-but this later allowed new tree seedlings to germinate.
Without great floods, Sparks notes, cottonwoods would gradually be replaced by hackberries and elms, because cottonwood seeds germinate only on moist mud and the seedlings cannot grow in the shade of taller plants.
The 1993 flood also had the unfortunate effect of carrying the invading zebra mussel into flood plains and tributaries.
But another pesky exotic, Eurasian watermilfoil, was naturally eradicated in certain areas, Sparks notes.
As the floodwaters rose, native species such as wild celery and water star grass grew more quickly, replacing the exotic milfoil in some Mississippi backwaters of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
And the same spreading waters, Sparks found, released nutrients from newly flooded soils, stimulating phytoplankton growth, which in turn benefited aquatic insects and fish.
Flooded with fish
Floods typically are measured in losses: of land, roads, buildings, even lives.
But there are also gains realized when a river tops its banks-and anglers can be some of the chief beneficiaries.
"As far as the fish resources are concerned, flooding is generally beneficial," says Tim Schlagenhaft, DNR area fisheries supervisor at Lake City on the Mississippi River.
When a flood occurs, a fish's world expands, offering more food and shelter.
Schlagenhaft says northern pike and walleyes thrive during years of high water.
"Those species spawn a lot of times over vegetation or gravel, where there's flowing water," he says.
Al Stevens, assistant area supervisor at Lake City and a large lake specialist for Lake Pepin, says assessments going back to 1965 show that walleyes love high water.
"Over the years we've seen a lot of ups and downs in the walleye population," Stevens says.
"What shows up all the time is that water levels are very important.
The relationship for walleyes is that they generally produce better year classes [generations of fish born during the same years] in years of high water."
Stevens emphasizes the word "generally."
For example, though the Mississippi River's spring 1996 floods produced a good year class of walleyes in the Lake Pepin area, the huge 1993 flood didn't particularly help.
"That's because it arrived in summer, too late for spawning," Stevens explains.
And floods don't benefit all fish.
The strongest year classes of smallmouth bass, for example, seem to come during years of low river water.
Bluegills and crappies seem to thrive in stable water levels.
"It's all part of a river's long-term cycle," Stevens explains.
"During low water, some species do better.
During high water, other species get off strong year classes."
Taking the flood pulse
As researchers learn more about rivers and their cycles, they are developing new concepts to understand them.
One is the flood-pulse concept.
DNR research scientist Luther Aadland, Fergus Falls, explains it this way:
"The flood-pulse concept says that big rivers depend on leaf matter and woody debris in the flood plain.
During a flood, a lot of this material and the nutrients from it come into the river.
Also, the invertebrate production in the flood plain is huge.
These invertebrates are key to the river, and to the fish that eat them.
"Rivers are very competitive systems.
When flows are low, a lot of predators eat the young fish.
But during a flood, the young fish get spread out, so you've got this added volume of water that protects young fish in addition to giving them a tremendous new food supply."
Aadland notes that flooding also shapes the river valley.
Frequent spring floods reconfigure the channel itself, but bigger events contribute to shaping the entire flood plain.
"Of course, floods also knock down dikes and levees in the way," says Aadland.
"But all that's really happening there is that the river is reclaiming its flood plain."
Aadland and other researchers are learning that dikes, levees, and channelization-straightening river tributaries to move water off the landscape quickly-have limitations in controlling floods, and can even be counterproductive.
It turns out that even the most ambitious human engineering can't contain massive meteorological events.
"A tremendous amount of public money has been spent on channelization projects that actually make flooding worse by moving the problem downstream," says Aadland.
"It's been known for a long time that channelization generally increases peak flood flows farther down the river."
Aadland, Sparks, and other researchers add perspective by taking a step back from the immediate human toll to look at floods over the long haul.
Sparks notes that flooding occurs on three time scales: Annual spring floods are the most frequent, happening almost every year.
Next are infrequent, large floods such as the Mississippi River flood of 1993 and last year's Red River flood.
And then there are whoppers that humans have scarcely seen, but which scientists know happen regularly over thousands of years.
"So it's like you're looking at cycles within cycles," Sparks says.
"On a longer time scale, there were floods that dwarfed even these most recent major floods."
Aadland believes that recent floods helped bring floods and rivers to the forefront of many people's minds.
"I think public attitudes about rivers are changing," he says.
"There are some who still view them strictly as conduits to get water off the land, but a lot of people are upset about river degradation.
I think a lot of people want their rivers back."
