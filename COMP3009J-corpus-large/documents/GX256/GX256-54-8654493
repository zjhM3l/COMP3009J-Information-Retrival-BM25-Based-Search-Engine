THE MINERAL INDUSTRY OF ICELAND By Harold R. Newman Owing to abundant hydroelectric and geothermal energy and the lack of domestic resources, the mineral industry of Iceland largely comprised metal production from imported materials.
Iceland has few proven mineral resources, although deposits of diatomite were being developed.
All production of industrial minerals, with the exception of diatomite, was used by local industries.
(See table 1.)
Because of geographic proximity to the European Union and existing trade agreements, most of Iceland's trade was with Europe.
The Government held most of the shares in the major mineral enterprises.
The remaining enterprises were either foreign owned and locally operated or, for smaller businesses, locally owned and operated.
(See table 2.)
Nordic Aluminium (Nordural) went on-stream in June 1998 in what was the first phase of operation with a capacity of 60,000 metric tons per year (t/yr).
Nordural was in negotiations with electricity generator Landsvirkjun concerning the expansion of the smelter from 60,000 t/yr to 90,000 t/yr.
Nordural was permitted by the Icelandic Government to expand to 180,000 t/yr with two 90,000-t/yr pot rooms (Walawalker, 1998a).
Icelandic Aluminium did not operate at full capacity owing in part, to a shortage of electricity, which affected ferroalloy producer Islenska jarnblendendifelagid hf (Icelandic Alloys Ltd.) more severely.
This shortage was due to the lowest rainfall in 18 years causing reduction in hydroelectric power generation.
The affected companies had signed to secondary power contracts for part of their energy supply, which risked the suspension of supplies if such a shortage of power occurred (MetalNet, 1999, accessed March 1, 1999, at URL http://www.metalnet.co.uk/egi 2/W3Vlibrary/MO=3/CT=B/RI=00004829).
The entire production of diatomite was supplied by Kisilidjan hf (Diatomite Plant Ltd.) near Lake Myvatn.
During the summer months when the lake is not frozen, the diatomaceous earth was pumped from the bottom of the lake and dried in kilns using geothermal energy to a 99% solid diatomaceous earth.
Production was limited to specific areas of the lake because of adverse effects on sediment displacement.
All production of pumice was concentrated around Mount Hekla.
The largest quarry was operated by Eldber hf.
The pumice was 4 meters (m) thick, covered by a 1-m overburden.
The density of dry loose pumice was 320 kilograms per cubic meter, suitable for light concrete and building blocks.
Iceland's future industrial development depends on using its abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power.
The Government was continuing to encourage foreign investment in energy intensive industries, in particular the aluminum and ferroalloy sectors.
Norwegian group Norsk-Hydro was reported to be considering construction of a large greenfield aluminum smelter, and an international consortium that also consisted of Alumix S.p.A.
GrÃ¤nges AB and Hoogovens Group has also been reported to have looked at smelter projects in Iceland (Walawalker, 1998b).
An Icelandic Government/international joint venture of Daimler-Chrysler, Norsk Hydro A/S, and Shell International formed a new company, Icelandic Hydro and Chemical Energy Co., to promote the use of hydrogen as an alternate power source.
The company will examine the practical application of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles, including fishing vessels.
It will seek safe ways to produce, distribute, store, and utilize hydrogen fuel (U.S. Embassy, Reykjavik, Iceland, 1999).
