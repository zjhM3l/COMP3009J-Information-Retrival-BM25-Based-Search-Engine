Performance Measure Percentage of instances protectees arrive and depart safely Definition and Validation Definition: This measure reports the percentage of travel stops where the protectee safely arrives and departs.
A stop is generally considered a city or other definable subdivision visited by a protectee.
Verification and Validation: The Protective Program measures originate from the Agent Manpower System (AMPS).
AMPS is used to assign and track the travel associated with all protective and support details, as it occurs, for the President and family, the Vice-President and family, former Presidents and their spouses, and all designated foreign and domestic dignitaries, and Presidential candidates.
AMPS has several levels of security to limit and control access to authorized users, and to assure the accuracy of data.
Further, protectee travel can only be entered after a headquarters' controlled "trip number" is assigned.
This procedure assures that only valid protectee stops are counted.
Data Accuracy: Assessments of AMPS-based measures have found that the data is extremely accurate.
Overall error rates are less than one percent.
Error is due to lag time in data entry or corrections to historical data.
Protective measures are updated monthly, but are available more frequently, if required.

Performance Measure Percent of cases accepted for Federal prosecution Definition and Validation Definition: This measure reports the percentage of defendants prosecuted in Federal court relative to the total number of prosecutions at all judicial levels.
The goal is to increase the percentage of defendants prosecuted at the Federal level by presenting cases consistent with national crime suppression strategies.
Verification and Validation: Data for the investigative measures are collected from the Master Central Index (MCI) System.
This system is used by all the Secret Service investigative field offices, and provides a means of record keeping for all case and subject information.
MCI has many features built into it in order to provide the most accurate data possible.
Along with the mainframe security features, there are many edit checks built into the application to ensure the accuracy and validity of the data.
Only authorized headquarters and field personnel have access to the application, and they are governed by specific procedures to input case and arrest data.
Data Accuracy: Data for this meeasure are extremely accurate.
Investigative measures are updated monthly, but are available more frequently, if required.

Performance Measure Counterfeit passed per million dollars of genuine U.S. currency (in dollars) Definition and Validation Definition: This measure is an indicator of the proportion of counterfeit currency relative to the amount of genuine U.S. currency in circulation.
The measure reports the dollar value of counterfeit notes passed onto the public per million dollars of genuine currency in circulation.
This measure is calculated by dividing the dollar value of counterfeit notes passed by the dollar value of genuine currency in circulation multiplied by $1 Million.
Validation and Verification: Data is collected from the Counterfeit/Contraband System (CCS).
All Secret Service investigative field offices use this system to track counterfeit currency by type, description, location, and other relevant investigative information.

Only authorized headquarters and field personnel have access to the application, and they are governed by specific procedures to input counterfeit data.
Data Accuracy: Assessments of CCS data have shown the measure to be extremely accurate.
Overall error rates are less than one percent.
Error is due to lag time in data entry or corrections to historical data.
Counterfeiting measures are updated monthly.
