Delinquent licenses may be cancelled! A Reminder--CURES is in effect As of September 18, 1998, all California pharmacies that dispensed Schedule II controlled substances in August were required by section 1715.5 of the California Code of Regulations to submit this prescription data electronically for the Controlled Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).
This information will be collected on an on-going basis and must be transmitted to Atlantic Associates Inc. at least every 30 days and no later than the 18th calendar day of the month following the month in which the prescription was dispensed. (e.g., October prescriptions must be submitted by November 18.)
Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of California pharmacy law except for those pharmacies who have ascertained that they are exempt from the reporting program.
The only exception to the automated reporting requirement is for those pharmacies that do not use computers or have computers that are not fully automated ("fully automated" is defined as having a pharmacy computer system capable of processing third-party billing, Medicare or Medicaid transactions electronically) and which average less than 25 triplicate prescriptions per month in any 6-month period.
These exempt pharmacies are asked to send the original triplicate prescription to a different mailing address for the Department of Justice--P.O. Box 16057, Sacramento CA 95816.
Those pharmacies that are computerized, but do not fill any Schedule II controlled substance prescriptions during the month, must fax the "zero-fill" information monthly to Atlantic Associates.
The requirement to submit data to CURES is in addition to the existing triplicate prescription program requirements.
Original triplicate forms are still submitted to the Department of Justice, P.O. Box 903327, Sacramento CA 94203-3720.
In May, every pharmacy was sent a CURES handbook to assist them in complying with the requirements of this program.

President's Message by Thomas S. Nelson, R.Ph. President, California Board of Pharmacy Most incoming presidents' messages start with a visionary statement of what lies before us, how we are going to get there, and why getting there is a good thing.
This particular issue of The Script will focus on the Board's strategic plan and our vision.
But we cannot forget that the fundamentals of good patient pharmacy care are the cornerstone of our vision and the new model for "pharmacists' care."
The core of pharmacists' care includes such worthwhile endeavors as diabetes, hypertension and anticoagulant disease state management programs.
And while these programs are indeed important for pharmacy, we must not forget the activity that most pharmacists are involved in every day and affects more Californians than any other aspect of pharmacy today--the dispensing of prescription drugs to patients.
Properly dispensing prescriptions, while perhaps not as glamorous as creating disease management programs, is vital to the foundation of any pharmacists' care model.
If you plan to add a second story to your house, you would first ensure that the foundation is solid with no weak spots before beginning construction, lest the entire structure collapse.
The same principle applies when creating a disease management program: the proper dispensing and patient consultation procedures must be in place and strong to keep the program intact and make it work.
There are three important aspects to the dispensing function: 1) providing the right drug with the right directions to the right patient, 2) drug utilization review (DUR), and 3) patient consultation.
As the most highly trained person behind the counter, the pharmacist should personally interpret the prescription and enter it into the computer.
This is necessarily preceded by examining the computer's patient profile and performing the DUR to ensure optimum outcomes by checking for overlaps, interactions, duplications and compliance with existing medications.
However, the pharmacist should use the computer's information as an aid, not as a replacement for professional judgment.
The actual assembling of the prescription can be handled by the technician and then passed on to the pharmacist for review.
Upon presenting the medication to the patient, the pharmacist should open the container to assure its contents match the prescription, and provide patient consultation.
If this procedure is performed by a different pharmacist who is not familiar with the patient's medical history and drug regimen and did not originally input the prescription, a DUR would be performed at this point.
Much publicity is being given to prescription errors today.
However, if all California pharmacists were diligently providing patient consultation and appropriate DUR, I believe that the error rates could be reduced by 50 percent or more.
Patient consultation provides that "final" check for the right drug, the right directions and the right patient.
This is the essence of the dispensing function which happens 100-500 times a day in outpatient pharmacies in California--and yet not everyone is truly embracing and providing proper patient consultation and DUR.
At the Board's compliance committee meetings where pharmacists appear for violations of section 1707.2 of the California Code of Regulations (Notice to Consumers and Duty to Consult), it is discouraging to hear pharmacists, after the legal requirement for consultation has been in place for nearly nine years, admit that they don't have any procedures to handle consultation.
Before we can move on and add the second story of pharmacists' care, we must be sure our foundation of dispensing and counseling is in place and solid with no weak spots that will allow our second story to tumble down upon us.
Board elects new officers and welcomes new members The Board of Pharmacy has undergone several changes this year.
Legislation mandated the addition of another public member, increasing the Board's membership to four public members and seven professional members.
In May 1998, the Board elected new officers: Thomas S. Nelson, R.Ph., President; Sandra Bauer, Vice President; and Caleb Zia was re-elected Treasurer.
Other changes included the departures of Janeen McBride, R.Ph. (October 1997), Raffi Simonian, Pharm.D., and Gary Dreyfus, Pharm.D., whose terms expired.
The Board acknowledges the dedication and commitment of these members and thanks them for their many contributions over the years.
They will be missed.
While saying farewell to the retiring members, the Board also welcomes their replacements--professional members Richard Mazzoni, R.Ph., John Jones, R.Ph., and Steve Litsey, Pharm.D.
Richard Mazzoni was appointed in January 1998 and serves as Regional Pharmacy Manager for American Drug Stores with See New Officers, Page 3

Health Notes--building a closer patient-pharmacist partnership By Marilyn Standifer Shreve, R.Ph.
Chair, Consumer Education and Communication Committee Editor, Health Notes During the 1940s, many state legislatures created boards to protect the health and welfare of their states' consumers by regulating the practice of healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, physicians and nurses.
The California State Board of Pharmacy is an example of a board that is focusing not only on regulating the practice of pharmacy, but also on providing tools and resources to assist pharmacists and other healthcare providers to be better informed on subjects of importance to their patients.
One such resource developed by the California Board is Health Notes, a magazine for healthcare providers and consumers.
Information provided in the magazine can, for example, help pharmacists counsel patients about medications.
It is well documented that counseling increases patients' awareness and understanding of their medical condition and helps them monitor that portion of their care for which they are most responsible-- medication compliance.
Up to half of the nearly two billion prescriptions filled each year are not used correctly.
Statistics indicate that about ten percent of all hospital admissions and 23 percent of nursing home admissions are caused by the inappropriate use of medications, costing the nation approximately $100 billion per year.
While increased importance is being placed on patient medication compliance, some regulatory boards are finding innovative ways to encourage healthcare providers to become active patient care managers and to provide patient counseling and prescription information that will help consumers better understand and monitor their medications.
See Health Notes, Page 14
Pharmacy Board meetings are open to the public In accordance with the Board's strategic plan (which is detailed on page 4 of this publication) five committees were formed to address issues related to meeting the plan's objectives: 1) Communication and Public Education, 2) Licensing, 3) Enforcement, 4) Legislation and Regulation, and 5) Organizational Development.
To share the various committee goals, activities and accomplishments with the public, a portion of each Board meeting will be devoted to one of the committees and open for comment.
The October 28-29, 1998, meeting will be held in Sacramento at 400 R Street, Room 1030.
The annual public meeting of the Legislation and Regulation Committee will be on Wednesday, the 28th, from 3-5:00 pm at the same address.
At the January 20-21, 1999, meeting in Orange County, the Licensing Committee will discuss its objectives and how to reach them.
The Board encourages all interested parties to participate in these meetings.
Public comment periods are part of each meeting.
If you cannot attend a meeting, you may submit written comments to the Board, but try to get them to the Board within seven days of the meeting.
Agendas with information regarding the exact time and location of the meetings may be obtained by calling the Board at (916) 445-5014.

Strategic Plan--Where the Board is going and how it plans to get there A strategic plan is an overall plan for an organization to accomplish its mission in a changing environment while operating within its available resources.
Strategic plans provide a blueprint for future program directions.
The strategic planning process produces fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization is, what it does, and why it does it.
The strategic plan defines and refines the business functions within an organization to carry out its programmatic missions efficiently and effectively.
The first step in completing a strategic plan requires the organization to conduct an evaluation of internal and external factors that affect the organization.
The organization's director and planning team then define the mission (purpose), expressing the core values and philosophies and articulates a vision (a conceptual image of the desired future).
Goals and objectives are established, and performance measures are identified for assessing effectiveness of the program.
After the mission, principles, goals and objectives are communicated to every level of the organization, action plans are developed to implement the plan.
The final step is to ensure that all future budget requests are linked to the strategic plan.
The Board of Pharmacy developed its first formal strategic plan in 1994, revising it through the years to reflect emerging issues.
In 1998, when each state agency was required to submit strategic planning information to the Governor's Office for approval, the Board reorganized its plan.
This article highlights the revised plan of 1998, which has become an integral part of our day-to-day business.
practice endorsed by the Board; goals and performance measures for assessing the plan's success; an action plan and methods for its update; and the formation of board committees to assist in implementing five areas of the plan.
The Pharmacists' Care Model Pharmacists' care is promoted by the Board as a model of practice defined as: The provision of medication-related care to patients.
It is intended to achieve definite outcomes (cure of a disease, elimination or reduction of a patient's symptomatology, arresting or slowing of a disease process or preventing a disease or symptomatology) that improve a patient's quality of life.
The following are the principal elements that must be included whenever pharmacists' care is being provided to patients: Â· Pharmacists are the providers of drug information and the repository of drug therapy expertise, and as such, are available for consultation before the prescription is written.
In fact, a pharmacist may decide a particular medication is inappropriate for the patient.
In providing pharmacists' care, the pharmacist becomes the patient's advocate, being directly responsible for seeing that the patient receives a positive outcome from the medication and is protected from drug misadventures.
Pharmacists have the responsibility for therapeutic outcomes resulting from their decisions.
However, pharmacists are not the only authority in matters related to medication use--pharmacists, caregivers, and other health professionals (including prescribers, nursing, etc.) all have valuable roles in the medication use process.
Pharmacists' care should be conducted and viewed as collaborative, and pharmacists should lead the healthcare team's efforts to improve patients' medication use.
Â·
1998 Strategic Plan Mission The Board's mission is to serve the people of California by: Â· Â· Â· Protecting their health, safety and welfare with integrity and honesty, Helping them attain health education, wellness and an improved quality of life, and Ensuring high quality pharmacists' care.
Â·
Board Committees To help the Board meet its objectives and mission-related goals, the following policy-development committees (each consisting of two board members and board staff) were formed: Â· Communication and Public Education: To encourage the public to discuss their medications with their pharmacist; emphasize the importance of complying with their prescription treatment regimens; and help pharmacists to become better informed on subjects of importance to the public.
Licensing: To ensure that those who practice pharmacy, as well as those entering the practice, meet minimum See Strategic Plan, Page 6
Vision To meet its mission, the Board envisions: 1) a healthcare system in which pharmacists are patient advocates who provide pharmacists' care to Californians, enlightening them about their drug therapy through effective communicating and listening, assessing, collaborating, understanding and intervening; 2) an effective licensing process that ensures the highest levels of professional standards, competency and pharmacists' care; and 3) ensuring that enforcement officials are provided the resources to act quickly, consistently and efficiently in the public interest.
Along with its mission and vision statements, the plan includes a description of "pharmacists' care," the model of

requirements for education, experience and knowledge, and ensure that facilities licensed by the Board meet minimum standards.
Â· Enforcement: To protect the public by preventing violations, and effectively enforce federal and state laws when violations occur.
Legislation and Regulation: To pursue legislation that ensures better patient care and provides effective regulation of the individuals and firms who handle, dispense, furnish, ship and store prescription drugs and devices in California.
Â·
Organizational Development: To use strategic planning, budget management and staff development activities to ensure the efficient achievement of the Board's mission and goals.
Â·
At each Board meeting, the committees provide written and oral reports on their progress in achieving their strategic objectives.
These meetings are open to the public, and to encourage public input, each meeting will include a publicly-noticed report on a specific committee's activity.
(Another article in this issue highlights the schedule of Board meeting dates and public committee meetings through January 1999.)
Licensing Committee The Licensing Committee consists of Board members Holly Strom, R.Ph., Chair, and Ken Tait, Public Member, and several staff members.
The committee will ensure that the professional qualifications of those entering the practice of pharmacy, as well as those continuing to practice, meet minimum requirements for education, experience and knowledge, and that facilities licensed by the Board meet minimum standards.
The committee's specific strategic goals are to: 1.
Assess the continuing education program, using the situation-target-proposal decision-making method to identify improvements.
Improve the license application process to prevent enforcement problems and reduce application review time; implement improvements to the processing of applications consistent with protection of public health and safety; determine distribution of resources among program components.
Evaluate the proper roles and responsibilities of pharmacy technicians in all practice settings.
Evaluate methods to ensure "pharmacists' care."
Â· Â·
clinics hypodermic needle and syringe distributors
To assure that these programs are efficient and increase customer satisfaction, the committee's initial planning meetings have focused on streamlining applications--in response to complaints received regarding the delays in application processing.
The delays began after pharmacy application forms were revised to require more detailed information regarding pharmacy ownership.
The revisions were necessary because the Board had removed the physical requirements for licensure, and enforcement efforts revealed significant fraudulent/hidden ownership of pharmacies.
Subsequently, a team of processing technicians, analysts and inspectors revised the pharmacy application forms to refocus the review process from the pharmacy's physical requirements to the pharmacy's ownership.
In November 1996, use of the new forms began, creating considerable delays in processing, confusion among applicants, and backlogs.
The backlogs were further compounded by vacancies resulting from staff changes in several processing positions.
To alleviate the backlogs and further streamline the application process, the Board obtained approval for additional staff and transitioned the final review of applications from inspectors to an in-house analyst.
Pharmacy applications are now being processed in a more timely manner.

Enforcement Committee By Darlene Fujimoto, Pharm.D.
Chair, Enforcement Committee In July 1997, consistent with the Board of Pharmacy's Strategic Plan, an enforcement committee was established.
Board members Dr. Darlene Fujimoto, committee chair, and John Jones, R.Ph., act as liaison between the full Board, the office staff and inspectors, with all working together as an enforcement team.
The primary goal of the Board's Enforcement Committee is the See Enforcement, Page 7
OCTOBER 1998 Enforcement Continued from Page 6
BOARD OF PHARMACY

protection of the public through enforcement of both state and federal laws governing the practice of pharmacy and the provision of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare products.
To meet this goal, there has been a reorganization of the enforcement team's individual functions.
As the practice of pharmacy is moving away from the traditional role of dispensing medications and toward positions as integral healthcare providers, Board inspectors are also changing their emphasis.
They recently announced their new team structure, which focuses on the various areas of enforcement rather than each inspector's location or "territory."
Currently, there are three inspector teams whose separate responsibilities are: 1) Compliance--to oversee standard maintenance and daily activities of pharmacy practice, 2) Drug Diversion and Fraud--to discover and seek discipline of those who do not to follow the law, and 3) Pharmacist Recovery Program and Probationer Monitoring--to prevent substance-impaired practitioners from practicing and monitor those who are recovering or returning to practice after failing to follow the standards and laws required of licensees.
These team functions are all critical to protecting the public and helping to ensure that appropriate pharmaceutical care is provided to all California residents.
The establishment of inspector enforcement teams has been further enhanced not only by inspector participation in high-level investigative and enforcement training, but also by the updating of their skills in such topics as consultation, the promotion of pharmaceutical care and team-building.
Because inspectors are highly-trained, dedicated professionals and experts in the application of pharmacy law, they are able to serve as consultants to both licensees and other agencies.
Along with the re-engineering of its enforcement team, the Board is increasing its communication efforts to advise licensees of law changes and interpretations and the licensees' corresponding responsibilities.
One of the Board's primary communication efforts is the introduction of the pharmacy self-assessment program.
This program requires pharmacists-in-charge (PICs) to complete an evaluation of their pharmacy's compliance to laws relating to the operation of a pharmacy.
The evaluation will be done on a Board-provided form and maintained in the pharmacy.
The forms also serve as an educational tool by asking compliance questions and providing regulatory information on how to be in compliance.
The self-assessment forms will be provided to all pharmacies and detailed in the January 1999 issue of The Script.
Other goals the committee will emphasize are to increase the quality and quantity of patient consultations and by doing so, provide consumers with the best therapeutic outcomes and minimize drug misadventures.
Additionally, since approximately half of the complaints received by the Board are related to prescription errors, the committee is dedicated to reducing such errors by increasing the information regarding their occurrence and how to prevent them.
The committee also hopes to become more consumer and licensee "friendly" by improving access to the Board and its information services.
An 800 number is in the planning stages, and additional consumer and licensee education programs are on the agenda.
In keeping with the Board's overall strategic plan that describes pharmacists as advocates who communicate and enlighten their patients about their drug therapies, the committee also wishes to communicate and interact with our licensees for a positive relationship with the patient--the ultimate focus of all our work.
Communication and Public Education Committee By Marilyn Standifer Shreve, R.Ph., Chair The Board's Communication and Public Education Committee was created in July 1994 to develop a public awareness campaign encouraging consumers to talk with their pharmacists about the medications they take and to understand the importance of taking medications correctly.
The committee also would seek to assist pharmacists in providing counseling services and innovative pharmaceutical care services.
In only four years, the Communication and Public Education Committee has successfully developed and generated: Â· Statewide television network news coverage reaching more than 15 million viewers, highlighting pharmacist counseling and encouraging consumers to talk with their pharmacist to learn more about the medications they are taking.
Radio public service announcements and interviews reaching more than 12 million listeners (in English and Spanish), highlighting the message "Asking Questions Can Help Save Your Life!" Consumer health columns entitled, "California Health:" tips from the California Board of Pharmacy reaching more than 10 million readers (in English and Spanish).
So far there have been eight columns covering such subjects as talking to your pharmacist, pain management, Patient's Bill of Rights, and women's health issues.
Two Health Notes monographs--pain management and women's health issues--reaching a cumulative readership of 150,000 to assist pharmacists and other health care providers become well-informed on subjects of importance to their patients.
Two other monographs are in production, including one on anticoagulation drug therapy.

innovative pharmaceutical care practices, such as disease state management programs and patient centered services.
The summit was cosponsored by the California Board of Pharmacy, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the California Health and Welfare Agency and facilitated by the Board's Communication and Public Education Committee and the California Pharmacists Association.
The summit was attended by employers (government and private) who purchase health care benefits for more than 19 million people and spend $3 billion on health care annually.
Pharmacist presenters demonstrated that cost-effective pharmaceutical care services improve patient medication outcomes; result in fewer visits to the doctor's office; decrease the number of emergency room visits, laboratory tests, and hospitalizations; and improve quality of life.

Board is accepting applications for inspector The Board of Pharmacy has vacancies statewide for the position of Inspector, Board of Pharmacy.
Applications for appointment to this state civil service classification will now be accepted on an ongoing basis.
Inspectors, under general direction, work from home offices to conduct inspections and investigations to enforce laws regulating the practice of pharmacy.
Inspectors provide consultation and education to licensees, governmental agencies and others regarding laws related to drugs and the practice of pharmacy.
Inspectors work as members of teams and frequent travel is required.
Minimum qualifications include possession of a valid pharmacist license, two years' experience in the practice of pharmacy, including contact with the public, and possession of a valid California driver's license.
(Applicants who do not have a license will be admitted to the interview but must obtain the license before they are hired.)
Applicants meeting the minimum qualifications will be scheduled for one of the semi-annual "examinations."
The examination is actually a structured interview, and applicants will be asked to complete a written exercise before the interview.
Applications postmarked or submitted by October 1, 1998, will be scheduled for the testing period of November/December 1998, and applications for the May/June 1999 testing period must be submitted by April 1, 1999.
Applications received after a cut-off date will be scheduled for next testing period.
The salary range is $4,337 - $4,924 per month.

(Effective 09/24/98 to 01/01/99)
By focusing the same type of widespread public attention on the importance of patient medication compliance as is given to food labeling and health fitness, we will have a better informed patient population, achieve more effective health care, and save valuable healthcare resources.
Pharmacists who initiate programs that help patients better manage their medications and meet their treatment objectives can help reduce healthcare costs and untold human suffering.
Health Notes regularly features articles that deal with such healthcare topics as pain management, the impact of pain on patients and their families, coronary artery disease in women, breast cancer treatment, the pharmacist's role in the treatment of depression, and the importance of weighing the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy.
In an effort to help consumers learn more about medications, the Board has also developed a public awareness program that encourages consumers to talk with their pharmacists.
The program has created newspaper columns in English and Spanish covering such topics as "How Asking Questions About Your Medicines Can Help Save Your Life," "The Patient's Bill of Rights," and "Pain Management: A Pain Rating Scale to Help You Describe Your Pain."
"We are urging consumers to talk with their pharmacists about any problems they anticipate in using their medications," states Sandra Bauer, Vice President of the California Board of Pharmacy.
"If a patient gets a prescription refilled and it has a different appearance or the directions on the label have changed, the patient should discuss it with a healthcare provider."
For a free copy of Health Notes, write to the State Board of Pharmacy, 400 R Street, Suite 4070, Sacramento, CA, 95814.
Check your license's expiration date! Delinquent licenses may be cancelled! Section 4402 of the Business and Professions Code mandates that any pharmacist license that is not renewed, restored, or reinstated within three years following its expiration date shall be cancelled by operation of law.
Any other Board-issued license registration (e.g., pharmacy technicians, interns, exemptees, pharmacies, clinics, drug rooms, wholesalers, medical device retailers) are automatically cancelled by operation of law if the license is not renewed within 60 days after its expiration date.
Pharmacists-in-charge are responsible for ensuring that all licenses (site and personnel) of the pharmacy are current.
Wholesalers and medical device retailers should also ensure that the licenses of their exemptees and qualifying pharmacists have been renewed properly.
Failure to renew exemptee licenses can block the renewal capabilities of the company to which the license is related.
Licenses cancelled under this provision will not be reissued.
Instead, a new application will be required.
