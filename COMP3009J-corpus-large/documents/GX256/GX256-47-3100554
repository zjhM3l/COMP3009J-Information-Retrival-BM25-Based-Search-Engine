Appropriations for FY2004: Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Summary The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally.
It contains the largest share -- about two-thirds -- of total U.S. international affairs spending.
President Bush has asked Congress to appropriate $18.89 billion for FY2004 Foreign Operations.
The budget proposal is $2.7 billion, or 16.7% higher than regular (non-supplemental) Foreign Operations appropriations for FY2003.
If enacted, the President's recommendation would result in one of the largest increases of regular Foreign Operations funding in at least two decades.
Congress subsequently approved in mid-April an additional $7.5 billion FY2003 supplemental foreign aid spending in P.L. 108-11, for Iraq reconstruction, assistance to coalition partners, and other activities supporting the global war on terrorism.
Including the supplemental brings Foreign Operations appropriations in FY2003 to $23.67 billion.
The FY2004 budget blueprint continues to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority, with about $4.7 billion recommended.
The submission also requests funding for four new foreign aid initiatives which together account for most of the $2.7 billion increase over regular FY2003 levels.
Combined, the Millennium Challenge Account, a new foreign aid concept, the State Department's Global AIDS Initiative, and two new contingency funds, total $2.05 billion.
Other Foreign Operations programs are left with a more modest 4% increase.
In total, the request includes $1.2 billion for HIV/AIDS, about $350 million more than enacted for FY2003, and $7.1 billion for military and security-related economic aid, up nearly $650 million or 10% from regular FY2003 appropriations.
"Core" bilateral development assistance funding, however, would fall by 8%, although recipients of these accounts are likely to benefit significantly from the new Millennium Challenge Account and Global AIDS Initiative.
Funding for Eastern Europe and former Soviet programs is cut by 21%.
The FY2004 budget resolution approved by Congress in mid-April (H.Con.Res.
95) includes $28.65 billion in discretionary budget authority for International Affairs programs, the same as the President's request.
House and Senate Appropriations Committees received sufficient resources to fully fund the Administration's foreign policy budget proposal, including the Foreign Operations request.
To accommodate other priorities, however, the House Appropriations Committee decided to reduce the Foreign Operations allocation by 9.4% to $17.12 billion, while the Senate panel cut the allocation by 4.2% to $18.1 billion.
The FY2004 Foreign Operations debate will include discussion of several significant policy issues, including foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism, the Millennium Challenge Account, international family planning programs, and Afghan reconstruction.

Appropriations for FY2004: Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Most Recent Developments In mid-June, House and Senate Appropriations Committees announced how they would distribute among their 13 subcommittees the $784.7 billion in discretionary budget authority the Committees have under their control.
Under the House "302(b) allocation" process, Foreign Operations received $17.12 billion, $1.77 billion or 9.4% below the President's request.
The Senate Committee allocated $18.09 billion for Foreign Operations, 4.2% less than the Administration's proposal.
At either of these levels, trade-offs among competing priorities will be necessary as the Foreign Operations subcommittees decide how to absorb these reductions.
These allocations come within the context of an Administration FY2004 budget request that represents one of the largest increases for Foreign Operations programs in several decades.
The $18.9 billion proposal is $2.7 billion, or 16.7% higher than regular foreign aid funds enacted for FY2003 (excluding the $7.5 billion provided in the FY2003 Iraq War supplemental).
Most of the add-ons reflect several new initiatives proposed for FY2004, including the Millennium Challenge Account ($1.3 billion) and the Global AIDS Initiative ($450 million).
Excluding these new initiatives, the FY2004 request for continuing Foreign Operations programs is a more modest 4% higher than funding for regular foreign aid activities in FY2003 (excluding the supplemental).
In total, the request includes $1.2 billion for HIV/AIDS, about $350 million more than enacted for FY2003, and $7.1 billion for military and security-related economic aid, up nearly $650 million or 10% from regular FY2003 appropriations.
"Core" bilateral development assistance funding, however, would fall by 8%, although recipients of these accounts are likely to benefit significantly from the new Millennium Challenge Account and Global AIDS Initiative.
Funding for Eastern Europe and former Soviet programs is cut by 21%.
Earlier, on April 12, 2003, Congress approved a $78.4 billion Iraq War supplemental appropriation (H.R. 1559; P.L. 108-11) that included an additional $7.5 billion in Foreign Operations funding for FY2003.
The foreign aid portion of the supplemental was roughly divided into three components: Iraq post-conflict relief, reconstruction, and security (about $2.5 billion); aid to coalition partners and other nations engaged in the war on terrorism (about $4.5 billion); and funds to replenish regular aid accounts that had been drawn from to pre-position commodities in the region (about $550 million).
(P.L. 108-11 also included $369 million to replenish international food aid accounts drawn from the Agriculture portion of the supplemental.)
Although Congress generally approved amounts requested by the President, most controversy centered on which agency would manage the $2.475
CRS-2 billion Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.
The White House requested broad authority so the President could designate the Defense Department (DOD) to administer the funds while many in Congress felt the traditional aid agency managers -- the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) -- should control Fund resources.
As approved, the supplemental legislation appropriates the funds to the President, allowing him to directly apportion the money to five Federal agencies, including DOD.
Introduction The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is vehicle through which Congress reviews and votes on the budget and influences major aspects of executive branch generally.1 It contains the largest share -- about two-thirds affairs spending by the United States (see Figure 1). the primary legislative U.S. foreign assistance foreign policy making -- of total international
The legislation funds all U.S. bilateral development assistance programs, managed mostly by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies, such as the Peace Corps and the Inter-American and African Development Foundations.
Most humanitarian aid activities are funded within Foreign Operations, including USAID's disaster program and the State Department's refugee relief support.
Foreign Operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former Soviet Union (also referred to as the Independent States account) and Central/Eastern Europe, activities that are jointly managed by USAID and the State Department.
Security assistance (economic and military aid) for Israel and Egypt is also part of the Foreign Operations spending measure, as are other security aid programs administered largely by the State Department, in conjunction with USAID and the Pentagon.
U.S. contributions to the World Bank and other regional multilateral development banks, managed by the Treasury Department, and voluntary payments to international organizations, handled by the State Department, are also funded in the Foreign Operations bill.
Finally, the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies: the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-Import Bank, and the Trade and Development Agency.

Although the Foreign Operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the "foreign aid" spending measure, it does not include funding for all foreign aid programs.
Food aid, an international humanitarian aid program administered under the P.L. 480 program, is appropriated in the Agriculture appropriations bill.
Foreign Operations also include funds for the Export-Import Bank, an activity that is regarded as a trade promotion program, rather than "foreign aid."
In recent years, funding for food aid and the Eximbank have been about the same, so that Foreign Operations and the official "foreign aid" budget are nearly identical.
Throughout this report, the terms Foreign Operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably.

For nearly two decades, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making.
Congress has not enacted a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees.
As a result, Foreign Operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives.
It has been largely through Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War.
The legislation has also been the channel through which the President has utilized foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of September 11, 2001.
The appropriations measure has also been a key instrument used by Congress to apply restrictions and conditions on Administration management of foreign assistance, actions that have frequently resulted in executive-legislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making.

President Bush submitted his FY2004 federal budget request to Congress on February 3, 2003, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs.
Subsequently, on March 25, the White House requested FY2003 emergency supplemental funds for costs of military operations in Iraq, relief and reconstruction of Iraq, ongoing U.S. costs in Afghanistan, additional aid to coalition partners and nations cooperating in the global war on terrorism, and homeland security.
House and Senate Appropriations Committees held several hearings on both the FY2004 and FY2003 supplemental requests, and approved the supplemental (P.L. 108-11) on April 12.
The Committees have not begun work on the FY2004 appropriations request.
Foreign Operations Funding Trends As shown in Figure 2 below, Foreign Operations funding levels, expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation, have fluctuated widely over the past 26 years.2 After peaking at over $33 billion in FY1985 (constant FY2004 dollars), Foreign Operations appropriations began a period of decline to $13.9 billion in FY1997, with only a brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for Panama and Nicaragua (1990), countries affected by the Gulf War (1991), and the former Soviet states (1993).
2
Some of these swings, however, are not the result of policy decisions, but due to technical budget accounting changes involving how Congress "scores" various programs.
For example, the large increase in FY1981 did not represent higher funding levels, but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as "offbudget" items.
Part of the substantial rise in spending in FY1985 came as a result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past.
Beginning in FY1992, Congress changed how all Federal credit programs are "scored" in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in Foreign Operations.
All of these factors make it very difficult to present a precise and consistent data trend line in Foreign Operations funding levels.
Nevertheless, the data shown in Figure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in Congressional decisions regarding Foreign Operations appropriations over the past 25 years.
CRS-5 Figure 2.
Foreign Operations Funding Trends
Arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined U.S. foreign policy interests and limited the ability of American officials to influence overseas events, Clinton Administration officials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decade-long decline in the foreign policy budget.
Foreign aid spending increased slightly in FY1998, but beginning the following year and continuing to the present, Foreign Operations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special, and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives.
While funding for regular, continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period, supplemental spending for special activities, such as Central American hurricane relief (FY1999), Kosovo emergency assistance (FY1999), Wye River/Middle East peace accord support (FY2000), a counternarcotics initiative in Colombia and the Andean region (FY2000 and FY2002), aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and Iraq-war related assistance (FY2003), was chiefly responsible for the growth in foreign aid appropriations.
The average annual funding level during the FY1999-FY2003 period of $18.68 billion represents a level 36% higher than the low point in Foreign Operations appropriation in FY1997.
At present, the $24.2 billion appropriated for FY2003 Foreign Operations programs (real terms) is the largest amount since FY1985.
This substantial FY2003 funding level is made up of a combination of the highest regular Foreign Operations spending bill in over a decade, plus the largest supplemental ($7.5 billion) since approval of an FY1979 supplemental aid package in support of the Camp David peace accords signed by Israel and Egypt.
Due to the unpredictability and significant size of foreign aid supplementals in recent years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to compare a new budget request with the previous year when the latter includes a large supplemental.
This is
CRS-6 especially true when evaluating the FY2004 Foreign Operations budget plan, which could also substantially increase through supplementals enacted next year.
In this case, a more informative assessment might compare regular FY2003 and FY2004 Foreign Operations budgets, keeping in mind that FY2003 has already been augmented with significant supplemental funding.
Using this point of reference, despite falling well short of total amounts appropriated for FY2003, including the supplemental, the FY2004 Foreign Operations request, if enacted, would be the highest regular foreign aid spending measure in at least 15 years (in real terms) and represent the largest single-year increase for regular Foreign Operations appropriations over the entire 26 year period.

FY1999 excludes $17.861 billion for the IMF.
The significance of supplemental resources for Foreign Operations programs in recent years is illustrated in Figure 3 below.
Due to the nature of rapidly changing international events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the U.S. national interest to respond, it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle.
Supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the Camp David accords (FY1979), Central America conflicts (FY1983), Africa famine and a Middle East economic downturn (FY1985), Panama and Nicaragua government transitions (FY1990), the Gulf War (FY1991), and Bosnia relief and reconstruction (FY1996).
But after a period of only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years, beginning in FY1999 Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations exceeding $1 billion in each of the past five years.
Relief for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch, Kosovo refugees, and victims of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in FY1999 totaled $1.6 billion, and was followed in FY2000 by a $1.1 billion supplemental, largely to fund the President's new counternarcotics initiative in Colombia.
As part of a $40 billion emergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in September 2001, President Bush and Congress allocated $1.4 billion for foreign aid activities in FY2001 and FY2002.
Another $1.15 billion supplemental cleared Congress in FY2002 to augment Afghan reconstruction efforts and assist other "front-line" states in the war on terrorism.
Until FY2003, these additional resources have accounted for between 7% and 11% of total Foreign Operations spending.
The $7.5 billion Iraq War supplemental for
CRS-7 FY2003, however, goes well beyond these standards, representing nearly one-third of the FY2003 Foreign Operations budget.

As a share of the entire $2.24 trillion U.S. budget for FY2003, Foreign Operations currently represents a 1.06% share, significantly higher than the traditional level of around 0.75%.
This is due largely to enactment of the $7.5 billion supplemental for Iraq reconstruction, aid to coalition partners, and assistance to other front-line states in the war on terrorism.
The FY2004 Foreign Operations request is projected to total 0.84% of total U.S. federal spending.
As a portion of discretionary budget authority -- that part of the budget provided in annual appropriation acts (other than appropriated entitlements) -- Foreign Operations consumes 2.8% in FY2003, a level that would drop back to 2.4% under the FY2004 budget proposal.
By comparison, at the high point of Foreign Operations spending in FY1985, foreign aid funds represented 2% of the total U.S. budget and 4.6% of discretionary budget authority.
Foreign aid as a percent of discretionary budget authority remained above 3% in most years between FY1978 and FY1991.
In the last decade, however, it has stood below 3%, with the low point falling in FY2002 to 2.25%.
CRS-8 Data Notes Unless otherwise indicated, this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority.
The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables -- USAID's Foreign Service retirement fund.
The retirement fund is scheduled to receive $43.9 million for FY2004.
In addition, funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), proposals that are enacted periodically (about every five years) in Foreign Operations bills.
Congress approved $17.9 billion for the IMF in FY1999, the first appropriation since FY1993.
Including these large, infrequent, and uniquely "scored" IMF appropriations tends to distort a general analysis of Foreign Operations funding trends.
Although Congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of U.S. participation, the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the United States and the IMF, and results in no outlays from the U.S. treasury.
In short, the appropriations are off-set by the creation of a U.S. counterpart claim on the IMF that is liquid and interest bearing.
For more, see CRS Report 96-279, U.S. Budgetary Treatment of the IMF.
Foreign Operations, the FY2004 Budget Resolution, and Sec. 302(b) Allocations Usually, Appropriations Committees begin markups of their spending bills only after Congress has adopted a budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the Appropriations panels under what is referred to as the Section 302(a) allocation process, a reference to the pertinent authority in the Congressional Budget Act.
Following this, House and Senate Appropriations Committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees, staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution.
This second step is referred to as the Section 302(b) allocation.
Foreign Operations funds fall within the International Affairs budget function (Function 150), representing in most years about 65% of the function total.
Smaller amounts of Function 150 are included in four other appropriation bills.
How much International Affairs money to allocate to each of the five subcommittees, and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the Appropriations Committees.
Nevertheless, overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills.
On April 11, 2003, the House and Senate agreed to a budget framework for FY2004 (H.Con.Res.
95) that includes $784.7 billion in discretionary budget authority.
The discretionary budget authority target for the International Affairs function is $28.65 billion, the same as the President's request (as re-estimated by
CRS-9 CBO).
This means that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees received sufficient resources to fully fund the Administration's foreign policy budget proposal, including the Foreign Operations request.
The Committees, however, can choose to allocate the $28.65 billion among the five subcommittees with jurisdiction over the International Affairs programs differently than what the President proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities.
Depending on other competing priorities, the final allocations can be quite different from those assumed in the budget resolution.
For a number of weeks following passage of H.Con.Res.
95, Appropriation Committee leaders debated how to distribute the discretionary funds under their jurisdiction, and especially how to absorb what they identified as a roughly $5 to $7 billion gap in spending requirements and amounts available.
Departing from traditional practices where House and Senate Committees work separately on subcommittee allocations, Committee leaders negotiated across both houses with their leadership and with the White House to establish a common framework within which to base their initial allocations.
On June 11, House and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairmen announced an agreed package which would free-up sufficient resources to address the funding gap and remain within the overall FY2004 discretionary budget cap of $784.7 billion.
As approved by all parties, including the President, the Appropriations Committees will reduce Defense spending by $3 billion and move $2.2 billion in FY2004 advance appropriations to FY2003.
The House Appropriations Committee, which also released its allocation for all 13 subcommittees on June 11, made further alternations beyond the basic framework.
The Committee's distribution adds funding beyond the President's request for several subcommittees, including Homeland Security (up $1 billion), VA/HUD (up $600 million), and Commerce, Justice, and State (up $229 million).
In addition to the $3 billion reduction for Defense, the House Committee further cut Foreign Operations by $1.769 billion to $17.12 billion.
This 9.4% cut from the President's request is the largest percentage reduction for any of the 13 subcommittees.
The Senate Appropriations Committee on June 19 agreed to its allocations, differing from House levels in several areas, including Foreign Operations.
The Senate panel provides $18.09 billion for foreign assistance, about $800 million, or 4.2% below the President's request, but $900 million more than the House.
Like the House, however, the Senate Committee reduced Foreign Operations on a percentage basis more than any other subcommittee.
Although Senate levels would be easier to accommodate, cuts of this size for Foreign Operations will require substantial trade-offs among Administration priorities as well as foreign aid programs of high interest to Congress.
With most of the Foreign Operations increases slated for new initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Account and the Global AIDS program, cuts will be necessary for these new proposals, for continuing activities, or for a combination of both.
During negotiations with the White House, it was reported that President Bush emphasized that the budget package must not reduce funding for his top spending priorities,
CRS-10 including the Global AIDS Initiative.3 The Foreign Operations request includes $1.24 billion of the Administration's overall $1.9 billion international HIV/AIDS recommendation.
Foreign Operations Appropriations Request for FY2004 and Congressional Consideration Request Overview On February 3, 2003, President Bush asked Congress to appropriate $18.89 billion for FY2004 Foreign Operations.
The budget proposal is $2.7 billion, or 16.7% higher than regular Foreign Operations appropriations for FY2003, as enacted in P.L. 108-7.
If enacted, the President's recommendation would result in one of the largest increases of regular (non-supplemental) Foreign Operations funding in several decades.
Congress subsequently approved in mid-April an additional $7.5 billion FY2003 supplemental foreign aid spending in P.L. 108-11, for Iraq reconstruction, assistance to coalition partners, and other activities supporting the global war on terrorism.
Including the supplemental brings Foreign Operations appropriations in FY2003 to $23.67 billion.
The FY2004 budget blueprint continues to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority.
But a notable characteristic of the submission is the request for funding four new foreign aid initiatives which together account for most of the $2.7 billion increase over regular FY2003 levels.
Combined, the Millennium Challenge Account (a new structure for delivering foreign aid), the State Department's Global AIDS Initiative, and two new contingency funds (Famine and Complex Crises), total $2.05 billion.
Other Foreign Operations programs are left with a more modest 4% increase.

Fighting the War on Terrorism.
Since the terrorist attacks in September 2001, American foreign aid programs have shifted focus toward more direct support for key coalition countries and global counter-terrorism efforts.
In total, Congress has appropriated approximately $17.9 billion in FY2002 and FY2003 Foreign Operations funding to assist the 26 "front-line" states in the war on terrorism, implement anti-terrorism training programs, and address the needs of post-conflict Iraq and other surrounding countries.
Nearly half of all Foreign Operations appropriations the past two years has gone for terrorism or Iraq war-related purposes.
The FY2004 budget continues the priority of fighting terrorism with $4.7 billion, or 25% of Foreign Operations resources assisting the front-line states.
Unlike a year ago when the President's FY2003 budget was viewed by many as an inadequate request, especially for Afghanistan, the FY2004 proposal includes substantial aid packages for a number of the front-line states.
Although the levels for most countries will not increase much beyond what was provided from regular FY2003 foreign aid funding, the request largely sustains amounts that have grown substantially during the past two years.
Anti-terrorism training and technical assistance programs also rise by 45% above FY2003 levels.
The FY2004 submission does not, however, include follow-on funding for Iraq relief and reconstruction.
Congress approved $2.5 billion in FY2003 supplemental resources, an amount many view as a down payment of long-term needs in Iraq.
With great uncertainty surrounding the costs of Iraq reconstruction, how much of the financial burden the United States will shoulder, and the process by the reconstruction operations will be managed, the Administration has not amended its pending FY2004 request to include additional amounts.
New Initiative: The Millennium Challenge Account.
The largest of the new initiatives is the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a program designed to radically transform the way the United States provides economic assistance to a small number of "best performing" developing nations.
The request for FY2004 is $1.3
CRS-12 billion with a promise that the MCA will grow to $5 billion by FY2006 and remain at least at that level in the future.
Some MCA supporters argue that the FY2004 level is too low, saying that the President pledged to implement the initiative in equal installments over three years and that an appropriation of $1.67 billion is what they had anticipated.
The Administration says that the added MCA funding will be in addition to and not a substitute for existing U.S. economic aid, but development advocates are concerned that given the tight budget environment, trade-offs between regular economic programs and the MCA may be required.
(See separate page under Funding and Policy Issues for more discussion of the MCA.)
New Initiative: The Global AIDS Initiative.
In his January 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush pledged to substantially increase U.S. financial assistance for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS, especially in the most heavily inflicted countries in Africa and the Caribbean.
The President promised $15 billion over 5 years, $10 billion of which would be money above and beyond current funding.
The Global AIDS Initiative, which will be housed in the State Department, represents a portion of that pledge -- $450 million in FY2004 -- that when combined with other resources managed by USAID and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), would raise total international HIV/AIDS resources in FY2004 to about $1.9 billion.
Some observers note, however, that this falls well short of the anticipated $3 billion per year implied in the President's speech and would represent only $500 million in new money to fight AIDS above the FY2003 level.
Some further question whether the State Department should be coordinator of international HIV/AIDS programs, as envisioned in the Initiative, rather than USAID or HHS.
(See separate page under Funding and Policy Issues for more discussion of the Global AIDS Initiative.)
New Initiative: The Famine Fund.
This new contingency fund, with $200 million requested for FY2004, would allow the Administration to provide, under more flexible authorities, emergency food and other disaster relief support as needs arise.
Executive officials argue that greater flexibility would permit them to respond rapidly to the human consequences of natural disasters and conflict without having to divert resources from other economic aid accounts.
Critics note, however, that the existing international disaster assistance account and P.L. 480 food aid program, plus legislative authorities that allow for temporary borrowing of funds from other aid accounts perform the same functions as the proposed Famine Fund and question whether it is necessary.
New Initiative: The U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Crises.
The Administration proposes to establish within the Executive Office of the President a $100 million contingency fund allowing the United States to respond quickly to unforseen complex foreign crises.
The resources would not be used to address victims of natural disasters, but rather would support peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations, including acts of ethnic cleansing, mass killing, or genocide.
In the past, Congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund over which it can apply little oversight.
The Administration had asked lawmakers to launch the Complex Crisis Fund with $150 million as part of the FY2003 Iraq War supplemental.
Congress, however, chose to defer consideration of establishing such a Fund until the FY2004 appropriation cycle, and instead
CRS-13 allocated the requested resources among various accounts for Iraq reconstruction and aid to regional states affected by the war.
Other Key Elements of the FY2003 Request.
Beyond these specific and prominent issues, the Foreign Operations proposal for FY2004 seeks to substantially increase aid activities in a few areas while cutting resources for several programs.
Significant appropriation increases when compared with regular FY2003 appropriations (excluding the Iraq War supplemental) include: !
Security assistance -- Economic Support Fund and Foreign Military Financing.
These two core security aid accounts that aim to support countries strategically important to the U.S., would grow by a combined $648 million, or 10% above regular FY2003 levels.
Much of the add-on is targeted for a $250 million security aid package for Turkey and a $145 million new Middle East Partnership Initiative.
Peace Corps funding would rise by $64 million, or 22% in an effort to place 10,000 volunteers by the end of FY2004 and to keep on track the President's longer term plan of having 14,000 Americans serving in the Peace Corps by FY2007.
Contributions to the World Bank and other international financial institutions would grow by $259 million, or 17%, covering all scheduled U.S. payments to the multilateral development banks, plus clearing $196 million of U.S. arrears owed to these institutions.
The request further includes an 18% increase for the World Bank's International Development Association and the African Development Fund as a "results-based Incentive Contribution" that had been promised last year if the banks implemented certain reforms.
Debt reduction, which received no funding in FY2003 except by a transfer of $40 million from another aid account, would grow to $395 million under the Administration's budget submission.
There are three components to the request: $300 million to cancel bilateral debt owed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative; $75 million as a contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund to make up for unanticipated shortfalls in implementing the program; and $20 million for the Tropical Forestry Conservation debt relief activity.
International narcotics control would grow by $89 million, or 45%, largely to expand significantly programs in Pakistan and Mexico.
The Administration further seeks $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI), an increase from the $700 million regular appropriation for FY2003.
The ACI proposal would generally restore amounts that were cut from the FY2003 request for Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela, and Panama.
!
!
!
!
CRS-14 The largest reduction proposed in the President's Foreign Operations budget targets assistance to Former Soviet states and Eastern Europe.
Collectively, aid to these countries would decline by $266 million, or 21% from current levels.
The request reflects a reorientation in the former Soviet aid account to focus more on Central Asian states, linked to the war on terrorism, and to begin the process of graduation for Russia and Ukraine.
Aid to these two nations would fall by 40% from FY2003 allocations.
The request further would cut Armenia's aid by nearly half, from $89 million to $49 million.
For Eastern Europe, aid levels would fall for nearly every recipient, with some of the largest reductions scheduled for Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia.
Funding for the Export-Import Bank would also decline under the President's budget -- from $565 million to $43 million in FY2004 (as re-estimated by CBO).
But because of substantial "carry-forward" resources that were not spent in prior years, Eximbank officials say that Bank lending can total $14.6 billion in FY2004, which is at least $2 billion higher than the anticipated level for FY2003.
Assessing the Administration's request for bilateral development and health assistance is more complicated and has led to varying interpretations.
With implementation of the President's new Global AIDS Initiative in FY2004, development and health resources, including funds from USAID's "core" accounts for development assistance and child survival/health, and the State Department's Global AIDS Initiative, would increase by $205 million, or 6.4% over regular FY2003 levels.
Depending on the purposes for which Millennium Challenge Account funds are spent, further additions to development and health programs might also be expected from MCA allocations.
But excluding the new Global AIDS Initiative and MCA from the equation, overall funding for USAID's two "core" accounts would decline in FY2004 by a combined $245 million, or 7.6%.
The implication of this reduction is that with the exception of HIV/AIDS, nearly all other development programs, including those for agriculture, basic education, family planning, malaria and tuberculosis, and democracy programs would be at or slightly below amounts allocated for FY2003.
Some critics charge that this violates the executive's pledge that MCA funding would be in addition to and not in place of continuing economic aid programs.
Others express concern that the growth in HIV/AIDS resources comes at the expense of other key health activities for which resources would decline.

Leading Foreign Aid Recipients Proposed for FY2004 Israel and Egypt remain the largest U.S. aid recipients, as they have been for many years.
However, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, foreign aid allocations have changed in several significant ways.
The request for FY2004 largely continues the patterns of aid distribution of the past two years.
Since September 11, the Administration has used economic and military assistance increasingly as a tool in efforts to maintain a cohesive international coalition to conduct the war on terrorism and to assist nations which have both supported U.S. forces and face serious terrorism threats themselves.
Pakistan, for example, a key coalition partner on the border with Afghanistan, had been ineligible for U.S. aid, other than humanitarian assistance, due to sanctions imposed after India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May 1998 and Pakistan experienced a military coup in 1999.
Since lifting aid sanctions in October 2001, the United States has transferred over $1.5 billion to Pakistan.
Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India also are among the top aid recipients as part of the network of "front-line" states in the war on terrorism.
CRS-16 The other major cluster of top recipients are those in the Andean region where the Administration maintains a large counternarcotics initiative that combines assistance to interdict and disrupt drug production, together with alternative development programs for areas that rely economically on the narcotics trade.
Several countries in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union -- Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia -- would continue to be among the top recipients, although at somewhat lower funding levels.

CRS-17
Iraq War Supplemental for FY2003 and Foreign Operations Funding On March 25, 2003, the President requested a nearly $75 billion FY2003 supplemental that included $7.6 billion for near-term Iraq reconstruction and relief, additional aid to coalition partners and other states cooperating in the global war on terrorism, and related USAID administrative expenses.
By comparison, the supplemental request totaled a little less than half of the $16.2 billion appropriated previously by Congress for FY2003 Foreign Operations activities.
The proposal, as detailed below in Table 6, was roughly divided into two components: Iraq relief and reconstruction (about $2.85 billion) and aid to coalition partners and other nations engaged in the war on terrorism (about $4.7 billion).4
Reconstruction Efforts Normally, it would be presumed that transfers for reconstruction and postconflict aid would be made to USAID, the State Department, and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies.
But with plans for the Defense Department to oversee the governing of Iraq immediately after the end of hostilities, the proposal stimulated immediate controversy.
A number of critics, including Members of Congress, argued that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the State Department and under the authorities of a broad and longstanding body of foreign aid laws.
They pointed out that during other recent reconstruction initiatives in Bosnia and Kosovo, resources and policy decisions flowed through the Secretary of State.
Others argued that groups which would play a significant role in post-war rehabilitation efforts -- non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foreign donors, and international organizations -- would be reluctant to take direction and funding from the U.S. military.
This, they contended, would hamper relief activities.
Furthermore, the placement of reconstruction funding in a Presidential account appeared to grant the White House significant discretion in responding to changing and unanticipated demands, unencumbered by specific programmatic allocations.
The Administration said only that $543 million would cover humanitarian expenses, $1.7 billion would be set aside for reconstruction needs, and up to $200 million would be available to reimburse foreign aid accounts from which funds were drawn prior to the conflict.
As with other parts of the supplemental dealing with defense and homeland security resources, the White House wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of the appropriations so that it could respond to changing circumstances and unanticipated contingencies.
Executive officials, who acknowledged that some or all of the funding would be transferred to DOD, argued that the military would be best situated following the conflict to immediately launch the reconstruction efforts.
Moreover, the Administration noted that the Defense office in charge of reconstruction operations would most likely re-direct most of the
OMB documents estimated the total amount for Iraq reconstruction was $3.5 billion, a figure that included nearly $500 million from DOD funding for the repair of oil facilities.
4
CRS-18 resources to the State Department and USAID who would then be responsible for managing rehabilitation projects.
Officials further argued that it was too early to identify specific reconstruction activities and that it was possible to only provide the most general outlines of how the money would be spent until assessment teams could report on the extent of needs throughout the country.
Congressional Action on Iraq Reconstruction.
As cleared by Congress, H.R. 1559 appropriates $2.475 billion for the Relief and Reconstruction Fund, slightly higher than requested.
The President will be able to apportion Fund resources directly to five federal agencies: the Departments of Defense, State, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and USAID.
In previous congressional debate, the House and Senate had each expressed their expectations that these funds would be channeled to the Secretary of State, and in most instances, further directed to USAID.
The report accompanying S. 762 specifically noted that the funds were not expected to be transferred to the Secretary of Defense.
Nevertheless, the White House continued to argue for greater flexibility and authority to place reconstruction resources under DOD auspices, and ultimately conference committee members agreed.

Although the enacted supplemental does not set a specific level for this country, the Administration has allocated the full amount requested.

Due to Congressional reductions in overall ESF funding and increases for Afghanistan and the Philippines, the Administrations allocated $100 million for MEPI.
House bill funded an Islamic Partnership and Outreach Program.
The Administration requested funds for 10 Central European nations but has altered the list of recipients and the allocation of military grants following enactment of the supplemental, as follows: Poland ($15 million requested and allocated); Hungary ($15 million requested; $8 million allocated); Czech Republic ($15 million requested and allocated); Estonia ($2.5 million requested, $2.75 million allocated); Latvia ($2.5 requested, $2.75 million allocated); Slovakia ($6 million requested, $6.5 million allocated); Romania ($15 million requested and allocated); Slovenia ($5 million requested, $0 allocated ); Lithuania ($3.5 million requested, $4 million allocated); Bulgaria ($5 million requested, $10 million allocated); Albania $0 requested, $3 million allocated); Macedonia ($0 requested, $1 allocated); and Ukraine ($0 requested, $1.5 million allocated).
CRS-23 The enacted bill further directs higher and more specific amounts that should be used to replenish several foreign aid accounts that had been drawn upon in order to preposition food and medicine stocks in the region and for other pre-conflict humanitarian purposes.
The conference agreement directs "full and prompt" reimbursement of USAID and State Department accounts from the Iraq Fund.
The supplemental provides $143.8 million for international disaster assistance, $112.5 million of which will restore funds diverted previously for Iraq.
The remaining balance will augment USAID disaster relief resources to respond to foreign contingencies that may arise through the end of FY2003.
Similarly, Congress increased the State Department's refugee reserve account from the $50 million requested to $80 million in order to address needs in the Persian Gulf region as well as other global requirements.
International Assistance The Administration's supplemental appropriation proposal, which was only slightly modified by Congress, provided about $4.7 billion in additional aid to 23 countries and regional programs that are contributing to the war in Iraq and cooperating in the global fight against terrorism.
See the table below for a complete list of proposed recipients.
Among the largest and most complex aid packages would be: !
Jordan -- $700 million in economic grants and $406 million in military transfers.
This would be on top of Jordan's regular $452 aid package from the U.S. Israel -- $1 billion in supplemental military aid (on top of the $2.7 billion regular FY2003 assistance) and $9 billion in economic loans guaranteed by the U.S. government over the next three years.
Israel would pay all costs -- fees that may total several hundred millions of dollars -- associated with these economic stabilization loans.
Conditions on how the funds would be spent, similar to those that were applied in the early 1990s when Israel drew on a $10 billion U.S.-backed loan package, would be employed.
Turkey -- $1 billion for economic grants which could be applied to fees associated with $8.5 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees.
Afghanistan -- $325 million in economic grants, anti-terrorism, demining, and military transfers.
This would be in addition to roughly $350 million already scheduled for Afghanistan this year.
Egypt -- $300 million for economic grants, a portion of which could be used to gain access to up to $2 billion in loan guarantees.
Depending on the terms of the loan, if Egypt chose to receive the full $2 billion, about $120 million or more of the $300 million would be applied to the costs faced by the United States of guaranteeing the loans.
The Administration further proposed to reprogram $379.6 million in previously appropriated commodity import program aid to Egypt as a cash transfer.
The supplemental would come on top of $1.9 billion in regular U.S. aid to Egypt.
!
!
!
!
CRS-24 !
Pakistan -- $200 million in military grants and law enforcement assistance.
Pakistan currently receives $305 million in FY2003.
The Administration further requested $150 million to initiate a U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Emergencies, a contingency account that would allow the President to address quickly unforseen needs of coalition partners.
The Fund, which would be managed by the White House, had originally been proposed for an FY2004 startup of $100 million.
Congressional Action on International Assistance.
H.R. 1559, as approved, includes $4.52 billion in additional aid to countries and regional programs, about $180 million less than requested.
Nearly all of this reduction, however, comes from Congress' decision not to fund the President's $150 million emergency account for complex crises.
In most other cases, the Administration has been able to allocate these foreign aid resources as it had intended.
Congress earmarked funding at the requested levels for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan, while adding resources for Afghanistan and the Philippines.
Turkey may receive "not to exceed" $1 billion in aid that is conditioned on a requirement for the Secretary of State to certify that Turkey is cooperating with the United States in Operation Iraqi Freedom (including facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid into Iraq), and has not unilaterally deployed forces in northern Iraq.
The restriction on Turkey's aid package, the size of which could grow to $8.5 billion if the loan option is implemented, combines text in House and Senate-passed bills.
Earlier, the House had defeated two amendments that would have eliminated aid to Turkey or reduced it by $207 million.
For Israeli loan guarantees, the enacted supplemental includes the full $9 billion proposal, but adds conditions not included in the Administration's proposal.
Loans may be issued in $3 billion allotments in each of FY2003 to FY2005, a provision that will allow the President to reduce disbursements in the second and third years if Israel violates any of the loan conditions.
One such condition added by Congress prohibits loan resources from supporting any activity in geographic areas that were not administered by Israel prior to June 5, 1967.
This is similar to a condition attached to the 1992 $10 billion loan guaranty package for Israel, some of which was not disbursed because of continued Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank area.

Amount is earmarked or recommended in the enacted supplemental appropriation.
The enacted supplemental appropriation provides $167 million.
The enacted supplement appropriation includes $30 million for economic aid for the Philippines.
Following enacted of the supplemental, the Administration has modified its plans to allocate funds for this recipient.
See footnote "i" in Table 6, above, for the allocated amounts.
CRS-26 While most of the President's request for international assistance is supported in the enacted emergency supplemental, the Administration had to reduce economic assistance in one instance.
Congress cut Economic Support Fund appropriations by $20 million, but because of earmarks and additions for Afghanistan and the Philippines, and $10 million to investigate possible Iraqi leadership war crimes, executive officials had $100 million less than requested in economic assistance for countries not protected by legislative directives.
Non-earmarked programs included $50 million for the Palestinians, $25 million for Djibouti, and $200 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative.
The Administration chose to fully allocate amounts for the Palestinians and Djibouti, but cut resources for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (including Muslim Outreach) to $100 million, half of the level requested.
The State Department also chose to modify its distribution of military aid grants to several Central Europe states.
Most significantly, the executive branch decided to add funds (not requested) for Albania, Macedonia, and Ukraine, and increase amounts above the requested levels for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria.
As off-sets, the State Department cut funds for Hungary and eliminated the $5 million request for Slovenia.
These alterations appear to reflect Administration views on the extent to which selected countries supported or did not support U.S. operations in Iraq.
See footnote "i" in Table 6 above for specific amounts allocated to each recipient.
DOD Authorities to Provide Military Aid Under sections relating to Defense Department funds and authorities, the supplemental proposed two items that drew particular congressional attention.
The key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight and the State Department's traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resource allocations.
They were both similar to proposals made last year in the FY2002 supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized by Congress.
The first would provide $1.4 billion for the Defense Department, "notwithstanding any provision of law," to pay Jordan, Pakistan, and other nations that have provided logistical and military-related support to U.S. military operations in Iraq or in the global war on terrorism.
In the past, Defense officials argue, competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends that provide services to American forces.
Congress approved funding in the FY2002 supplemental for this purpose, but included a 15-day prior notification requirement that is not part of the FY2003 supplemental draft legislation.
The more controversial authority concerned DOD's request for $150 million to support "indigenous forces" assisting U.S. military operations, including those aimed at the global war on terrorism.
Decisions to draw on these funds would be made by the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State.
The Defense Department defines indigenous forces as "irregular forces and resistance movements" and notes that such forces "generally conduct military and para-military operations in enemy-held or hostile territory and conduct direct offensive low-
CRS-27 intensity, cover, or clandestine operations."5 Although it was unclear from the budget justification and bill text exactly what groups and under what scenarios the Administration would utilize these resources, a senior Administration official suggested that the intent was to have resources available for groups in Iraq.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage testified on March 27 that because of the uncertainty of the war's duration, it might be necessary to transfer additional arms and equipment to Kurdish and other forces, and that the $150 million would provide a "hedge" in case of a more prolonged conflict.
In last year's supplemental appropriation debate, DOD asked for $30 million to support indigenous forces, funds that would be exclusively under the control of the Secretary of Defense.
Congress rejected the proposal, however.
At that time, the House Appropriations Committee observed in deleting the request that the Secretary of State's primary responsibility over U.S. military assistance programs is well established and that the Administration had the necessary authorities under existing foreign aid laws to undertake the requested activities.6 Congressional Action on DOD Authorities.
H.R. 1559, as enacted, provides the $1.4 billion for nations supporting U.S. military operations in the global war on terrorism, but does not authorize the $150 million for aid to indigenous forces.
Selected Major Issues in the FY2004 Foreign Operations Debate W foreign several include hile the Foreign Operations appropriations bill can include virtually any policy issue of interest to Congress, the annual debate usually focuses on major policy and spending issues.
Among those for FY2004 are likely to the following.
Combating Terrorism Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the initiation of military operations in Afghanistan, combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of American foreign assistance.
Indeed, Secretary of State Powell has said at several 2003 congressional hearings that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the FY2004 Foreign Operations request.
While there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism, most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing poverty, promoting jobs and educational opportunities, and helping stabilize conflict-prone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause.

H.Rept.
107-480, May 22, 2002.
CRS-28 than $5.9 billion to 26 so-called "front-line" states in the global war on terrorism in immediate post-September 11 and FY2002 appropriations, while FY2003 regular and supplemental spending bills have provided $7.1 billion.
The Administration proposes $4.8 billion for the "front-line" states in FY2004.
(None of these figures includes post-conflict reconstruction assistance for Iraq which totals about $2.5 billion.)
While increased levels of foreign aid are only one sign of the importance the United States assigns to the support provided by these front-line states, the amounts allocated since September 11 are in sharp contrast to the $3.4 billion provided to these 26 countries prior to the attacks in regular FY2001 appropriations.
Additional economic and military assistance has been particularly evident in a few countries, including Jordan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Oman, Yemen, and Djibouti.
Foreign aid can be programmed in a number of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism.
Assistance can be transferred, as has occurred in Pakistan and Afghanistan, to bolster efforts of a coalition-partner government, to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups, and to promote better health care, education, and employment opportunities to its people.
Security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internally-based terrorist movements.
While there has been congressional support for additional foreign aid resources aimed at countering terrorism, some warn that the United States needs to be cautious about the risks of creating a close aid relationship with governments that may have questionable human rights records, are not accountable to their people, and are possibly corrupt.
Some Members have been especially critical of Administration efforts to include in aid proposals for "front-line" states legislative language that would waive all existing restrictions and prohibitions on the transfers.
Instead, these critics argue, the Administration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with a country aid program and seek a congressional waiver for those particular problems.
For example, in late 2001 when the Administration wanted to provide Pakistan with $600 million in fast-disbursing economic aid, instead of providing a blanket waiver of legislative obstacles, Congress approved in P.L. 107-57 specific waivers of aid prohibitions that applied to countries that engaged in missile proliferation, whose leaders came to power through a military coup, and which were behind in debt payments to the United States.

Countries are listed in order of the size of aid provided and requested since September 11, 2001.
Amounts include funds appropriated for programs under jurisdiction of the Foreign Operations spending measure, plus food assistance provided in the Agriculture appropriation bill.
a. FY2001 pre-September 11 are amounts allocated from regular FY2001 appropriations.
FY2001 post-September 11 are amounts distributed from the Emergency Response Fund, funding for which was provided in P.L. 107-38, enacted in September 2001.
Beyond substantial amounts of bilateral aid for "front-line" states, the Foreign Operations appropriation bill funds several global programs specifically aimed at anti-terrorism efforts overseas and the provision of security for USAID employees living abroad.
Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA).
Since FY1984, the State Department has maintained the ATA program designed to maximize international cooperation in
CRS-30 the battle against global terrorism.
Through training, equipment transfers, and advice, the ATA program is intended to strengthen anti-terrorism capabilities of foreign law enforcement and security officials.
Since its initiation in 1984, over 23,000 officials from 112 countries have participated in ATA projects.
ATA funding is included within the Foreign Operations account of Non-proliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR).
Resources for the $38 million annual ATA program (FY2001) rose sharply following September 11, with an additional $45.5 million allocated out of the Terrorism Emergency Response Fund.
Congress approved $38 million for FY2002 and $64.2 million for FY2003.
Increased funding for FY2003 is intended to finance three ATA program strategies: ! ! !
expanding existing U.S.-based training activities; initiating new in-country programs in participant nations; and adding program flexibility to respond rapidly to changing global circumstances.
For FY2004, the State Department seeks $106.4 million for ATA programs, up nearly two-thirds from existing levels.
Most FY2004 training will continue for training of officials from the "front-line" states, with a focus on in-country training in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Indonesia.
The ATA program further plans to launch a Mobile Emergency Training Teams (METT) initiative ($10 million) which will deliver in-country instruction for VIP protection, bomb squads, and crisis response operations.
The State Department had planned to begin METT in FY2002 but reprogrammed a $20 million appropriation in order to provide protective service for Afghan President Karzai.
Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP).
As one response to the 1998 bombings of American embassies in East Africa, the State Department launched the TIP, an activity intended to restrict the ability of terrorists to cross international borders, launch attacks, and escape.
TIP strengthens border security systems in particularly vulnerable countries by installing border monitoring technology, training border security and immigration officials in its use, and expanding access to international criminal information to participating nations.
Like ATA, funds for TIP are part of the NADR account in the Foreign Operations spending bill.
Since September 11, the State Department has expanded from 34 to 60 the number of countries where it believes TIP would immediately contribute to the global counterterrorism campaign.
The $4 million TIP budget doubled for FY2001 following September 11, and grew to $14 million in FY2002.
After falling back to $5 million for FY2003, the request for FY2004 is $11 million.
The Administration plans to expand operations in up to ten new countries with the additional resources.
Counterterrorism Engagement with Allies.
Following the September 11 attacks, the United States began to conduct Senior Official Policy Workshops and multilateral conferences in order to better respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction overseas.
With $3 million from emergency FY2002 supplemental spending, the State Department conducted workshops in 18 countries as well as several regional conferences.
The $2.5 million budget request for FY2004
CRS-31 would finance ten scheduled workshops, including three in Greece in advance of the 2004 Olympic games.
Terrorist Financing.
In December 2001, an interagency review group identified 19 countries where a significant terrorist financing threat existed, and with $3 million allocated from the Emergency Response Fund, launched a training and technical assistance program.
The State Department allocated $10 million out of the FY2002 supplemental appropriation to expand the program, while the Treasury Department is utilizing approximately half of its $10 million FY2003 "Technical Assistance" program for these purposes.
In FY2004, Treasury proposes $5 million for combating terrorist financing activities.
USAID Physical Security.
USAID maintains about 97 overseas facilities where much of its workforce -- including both Americans and foreign nationals -- is located.
Many missions are based in places where there is a high threat of terrorist activity, and especially since the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, agency officials have been concerned about insuring adequate security.
In countries where USAID is or is scheduled to be co-located with the U.S. embassy, the State Department's Foreign Buildings Operations office had been responsible for financing USAID secure facilities.
These funds are appropriated in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations.
Nevertheless, there have been serious construction delays for USAID co-located facilities -- especially in Uganda -- due to competing State Department building priorities and conflicting congressional directives.
In an effort to overcome these problems, USAID requested for FY2003 a new Foreign Operations account -- the Capital Investment Fund -- that would support enhanced information technology ($13 million) and facility construction ($82 million) specifically at co-located sites where security enhancements are needed.
USAID planned to use the money in FY2003 for construction projects in Kenya, Guinea, Cambodia, and Georgia.
Congress, however, reduced funding for this account to $43 million, with $30 million assumed for Kenya and $10 million for a new facility in Afghanistan.
With reductions made to the FY2003 request, USAID is proposing a $146.3 million Capital Investment Fund request for FY2004.
Of the total, $20 million will support information technology needs, while the balance will finance construction of seven co-located facilities where the State Department is already building new embassies.
In addition to Guinea, Cambodia, and Georgia, which went unfunded in FY2003, USAID requests resources for co-located missions in Zimbabwe, Armenia, Mali, and Uganda.
For construction of co-located missions at embassies where building will begin in FY2004 or later, resources for USAID facilities will be drawn from State Department appropriations under the Capital Surcharge Proposal.
Security upgrades for the 64 overseas missions situated some distance from American embassies have been provided out of USAID operating expenses, a Foreign Operations account that has been under funding stress in recent years due to agency relocation costs in Washington, D.C., replacement of failed financial management systems, and dwindling non-appropriated trust funds used to finance some in-country costs.
As a result, security upgrades for some USAID missions have
CRS-32 been deferred due to funding shortfalls.
For FY2003, USAID estimates that it will spend $7.1 million for security needs out of its operations account, compared to $6.75 million in FY2002.
USAID is requesting the same amount -- $7.1 million -- for FY2004 as it has available this year.
Aid Restrictions for Terrorist States.
Annual Foreign Operations spending bills routinely include general provisions prohibiting U.S. assistance to countries engaged in terrorist activities or providing certain types of support to terrorist groups.
Included in the FY2003 funding measure are two: !
Sec. 527 prohibits bilateral U.S. assistance to any country that the President determines grants sanctuary from prosecution to any individual or group which has committed an act of international terrorism, or otherwise supports international terrorism.
The President could waive the restrictions for national security or humanitarian reasons.
Sec. 543 prohibits U.S. aid to a government which provides lethal military equipment to a country that the Secretary of State has determined is headed by a terrorist supporting government.
The President could waive the requirement if it is important to U.S. national interests.
!
Despite these restrictions, however, certain types of humanitarian foreign assistance may be provided "notwithstanding" other provisions of law, which would override the terrorism restrictions.
Disaster and refugee relief, child survival and HIV/AIDS programs, emergency food and medicine, and demining operations are among the categories of U.S. assistance that could potentially be provided to a country that would otherwise be ineligible.
Millennium Challenge Account In a speech on March 14, 2002, at the Inter-American Development Bank, President Bush outlined a proposal for the United States to increase foreign economic assistance beginning in FY2004 so that by FY2006 American aid would be $5 billion higher than three years earlier.
The funds would be placed in a new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and be available to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas: ! !
!
Ruling justly -- promoting good governance, fighting corruption, respecting human rights, and adhering to the rule of law.
Investing in people -- providing adequate health care, education, and other opportunities promoting an educated and healthy population.
Fostering enterprise and entrepreneurship -- promoting open markets and sustainable budgets.
If fully implemented, the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half a century, outpaced only by the Marshall Plan following
CRS-33 World War II and the Latin America-focused Alliance for Progress in the early 1960s.
The concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principles and policies.
Conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipient nations is not new to U.S. aid programs.
Since the late 1980s at least, portions of American development assistance have been allocated to some degree on a performance-based system.
What is different about the MCA is the size of the commitment; the competitive process that will reward countries for what they have already achieved not just what is promised for the future; the pledge to segregate the funds from U.S. strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influence where U.S. aid is spent; and to the decision to solicit program proposals developed solely by qualifying countries.
If Congress fully funds the President's MCA request and assuming that FY2003 will be the baseline from which to compare growth in foreign aid spending during implementation of the MCA, a $5 billion increase by FY2006 would result in a $17.2 billion foreign aid budget.
In real terms (constant FY2003 dollars), taking into the account the estimated effects of inflation, U.S. economic assistance in FY2006 would be $16.14 billion, the highest amount since FY1979 and the signing of the Camp David Middle East peace accords, and FY1985, an unusual year in which the United States responded to special Middle East economic stabilization and African famine requirements.
The nominal increase between FY2003 and FY2006 would be about 41%, while in real terms, FY2006 funding would be nearly 32% more.
These figures are less than Administration claims of a 50% increase in funding due to the MCA, a figure that is apparently calculated using the $10 billion aid level in FY2000 as the base year.
Because of the size of the U.S. economy and continued growth projected over the next several years, the MCA increases will have minimal impact on the amount of U.S. aid as a percent of GDP.
According to current projections, assistance would rise from the 2002 level of 0.11% of GDP to 0.13%.
During the first year of the MCA, participation will be limited to the 74 poorest nations that are eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association and have per capita incomes below $1,435.
The list will expand to include all lower-middle income countries by FY2006 with per capita incomes below $2,975.
Participants will be selected largely based on 16 performance indicators related to the three categories of good governance, economic freedom, and investing in people.
Countries that score above the median on half of the indicators in each of the three areas will qualify.
Emphasizing the importance of fighting corruption, however, should a country fall below the median on the corruption indicator (based on the World Bank Institute's Control of Corruption measure), it will be automatically disqualified from consideration.
To manage the MCA, the Administration has proposed the creation of a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a new independent government entity separate from the Departments of State and the Treasury and from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
The White House envisions a staff of about 100, drawn from various government agencies and non-governmental organizations, led by a CEO confirmed by the Senate.
A review board, chaired by the Secretary of
CRS-34 State and composed of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of OMB, would oversee operations of the MCC.
The decision to house the MCA in a new organization has been one of the most debated issues during early congressional deliberations of the President's foreign aid initiative.
The Administration argues that because the MCA represents a new concept in aid delivery, it should have a "fresh" organizational structure, unencumbered by bureaucratic authorities and regulations that would interfere in effective management.
Critics, however, contend that if the MCA is placed outside the formal U.S. government foreign aid structure, it will lead to further fragmentation of policy development and consistency.
Some believe USAID, the principal U.S. aid agency, should manage the MCA, while others say that the MCA should reside in the State Department where more U.S. foreign policy entities have been integrated in recent years.
At least, some argue, the USAID Administrator should be a member of the MCC Board, possibly in place of the OMB Director.
For FY2004, the Administration seeks $1.3 billion for the MCA's first year and remains committed to a $5 billion budget by FY2006.
Some believe, however, that the FY2004 request is less than promised a year ago.
At the time, Administration officials implied that funding might be phased in over three years in equal increments, resulting in a $1.67 billion program in FY2004, a $3.34 billion level in FY2005, and $5 billion in FY2006.
In the President's budget submission this year, however, budget officials say the pace at which resources will rise was never specifically set, and that only the $5 billion target for FY2006 is a firm commitment.
Congressional Action.
In legislation related to the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, Senate and House authorizing committees have reported bills establishing the Millennium Challenge Account.
On May 29, 2003, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported S. 1160, legislation providing $1 billion for the MCA in FY2004, $2.3 billion in FY2005, and $5 billion in FY2006.
On a vote of 11-8, the Committee further approved an amendment by Senators Biden and Hagel that would establish the MCA inside the State Department under the direction of the Secretary of State.
The legislation abandons the separate corporation proposal put forward by the Administration.
Secretary of State Powell wrote the Committee saying he would advise the President to veto the legislation if this provision to locate the MCA in the State Department remained in the bill.7 S. 1160 also would permit low-middle income nations to participate in the MCA program only if appropriations in FY2006 and beyond exceed $5 billion annually.
In such years, these relatively wealthier countries may compete for only 20% of the total appropriation.
In many other areas, however, the legislation adopts most of the broad concepts recommended by the executive.
7
Chairman Lugar, who opposed the Biden-Hagel amendment, has proposed an alternative structure in new legislation.
S. 1240, as introduced on June 11, would create a Millennium Challenge Corporation within the State Department, under the authority of the Secretary of State, but with the same degree of independence and status as USAID.
A Board of Directors would include the Secretary of State (Chairman), the Secretary of the Treasury, the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the MCC CEO.
CRS-35 On June 12, the House International Relations Committee reported an MCA authorizing measure -- H.R. 2441 -- containing significant differences with the Senate and the Administration.
The legislation authorizes $1.3 billion for FY2004, as requested, $3 billion for FY2005, and $5 billion for FY2006.
Unlike the Senate measure, H.R. 2441 creates a new Millennium Challenge Corporation sought by the President, but alters the composition of the Board of Directors and the authority of the MCC's Chief Executive Officer.
The Board, as designed under H.R. 2441, includes the Secretary of State as Chairman and the Secretary of the Treasury, as proposed, but deletes the Director of OMB and adds the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the CEO of the MCC.
The bill also includes four additional members, to be appointed by the President from a list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate.
The Board would further include as non-voting ex-officio members the CEO of OPIC, and the Directors of the Trade and Development Agency, Peace Corps, and OMB.
Additionally, H.R. 2441 designates the CEO of the Corporation as the individual responsible for determining eligible countries rather than the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Administration.
The House bill allows low-middle income countries to participate in the MCA beginning in FY2006 regardless of the amount of money appropriated, but limits the allocation to these relatively wealthier countries to 20% of MCA assistance.
Table 9 summarizes these and other differences among Senate, House, and Administration proposals.

Development Assistance, Global Health Priorities, and HIV/AIDS A continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and Congress is how to allocate the roughly $3.2 billion "core" budget for USAID development assistance and global health programs.
Among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supporting child survival, basic education, and efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.
The Administration has also backed these programs, but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors.
Most recently during the FY2003 and FY2004 budget cycles, some Members of Congress have argued that it has been the executive branch that has added funds for Administration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities.
In years when Congress has increased appropriations for its priorities, but not included a corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget, resources for other aid sectors, such as economic growth and the environment, have been substantially reduced.
This was more problematic during the mid-to-late 1990s when world-wide development aid funding fell significantly.
In more recent years, and especially for FY2003, Congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for non-earmarked activities.
Nevertheless, Administration officials continue to argue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances.
In 2001, the Bush Administration set out revised USAID core goals for sustainable development programs focused around three "spheres of emphasis" or "strategic pillars" that include Global Health, Economic Growth and Agriculture, and Conflict Prevention and Developmental Relief.
The Administration further introduced a new initiative -- the Global Development Alliance (GDA) -- in an effort to expand public/private partnerships in development program implementation.
Under the initiative, USAID identifies good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations, non-governmental organizations, universities, and for-profit organizations, and provides parallel financing to leverage resources already committed to these activities.
USAID officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of a coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these non-governmental development partners.
Although it started out as a much more ambitious project -- USAID requested $160 million for FY2002 -- the GDA has received relatively modest funding allocations: $20 million in FY2002 and $14.9 million in FY2003.
The FY2004 request seeks $15 million.
Underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elevation by the Administration of the value of foreign economic assistance as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
President Bush has announced plans to launch two major foreign aid initiatives -- the Millennium Challenge Account and the Global AIDS Initiative -- that if approved by Congress, would significantly boost
CRS-39 funding for development assistance programs.
Moreover, the President's September 2002 National Security Strategy established global development, for the first time, as the third "pillar" of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy.
For FY2004, the President seeks a substantial increase in overall development assistance, although the programs are configured differently than they have been in the past, raising questions in some observers' minds about the Administration's commitment to broad-based, worldwide development.
For "core" development assistance -- programs that match the current structure of USAID's "strategic pillars" and Foreign Operations appropriation accounts for Development Assistance and Child Survival and Health Program Fund -- the Administration proposes $2.96 billion, as shown in Table 10.
This represents a $245 million, or 7.7% reduction from current amounts for FY2003.
With the exception of HIV/AIDS, democracy programs, and to a far less extent agriculture and economic growth activities, all other development sectors would receive less funding in FY2004 than appropriated for FY2003.

Two new initiatives proposed for FY2004 that would be managed outside of USAID "core development" programs, however, push overall U.S. development assistance well above FY2003 levels.
With the additions of the Global AIDS Initiative and the Millennium Challenge Account, for which $450 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, are requested, total development aid in FY2004 would grow to $4.7 billion, or 47% higher than FY2003 amounts.
CRS-40 While development assistance supporters applaud the increases sought for the new initiatives, they remain concerned over the reductions proposed for USAID's "core" development accounts.
The latter are worldwide activities that serve multiple development needs in over 55 countries that range from nations with a sound commitment to economic and democratic reforms, to countries emerging from conflict, to failed states that confront humanitarian crises.
The HIV/AIDS and MCA proposals, on the other hand, are more narrowly focused.
The Global AIDS Initiative, implementing prevention, treatment, and care projects, will be focused largely on 14 priority countries in Africa and the Caribbean.
The Millennium Challenge Account will likely support programs in the first year in perhaps as few as 5-8 "best-performing"countries that have demonstrated progress in the areas of governance, economic freedom, and social investments in people.
The Administration further had said that funding for the MCA would be in addition, not a substitute for continuing "core" development resources.
Critics charge that the FY2004 budget request violates that pledge by cutting amounts for the "core" programs.
What some observers find most problematic about the FY2004 development assistance request is that increases for selected areas, especially those for HIV/AIDS, to some extent result from reductions in other development programs.
(See Table 11.)
Among health programs, each sub-sector is cut, except for HIV/AIDS.
Funding for other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria, would fall by onethird under the President's budget request, child survival activities would be cut by 11%, reproductive health would drop by 5%, and vulnerable child programs would be reduced from $27 million to $10 million.
The Administration recommended similar reductions in its FY2003 budget request last year, but Congress restored most of the funds that would have been lost under the President's recommendation.
For example, USAID had sought $110 million out of the Child Survival and Health Program Fund account for FY2003, an amount that rose to $154.5 million due to subsequent congressional additions in the Foreign Operations appropriation.
Aside from global health programs, USAID proposes a mix of budget increases and cuts for other "core" development sectors.
Those scheduled for higher spending include: ! ! !
Agriculture programs would increase by 4% to $261 million.
Economic growth activities, including trade and investment programs, would rise less than 1%.
Democracy and local governance would grow by 20%, although large increases for Afghanistan and Pakistan would leave similar programs in Africa and Latin America below FY2003 levels.
Funding for other "core" development areas would fall: ! !
!
Environmental activities would drop by 6% to $286 million.
Basic education, a high congressional priority for a number of years, would fall by 2% to $212 million, and resources for higher education would be cut by 17%.
Human rights and conflict prevention programs would be reduced collectively by over one-third.
CRS-41 Resources for some or all of these sectors, however, could rise, and in some cases significantly, when MCA programs are selected.
The $1.3 billion sought by the President in FY2004 would be allocated among a selected few "best performing," low income countries, supporting the highest development priority identified by the participant nation.

In other areas, however, especially economic growth , agriculture, and democracy, a sizable amount of resources are drawn from these non-"core" accounts.
Because USAID does not have data estimating for FY2003 how much each sector will receive across all appropriation accounts, it is only possible to draw comparisons for "core" development aid resources.

International HIV/AIDS.
By far, the largest growth area for development assistance is for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs (Table 12).
Resources requested under the Foreign Operations bill for HIV/AIDS in FY2004 total $1.24 billion, a 41% increase over $882 million appropriated for FY2003.
Moreover, the Administration is seeking another $680 million for international HIV/AIDS from non-Foreign Operations accounts, most importantly for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded under the Labor/HHS/Education appropriation bill.
The total request across all appropriation measures for FY2004 is $1.92 billion.
(The Administration frequently uses a total of $2 billion in its estimates of FY2004 funds requested for international HIV/AIDS programs.
These executive estimates include USAID resources for tuberculosis and malaria that are not calculated in the $1.92 billion level shown in Table 12.)
A controversial issue likely to arise during congressional consideration is the President's decision to propose $200 million for the Global Fund -- $100 million each from Foreign Operations and Labor/HHS/Education.
For FY2003, Congress raised the U.S. contribution to $350 million and subsequently authorized "up to" $1 billion for FY2004 in P.L. 108-25, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.

The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriation Act (P.L. 108-7) required an across-the-board rescission of 0.65% for each account, an amount not calculated in these figures.
International Family Planning and UNFPA Funding U.S. population assistance and family planning programs overseas have sparked continuous controversy during Foreign Operations debates for nearly two decades.
For FY2004, the Administration requests $425 million for bilateral population assistance, the same as proposed last year, but below the $446.5 million appropriated by Congress for FY2003.
Although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by Congress, the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of Foreign Operations bills have focused on two matters: whether the United States should contribute to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) if the organization maintains a program in China where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years, and whether abortion-related restrictions should be applied to bilateral USAID population aid grants (commonly known as the "Mexico City" policy).
UNFPA Funding.
The most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question, but most recent attention has focused on UNFPA and a White House decision in July 2002 to block the $34 million U.S. contribution to the organization.
During the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the United States did not contribute to UNFPA because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in China where UNFPA maintains programs.
In 1985, Congress passed the so-called Kemp-Kasten amendment which has been made part of every Foreign Operations appropriation since, barring U.S. funds to any organization that supports or participates "in the management" of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.
In 1993, President Clinton determined that UNFPA, despite its presence in China, was not involved in the management of a coercive program.
In most years since 1993, Congress has appropriated about $25 million for UNFPA, but added a directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much UNFPA spent in China.
Consequently, the U.S. contribution has fluctuated between $21.5 million and $25 million.
For FY2002, President Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA.
As part of a larger package concerning various international family planning issues, Congress provided in the FY2002 Foreign Operations bill "not more than" $34 million for UNFPA.
While members of the Appropriations Committees say it was their intent to provide the full $34 million, the language allowed the President to allocate however much he chose, up to a $34 million ceiling.
According to February 27,
CRS-44 2002, testimony by Arthur Dewey, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in Chinese counties where UNFPA concentrates its programs.
A September 2001 investigation team, sponsored by the Population Research Institute, concluded that a consistent pattern of coercion continued in "model" UNFPA counties, including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations.
Refuting these findings, a UNFPA-commissioned review team found in October 2001 "absolutely no evidence that the UN Population Fund supports coercive family planning practices in China or violates the human rights of Chinese people in any way."
(See House International Relations Committee hearing, Coercive Population Control in China: New Evidence of Forced Abortion and Forced Sterilization, October 17, 2001.
See also testimony of Josephine Guy and Nicholaas Biegman before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, February 27, 2002.)
Although most observers agree that coercive family planning practices continue in China, differences remain over the extent to which, if any, UNFPA supports involuntary activities and whether UNFPA should operate at all in a country where such conditions exist.
Given the conflicting reports, the State Department sent its own investigative team to China for a two-week review of UNFPA programs on May 13, 2002.
The team, which was led by former Ambassador William Brown and included Bonnie Glick, a former State Department official, and Dr. Theodore Tong, a public health professor at the University of Arizona, made three findings and recommendations in its report dated May 31: Findings: ! There is no evidence that UNFPA "knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization" in China; ! China maintains coercive elements in its population programs; and ! Chinese leaders view "population control as a high priority" and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change.
Recommendations: The United States should release not more than $34 million of previously appropriated funds to UNFPA; ! Until China ends all forms of coercion in law and practice, no U.S. government funds should be allocated to population programs in China; and ! Appropriate resources, possibly from the United States, should be allocated to monitor and evaluate Chinese population control programs.
!
Despite the team's recommendation to release the $34 million, Secretary of State Powell decided on July 22, 2002, to withhold funds to UNFPA and to recommend that they be re-directed to other international family planning and reproductive health activities.
(The authority to make this decision had been delegated previously by the President to the Secretary of State.)
The State
CRS-45 Department's analysis of the Secretary's determination found that even though UNFPA did not "knowingly" support or participate in a coercive practice, that alone would not preclude the application of Kemp-Kasten.
Instead, a finding that the recipient of U.S. funds -- in this case UNFPA -- simply supports or participates in such a program, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would trigger the restriction.
The team found that the Chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government, a practice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo.
The State Department analysis concluded that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program "allows the Chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion."
(The full text of the State Department's analysis is online at the State Department's web site at [http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/other/12128.htm].
The State Department's assessment team report is also online, at [http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/rpt/2002/12122.htm].)
Critics of the Administration's decision oppose it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries where UNFPA operates, but also because of the possible application of the determination for other international organizations that operate in China and to which the U.S. contributes.
For FY2003, the President proposed no funding for UNFPA, although $25 million was requested in "reserve" for the account from which UNFPA receives its funding.
Presumably, this could be made available to UNFPA if it is found not to be in violation of Kemp-Kasten.
Following several legislative attempts to reverse the Administration's denial of UNFPA -- in both FY2002 supplemental appropriations and regular FY2003 Foreign Operations measures -- Congress approved in P.L. 1087, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003, a provision allocating $34 million to UNFPA, the same as in FY2002, so long as several conditions were met.
The most significant requirement is that the President must certify that UNFPA is no longer involved in the management of a coercive family planning program.
The President has not yet issued a determination regarding the status of UNFPA funding for FY2003.
Like for FY2003, the FY2004 Foreign Operations request does not propose funding for UNFPA, but places $25 million in "reserve" for unidentified voluntary contributions to international organizations.
"Mexico City" Policy.
The debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago, in 1973, when Congress added a provision to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. appropriated funds for abortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs.
During the mid-1980s, in what has become known as the "Mexico City" policy (because it was first announced at the 1984 Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan Administration, and later the George H. W. Bush Administration restricted funds for foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds.
Several groups,
CRS-46 including International Planned Parenthood Federation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support.
In some subsequent years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition, but White House vetoes kept the policy in place.
President Clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors, allowing the United States to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money was used by those involved in abortionrelated work.
Between 1996 and 2000, the House and Senate took opposing positions on the Mexico City issue, actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final Foreign Operations spending measures.
The House position, articulated by Representative Chris Smith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policy restricting U.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries.
The Senate, on the other hand, rejected in most cases House provisions dealing with Mexico City policy, favoring a position that left these decisions in the hands of the Administration.
Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure to move forward.
The annual "compromise" removed House-added Mexico City restrictions, but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in several years, "metered" the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385 million per month.
In FY2000, when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations, a reluctant President Clinton agreed to a modified version of abortion restrictions, marking the first time that Mexico City conditions had been included in legislation signed by the President (enacted in the Foreign Operations Act for FY2000, H.R. 3422, incorporated into H.R. 3194, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, P.L. 106-113).
Because the President could waive the restrictions for $15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify, there was no major impact on USAID family planning programs in FY2000, other than the reduction of $12.5 million in population assistance that the legislation required if the White House exercised the waiver authority.
When Congress again came to an impasse in FY2001, lawmakers agreed to allow the new President to set policy.
Under the FY2001 Foreign Operations measure, none of the $425 million appropriation could be obligated until after February 15, 2001.
Subsequently, on January 22, 2001, two days after taking office, President Bush issued a Memorandum to the USAID Administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from President Clinton and directing the Administrator to "reinstate in full all of the requirements of the Mexico City Policy in effect on January 19, 1993."
The President further said that it was his "conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad."
A separate statement from the President's press secretary stated that President Bush was "committed to maintaining the $425 million funding level" for population assistance "because he knows that one of the best ways to
CRS-47 prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services."
The press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions "do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions, for example, post abortion care."
On February 15, 2001, the day on which FY2001 population aid funds became available for obligation, USAID issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the President's directive.
The guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the Mexico City policy applied.
Critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds.
They believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for USAID funding.
This, they contend, will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions.
Opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United States challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money.
They further argue that U.S. policy imposes a so-called "gag" order on the ability of foreign NGOs and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations.
This would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the United States, critics note.
Supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans USAID funds from being used to perform or promote abortions, money is fungible; organizations receiving American-taxpayer funding can simply use USAID resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations.
The certification process, they contend, closes the fungibility "loophole."
Since re-instatement of the Mexico City policy in early 2001, several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy, but none has passed either the House or Senate.
The policy continues to apply to FY2003 family planning aid programs and will presumably continue in FY2004.
Congressional Action.
In authorizing legislation related to portions of the Foreign Operations appropriation bill, the House International Relations Committee approved on May 8, 2003, an amendment by Congressman Crowley that authorizes $50 million for a U.S. contribution to UNFPA for each of FY2004 and FY2005 (H.R. 1950).
The Crowley amendment further alters existing law for determining UNFPA eligibility by requiring that the President find that UNFPA does not "directly" support or participate in coercive or involuntary activities.
This would appear to make it more difficult for the President to block funding for UNFPA than under conditions that apply for this year.
Not only does the Crowley amendment add the word "directly," but also defines the circumstances under which UNFPA would be found ineligible as "knowingly and intentionally working with a purpose to continue, advance or expand the practice of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization, or playing a primary and essential role in a coercive or involuntary aspect of a country's family planning program."
CRS-48
Afghanistan Reconstruction8 The conditions in Afghanistan represent a challenging mix of ongoing security concerns, infrastructure destruction, and humanitarian needs likely requiring a robust and sustained intervention.
While the hunt for Al Qaeda forces within Afghanistan continues, transitional and reconstruction assistance has also moved ahead.
An examination of the progress of reconstruction efforts and aid priorities since December 2001 reveals the complexity of the tasks at hand and the important roles to be played by the United States and the international community.
The case of Afghanistan may present a special category of international crisis response, in which the United States and others pursue the war on terrorism in a country while simultaneously providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.
So far, the international community has continued to provide large amounts of aid and resources for the reconstruction effort.
A long-term commitment will likely be necessary to ensure that a stable, democratic Afghanistan emerges and will not fall prey to the twin evils of drugs and terrorism.
The outcomes of the international donors conference in January 2002 and other donor conferences since then indicate a strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration of Afghanistan.
However, reconstruction costs are estimated by some to be more than $15-$30 billion over the next decade.
Situation Prior to September 11.
Even before the current crisis, Afghanistan had suffered twenty-two years of war, which included a long Soviet occupation, followed by civil war, and, beginning in 1996, harsh Taliban rule in most of the country.
With a devastated infrastructure and minimal government and social services, even basic health care and education were almost nonexistent.
As of September 10, 2001, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), nearly four million Afghans (out of a total population of about 26 million) were refugees with a majority located in Pakistan and Iran.
Nearly one million other Afghans were internally displaced persons (IDPs).
Humanitarian assistance programs have been a key part of the overall multilateral effort to relieve human suffering and assist refugees and internally displaced persons.
The United States has been the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan through direct programs and through its contributions to the UNHCR, other U.N. agencies and international organizations, and NGOs.
From 1994 until just recently, U.S. aid was provided mainly through U.N. agencies and NGOs.
Via the World Food Program (WFP), the United States provided more than 80% of all food shipments to Afghanistan during FY2001 and more than 47% in FY2002.
The humanitarian needs, although becoming less critical, remain significant.
Key developments since September 11, 2001, and the collapse of the Taliban focus on three main pillars: First, the development of plans for security including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and in the future, an Afghan National Army and police force; second, establishing the political framework through the

Current Operating Environment.
The current operating environment continues to highlight the importance of these three themes and the work that remains to be done to assure Afghanistan's recovery.
The most serious challenge facing Afghanistan today is the lack of security.
Former commanders maintain control over their own areas and continue fighting with their rivals, making difficult the extension of control by the national government, the provision of humanitarian assistance, and the implementation of plans for reconstruction.
With the continued fighting and insecurity, the process of demobilization and integration of combatants has also been slow.
U.S. forces are continuing to train a new Afghan National Army that it is hoped will ultimately allow the Kabul government to maintain security on its own, and enable foreign forces to depart Afghanistan.
With about 4,500 recruits trained so far, the U.S. government estimates that it will be at least five years until the army reaches full strength, currently planned for 70,000.
Ensuring a secure environment for reconstruction gained greater attention with an initiative by the Pentagon to expand the role of the U.S. military in Afghanistan.
In December 2002, DOD announced that it would be setting up eight "provincial reconstruction teams" (PRTs), composed of U.S. combat and civil affairs officers, to provide security for reconstruction workers and to extend the influence of the Kabul government.
Three of these PRTs are already in operation and observers say NGOs are gravitating to areas where they are present due to improved security.
This marks a departure from the previous policy of relying solely on security through the development of an Afghan national army or expansion of the ISAF, and engages U.S. forces beyond military action to oust the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
Still, factional fighting and increased criminal activity have undermined humanitarian operations.
In some cases, where operations were directly targeted, this has led to the temporary suspension of U.N. missions or withdrawal of aid agencies from certain areas.
The United Nations has begun a database to record national security incidents and to provide more effective, timely information and situation assessments.
The strength and influence of the central government is viewed as a key factor that will determine the success of the intervention and assistance on the part of the international community.
Humanitarian and reconstruction programs face the challenge of maintaining their foothold despite the complex humanitarian requirements (such as population returns and resettlement, food security, shelter, and winter assistance) and reconstruction problems (such as rebuilding the infrastructure, economy and agricultural base; addressing landmines and environmental damage; and reestablishing health, education, and community centers.)
At the end of 2003, Afghanistan is to begin preparing for national elections to take place by June 2004.
A loya jirga in October 2003 is to consider a draft permanent constitution.
CRS-50 Apart from the security problems, the current operating environment presents a number of other urgent challenges.
The collapsed infrastructure, rugged terrain, and extreme weather are significant factors with regard to access, food aid, logistics, and plans for reconstruction.
The humanitarian needs and support required for recovery in Afghanistan must be understood in the context of the continuing vast numbers of refugees and IDPs, the differences among the regions in which they are located, and the political and security situation throughout the country.
There is a need for stronger links between humanitarian and reconstruction projects so that Afghans can begin to move beyond initial reintegration to more permanent resettlement.
UNHCR plans to assist 1.2 million refugees and 300,000 IDPs during 2003, although some have raised concerns that the infrastructure may not yet be able to support this many returnees.
The United States has international help in carrying out the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The United States is training the new army and about 9,000 U.S. troops continue to combat Taliban/Al Qaeda remnants.
The U.S. Treasury Department is advising the government on its budget and other financial affairs.
Among contributions by other countries, Italy is providing advice on judicial reform and Germany is helping establish a national police force.
The United States, Japan and Saudi Arabia are financing the rebuilding of the Kabul-Qandahar-Herat major roadway.
There have been some reports that Afghanistan officials have complained about the slow pace at which pledged funds were being paid.
In a similar vein, the United States has been critical of other donors for not meeting their "fair share" of the cost of recovery and for not doing enough on a multilateral level.
On the one hand, determining the "fair share" of the costs of reconstruction for any one country or group of countries varies from conflict to conflict and depends in part on the resources being spent on conflicts elsewhere.
On the other hand, the way in which funds are distributed -- be it multilaterally through U.N. agencies or bilaterally with funds supporting international organizations and NGOs directly -- appears to be at issue in Afghanistan.
Others are concerned that international donors might shift their focus to Iraq reconstruction, and lose interest or run too low on resources to continue to participate in Afghan reconstruction.

According to USAID, during FY2001 the U.S. government provided $184.3 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan ranging from airlifts of tents and blankets to assistance with polio eradication, from tons of wheat to crop substitution assistance for poppy growers.
On October 4, 2001, President Bush announced that for FY2002 the United States would provide $320 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghans both inside and outside Afghanistan's borders.
Multiple U.S. agencies provide some form of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, covering a wide variety of aid, services, and projects.
The International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan held in Tokyo in January 2002 gave the AIA a chance to demonstrate its commitment to the next phase of Afghanistan's recovery and provided the international donor community an opportunity to come together and formally demonstrate support for this initiative.
The sixty-one countries and twenty-one international organizations represented pledged $1.8 billion for 2002.
The U.S. government pledged $297
CRS-51 million, drawn from existing sources -- either from the $40 billion Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental (P.L. 107-38) that was passed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks or from regular FY2002 appropriations.
The total pledged at Tokyo was $4.5 billion, with some states making pledges over multiple years and commitments to be carried out in different time frames.
Some countries offered support in kind but placed no monetary value on that.
Subsequent U.S. Aid Transfers, FY2002 and FY2003.
Since the Tokyo pledging conference, through supplemental and regular appropriation bills, Congress has approved an additional $970 million in U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, making Kabul one of the largest recipients of American aid.
An emergency FY2002 supplemental measure (P.L. 107-206) added $258 million for Afghanistan to amounts previously allocated, bringing the total amount of U.S. assistance in FY2002 to $686 million, well in excess of funding pledged at the Tokyo conference.
Thus far in FY2003, Congress has passed in regular (P.L. 108-7) and supplemental (P.L. 108-11) appropriation acts over $700 million, of which $647 million falls under Foreign Operations programs.
In each of these actions, Congress has increased levels beyond those requested by the Administration.
The $40 million add-on in P.L. 108-11 will permit USAID to accelerate the Kabul-Qandahar-Herat road construction project that is jointly financed with Japan and Saudi Arabia.
In related legislation, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (P.L. 107327, S. 2712), passed by congress on November 15, 2002, and signed by the President on December 4, 2002, authorizes an additional $3.3 billion for Afghanistan over four years.
Included is $2 billion for humanitarian, reconstruction, and enterprise fund assistance through FY2006 and $300 million in drawdown from U.S. military stocks of defense articles and equipment for Afghanistan and other countries and organizations participating in restoring Afghan security.
The legislation also includes a Sense of Congress that calls for an expanded International Security Assistance Force with an authorization of an additional $1 billion over two years.
FY2004 Afghanistan Aid Request.
For FY2004, the Administration requests $550 million for Afghanistan, an amount that would make Kabul the fourth largest recipient of U.S. aid next year.
Although the FY2004 proposal is less than for FY2002 and FY2003, when funding for humanitarian programs in FY2004 (food, refugees, disaster relief) are added, the total sum is likely to be near or above previous years.
(Humanitarian funds are usually not allocated on a country basis until the fiscal year begins.)
Nearly half of the $321 million FY2004 economic aid request would continue infrastructure rehabilitation, focusing largely on roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, and waste water facilities.
