The task of creating the Tuskegee Airmen NHS p resents t he National Park Service with a uni que opportunity.
Many of the p eople whose s tories w ill be commemorated and interpreted at the new site are still a live.
From the outset, it has been clear that an oral history project w ith the goal of interviewing as many participants in t he Tuskegee Airmen experience as p ossible would b e a cr ucial component of this effort.
Oral histories of the surviving Tuskegee Airmen will be used for three main purposes.
Informat ion from the interviews will guide the Park Service's rehabilitation and construction projects at Moton Field.
Recordings of the interviews will be used in the NHS's interpretive programs, so that visitors will be able to learn about the Tuskegee Airmen experience from those who participated, in their own words.
Finally, the interviews and their transcripts will housed in an archive at the NHS and made available to researchers and the public.
In 1998, President C linton signed Public Law 105Â­355, establishing t he Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site at Moton Field in Tuskegee,AL, to commemorate the heroic actions of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II.
Two years later in 2000, the National Park S ervice initiated the Tuskegee Airmen Oral History Project.
Today, five f ull-time oral history interviewers a re interviewing participants in t he Tuskegee Airmen experience throughout t he country.
When opened to the public, the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site at Moton Field w ill contain a museum and interpretive programs at the hi storic complex at Moton Field.
The new unit of the National Park System will address the training of the Tuskegee Airmen, their contributions to t he U.S.

The National Park Service has c hosen to define a "Tuskegee Airman" in the broadest possible terms.
Nearly 1,000 pilots successfully c ompleted Army Air Corps flig ht training at Tuskegee between 1941 a nd 1946.
These pilots have recently b egun to w in recognition for their excellent service in World War II, and justly so.
But they made up o nly a fraction of the total number of people whose collective service was responsible for the success of the Tuskegee program.
The Tuskegee Airmen Oral History Project is identifying and interviewing the thousands of people who served behind the scene--as mechanics, parachute packers, weather forecasters,radio operators,secr etaries, etc.-- in addit ion to t hose who fl ew the planes.
The goal is to i nterview a mini mum of 1,500 participants in t he Tuskegee Airmen experience.
The staff of fulltime interviewers is b ased in t he Southeast Regional Office of the National Park Service, in Atlanta,GA.
If you know of anyone who should be considered for an interview, contact Todd Moye at 404/562-3117 or Todd_Moye@nps.gov.

Everyone who works in a Civil War p ark knows t hat staff and v isitors come to these sites with their own past exper iences and b eliefs.
Fort Sumter National Monument is committed to telling a broader story about our hi story, including the voices of captured and enslaved Africans.
These voices from the past are voices that we hope will provoke cur iosity and interest in l earning more a bout our shared heritage as United States citizens.
Visitors should be a ble to connect with our exhibits with i ssues that are still relevant to who we are today--the role of the federal government, states' rights, and race relations.
For more information, contact Carlin Timmons, Ft Sumter National Monument; 843/883-3123, e-mail: Carlin_Timmons@nps.gov.
When completed in l ate 2001,NPS staff expects t hat this brochure will expand public understanding of, and appreciation for, the cultural, natural, and recreational resources within and close to t he park.
The b rochure also can build support for interpretative prog rams, environmental a nd cultural resource education, and maintenance.
The NPS FY 2000 C hallenge Cost S hare Program (CCSP) p rovided se ed money for t he preparation of the brochure.

Ft. Sumter Ferry Facility Offers New Interpretation for Visitors Carlin Timmons, Fort Sumter National Monument
A dream 25 years in t he making is about to b ecome a r eality in Charleston, SC. Fort Sumter National Monument's new ferry boat facility w ill be o pening downtow n at Liberty S quare this summer.
This project is signifi cant in a number of ways.
It is b uilt on a reclaimed Super Fund site and is part of a broad based waterfront revitalization.
On t he ferry, visitors to Fort Sumter take part in i nterpretive programs that will help them appreciate the many meanings associated w ith Fort Sumter.
The challenge has been to greatly expand the story told at the fort's museu m ,w h ich was renovated in 1995.
Its emphasis is on the what happened at Sumter and the Charleston area during the Civil War.
The new Liberty Square exhibits will place the events at Fort Sumter in the larger context of United States history.
This context will extend back to the colonial roots of the conflict and events leading up to secession.
The exhibits will bring the visitor up to the beginning of the Civil War in April 1861.
The exhibits w ill cover the causes of the war, the g rowth of sectionalism, slaver y, the Constitution, and the greatest challenge that this country has ever faced.
Visitors likely w ill include those wh ose great-great grandparents were born into slaver y and others whose ancestors might have b een Confederate generals.
The National Park Service is cooperating with t he National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) t o produce a b asic NPS brochure for Anacostia Park in Washington, DC.
Located on both sides of the Anacostia River, Anacostia Park is a major n atural, cultural, and recreational resource in the national capital city and an i mportant part of the national park system in the Washington DC a rea. Anacostia Park is close to o ther NPS attractions, including the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site and Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.
City historic places, including the residential Anacostia Historic District and Anacostia High Sc hool, are near t he park.
Despite t he central l ocation a nd large size of Anacostia Park, it is l ittle known to ma ny residents of the Washington, DC metropolitan area or to many visitors.A NPS brochure will provide t he visitor with a map of the park.
It identifies park boundaries, visitor facilities, ranger stations, and areas for recreational uses and summarizes the natural and c ultural resources within and around the park.
These brochures a re provided to v isitors,sc hools, and residents of nearby communities.

Do you know the community's names for these special places--and do you understand the community's concerns about how they are managed? And what happens if your park hasn't yet identified its c ulturally significant resources? NPS's Applied Ethnography Program is a small service-wide group of cultural anthropologists based in regions, support offices,se rvice centers, programs, and parks across the country.
They focus on the relationships b etween Parks,NPS programs, and p eoples whose c ustomar y ways of life affect, or
are affected by, NPS management activities.
They also reach out to federal, state, tribal, and other partners beyond the NPS.
Although ethnographic, cultural, and natural resources (including the landscapes of which they are a p art) can be eligible for listing in t he National Register of Historic Places, the t rue importance of these resources lies in the unique c ultural value that they have to contemporary peoples and communities and the continuance of traditional practices.

Stored within the collections of a new museum at Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO, is a sma ll baby's blanket that, by itself, doesn't have much value, but whose stor y is priceless.
The blanket had belonged to a Navajo man b orn at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in t he early 1860s following the DinÃ© Long Walk from Canyon de Chelley in Arizona.
More than 3,000 died during the death march and subsequent incarceration.
With its s tory, the weaving has become a p owerful symbol of a p eople's history t hat should never be forgotten.
The b lanket is one of thousands of historic and prehistoric artifacts, oral histories,ra re books,ma ps, and hi storical photographs now available to t he public through the college's new $8 mi llion Center of Southwest Studies,a museum, archives, research library, and home to the institution's award-winning Southwest Studies a nd Anthropology degree programs.
Although originally established in 1964, it is t he country's oldest c enter that is focused solely on S outhwest history and cultures.
The center had been hidden away on t he third floor of the college's library, and trying to a ccess its c ollections was akin to e ngaging in a n archaeological dig.

National Center for the Preservation of Democracy Established at Japanese American National Museum On October 17,2000, the Japanese American National Museum and the Chairman of its B oard of Governors, Senator D aniel K. Inouye (D-HI), announced the appropriation of $20 million in f ederal fun ds to e stablish the Nat ional Center for the Preservation of Democracy.
This Center will be affi liated with and housed at the National Museum in L os Angeles.
The purpose of the National Center is to exami ne the rights and freedoms of all Americans through the lessons learned from the Japanese American exp erience.
In ma king the announcement, Senator Inouye stated, "The Japanese Americans' stor y celebrates t he t riumphs of American democracy.
I am proud to be able to announce that the National C enter for the Preservation for Democracy w ill be affi liated with the Japanese American National Museum, which is an i nstitution that is d edicated to t he study, preservation, and i nterpretation of democratic i ssues.
The National Center's development of nationwide programs about t he issues of democracy a nd its e ducation and public programs examining democracy in action will be a n atural complement to t he important work being done by the National Museum."
The National Center will provide a w ide array of educational programming that includes exhibitions, media arts presentation, public programs, conferences, and civic dialogue/public forums.
The educational programming w ill be multi-faceted, using Japanese American history as the lens to look at U.S. constitut ional and civil rig hts issues and the experiences of a broad range of ethnic and racial g roups.
George Takei, Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the Japanese American National Museum,cited the appropri-
ateness of the National Museum's hi storic building--a National Historic Landmark as designated by the Secretary of the Interior.
The building has been a focal point of American history, serving as a U.S. government assembly point where Japanese Americans were ordered to report before their un constitutional World War II incarceration.
As Takei stated, "What better place to l earn the lessons of American democracy than at this historic site?" For more information, contact Chris Komai, the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, 213/830-5648.
Descendants of Elizabeth Hawkins are doing more than just p art icipating in the excavations.
Several Hawkins family descendants have provided informal oral hi stories and family genealogies of the seven Hawkins family lines who trace their ancestry to t he slave quarters at Northampton.
Family members are also ta king a proactive role in h elping to obtain finding and to encourage community support for the project.
Excavations of the two slave quarters have been completed.
Historical research and artifact analyses are now being conducted via a gra nt f rom the Maryland Historical Trust.
The foundation of one of the quarters has been reconst ructed as a p ermanent exhibit.
Upon e ntering t he park, an asphalt path directs the visitor past the reconstructed foundation of an 1840s duplex quarter, to a s itting area w ith two benches.
A sign includes text, graphics, and photographs,which offer an interpretation of the site.
Among the brief narratives on t he sig n is the following statement by the descendants of Elizabeth Hawkins: "There a re five living generations of descendants of the Hawkinses, the family that resided on this fa rm here in Prince George's C ounty.
We total in excess of 400 people, and more than three-fourths of those folks make t heir home within a 20-mi le radius of the location of the slave cabins in L ake Arbor.
Its significance to this fami ly i s tremendous; it has b een like a t ie t hat binds us together....
We the descendants of Robert and Lizzie Hawkins remember the Northampton Plantation."
Through the Hawkins' family's active part icipation in t he planning and interpretation of the Northampton Slave Quarters and Archaeological Park, the Maryland-National C apital Park and Planning Commission b elieves this project can serve as a model for engaging communities in t he interpretation of their past.

Many public archaeology projects offer volunteers and students the opportunity to p articipate in an excavation.
Most people are fascinated with t he discovery of artifacts f rom the past,wh ether they are stone tools from thousands of years ago, or shreds of pottery, glass, or buttons from our more recent past.

The preservation philosophy which governed the decision ma king process for this project required the conservation and reuse of historic materials, the use of period materials where necessary, and the replication of moldings,fixtures and elements as n eeded.
Unique to this project was t he barg ing over of materials and the ferrying of workers to the b arrier island.
Students gained firsthand knowledge and experience undertaking a ll phases of the documentation, construction and restoration process while working hand in hand w ith residents of the island.
The Sapelo Preservation Project has preserved an important element of an island heritage and created a l egacy for a g rowing audience that has come to appreciate the traditions and lore of the Gullah-Geechee community.

Zion Poplars is connected to b road patterns of our nation's history.
Before 1865, and for some time afterwards, blacks were prohibited by law from gathering in large numbers for the purpose of educational or religious instruction.
Consequently, blacks held "brush arbors," or clandestine religious meetings in wooded areas.
However, brush arbors held signifi cance beyond their function as sa fe havens for worshipping God.
Brush arbors represented appropriate sanctuaries because, according to some west African religious beliefs, spirits reside in t he brush.
Zion Poplars developed out of this west African-influenced tradition when, in 1866, its founding mothers and fathers chose seven p oplar trees as t heir sa nctuary.
These trees, four of which are extant on c hurch grounds,uni te to form one base.
In the African-Baptist worldview, Mount Zion was the sacred place where God m et with his p eople.
The seven united poplar trees constituted a k ind of "Zion," or sacred place, indicated by t he inclusion of the word Zion in t he name of the church.
Therefore, the history and culture of Zion Poplars Baptist Church are "rooted" in the seven untied poplar trees.
Observing t he tradition of most independent black churches that were established during the Reconstruction Era, Zion Poplars was a m ulti-functional institution that served the spiritual, educational, and economic needs of its congregants and communit y members.
In t hat regard, Zion Poplars prov ided blacks with many resources that the larger society refused to grant.
Mutualaid is one of Zion Poplar's cherished legacies, fostered by t he communal and indomitable spirit of its members a nd their ancestors.
For its se rvice to t he congregants, its architectural s tyle, and its west African cultural influences, Zion Poplars Baptist Church is a l ocal, state, and national treasure.
For more information, contact Natalie S. Robertson, 757/727-5749.

The Spanish Caribbean Colonies as Stepping Stones In the North American Colonization Luis F. Olivieri-Robert, University of Puerto Rico-Carolina
As early as the sixteenth century, both Cuba and Puerto R ico were steppingstones for the early Spanish colonization of the North American lands.
Cuba was a departure port for the exploration of Florida by Hernando De Soto, while Puerto Rico was the departure site for Juan Ponce de Leon's attempt in the early quarter of the same centur y.
This history dealt with t he pirates a nd buccaneers that made the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast their p erforming scenario.
The underground economy sponsored and promoted by t hese outlaws was strong.
Monitoring of, and participation in, the illegal trade of tobacco, slaves, sugar, leather, or other goods was one of the non-written duties of the colonial governor.
There are well-documented testimonies of New York, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico governors as a ctive participants in this e conomy as e arly as t he sixteenth century, and up to the days of the American Revolution in t he eighteenth century.
The famous William Kidd used Vieques and Mona islands (in Puerto Rico) as tra ding posts for his s muggled goods.
In the same way William Syms, from Boston,MA, was well known in the Caribbean ma ritime routes.
The commerce b etween New York a nd Puerto Rico was very lucrative up to 1769 due to the C aribbean need for flour and the American colonial need for rum.
During the Revolutionary period (1776Â­1783) pirates and c orsaries from the revolutionized colonies traveled through the Antilles, in v iolation of the British laws, and in favor of the Spanish policy of exclusivism, which made the Cuban and Puer to Rican colonial economies eventually more dependent of the North American.
In Puerto Rico, places like Fort "El Morro," under the purview of the National Park Service, were vital to the militar y history of the C aribbean
basin.A b uilding like "La Fortaleza," the governor's mansion since the 1540s, is a good example of the presence of late Gothic military architecture combined w ith baro que and Neoclassical decorative t rends.
At this present moment, "La Fortaleza" in San Juan and the "Armstrong-Poventud" mansion are asking for urgent attention concerning its preservation and conservation.
Luis Olievera-Robert is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Carolina.
it shows how to turn conflict into a cause for collaboration,whi le pointing to new understandings of the meaning of place.
In 1864,American soldiers massacred an e ncampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians by the banks of Sand Creek, CO. 135 years later, at the prompting of Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the Nat ional Park Service joined forces with four Indian tribes, local landowners, and the State of Colorado to p rotect a nd commemorate the site.
The first challenge was to find it.
Indian tradition placed it in o ne location, while documentar y ev idence a nd archeology raised the possibility of a nearby place.
In the end, the boundaries of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site were draw n to include both sites.
Sand Creek offers several lessons.
First, it shows how we can stretch the bounds of collaboration beyond the limits typically set by government agencies.
Second, it demonstrates the special power of sites associated with conflict and grief.
Such sites enable us to carry on a public conversation about painful and unresolved episodes in our national history.
The debates themselves can create a new public consciousness of history.
Finally, Sand Creek poses a q uestion about what we mean by place.
All participants ag reed that it was important to find the site and protect it.
In the end, they also agreed to d iffer in wh ere they thought it was.
That is no t rivial disagreement, yet n either need i t become a cr ippling one.
We need different things from a site.
While the scientific mi nd may crave the certainty of saying "it happened precisely here," others seek a s pot where they can commune with memory, observe some personal or communal r itual.
For them, the site's authenticity may not depend on a t est boring.
Shovels might even diminish its aura.
As preservationists, we need to create collaboration out of conflict,ma ke peace between research a nd reflection, create space f or ceremony as well as science.
Sand C reek shows that it c an be done.
Sites of Conflict and Collaboration: New Developments from the West Ned Kaufman
Preservat ionists are finding common ground with environmentalists in a new appreciation of the cultural heritage of place: all over the West, people are working together in n ew ways to protect environmental values and traditions.
It's happening in B ozeman, MT, where a g roup of ranchers recently got together to place their land under conservation e asements.
It's happening in Missoula,wh ere the O'Connor Center for t he Rocky Mountain West is study ing ways for local ranchers, and others, to gain greater responsibility for managing public lands; in Steamboat Springs, CO, where the City Council, helped by the Orton Family Foundation, just opened a ci vic hall where planning meetings c an be t ruly public; and at Heart Mountain,WY, where efforts to preserve a World War II i nternment camp are bringing together the State Historic Preservation Office with l ocal business interests and Japanese Americans.
It's happening throughout the West, where g roups like the Northern Lights Institute and the S onoran Institute a re developing new techniques of collaborative conservation, bringing residents, environmentalists, business interests, and officials together to so lve the thorniest problems of conservation and development.
In e ach example, people have come to value c ultural heritage as p art of their environment.
One story is e specially relevant to our concern w ith ethnic heritage, because
Bohemian Hall in Astoria, NY, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a traditional cultural property .
Bohemian Hall added to the National Register Bohemian Hall, in Astoria,NY, was listed in t he National Register of Historic Places on March 23,2001 as a tradit ional cultural property.
Bohemian Hall has served the Czech community, and other ethnically diverse groups se eking a place to congress in Q ueens for 90 years.
Completed in 1911, the two-stor y, Neo-Classical Revival style hall is used not only for "public assembly," but also as a C zech language school, and presently houses a Greek seni or center and t he Emerald Society of Irish p olicemen.
Behind it is the beer garden, added in t he 1930s, the last one b uilt in New York.

Colorado Annual Conference Emphasizes Diverse Cultural Heritage Antoinette J. Lee, National Park Service
"Preserving D iverse Cultural Heritage" was the theme for the annual m eeting of Colorado Preservation, Inc.(CPI).
Held February 1Â­3,2001, the c onference attracted approximately 600 attendees.
The conference featured plenary sessions by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Congressman Mark Udall, and State S enate President Stan Matsunaka.
Speakers i ncluded representatives from national, state, regional, and local preservation organizations and agencies.
Among the hig hlights of the conference were the sessions that addressed the new Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site.
Senator Campbell was a driving force behind the project t hat studied of the location of the massacre of 1864,where 700 so ldiers, led by Col. John M. Chivington, attacked a v illage of 500 C heyenne and Arapaho people.
At least 150 p eople, including women and children, were killed.
In order to identify the location and extent of the massacre, the Sand Creek Massacre Project staff consulted w ith Indian tribes,un dertook research on written records, studied archeological sites, and conducted aerial photography a nalyses.
The Special Resource Study for the Sand Creek Massacre site concluded that the site possessed exceptional value in i llustrating and interpreting the histor y of U.S.-Indian relations in t he American West.
The massacre was a major tur ning point in t he relationship between whites a nd Indians and succeeding Indian and army conflicts were tied in someway to the massacre.
Today, the site's high d egree of physical i ntegrity and its isolated sett ing give v isitors an opportunity to comprehend the tra gedy that took place there.
During the conference,CPI announced the properties on its "most endangered places list" for 2001.
Historic properties associated with diverse cultural g roups included Camp Amache in Powers
County, a relocat ion camp that housed thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.
Today, the Camp Amache s ite is threatened by neglect and vandalism.
Another property is t he 1895 S an R afael C hurch in C onejos County, which represents a religious clash between Anglo and Hispanic missionaries.
Dating f rom 1200 A.D., the Shield Rock Art Site in R io Blanco County is l ocated in an a rea that has some of the oldest Native American pictographs and petroglyphs in the state.
Conference sessions reinforced the major conference theme.
Topics i ncluded hi storical archeolog y and cultural diversity, redefining c ultural heritage for the twenty-first century, historic Jewish sites in t he Denver area, diverse communities and historic preservation, and current issues in p reserving Native American heritage.
The 2001 CPI annual conference offered Colorado preservationists an important opportunity to t ie their programs w ith the state's and the nation's increasingly diverse population.
In addition, the conference i nvited diverse community members to ma ke connections between their priorities and available preservation tools and approaches.

Your Town workshops bring together rural community leaders to engage in c ommunity design problems.
This Delta workshop was the first one devoted to African American community i ssues.
Fift y five participants convened in Cleveland to discuss a ra nge of planning, development, and design issues.
At the c ore of the workshop was a fourhour field t rip along Highway 61 to v isit Mound Bayou, an exclusively African American town founded in 1867; Jonestown,a tiny African American community; and C larksdale, home of the Delta Blues Museum.
Participants worked on design problems for these communities, including rehabilitating and re-using historic structures, enhancing community spaces, and maintaining cultural identity in t he context of limited resources and high unemployment.
Mark Robbins, Director of Design at t he National Endowment for t he Arts, believes strongly that rural African American communit ies, generally underserved in a ccess to d esign, preservation, and planning assistance, are entitled to t he same level of design exper tise that other communities receive.
The Your Tow n workshop brought nationally k now n African American speakers to t he Delta, to offer their experience a nd expertise.

The Wheel Reinvented in Spanish Cindy Olsen, National Task Force on Emergency Response, Heritage Preservation
A Spanish language version of the Emergency Response a nd S alvage Wheel is n ow in progress.
This popular resource is an i nteractive slide chart that makes accurate information on protecting and salvaging collections easily accessible.
The wheel was originally produced in 1997 by t he National Task Force on Emergency Response, an initiative of Heritage Preservation, the Federal E mergency Management Agency, and the Getty Conservation Institute.
Today, nearly 65,000 wheels are in circulation.
Last year, the National Endowment for the Humanities made a gra nt to Heritage Preservation for the partial costs of producing and distributing 25,000 free copies of the Rueda de Salvamento y de Respuesta a Emergencias.
Private sector funds have been sought to complete the project.
The current goal is to launch the Spanish-language wheel w ith a ma ss mailing of more than 15,000 c opies near the b eginning of the 2001 hurricane season.
The project will ta rget archives, libraries,hi storic sites, collecting institutions, and other cultural resources in areas where the Spanish-speak ing populations are the largest: California, Florida, New Mexico, Texas, Puerto Rico, parts of Arizona and Colorado, and the metropolitan a reas of New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.
