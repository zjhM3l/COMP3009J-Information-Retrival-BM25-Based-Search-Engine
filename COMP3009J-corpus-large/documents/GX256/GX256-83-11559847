NEW LOAN PROGRAM FROM MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT By Andrew Gosden, MDE Certain small businesses in Maryland will soon benefit from a new source that can help them expand or upgrade their enterprises while complying with the states air emissions laws.
The Small Business Pollution Compliance Loan Program, which was authorized last year by the General Assembly, is designed to provide financial assistance to small businesses to upgrade or replace equipment to reduce air pollution.
The loan program defines a small business as one with 25 or fewer full time employees.
The loans may be used for costs in upgrading or replacing air pollution control equipment.
The loans also may be used to purchase and install equipment to make operational changes that reduce air pollution and to purchase equipment that modifies production practices to reduce air pollution.
Loans of up to $50,000 are available for a project.
The interest rate for the loans is based on Marylands General Obligation Bond rate.
The length of the loan will depend on the project, but the term can not exceed 15 years.
For more information or to request an application package, call the Small Business Assistance Program at (410) 631-3772.

A no discharge zone (NDZ) is an area of water where it is also illegal to discharge sewage that has been treated by a Type I or Type II marine sanitation device (MSD).
When operating in an NDZ, Type I and Type II MSDs may not be used and must be secured.
NDZs are designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) upon approval of applications submitted by individual states.
Although several states have implemented NDZs, there are currently no NDZs in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay or in the Coastal Bays.
This will likely change in the future.
There have been two Chesapeake Bay Agreements since 1983 that have guided Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Maryland in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay.
The third Chesapeake Bay Agreement (Chesapeake 2000: A Watershed Partnership), will provide Bay restoration leadership through the year 2010.
The Agreement is scheduled to be signed on June 28th, and the draft version includes the following wording: By 2003, establish appropriate areas within the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as no discharge zones for human waste from boats.
By 2010, expand by 50 percent the number and availability of waste pumpout facilities.
Maryland is well-positioned to evaluate areas for potential NDZ designation.
During the 1999 legislative session, a Maryland law was passed (Natural Resources Article Ã¯Â¿Â½8-742) that required DNR to, among other things, conduct several surveys that are considered prerequisites to the NDZ application process.
DNR was required to identify: the number, location, and use of pumpouts and waste reception facilities; the number of recreational vessels in Maryland waters (including transients) that have Type I, Type II, and Type III marine sanitation devices; areas of water where those boats congregate; and waters of the State that support living resources that are sensitive to boat sewage discharge using criteria established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and 40 CFR Section 140-4.
In order to help DNR meet these requirements, a Sensitive Areas Committee was formed that includes representatives from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, Boat/US Clean Water Trust, the Maryland Boat Act Advisory Committee, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), the EPA, and DNR.
The Committee helped DNR identify a number of areas that are adequately served by pumpout facilities, that have significant boat congregations, and that contain living resources that are sensitive to boat sewage discharges.
From this list, within the next year DNR will recommend a small number of areas to MDE as candidates for pilot NDZs.
MDE is the agency responsible for submitting NDZ applications.
Then, over time, Maryland will likely pursue NDZ designation for other selected areas.

When the system was installed about ten years ago, the components were considered state-of-the-art.
The transition sump was designed as a model for future marina installations.
Fiberglass piping was recommended over galvanized metal.
Still, the forces of Mother Nature rule and can ruin an otherwise lovely day.
There is one bit of advice that should be heeded by fuel dock owners and operators.
Before you have an emergency spill, contact a few Spill Response companies and request their rate sheet.
During an emergency you really dont have the luxury of time to call around for competitive quotes.
In addition, have your insurance agent review the potential costs associated with a clean up effort.
Your policy may not cover, for example, a monitor well with monthly testing .
I hope our story serves as food for thought to other facilities as we begin yet another boating season in Maryland.
There is no substitute for planning and preparedness when an emergency strikes.

We can also provide a personal consultation to review your facility, in preparation for your confirmation visit.
5) Schedule a confirmation visit.
One member of our staff and one marina operator from our clean marina committee will visit your marina to verify the items checked on the award Checklist.
6) Enjoy your rewards! As a Maryland Clean Marina, you will be authorized to use our logo on your letterhead and in your advertising .
You will also receive a certificate, a burgee, and a free page on the Mar yland Clean Marina Initiative website.
Additionally, the Initiative will promote your facility through publications, public displays, and media releases.
7) Maintain your Clean Marina status.
Annually, confirm in writing that you continue to meet the award standards.
At least every third year, we will arrange a meeting to reaffirm Clean Marina status.
A goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify 25% (or about 150) of the marinas in the state as clean marinas by 2004.
We aim to prove that the marina industry can act voluntarily to reduce pollution from its operations, thereby showing the federal government that voluntary programs, rather than further regulations, are effective in reducing non-point source pollution from this industry.
We look forward to celebrating and thanking the operators of our newest certified clean marinas in July.
This spring four marinas were certified as Clean Marinas, meaning they have implemented a significant proportion of the recommendations in the Mar yland Clean Marina Guidebook.
Congratulations and thanks to: Youngs Boatyard, Osprey Point Marina, Parkside Marina, and Mears Yacht Haven.
Some highlights of the practices these marina operators implemented are:
At Youngs Boatyard in Edgemere customers are asked to implement pollution prevention practices as a condition of their lease agreements.
The owner also created a poster of clean boating tips and posted it prominently outside the bath house.
At Osprey Point Marina in Rock Hall employee training is a top priorityeach year management hires a consultant to train employees on OSHA safety and environmental standards.
The owners of Parkside Marina in Baltimore developed an oil spill response plan and invested in a spill response kit even though they do not sell or store fuel.
They want to be prepared in case of a spill from any of their slip-holders.
The managers of Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford maintain an oil spill response kit at their fuel dock and have signs conspicuously posted around the property to remind customers about proper waste disposal.
All of these marina operators have employed creativity and foresight in implementing best management practices at their facilities.
