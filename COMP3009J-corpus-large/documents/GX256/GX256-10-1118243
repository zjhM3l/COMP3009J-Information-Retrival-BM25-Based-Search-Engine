Senator Morrow is delayed a little bit longer.
We will start the hearing now, so, welcome everybody, to our umpteenth hearing on the investigation.
are here today specifically to zero in on the issue of the continued contempt process as to Enron and to Mirant.
Before we get into that, I want to address a couple procedural issues and one other issue that has been brewing for about two weeks now regarding the Duke facility and the ISO information.
First, the next hearing that we've got scheduled is for next Wednesday, a week from today.
That hearing, at We
least as of right now, is to follow-up on our last hearing concerning the potential contempt or the issue of contempt as to the other market participants that received service of the June 11th subpoenas that are not at issue here today.
We may end up
dealing with some of these issues, it may spill over until next week, but we'll see as the hearing unfolds this morning.
With respect to the issue of the Duke facility and the ISO information, I want to update everybody, and certainly welcome, if anybody wants a copy of the series of letters that has gone back and forth between my office, and Senator Morrow's office, and the ISO, and between Duke and us as well.
Here's my concern and why I want to address this at this point in time, because there's been some misperceptions
1 2
that have unfortunately developed.
First and foremost, when the three witnesses came Page 1
8ENERGY.TXT 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 forward several weeks ago and testified as to their observations of the Duke South Bay facility, this Committee did not draw any conclusions.
In fact, I think at least in my review of the
press accounts, the Committee Members that were interviewed were very, very cautious in their comments that, in fact, no definitive conclusions were being drawn by this particular Committee.
Comments that others may have made that are not on this Committee are certainly outside of our control and not at issue with respect to our particular investigation.
The Committee's position was, it was interesting information, but we needed to see much more information before any definitive conclusions could be drawn about what occurred in those three days referenced in the log reports that one of the witnesses brought forward.
As everyone here is aware, Duke was very critical of the fact that they were not given an opportunity to testify on that very day with respect to the information that the three witnesses had shared with the Committee.
The rules of the road, so to speak, for this process were established a long time ago with everybody's input.
It was decided that the Committee would review primarily
positions critical of the market and the market participants, and then certainly give full hearings to those market participants to provide, if I may just call it, the other side of the story, and that this Committee would at no time draw
1 2 3 4 5
definitive conclusions until we heard everything.
I don't mean to draw the analogy to a court process, because there are critical distinctions between a legislative investigation and a court process, but in a trial, someone does not get to respond at the end of every trial day.
Page 2
8ENERGY.TXT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 And they wait until they get their turn to present their case, and the jury is cautioned not to draw any definitive conclusions until the very end.
That was the process we embarked upon at the outset, and everybody was aware of that.
I understand Duke's concerns that some of the spin that was being developed, not by this Committee or its Committee Members but by others, of that testimony was unfair because it was based upon incomplete information.
is some merit to that allegation that they made.
I think there But again, it
wasn't a spin developed by this Committee or any Committee Members.
I was equally disturbed, however, when Duke approximately a week ago took a slice of data from the ISO and attempted to spin it the opposite direction.
That is, that the
limited data released by ISO with Duke's authorization somehow allowed us to draw a definitive conclusion about what occurred on those three days in January.
That position is as equally
faulty as those who tried to draw definitive conclusions just based on three witnesses' testimony.
It was as a result of those unfolding events that both myself and Senator Morrow requested the full data from ISO from which it's possible -- I can't guarantee it, but it's
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
possible -- to draw more definitive conclusions about what occurred in those three days.
And that's where there's been a
flurry of correspondence between the various offices that I've identified.
And we are happy to make available to anybody upon
their request that flurry of correspondence, again, between Senator Morrow's office, my office, the ISO, and Duke.
Specifically, I've requested that certain information be released with Duke's authorization.
Page 3 Duke will
8ENERGY.TXT 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 not authorize the release of what I consider to be the full, complete data that led up to those three days.
Until that is
done, no definitive conclusions, one way or the other, can be drawn.
I'll just share with you the last series in that correspondence, which was my letter of July 5th to William Hall, who is the Vice President, Asset Management, of Duke Energy, North America.
It says: "Dear Mr. Hall, "Thank you for your July 2nd letter."
That's his cover letter sending me the letter they sent to the Governor.
"As you are well aware, no final conclusions can be drawn about the output from the South Bay facilities on January 16, 17, and 18, 2001 as of yet.
"Neither the testimony from the witnesses nor the partial ISO data released last
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
week allow for a definite conclusion regarding the operation of those facilities.
"The only way to reach a definite conclusion is for Duke to authorize the public release of all the confidential bidding data leading up to the three days.
Up to now, your
company has steadfastly refused to allow the release of such Page 4
8ENERGY.TXT 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 data.
"I urge you to grant this authorization immediately so the true picture can be realized.
"Additionally, I continue to renew my demand for an agreement from your company not to destroy documents.
"Very truly yours, "Senator Joseph L. Dunn."
That was the last bit of correspondence.
have received nothing further.
Duke has not altered its We
position as of yet about the release of the full data relating to those three days.
Hopefully, that provides a little more clarity, but it does not provide any definitive conclusions that anybody can draw as of yet.
We simply don't have the full picture yet.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
And my hope is that no one engages in spinning on incomplete information because that is a disservice, obviously, to the entire process, and we are, of course, constantly being
bombarded by allegations of being politically motivated and not unbiased in our investigation.
So, we are very careful to
ensure that we at least try to do the right thing as much as we possibly can.
So, thanks everyone for bearing with me as I walked through that, but it's been disturbing, at least from the Chair's perspective, to watch all of it unfold since the day those witnesses first came forward and subsequently Duke's release of the partial ISO data.
So, with nothing further about that, let's go forward with the two issues we're dealing with today regarding Page 5
8ENERGY.TXT 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Enron and Mirant and the process of contempt.
We have
Mr. Drivon, Special Counsel to the Committee, before us at the witness table.
Peace.
SENATOR PEACE: Before you start on that process, Why don't we have Bob or Chris -- yes, Senator
on the issue you were just discussing with respect to the ISO and Power Exchange, I think it's important that folks not lose track of the fact that the ISO, which was giving these orders, was operating under a paradyme that was driven by the generators and marketers.
That the manipulation of this market didn't just occur in the discrete actions of a particular power plant or power plants.
It occurred by virtue of the actions of the same
generators and marketers that sat on the stakeholder board who
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
suppressed or ignored market surveillance reports, and who literally invented a concept which they brag about in their -if you look at their stationery it says, "Reliability Through Markets."
This is a concept invented by the ISO in which they
would rely upon the spot market to get reliability.
So, this debate about whether the ISO ordered a ramp up of a power plant or it was done discreetly at the site is irrelevant because the same people were in charge of the rules as were in charge of the plants.
And I know I've come back to this many times, but every time I want to keep reminding myself that there were many paths and many opportunities for manipulation here.
And every action taken by the ISO during this period was being run by an ISO that was controlled by the actions of the generators and marketers, including its Chairman, who was also the President of the Independent Energy Producers Association at the time.
Page 6
8ENERGY.TXT 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 So, there's a lot of confusion out there that when the ISO does something, it was, quote, "the state" doing this.
FERC expressly prohibited the state from having an Ms. Bowen was on the oversight board But FERC told her, as an oversight
oversight board rule.
during this period of time.
board member, expressly prohibited her from taking any action to overrule the stakeholder board.
California, in 1890, gave Ms. Bowen, as an oversight board member, the power to overrule the stakeholder board.
FERC refused to approve that provision, forced us to
pass another bill, taking the power away from economically
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
independent, politically appointed board members, gave all the power to the politically independent, economically dependent folk, and that's why you had an ISO that devised a system and a mechanism that allowed generators and marketers to profit through an operation and a methodology in operating the power plants that weren't consistent with prudent power plant operation.
So, we need to dispose of this fiction that because Duke can say, "ISO told us to do it," that that means it was some sort of independent government folk doing it.
was controlled by the same people.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Thank you, Senator Peace.
The ISO
Bob, if you would, please.
[Thereupon the witness, LARRY DRIVON, swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.]
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Thank you, Mr. Drivon.
I want to remind everybody, I don't think we're going to be having that many witnesses testify today, but for Page 7
8ENERGY.TXT 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 those, just recall that we have Evelyn here.
Welcome back, Evelyn.
Bear in mind the rules of the road when we have a court reporter here to ensure that folks don't talk on top of each other, so in fact the record can be clear.
Although, for She's back.
those of you who have been watching throughout our hearings, you'll know that Evelyn is not a shy individual when folks are talking in a way that does not provide for clarity on the record
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
itself.
Mr. Drivon, what I want you to do, if you would, please, let's start with Mirant, and then we'll go to Enron, and discuss where we've come since our last particular hearing.
But before doing so, I do want to clarify some confusion over this process of, quote-unquote, "contempt". is a process.
It
It started in our last hearing, but for it to be
ultimately finalized and sanctions given upon them, this Committee needs to take another step or two, and then ultimately the full Senate has to act as well.
As I think most of you are now aware in looking at this process that's rarely used, it is a process that has several steps to it. particular process.
With that, Mr. Driven, update us as to where we are with respect to the first entity.
MR. DRIVON: First of all, Senator, you're Today is one more potential step in that
absolutely correct that the contempt procedure with respect to all of the generators is at this point incomplete.
My
understanding is we're going move forward today with respect to two of the market participants, Mirant and Enron.
You're asking me for an update with respect to what has taken place concerning Mirant since the last hearing.
Page 8
8ENERGY.TXT 24 25 26 27 28 The first thing that occurred was on June 28th, we received a response to the subpoenas from Mirant.
They
raised numerous objections, including a lack of jurisdiction and other objections, on both a jurisdictional and evidentiary nature.
That was read and understood by us.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
And that day, Mr. Bittman appeared before this Committee in the hearing, explained his company's position, and advanced the ball to a considerable degree during that hearing, but was unable, as the Chair will remember, to complete the requested tasks at that time.
Although Mr. Bittman tried
mightily to do that, it was not possible.
At that point, Mirant was found in contempt for its failure to comply with the legislative subpoena that had been issued.
The next day, actually first contact with Mirant was later that day after the hearing, when I was in conference, personal conference with Mr. Bittman concerning their position.
He indicated to me that he believed that Mirant and the Committee could come to terms with respect to these issues and appreciated the time that he was given before the contempt process before this Committee was completed.
I spoke with him on the telephone a number of times, but prior to that, on the 3rd of July, we sent a letter to all counsel summarizing what the Committee expected to be done should contempt procedure be interrupted with respect to Enron and Mirant, and with respect to the other market participants as well.
That was done by way of letter.
On the 3rd, I and the Committee staff participated in an extensive conference call with all counsel representing the market participants concerning the proposed confidentiality agreement and other issues with respect to Page 9
8ENERGY.TXT 27 28 compliance with the subpoenas.
On the 3rd -- excuse me -- on the 5th, we sent a 1 letter to all counsel making certain modifications in the points by which the Committee was going to judge compliance concerning the subpoenas, and those changes to reflect the discussions that took place on the 3rd in the conference call.
On the 6th, we sent a letter by e-mail, fax, and U.S. mail notifying counsel for Enron and Mirant that the 07-10 hearing was continued until the 11th in this room.
And
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
additionally, the Committee sent a letter to counsel for AES, Duke, Dynegy, NRG, Reliant, and Williams advising that the hearing to consider compliance for those companies would be continued to July the 18th.
I spoke with the Duke attorney with regard to those communications, and on a Saturday, confirmed with him that his client and the others named would not need to be here today but would need to be here on the 18th.
I spoke with Mr. Bittman, representing Mirant, on the 7th of July, during which time he indicated to me that Mirant was securing a location for the document depository and was forwarding priority responsive documents to that facility, and arranged a meeting with me on Tuesday, July the 10th, to discuss these matters in further detail.
I had a number of phone conversations with Mr. Bittman, including a telephone conversation which took place on July 8th, during which we discussed in particular the specific confidentiality agreement provisions and the protocol for the document depository and access thereto, together with other issues having to do with compliance concerning the subpoena.

CHAIRMAN DUNN: We operate on simple premises 1 1 2 3 here.
MR. DRIVON: Well, being from Stockton, I In addition to that, I met with Mr. Bittman and Mr. Starbird, both representing the defendant -- excuse me -the market participant Mirant, concerning the confidentiality agreement and the document depository protocol.
In addition to that, I had other telephonic communications during that general time period concerning these issues.
We came to an agreement last night with respect to the confidentiality agreement, document depository protocol and access thereto, with the representatives from Mirant who were authorized by that particular market participant to enter into that agreement, and I was taken to the site where the documents have been deposited.
I there had an opportunity to
look at the facility, which was then containing about 89,000 documents.
I was given uncontrolled access to whichever of
those I wanted for the purpose of determining in general the quality of the documents that had been deposited there.
I was told that at 10:00 o'clock last night an additional 53,000 documents would be provided to that particular facility.
I was informed that the document depository would be
moved from its current location on the 21st Floor to a location, a permanent location, on the 2nd Floor of the same building, which I believe is United States Bank Building.

CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. DRIVON: The lions in front.
Maybe I have
The one with the lions in front,
appreciate your deference, Senator.

I did, as a matter of fact, spend time there last night, looking at the documents which I pulled at random from the boxes.
I found those documents to contain highly sensitive
information of the type that we have requested on our priority list, including risk management documents, output logs, confidential memoranda with respect to the plant operation, maintenance, acquisition, and other particulars that we asked for.
And it would be my report, pending a more complete
investigation of those documents, that there is a substantial number of documents responsive to our short list of highly sensitive documents that has been produced by Mirant in that fashion.
This morning at 9:30, I met with Mr. Bittman and Mr. Starbird in the Senate office at 2080, and a confidentiality agreement was signed by them. thereon.
The agreement concerning the depository and access thereto was also signed by yourself and by representatives of Mirant, Mr. Bittman and Mr. Starbird.
It is my report that Mirant has been extremely cooperative, very substantive in their attempts to come to 1 I secured your signature
1 2 3 4 5 6
agreement with the Committee.
That they were willing to make
substantial changes in their positions that had previously been stated with respect to matters involving confidentiality to bring them in line with the provisions that this Committee was willing to accept.
That their production of documents by my
preliminary examination seems to be highly responsive to our Page 12
8ENERGY.TXT 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 requests.
They indicate to me that they intend in the further
and dramatic production of documents -- dramatic in terms of quantity and quality -- over the next ensuing days and weeks, and have no objection to their further compliance being examined from time to time by the Committee.
We reserve in that confidentiality agreement the right of this Committee to proceed by way of contempt under the existing subpoenas in the future should compliance issues change with respect to Mirant.
I have found their attitude to be cooperative.
have found them to be pleasant to deal with, and responsive to our requests, needs and demands.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: If I can summarize where we are I
following your comments, in your dealings with the company, we have a document depository that's been established here in the downtown area.
MR. DRIVON: Yes.
We have over 100,000 documents
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
that are currently in the depository.
MR. DRIVON: Yes.
And your preliminary review 1
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
indicates that they appear to be responsive to our priority
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
requests.
MR. DRIVON: Yes.
They have signed a
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
confidentiality agreement that is acceptable to the Committee and to Legislative Counsel.
MR. DRIVON: Yes.
And your recommendation is that
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
we terminate the contempt process as to that company? MR. DRIVON: I would recommend that the contempt Page 13
8ENERGY.TXT 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 process be interdicted with respect to them, rather than terminated, because we reserve the right to proceed further with respect to the question of contempt should the issue of compliance change, but that the current process be interdicted and interrupted, and that any finding respect to contempt that has at least preliminarily taken place to this point be purged.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: From the Chair's perspective, for
the Committee's benefit, I participated in several of those meetings directly, along with Special Counsel, with the representatives from Mirant.
I'll tell you that I share the views of Mr. Drivon that they indeed, since the last hearing, have shown a high degree of cooperation and willingness to respond to our requests associated with the subpoena, including the document depository, and an acceptable from our perspective confidentiality agreement, as well as putting the priority documents that we requested in the depository, or at least in the process of putting them in the depository.
It's unfortunate we have to reach this kind of 1 point, but sometimes crisis is what brings folks together.
But I do want to extend a thank you to their company representatives, Mr. Bittman and Mr. Starbird, as well as to the company itself, for the cooperation or level of cooperation we've seen in the past week-and-a-half or so.
It
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
has been a refreshing change from what we have seen from many of the market participants up until now.
So, we appreciate that very much.
level of cooperation continues.
Mr. Drivon, did you want to add something? MR. DRIVON: Yes, there is one further point We hope that
which Mirant does understand, and that's that a final formal Page 14
8ENERGY.TXT 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 approval of the form of confidentiality agreement that we've entered into requires that it be reviewed in its final form by Legislative Counsel, and that the signature of Mr. Schmidt be obtained prior to its becoming fully executed.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Understood.
We stated that
pretty clearly last time, and we've been operating under that premise and involving Leg.
Counsel along the process here.
Let me open it up.
If any of the Committee
Members have any questions, or Mr. Starbird or Mr. Bittman, if you want to make any additional comments.
I suspect this is one
of those, when you're ahead you remain quiet.
If any of the Committee Members wish to ask any questions of either Mr. Drivon or the representatives from Mirant, they are welcome to do so.
If not, at the end of the process today, Mr. Drivon, we will be making a motion covering all the matters 1 that we heard, but certainly the motion will be made based upon your recommendations to the Committee as to Mirant.
With that, Mr. Drivon, anything further as to Mirant? MR. DRIVON: Not with respect to Mirant.
I continually mispronounce it,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Mirant.
My apologies, by the way.
MR. DRIVON: One of us is mispronouncing it,
Senator.
I'm not certain it's you.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: I suspect it probably is me
that's all right.
Let's move on to Enron.
This will probably take
a little bit longer because I think we do have a witness that will be testifying.
Let me explain how we're going to handle
this, basically the same way.
I want to make some preliminary Page 15
8ENERGY.TXT 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 comments, then open it up to Mr. Drivon.
We're going to invite Mr. Kirby.
Mr. Kirby, you'll want to make some comments? know? You'll assess it? MR. KIRBY: I do, your Honor.
I've never been called your Honor I suspect, Or you don't
CHAIRMAN DUNN: before, but I appreciate that.
Anyways, so we'll go from my opening comments.
Of course, if any of the Committee Members wish to comment, they're welcome to do so as well, to Mr. Drivon or Mr. Kirby, who is legal counsel for Enron.
The only introductory comment I want to make, just so everybody is aware, there's been some rumored whispers 1 around.
In fact, Enron did initiate litigation against the Committee this morning at 8:58, to be exact, in the Sacramento Superior Court here, obviously, in Sacramento.
not here this morning to comment upon that, to debate it.
We're That
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
process will unfold as is required according to the rules of litigation.
But for those of you that are interested in it, I will give you the caption number and case number in case you so desire.
It is entitled, "Enron Corporation, Plaintiff, Versus
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market; and Senate Committee on Rules."
It is
Sacramento Superior Court Case Number 01A, as in Apple, S as in Sam, 04141: 01AS04141.
The file stamp date this morning is
July 11th at 8:58.
Mr. Kirby was gracious enough to provide the Committee with several copies.
We're trying to make additional There are many exhibits

We'll try to get those out as quickly as

sometimes get burdened by those requests, and we may ultimately have to defer everybody to the Sacramento Superior Court who wish to have that.
The complaint that was delivered to me was also accompanied by a cover letter from Mr. Kean, who is Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff from Enron Corporation, Houston, a company cover letter.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
Again, I want to reiterate, this is a lawsuit that, among other things, attempts to terminate the investigation based on the arguments advanced by Enron, among other things.
We are not here to comment on it or debate it.
We're here to discuss the continuation of the last hearing.
MR. KIRBY: Your Honor? Yes, Mr. Kirby.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY:
There is no request in that lawsuit That is not what the lawsuit
to terminate this investigation.
seeks.
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
We are still reviewing it,
Michael, and we will obviously be -- all right.
So, let's continue forward.
I just want to make
sure that everybody's aware of that so we can move that issue aside here, because that's not what we're here to debate this morning.
That will be handled in due course.
Mr. Drivon, we are back to you.
Update us with
respect to the dealings of the Committee with Enron.
MR. DRIVON: Yes, and I appreciate Mr. Kirby's
acquiescence to the point and withdrawal of any indication within his complaint that challenges the jurisdiction of this Page 17
8ENERGY.TXT 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Committee to hold this investigation.
On 06-28, Enron forwarded a response to the subpoenas to the Committee, raising numerous objections.
That
response was delivered to us before 1:30 in the afternoon, but after this Committee had convened its proceeding.
They objected
to the Committee's jurisdiction to hold the investigation, claiming exclusive jurisdiction was under the Federal Energy 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
Regulatory Commission to conduct such an investigation.
Additionally, they asserted that documents located outside the State of California are beyond the jurisdiction of this Committee's ability to compel production.
They further objected that this Committee's investigation and subpoena is related to the Attorney General's investigation which is fatally and irreparably compromised by the blatant public bias and hostility which the Attorney General has displayed himself concerning Enron and its officers.
On the 28th, after the hearing, and a full report by myself of what had occurred with respect to Enron in the period of time leading up to the Committee hearing, Senator Morrow moved to find Enron and Mirant in contempt for their failure to comply with the legislative of subpoena process, thereby initiating the process by which contempt could be found by this Committee and ultimately by the Senate.
The next day, I was called by counsel for Enron, Mr. Kirby.
process.
And Mr. Kirby and I discussed the upcoming Committee And Mr. Kirby reiterated to me in a lengthy
conversation his concerns with respect to the process, the jurisdiction of the Committee, our ability to obtain documents from his company, and in general that the process had been unfair with respect to his client.
On the 3rd, we sent a letter summarizing the Page 18
8ENERGY.TXT 25 26 27 28 proceedings I've talked about before.
On the 3rd again, we had
the conference call I talked about with respect to Mirant, also including representatives of Enron.
On the 5th, we sent the letter I talked about 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
concerning modifications to the prior letter that had gone ought.
On the 6th, we sent a letter by e-mail, fax, and U.S. mail advising Enron that the hearing on the 10th would be continued to do the 11th in this room, and we sent the information notice to the other market participants with respect to continuing their matters until the 18th.
I was contacted by Mr. Kirby, who, on the 9th, who initially left a message for me on my cell phone, and I attempted to call him back.
He was at that time, this being
about two minutes after the message hit, he was at that time on the telephone with staff in our office, indicating that he had been informed by Mr. Kleinman, representing Duke, that there was no hearing with respect to any of the people this week, and that he received that communication on Saturday and had assumed, based on the communication from Duke's attorney, that there would not be a hearing this week.
I did talk to him that morning directly on the phone.
I know that he was informed by staff that his reliance
on the communication from the Duke attorney had been misplaced, and that his reliance should have been placed on the direct communications from our office that were sent to him by fax, e-mail, and U.S. Post Office.
He and I again during the, I believe, two telephone conversations on that day, discussed in detail his client's concerns with respect to the process, jurisdiction, ability of the Committee to proceed, and other matters such as Page 19
8ENERGY.TXT 28 that.
2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 On that date, I sent him a letter memorializing our recent conversations and correspondence, and indicating that he had also, by the way, asked for a continuance until next week for Enron.
I in my letter indicated to him that it was not my
place to grant continuances on behalf of the Committee, but that I could make a recommendation.
request be denied, and it was.
We communicated that information to him, and he was informed that his client would be -- his client's matter would be considered this morning by this Committee.
He had informed me on the 9th -- actually, I think before that, on Friday, that it was his company's intention to produce somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000 pages of documentation, representing some of the documentation accumulated by Enron within the State of California, and that he intended to produce that on Monday.
On Monday, he indicated that by reason of having relied upon Mr. Kleinman, that he had called off the people who were going to work the weekend to produce those documents to us on Monday, and so, they weren't produced on Monday, and they haven't been produced up until the time of this hearing, as far as I know; although, since I've left the office, I don't know what may have happened in that regard.
On the 10th, that's yesterday, I had several conversations, as I recall, with Mr. Kirby concerning his company's objections and concerns with respect to jurisdiction, production of documents, and the manner in which his company was being treated and singled out with respect to this procedure.
2 Yesterday afternoon, you had a personal Page 20 My recommendation was that his
1
8ENERGY.TXT 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 conversation of some considerable length, I believe, in the neighborhood of twenty minutes, directly with Mr. Kirby, where I understand the same objections were made, the same concerns expressed, and the same allegations put forward relative to his impression that his client had been differently and unfairly treated by this Committee.
He requested again of you that the
matter be continued until next week for his client.
You spoke with me concerning that conversation following the termination of it.
We discussed the matter, and I
was instructed to call him back and inform him that there would be no continuance, and that the matter would be taken up on the basis set forth in the prior letters that I discussed previously.
At 8:00 -- last night, during a couple of the conversations that we had with Mr. Kirby, we were informed that his client was inclined to file a lawsuit against us.
We asked
for a copy of that complaint at that time so that we could have an opportunity to see it.
We were not provided with a copy of
that complaint until it had been filed this morning.
We were informed last evening about 5:30 or 6:00 o'clock that they still intended to make that filing, and this morning we received notification, shortly after 9:00 o'clock, that at 8:57, the Committee had been sued in Sacramento Superior Court.
You obtained copies of that complaint from Mr. Kirby sometime around quarter to ten this morning.
is the status.
2 And that
1 2 3 4
As of this time, Enron has not signed a confidentiality agreement, spoken with me separately concerning the specific provisions of a confidentiality agreement, at least since the last hearing.
They have not assigned a document Page 21
8ENERGY.TXT 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 depository protocol.
They have not signed the access agreement.
They have not agreed to sign a nondestruct order, and we have as yet not received their document retention/ destruction policies, other than as reference in a letter by them to the effect they would not turn the document destruction/retention policy over to us until they had a confidentiality order because they considered that particular document to be of a confidential nature.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Okay.
Before any recommendations
are made or suggested, what I would like to do is, Mr. Kirby, I want to invite you up.
As he's settling in here, I think it looks like we're going to have a few, you may want to shift to a different chair, Mr. Drivon.
Mr. Drivon, I want to note also for the record one of the primary objections of Enron, which I'm sure Mr. Kirby is probably going to start with right out of the box, is the claim for a ruling on their objections which were provided to this Committee on the day of the June 28th hearing.
The Chair is prepared to make recommendations as to those objections, but certainly let's open it up first to Mr. Kirby, after I go through the objections, one by one.
A
little bit later, certainly, Mr. Kirby, you're welcome to make further comment.
But as with all witnesses, Mr. Kirby, we've 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
got to do our duty over here.
MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, I was told by Mr. Drivon
that I was not a witness, that I was an attorney appearing here today.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: I don't want to go counter to any
agreements with Mr. Drivon here.
MR. DRIVON: To the extent that Mr. Kirby is Page 22
8ENERGY.TXT 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 appearing here as an attorney, it would be my recommendation that he be handled in the same way as was Mr. Bittman at the last hearing and not be sworn.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Okay, we will do that.
If you're
going to verge into actual factual commentary, Mr. Kirby, we'll put you under oath.
But as we did with Mr. Bittman, we'll rely
on your duty as a lawyer in the State of California.
MR. KIRBY: Honor, which I recognize.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Okay, great.
And an officer of the court, your
Mr. Kirby, we open it up to you.
MR. KIRBY: appreciate the opportunity.
I'm going to go out of order here because I want to address -- and I do not, as the Court indicated -- I keep referring to you -- I'm so used to judges, your Honor.
The lawsuit that was filed, and I want to make it clear because this happened yesterday.
I had a conversation with Mr. Drivon.
At approximately 11:30, And I asked the specific Thank you, your Honor, and I
question, because these objections that I'm going to get to have never been considered or ruled upon.
I asked the question of 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Mr. Drivon:
Is it the Committee's position that Enron has to
file a lawsuit to avoid any waiver arguments? His response was no, that in his opinion, a lawsuit would be premature.
I asked him also the question about: Was it his
position that Enron had to file a lawsuit to preserve its position with respect to contempt? And his -- at that point, Senator, he said that he had not discussed the issue with you. you.
Page 23 He would confer with
8ENERGY.TXT 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 your Honor.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Before you do that, Mr. Kirby, preserve it.
As of noon yesterday, we were told a lawsuit was unnecessary and one was not going to be filed.
So, I want to address that sequence of events, So, as of noon yesterday, the position was that there would be no waiver of any kind, and it would be premature for Enron to file a lawsuit.
Within the hour I got call back.
interrupted on another call.
In fact, I got
Mr. Drivon wanted to talk to me.
He said he had conferred with the Committee, and what he had said about a lawsuit being premature was not the Committee's position, and that I needed to, if I wanted to avoid any waiver arguments, I needed to file a lawsuit.
That's why the lawsuit was filed this morning, to
let me throw on a comment, too, for clarity, because Mr. Drivon, after that conversation, did in fact talk to me.
2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
The concern, at least from the Chair's perspective was, we obviously can't provide you and your client legal advice.
I know you were not seeking it from us.
And so,
our position was, you've got to do whatever is necessary, obviously.
We haven't deemed anybody's objections waived along this process.
So, maybe there's a point we can resolve the suit that was filed this morning.
MR. KIRBY: I think that's true, your Honor.
I
mean, that's the only reason that this -- I want to make this clear -- the only reason this case was filed was because I got the distinct message yesterday afternoon that we were in danger Page 24
8ENERGY.TXT 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 not.

That's not the lawsuit, and it's not pleaded in I appreciate you've not had an opportunity, but I
want to make clear that Enron did not bring a lawsuit to cease this Committee's entire activities in any respect.
The question is, there are certain jurisdictional objections to the subpoenas.
There are clear rights of due

SENATOR PEACE: Mr. Chairman, I had thought it And again, I am willing to address those.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: My fellow colleague, Senator
was a good admonition on your part that this hearing would not be on the lawsuit.
However, if counsel insists on characterizing his lawsuit, I think that it's incumbent upon us to respond to what I would frankly view as a gross mischaracterization of the lawsuit I have in front of me.
The very first statement is an assertion of exclusive jurisdiction by FERC.
2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
Now, it's a wonderful irony that you also attach to this lawsuit asserting exclusive jurisdiction by FERC a letter signed by Mr. Kean which virtually argues the exact opposite with respect to Enron's alleged lack of culpability, and state regulatory agencies, and whatnot, having made all the mistakes.
MR. KIRBY: Senator, could I point you -- I don't
want to get off on the lawsuit -- but in fairness, if you want to look at Paragraph Seven and Eight of the complaint, it says very specifically that these issues regarding FERC jurisdiction have been raised, fully briefed and argued before United States District Judge Robert Whaley in the MDL proceeding.
specifically pleads, Senator -CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: Paragraph Eight.
The issues involving FERC's exclusive jurisdiction are the exclusive province of federal courts and cannot be raised here.
That's the point I'm making, Senator.

I'm sorry, Page Four, your Honor,
8ENERGY.TXT 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 This lawsuit does not raise those issues because they cannot be raised in that forum.
SENATOR PEACE: I want to make that clear.
In your prior letter, and in your
pleadings, you argue that this Committee lacks jurisdiction because FERC has exclusive jurisdiction.
You also mischaracterized, and I'm glad you brought attention to Paragraphs Seven and Eight.
If I were in
your shoes, I wouldn't, because you mischaracterize that case as well.

Are you referring to Senator Burton's lawsuit? SENATOR PEACE: Your contention in this document,
which you may for public relations purposes want to disclaim, Enron's clear position to deny this Committee's jurisdiction.
Your basis of the -- and I've read through the complaint very quickly -- it is basically this.
There's
exclusive jurisdiction at FERC, and the documents that this Committee is asking for do not go to any reasonably contemplated legislative agenda, which you contend must constrain any kind of subpoena power which this Committee may have.
Now, one of the bills moving through this Legislature would make certain activity by marketers and/or generators a criminal act.
And I would suggest that it
certainly would be within the confines of this Legislature to get information associated with what kind of behavior occurred or didn't occur before it considered whether or not it should Page 27

But one really has to jump off just
When you contrast Enron's behavior with all the
other folk, particularly since, as your principal points out in his letter, that you're such a small participant allegedly in 3 the market, with only $39 million at stake, your client doth protest too much.

does Enron seek so stridently to be contrasted by all the other companies? documents? It's interesting, particularly since you allegedly have so little at stake.
It's also interesting because you attached yourself to the effort to attempt to publish the Department of Water Resources purchasing, and then you hid behind that in your prior letter to this Committee, saying that, well, now that the Judge in San Diego has said that the state has to reveal all of these documents, this is another reason why Enron can't give these documents up to the Committee because we can't rely on the state to keep them confidential, because the Court may order you to make things you otherwise agree to in a confidentiality agreement, to go public.
And yet, Enron was behind the effort to make those documents public.
You are very smart people.
Nefarious and smart.

MR. DRIVON: I actually do know the difference.
To the extent
I need to clear up one thing.
that Mr. Kirby may have created the impression that we urged him to file a lawsuit, that is not accurate.
What the conversation was, was that although we did not believe such a lawsuit necessary, he needed to do whatever he needed to do to protect his client.
The decision to file a lawsuit was -- was Enron's decision.
It was not suggested by us.
It was not commanded by
us, and it was not conveyed to them as necessary by us.

I would only point out that the same proposal was not submitted to Enron.
Your Honor, I want to talk about -- my understanding is that this hearing today is to be a hearing on the objections by Enron to the subpoena duces tecum which was served on June 12, 2001.
Did we respond differently to the subpoena? The
As the Court in referencing, and Mr. Drivon, in
referencing the conduct of Mirant, my understanding, your Honor, nearly everyone if not all of the participants submitted written objections on June 28th to the subpoena.
That time had been
extended in writing, signed by Mr. Drivon, and it was originally to be at one -- if the Court will recall, excuse me.
The subpoena called for production at 1:30 P.M.
Mr. Drivon signed a letter that said all market
participants would have a seven-day extension.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: That's correct.
That would extend the time to 1:30 on

SENATOR MORROW: Don't think we're going to do
no false pretenses, Senator Morrow.
MR. KIRBY: Senator Dunn, despite the objections
that have gone back as forth, and the conversations, and I think it was clarified with Mr. Drivon, there really is, when you get down to Enron's response to the subpoena duces tecum, there are really three basic issues.
One is confidentiality.
And I say that, your
Honor, without waiving the FERC objections, but the Court -excuse me -- the Chair has already indicated what its position is on the FERC objection.
We have made it.
We have preserved
it, but that issue is not going to be decided here.
And I want to make it clear so that Senator Peace is aware of this, we have never said despite our FERC objections, we will not turn over a single document.
never been our position.
3 That's
1 2 3 4 5
There are serious issues of confidentiality, and I don't think anybody that has dealt with Mr. Drivon or any of the market participants would deny that.
As the Chair knows,
there have been two long exchange sessions, and I know Ms. Montgomery was involved in, where draft protective orders went Page 31
8ENERGY.TXT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 back and forth.
In fact, there were discussions about whether
that protective order should be in the state court or the federal court.
And you got to the point where it looked like in the discussions with counsel there was going to be a protective order that would adequately deal with those issues.
And then the Committee elected that they did not want to go forward with that.
And I understand now that there is apparently a confidentiality agreement that is at least acceptable to Mirant.
I haven't seen the form signed by Mirant.
The second issue, your Honor -- so, there is a huge issue, and because those are confidential, and the point that I make is, it cannot be seriously contended that Enron is making a frivolous argument about confidentiality of pricing data and forward contracts when the Governor of this state and the Attorney General of this state, as you will see in the attachments to this lawsuit, three expert witnesses have filed declarations in San Diego Superior Court on behalf of the Governor and the Attorney General, arguing as experts, that this information is highly sensitive; it is highly confidential, and it should not be disclosed.
Our point is, we agree with their position, that 3 it is confidential.
And those issues need to be dealt with.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
That's the issue of confidentiality.
The second issue, your Honor, is the jurisdictional -- let me take the third issue, because I think Mr. Drivon and I are in agreement on this.
The issue, the legal issue is whether or not a Senate committee can require a custodian of records in Houston, Texas to come to California and testify.
Page 32
8ENERGY.TXT 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 agreement.

Mr. Drivon, and he is free to speak his position, but I think agrees with me and our brief that no, you cannot.
It is clear in California law, a California Superior Court cannot require that.
So, the custodian cannot personally be That's one of our objections, and I don't think the
Committee's legal analysis disagrees with that, but that's part of my problem, your Honor.
To this day, I have submitted my objections.

I have never ever seen a legal argument, an I
authority, a case, even a letter saying this is our legal position, which I'm going to get to.
The third issue, your Honor, and I think as you and I talked yesterday, the issue is: How far does the subpoena
power of a Senate committee extend, and does it extend -specifically, does it extend beyond the state borders of California? That is, pure and simple, a legal issue.
I think, Senator, you and I and Mr. Drivon are in There has never been a case in the history of 3

question of first impression.
It is a

Honor.
And the problem that we have had from Enron's perspective is, even up to the letter that you sent, your Honor -- Mr. Chairman -- on July 5, the Committee -CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let me interrupt you.
And that's the issue, your
Senator Johannessen.
Page 33
8ENERGY.TXT 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 SENATOR JOHANNESSEN: I am very interested in the
issue of the subpoena power and the state borders.
Isn't there ample evidence that subpoena powers can go beyond state borders on other issues, or is this something specifically for this issue? MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, there has never been, to
my knowledge, at least I've not been provided with any legal authority from the Committee or its counsel, any case that has ever said that subpoena powers can go -- a state's subpoena -and I think as the Court, the panel, will recognize, almost all of these cases, obviously, arise in the context of court cases as opposed to Senate proceedings.
But the general rule in our view is, a state proceeding in California, as contrasted, Senator, with a federal proceeding, a state proceeding's subpoena powers extend to the state border.
Now, a different set of rules may apply when 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
there is a civil lawsuit between two parties.
Then that's -- I
don't want to get -- if the Court wants to hear it, but we have cited, there's a very clear reported case, the Amoco case, where insurance companies were sued -- out-of-state insurance companies were sued in California.
Clearly, in the pretrial
discovery process, you could require them to bring documents and subject people out-of-state to depositions.
But when the attempt was made to have them produce out-of-state residents to testify in a California court, the Court of Appeals in Amoco and the California Supreme Court denied review; said Section 1989 of the Code of Civil Procedure means exactly what it says.
A witness is not obliged to appear
unless he or she is personally served in the state or is a resident of the state when they're served.
Page 34
8ENERGY.TXT 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 As I said, I don't think you want to hear all -but that is the issue.
One of the things and the problem we have had, and I'm going to jump to the issues, we made objections.
As
competent as I like to think I am, there have been times when judges have disagreed with me and said, "No, I've read the other side's brief, and you're wrong."
What we contend, minimal due process requires, is that somebody -- and it has to be impartial, Senator -- somebody consider my legal arguments, the Committee's legal arguments, and make a ruling.
I suggested in conversations over two weeks ago, why not have the parties pick someone like a retired Justice of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, a retired federal judge, 3 and give us the benefit of it.
One of the problems that we have -CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: Let Mr. Kirby finish.

am, Senator, if I'm right, and there is a defect, a legal defect in the affidavit that generated the subpoenas, and if there's a legal defect on how far the subpoenas can reach, then there cannot even be a consideration of contempt.
What has happened here, what tramples on the rights of due process, is, I was told to make my objections by 1:30 on the 28th.
They were made by that time.
I expected that

This is a very simple, very short statute that we're dealing with.

comment that you made at the outset, where you felt that Enron was being treated differently.

the other companies.
MR. KIRBY: Can I address that? Let me finish.
You have argued your case differently than
SENATOR PEACE:
That may have been because of a policy position which Enron takes that's different than the other companies, or it may just have been a question of style.
But if we go back to the last hearing, you were the only company who came with a letter asserting exclusive FERC jurisdiction in a very confrontational way, making reference specifically to -- and I thought in an incredibly ironic way -the San Diego Judge's decision compelling the disclosure of the state purchasing records, which I hope you can appreciate from our perspective.
When the private companies say, we have to
keep all our documents secret, but the state has to publish theirs, it's sort of a pretty obvious effort, it seems to us, on the part of the private players to put the state purchasers at a competitive disadvantage.
I don't think the press has understood that very Page 37

purpose, but they've done so.
Now, you are treading, if I may dare, with your 4 lawsuit, and with the position that Enron is taking, into far more significant ground than anything that has to do with energy.
You're treading into the territory of asking a court to They didn't do it on

I hope you're prepared to go to the United States Supreme Court if you get any success.
And I can't imagine the It is a separation of powers issue of the
tumult and the seriousness of the institutional crisis that would be precipitated by a Houston company, hiring a San Diego lawyer, to precipitate a conflict between the California courts and the California Legislature.
This is a big deal.
And when Enron decides it's so important to keep their behavior secret that they are willing to precipitate a Constitutional conflict between the two branches of government, I can only assume that there's much more there to find than I ever imagined.
Now, I also understand why Enron would want to assert the exclusive jurisdiction of FERC.
As the largest
nonfederal government employer of former FERC employees and commissioners, Enron has a lot of confidence in how it will prevail at FERC.

And that is, on that day, June 28th, they did in fact provide written objections, but also provided documents.

have to operate on the premise there's something of substance in there -- my hope is Reliant didn't just give us junk -- that that's a difference.
That's a difference.
They asserted their
objections, yet at least made a step.
We're going to examine
that step next week, which did differentiate them from Enron.
SENATOR BOWEN: Senator Dunn, if I might.
What we did
I just think that that is critical.
last week, I think, was -- or two weeks ago -- we attempted to draw a line between those subpoenas that we had issued where we felt that some good faith response that would lead to an appropriate conclusion was, in fact, under way.
And the
production of a significant number of documents put us in a position where it would have been inappropriate, in my view, to proceed with contempt, any kind of contempt proceedings, until we had a chance to find out whether we were looking at hot chocolate orders or the kind of information that the Committee had requested.
So, there was really not much in the way to discuss about what to do with anyone who had responded, despite continuing objections and concerns about reaching an appropriate confidentiality agreement, with boxes of documents.
We had no such assurance that we would get 4
1 2 3 4 5 6
documents from Mirant.
And we have subsequently been able to
resolve that issue, and we now have documents.
Only Enron has put us in a position where they have argued that the Committee has no jurisdiction, and it's been one objection after another.
And this is not a court.
Page 41 It is a legislative
8ENERGY.TXT 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 proceeding.
And the issues are the manner of proceeding and the And they are set by this body.
issues are different.
Obviously, they have to meet with Constitutional mandates.
If you go back to the 1929 cement price fixing case, you will find that the court ruled that while the Legislature has the power to hold someone in contempt, and indeed to jail someone, that the subpoena has to have sufficient particularity.
But we have gotten no indication that Enron ever intends to comply with the subpoena.
MR. KIRBY: And that's why we're here.
Senator, that's not true, and I want
to go through the history here, because in the Chair's letter of July 3 and 5, the Chair made it very clear that the Committee's position was, to avoid contempt, you must waive all objections except as to confidentiality and trade secrets.
letter of July 3; it's in a letter of July 5.
I had a conversation with Mr. Drivon, and I appreciate we put a lot on him, given the narrative, but on Friday, July 6th, I said to Mr. Drivon, "Look, Enron is assembling documents and is going to produce documents, but I need to have an agreement with you that if I start producing documents on behalf of Enron, I am not going to waive all of my 4 objections."
And he confirmed that we would not be penalized That's in a

While she's getting that, 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Mr. Kirby, I tell you, the best face I could put on the events to this day is to go back to your original letter.

And Mr. Drivon
has explained what happened, and it was obviously a miscommunication.
But we are assembling documents.
SENATOR BOWEN: don't have any of the exhibits.
MR. KIRBY: I apologize, Senator.
So, when you refer to Exhibit 22, You'll have to help me because I

MR. KIRBY: Senator, in the interest of fairness,
I'd like you -- and this is not reflecting on this Committee, but it is the state's highest legal office -- I represent a corporation which has not been sued by the State of California, has never been charged criminally in any of these matters, and the highest legal officer of this state has suggested that the Chairman of my client should be taken to a prison cell, and all Page 43

Some shocking revelations are
going on in this Committee today.
MR. KIRBY: Senator, if the letter offended the I think
Committee, since I wrote it, I would apologize for it.
that in the context of what was going on at the time -SENATOR PEACE:
It isn't about being offended.
The letter reflected a very hostile and combative position with this Committee.
Whereas, the communications from the other
folks, no matter how disagreeable they may have been, they were Page 44
8ENERGY.TXT 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 professional and not laced with political, which is why I've not hesitated from responding politically in this exchange between you and I, because I think you opened that opportunity by lacing your communications with political commentary rather than legal commentary.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let me, if I can as the Chair
here, because I know Senator Johannessen wants to make a comment and Senator Bowen does, but before we do that, I want to provide a little clarification as well.
To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Kirby, your comments just now, that you've rented a depository space here in Sacramento and are prepared to put documents in there is news to us.
I don't know that you or anybody on behalf of Enron has 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
advised
us.
Mr. Drivon.
MR. DRIVON: Senator, I was told by Mr. Kirby
last week that his client was prepared to produce somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000 pages of documents; that they were in the process of trying to put together a depository.
Today is the first time I have heard that they have been successful in that hunt.
And I did not hear him say
that that success notwithstanding, that they had, in fact, made a deposit of those documents.
I further understand, Senator, that those documents represent documents that were here, present in the State of California, represent no infusion of documents from outside the State of California.
And further, would like to point out to you and to the Committee that one of the things that we made clear was that we expected to see here today a custodian of records from the various market participants.
Page 45 We were told that there is no
8ENERGY.TXT 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 custodian of records in the State of California for Enron.
yet, they have 25,000 documents at least in the State of California, and I don't know who is in charge of, in custodial charge of those documents.
I have to presume, Senator, that someone is, and I would further presume that since we've made our position clear in that regard, that person is here today.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let me make some additional And
comments here today as well, just following up on the tone issue; although, I don't want our Committee hearing to be drawn 5 too much farther down this thrust.
SENATOR MORROW: Mr. Chairman, before we do that,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
on that point by Mr. Drivon, if I can raise one issue, the question that's in my mind.
As far as these 30,000 documents that you appear willing to be put into a repository, it would be a correct understanding on my part that those -- well, you tell me, would those be made available or not to the Committee, pending the outcome of the lawsuit that you filed? MR. KIRBY: Your Honor -- excuse me, Senator --
the lawsuit that was filed was simply to get a hearing on very narrow issues.
The lawsuit did not seek -SENATOR MORROW: MR. KIRBY: That's fine.
So, the answer to your question is,
and I have suggested to Senator Dunn and to Mr. Drivon, I mean, I thought the issues that were raised by the lawsuit could be resolved in some fashion without the necessity of a formal lawsuit.
SENATOR MORROW: made available to the Committee? Page 46 Are these documents going to be
8ENERGY.TXT 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 MR. KIRBY: The only remaining issue is the As to some of those
confidentiality issue, obviously.
documents, there are confidentiality issues, as to some of them there are not, Senator.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR MORROW: Let me provide clarification -The answer is no, until and
unless we sign a confidentiality agreement that is amenable to 5 you.
MR. KIRBY: Senator, if I'm correct, the answer
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
is yes as to some, with or without a confidentiality agreement; no as to others unless and until we have a confidentiality agreement.
And I have now looked -- I mean, I've been given a
copy and I haven't analyzed the one that you signed with Mirant.
Obviously, Senator, in response -SENATOR MORROW: At least the answer is with
respect to some of those documents, it's not dependent on the outcome of the lawsuit that you filed.
MR. KIRBY: correct.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: But let me provide some That's correct; that's absolutely
clarification, Senator Morrow, because I think -- Mr. Kirby, let me ask a question which I think will provide more clarification to Senator Morrow's question.
The issue as to documents outside of the State of California is one that you want resolved by somebody, whether it be -- I suspect if this Committee resolves it against Enron, you would proceed with your lawsuit to resolve that question.
the documents that are either in the depository, or you are about to deposit in the depository, are California documents, not out-of-state documents; is that correct? MR. KIRBY: That's my understanding, Senator.
Page 47 And
8ENERGY.TXT 25 26 27 28 CHAIRMAN DUNN: I just want to make sure, Senator
Morrow, that we don't operate on the assumption that the lawsuit will cease to exist if, in fact, the depository is established and opened up to this Committee.
I don't think that's true.
5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
MR. KIRBY:
No, but I've also made it clear -Mr. Kirby, you made a
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
recommendation to me and I know to Mr. Drivon that you just want some neutral arbitrator to resolve -MR. KIRBY: And it doesn't have to be an
arbitrator, your Honor, and it doesn't mean that it couldn't be resolved informally.
But the position that I was given yesterday was, I subjected myself to a waiver argument if I didn't file the lawsuit.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: That's not quite what we said.
I just
We said, you need to do what you believe is appropriate.
want to make sure.
We're not taking a position on that.
I don't
want to beat that dead horse, so to speak.
I want to go back for a moment, Mr. Kirby, to the tone issue and your earlier letter.
Senator Johannessen, my apologies, and then we'll go to Senator Bowen.
Because we appreciate your comments.
It's not an
issue that was in need of an apology, but certainly we appreciate your gesture in that regard.
But I think the tone that Senator Peace was referring to was reiterated in the letter you provided me this morning from Mr. Kean.
And I just want to read a part of it
which I think reflects upon the tone issue that Senator Peace has raised.
One of the paragraphs says: "Apart from the concerns that Page 48
8ENERGY.TXT 28 Enron has about the legality of 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the committee's discovery requests, Enron is equally, if not more, concerned about the tone and direction of the committee's activities.
Based
on those activities, it is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the committee's actions are designed to uncover the facts underlying the price spikes in California's wholesale electric power market, or to create a convenient political scapegoat to shoulder the blame for California's policy mistakes and changes in market fundamentals."
And he goes on to say that Enron's been singled out, an issue that you have advanced.
He goes on to say we
haven't zeroed in on the municipal entities.
Please tell him he's incorrect about that.
In
fact, we have gotten documents in response to our request from LADWP.
Other municipal entities are also on the receiving end
of a request, which will ultimately be turned into subpoenas if necessary.
So, he's incorrect there.
As well as, he references the Committee has not investigated the circumstances that led to three major electric utilities, and refers to, why aren't you focusing in on utilities? We have made document requests to the three IOUs in 5 In fact, they were not outside of the scope of the Page 49

So again, I raise those couple of points in the letter simply because the tone issue was raised by Senator Peace.
Even if we ignore your letter, it's still there as of
July 11th.
SENATOR PEACE: As long as we go to that letter,
since obviously part of Enron's agenda is to get this letter sort of into the public que, the one thing I have to give Mr. Kean some credit for here is consistency in the letter.
As you indicated in terms of the contemporary issues that he raises, as they relate to this Committee, is the information is inaccurate.

But then Mr. Kean's letter, when you want to take advantage of that truthful statement, every market rule, every market mechanism, how the PX worked, all that stuff was decided by FERC, not by California policy makers, one hundred percent of it.
All right? And you want to take advantage of that exclusive FERC jurisdiction to the extent that you feel you'll do better back there.
But then, when you want to talk about, well, things FERC was You He's inaccurate with respect to the

Why don't you take that question back to Mr. Kean and have him explain to you how he rationalizes those obviously inconsistent positions.
And while you're at it, because obviously you Page 50
8ENERGY.TXT 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 weren't on this train during this thing, let me take us back four years ago.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: If you can do it briefly, Senator
Peace, because we want to establish a quorum.
SENATOR PEACE: In these last assertions of
Enron's positions, what he doesn't tell you is that it was Enron that invented the concept of a separate ISO and PX.
It is Enron It is
that's still pushing that in Japan today, as we speak.
Enron whose Chairman was in Spain, pushing the same concept of separation of generation and transmission.
It was Ken Lay, as a bureaucrat in the federal government, who began the whole concept of the competitive model being dependent upon the disaggregation of the parts.
And you know, Mr. Lay ought to take some pride in that notion of how to move forward, because he's spread it throughout the world.
Now, let me to go the final piece of this.
You
make reference -- in this letter you also make reference, and interestingly enough, relies upon press reports of what the ALJ, the federal ALJ -- inaccurate press reports, keeping to a year-long theme, of what the ALJ said in our hearings back at FERC.
The period of time that FERC is now looking at is from October forward.
During this period of time, none of these 5 The FERC had already blown up You had

a dark, bilateral market, exactly what Enron always wanted.
They got exactly what they wanted, and prices went up, not down.
Now, I have no quarrel.
There's a legitimate
economic argument, and there's good arguments on all sides of this, how to sort this stuff out.
Page 51
8ENERGY.TXT 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 What's really, and I think this is a real pivotal moment, in all sincerity, in this public dialogue, because there's been a tremendous amount of disinformation, most of it peddled by those attempting to defend the notion of competition on a national and international scale, and fearful that a California thing would spin out of -- would hurt the national movement toward competition.
At some point, you all are going to have to dispose of the fiction that California was unique.
There's
nothing unique about it, and it was a FERC-approved model, you were all there at its birth.
And the effort, the fiction of calling California a unique creature didn't work.
Now, I'm actually one that believes over the long haul, competition's a good thing if you do it rationally, sensibly, and transition.
Enron used to argue that you've got to jump into the swimming pool; just got to go do it.
Well, we've seen what Some people can

I don't know.
And whether the confidentiality of the Governor, if the double standard that is being used now, that we can't have anything, we're not allowed as Legislators to see what the Governor is spending, which I think is beyond our comprehension at the moment, and at the same time saying that you have to now deliver all the documentation that you feel is confidential is a double standard.
I understand that argument.

So, all I'm asking for is The The problem is, from the sound of what I'm hearing, it's going to be a cold day in Hell until this confidentiality agreement will be signed.
And if that's the
case, then you can object from here until the cows come up to my ranch before anything happens.
MR. KIRBY: Senator Johannessen, that is not the

And whether or not the subpoena powers that we
have are sufficient to get the information that we have asked for.
Now, if those questions can be answered in the affirmative, that we do in fact have that power, we do in fact can ask the documentation to be produced, and you have not produced it until the timeline, then your are in contempt.
Is that too simple, or am I missing something? Otherwise, you're going to spend the next five years in court.

I just want everybody to understand what we're going to do here quickly, because we need to give the court reporter a quick break coming up.

I have
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
No one has ever submitted a single legal
argument, brief, or even a telephone argument as to why my objections are invalid.
And I've already been held -- my client
has been held in contempt.
What we are saying is, due process requires what I think you're saying: Listen to the legal arguments; somebody
make a ruling on them; and if somebody says, "Enron, you're wrong and the Senate is right," or "The Senate is wrong and Enron is right," that's the way courts operate every day in this democracy.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let Mr. Kirby finish.
MR. KIRBY: And there are two reported cases in Hold on, Senator Johannessen.
the history of California jurisprudence of Senate contempt, both of which have been reversed.
And what the Senate did in both
cases, the courts have said, it is true you are a legislative Page 56
8ENERGY.TXT 23 24 25 26 27 28 body, but once you start to try hold somebody in contempt, you have to act like a court.
You cannot trample on their right to
due process; you cannot disregard their absolute right.
Senator, with all due respect, an accused criminal has been given more opportunity to have a hearing on their objections than I have.
Nobody has ever told me today 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
that my objections are without merit.
I think Senator's going
to rule on them, which I have a problem with, but at least in a democracy, you get a court hearing.
I was told Thursday by letter at noon, on the 5th, if you've got any legal authorities, I want them on file by Friday.
I stayed up all night.
You've got a 12-page argument.
Our legal arguments are sound
I think there's 9 or 10 cases.
and I stand.
I have yet to see a single case, a single statute, ever cited to me that says, your legal arguments on the subpoena issues are full of hot air.
If Larry Drivon said, "Mr. Kirby, go read the Jones versus Smith case, it says we have the exact power to do what we're doing," I would go read it, and if he was right, I would tell my client, "I think there's some legal argument."
That hasn't happened, Senator.

And you're
If you have the jurisdiction, and if you have the
authority, but those issues have never been resolved, and I'm already in contempt.
And that's the problem that my client has,
and why we think we're not getting a fair shake.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: I want to reiterate, as I started
this hearing, the Chair prepared to make recommendations and address the concern that you've just raised, Mr. Kirby.
I know Evelyn's getting really dicey over here.

We have to be out of this committee room at about
1:20, 1:25, because there is a 1:30 committee hearing in this room that we have to vacate for.
My preference is that we be concluded by that point in time, which means we have to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time.
I know that Senator Bowen wanted to make some I know that Senator Morrow wanted to make some We'll turn to those.

Mr. Kirby, it strikes me that your client has served you up and has invited itself somewhat to a public flogging here today.
MR. KIRBY: That's why I get paid the big bucks, Morrow, did you want to make comments prior to the break? SENATOR MORROW: It seems like we're getting back
perhaps, deservedly so, and Senator Peace has fit the bill.
But I think this Committee has been very generous An attorney of your caliber, and certainly with
Enron, with its resources, frankly, what we're hearing today we should have heard back on June 28th.
Be that as it may, we are here.
your objections.
So far I've heard three.
We're hearing
I understand there
are more in the written document.
While I have done some research myself, in an open argument, if our Special Counsel or the Chair cares to address those objections or wish to add to that, let's get on with that.
I've got a very busy day.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Great point, Senator Morrow.
Senator Bowen, did you want to comment, then we're going to get right to the objections, because we have to wrap up by 1:20.
SENATOR BOWEN: I want to be clear that this
process that we're undergoing, this legislative subpoena, is very different than what you might get in a court.
6
1 2
The reason for that is the aims of the Legislature are different.
I think it's important for people to Page 59
8ENERGY.TXT 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 judgment.
understand that.
We do not have the power to render a money We cannot impose a jail sentence; although, we do
have the power to issue contempt citations.
But the purposes for which we seek information are because we are responsible for setting policy for the State of California.
This morning, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order forcing four regional transmission organizations to be filed in this country.
That raises the
stakes in our discussion about what we should do as we decide how to structure our energy system.
And it, I think, makes it
all the more important that we really understand how this market functions and what is happening.
This may be the moment, the
dividing moment in our decision to take control over the transmission lines, to own the transmission lines.
But all of these are policy matters that we cannot make good judgments about without access to information.
And our power to get that information is broad, because our responsibility to set policy that fuels -- that will allow electricity to flow to both the new economy servers and the old economy cement plants is broad.
The contempt, a contempt citation takes an actual vote of the entire Senate.
It is not until that occurs, and it
has not yet occurred, that there is a formal contempt finding concluded.
We're not there yet.
We are in the process of going 6

through that.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Mr. Kirby, let's turn to you.
Mr. Drivon, did you have some short comments to make? Notice my editorial there.
MR. DRIVON: I do.
Page 60
8ENERGY.TXT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 at this time.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. DRIVON: Yes, sir.
You're prepared to take up question of objections
As that process begins, I wanted to Counsel complains
say that this is not an adversarial process.
that he has not been provided with points and authorities with respect to his objections, et cetera, confusing this with an adversarial process, which it is not.
Further, Senator Dunn, the question of who should rule on these objections is clearly set out by California statute.
And the person to rule on such objections as may be
proper and relevant would be you, sitting as the Chair, or the Committee, if that is your choice.
Further, there is considerable question insofar as I am concerned, and I believe my point has some concurrence by some of the Legislative Counsel who looked at this, there is considerable question as to whether, if, and to what extent objections are appropriate in this setting.
And as you move toward the point where you determine whether to address these objections, I just remind you of those points in my capacity as Special Counsel.
And I just hope I'm worth what I'm getting paid.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Here's what we're going to do.
6 I know there's some

points you want to cover.
Try to make it as brief as possible.
We've covered a lot of ground.
And as you hear in court all the time, Mr. Kirby, don't repeat what's in your papers.
This Senator, your Honor, But if there's
whatever I may be, have read them thoroughly.
additional comments you want to make, Mr. Kirby, please.
MR. KIRBY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Your Honor, I'll try to go right to it.
We have made objections -- let's back up.
The subpoena, and Senator Bowen raised the issue, but a subpoena is a subpoena.
And I respectfully submit the law
regarding subpoenas does not vary in terms of what is required for a subpoena duces tecum between a state court and a state legislature.
Both of them require an affidavit.
I think the Senate recognized that, because every subpoena that this Committee has served has been accompanied by an affidavit.
That's CCP 1985.
Once you go that route, the affidavit must comply with California law.
The case's replete.
You cannot file an
affidavit saying that the witness is informed and believes.
That's the essence of this.
There are a number of other defects in that It can't be conclusionary, and that is addressed in So, there's a defect.
the cases that we have cited.
It raises -- and I'm going to go right now to what Mr. Drivon said -- is that you as the providing -- as the presiding officer, decide this.
6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
The statute that I think he's referring to is -is it the Evidence Code you're relying on Counsel? MR. DRIVON: MR. KIRBY: I believe it's the Government Code.
The statutes in the state talk about
when, if the presiding officer, if it's not a court, should resolve the claims in the same manner as a court determines, for obvious fairness reasons.
Senator, I have raised objections to the substance and adequacy of your affidavit.
rule on those.
You are now going to
If I came to this hearing and suggested,
Senator, why don't you let me rule on your affidavit, you would Page 62

But the procedure that is set up is that you are going to rule on my objections, and I dare say, after I've already -- my client's already been voted in contempt.
And our position is, and I think Senator Johannessen was on the right track, the first thing would be to have a hearing and let somebody decide these issues.
somebody may well tell us that I'm wrong, all right? happened before.
And then It's

It did serve the response.
We served our response by the 28th.
We raised objections.
No one has ever to this 7
time, 12:30 on the 11th of July, ever said to me, "I've read
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
your objections, and we consider them to be valid or invalid, and here's the contrary argument."
In fact, in all fairness, I just had a discussion with Legislative Counsel in the Men's Room about the subpoena issue.
And I think both sides have rational arguments.
It is a case that's never been decided.
So, our point is, here I am, voted in contempt.

notice to file my legal arguments.
I'm told with one day's I filed it.
I did that.
I've still never seen anything in opposition to it.
I think it is, therefore, I respectfully submit, Senator, it's a foregone conclusion that the objections are going to be overruled.
And I don't think that is what is Page 63

choice.
But those issues, I think, can be resolved.
There is a single issue that is -- there's two single issues here: the jurisdictional issue, the objections contemplated as a due process fair hearing.
By the same token, I have indicated a willingness to meet with counsel with the Committee to try to resolve this issue.
It was not our preference to file a lawsuit We even, given the message we got, wasn't much
beyond the State of California; the confidentiality issues.
And I think the confidentiality issues probably, and talking to both Alexandra and to Mr. Drivon, are closer to being resolved.
But those are the fundamental issues.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 by you.
Mirant.
And I haven't seen the deal that was made with I haven't had a chance to discuss it with my client.
So my position is, your Honor, we've been told we're going to be treated the same as everybody else.
If we are
on the same calendar as everybody else on July 18th, we will be.
And I say this not as -- let me just paraphrase.
I respectfully submit I do not believe in the present context that this is going to be the only lawsuit that is on file over the issue of confidentiality.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: We've been told that before, not
MR. KIRBY:
Not by me.
And it was forced upon us, in my view, because of the nature of the contempt proceeding.
But I think those issues of confidentiality can and should be resolved without raising what Senator Peace refers to as a major conflict between the Legislature and the Judicial Page 64
8ENERGY.TXT 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 move forward.

But we don't -- if we have a disagreement, Senator, with the Legislative Branch, and the threatened consequence is, we're going to hold you in contempt, the only alternative we have is the Judicial Branch.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: looking to add something? MR. FERGUS: No comment.
Good, I was wrong.
I suspect counsel over here is
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
Mr. Drivon, your response, then we're going to
affidavit, Mr. Kirby avers that we all agree that in this setting, an affidavit is required.
As a matter of fact, the
Senate must agree, because after all, we attached affidavits.
I do not concur that an affidavit is required to be a part of such a subpoena.
And as far as the application of CCP Section 1985 is concerned, to which he has referenced, an affidavit under that statute is to be attached to a subpoena duces tecum in a pretrial setting.
This is not a pretrial setting.
He cites as his lead authority the Superior Court of Santa Barbara Versus Las Padres Aviation.
That particular
case deals with a situation in which there was a pretrial subpoena duces tecum.
And they found that that particular
affidavit was incomplete.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Okay.
If there's any further comments by the Committee, or if there are none, I'll go forward and made a recommendation.
Mr. Kirby, last comment.
MR. KIRBY: Mr. Chair, a couple of points, your Page 65
8ENERGY.TXT 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Honor, because I want to clear up a point, and I think -- I want to make sure it's true.
While we have raised the FERC objection, Senator Peace and I have discussed it, we have never said we are refusing to produce any documents based on the FERC objection.
Otherwise, why would we be producing 30,000 documents to a document repository? We have raised the objection.
We think it has to 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
be resolved in another forum.
We have never said, and I want that clear, that we have never said we're not going to give this Committee one single document because we think it belongs in FERC.
Nor, and I want to make this clear, I think it is clear in the lawsuit that was filed yesterday, we did not ask the Superior Court to stop anything this Committee is doing on the grounds of FERC.
There are very limited issues that are
raised in that lawsuit.
Finally, the suggestion was made, well, what is Enron hiding? Senator, Enron turns over every single record
and document that the FERC demand that it turns over.
But as this Chair knows, and I think the whole panel knows, there are FERC tariffs on confidentiality.
are consequences.
There
There are assurances that there, in fact, is
going to be confidentiality.
Finally just one point.
subpoena duces tecum.
Your Honor, this is a
It must be supported by an affidavit.
And if you look at the codes, West Codes or the Dearings Codes, they will give you cross reference to CCP 1985, which talks about the affidavit.
And like I'm saying, the unfairness of it is, I am hearing Mr. Drivon's arguments for the first time today, Page 66
8ENERGY.TXT 24 25 26 27 28 after my client's been held in contempt.
I've never had an The
opportunity to even listen to what his legal arguments are.
case he cited I honestly don't think is in our brief.
Maybe it
was in a memo that he -- it's not a case that I cited, and so, I can't respond to a case I've never seen.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 process part?
But that's the inherent unfairness of the position of finding someone in contempt, and then ruling on their objections.
And I submit, Senator, I have no questions about your integrity, but it does not pass the appearance of impartiality to have the Chair say, "I'm now going to decide the adequacy of my own affidavit."
CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR PEACE: an alleged finding of contempt.
Has there been any actual finding of contempt? CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let me clarify that.
And that's what we're doing.
Senator Peace.
Counsel has repeatedly referenced
There are several steps to the contempt process.
The first one is what we did a week-and-a-half ago.
For this process to be complete, we now have to, as Senator Bowen indicated before, make a report to the full Senate.
The full Senate then may act upon that report and
decide upon whether any action is necessary upon the report that's made.
We are at the report stage at this point in time.
SENATOR PEACE: finding of contempt.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Ultimately, the full Senate will So, there's been no actual
decide what's to be done in that regard.
SENATOR PEACE: Are we in the middle of the due
Page 67
8ENERGY.TXT 27 28 CHAIRMAN DUNN: And if you bear with me, I think
you'll see at least where the Chair sits on the issues raised by 7 Mr. Kirby.
SENATOR PEACE: I'm kind of a neophyte here.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
So, it sounds to me like counsel is, the court equivalent would be to run into the first day of trial and say, "Judge, you aren't giving me my due process rights," before the argument is even put before the judge.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: that analogy a little bit.
MR. KIRBY: A lot, your Honor.
I know that.
Let's not go there I suspect Mr. Kirby would change
CHAIRMAN DUNN: at this point.
Senator Morrow.
SENATOR MORROW:
I would also comment that at
least the Senators that I'm surrounded with aren't exactly pushovers or potted plants up here.
And if we disagree with any
of your recommendations, Senator Dunn, I think you're going to hear about it.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: I have no doubt.
There's no
Member of this Committee that could be considered a potted plant.
Mr. Kirby, let me do it this way.
What I'm going
to operate off of here is in fact the objections to the subpoena that Enron filed on the day of the hearing.
I did review your But
legal authorities that you also submitted to us as well.
I'm going to operate off of that particular document, if you have it before you.
I want to walk through very quickly each of the objections that you've raised, both the ones that have been done 7 Page 68
8ENERGY.TXT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Committee.
is complete.
Bear with me, Mr. Kirby, because there may be a middle ground that, while I know your client doesn't like the position it has found itself in, that if your representations I'm hearing correctly, may provide a solution to the concerns that you have raised, Mr. Kirby.
MR. KIRBY: I will.
First, I'm going to do this first So, bear with me, if you will.
on a preliminary basis, as well as the numbered objections, One through Seventeen.
What I'd like to do, I want to make some preliminary comments, and then walk through the seventeen so you know exactly where the Chair is, and what the Chair's recommendations are to the Committee with respect to those.
MR. KIRBY: clarification here.
Is it the Committee's position that Enron has not been voted in contempt by the Committee? Because that certainly Can I ask, I'd like a point of

CHAIRMAN DUNN:
comment a little light-heartedly, Mr. Kirby, because each of the generators -- not each, but a couple of the generators have engaged in trying to rename the Committee on their own.
And the pleading that you guys had submitted, 7
1 2 3
that Enron had submitted, renamed us into the, "In the Matter of the Senate Select Committee Investigation of the Wholesale Energy Market."
Page 69
8ENERGY.TXT 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 That's not the complete name, and I'd ask that when you guys prepare these documents and are going to submit them, use the complete name.
but did not here.
It's Investigation of Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market, and I think one generator had submitted something that said, "Alleged Price Manipulation."
MR. KIRBY: The Committee's name does suggest a I notice you did in the lawsuit
predetermined disposition, Senator.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Only if you read it that way,
Mr. Kirby.
Only if you read it that way.
Let me make some general comments first that are going to echo some of the sentiments you've heard expressed by some of the Committee Members as well as Mr. Drivon, which I also agree to, and with no particular order here.
First, let's understand what the purpose of this investigation is.
The purpose of the investigation is not to
determine the guilt or innocence of anybody, or any company, or corporation.
It's not to determine the liability or
nonliability for anything of any person, or company, or corporation.
We are investigating the behavior in the wholesale electricity market to determine whether there is any legislative action that is warranted by this body, the California State Legislature.
That's what this investigation is 7
1 2 3 4 5 6
all about.
Again, let me reiterate.
the guilt or innocence of anybody.
We're not looking for
We're looking and examining
market behavior to determine whether legislative action is necessary.
That's an important thing to bear in mind, Page 70
8ENERGY.TXT 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 because there is a fundamental difference between the court proceedings that Mr. Kirby has drawn the analogy to this morning and what we are doing here.
And the due process arguments that
Mr. Kirby has advanced, while certainly are dead-on accurate with respect to court proceedings where guilt or innocence, or liability or nonliability, are at issue, that's not what's going on with respect to this investigation.
So, the same due process concerns that are applicable to a court proceeding are not equally as applicable to an investigation by the Legislature to determine if legislative action is necessary.
Thus, we have to underscore, there's a fundamental difference between what we do as a legislative body investigating a particular issue and what the court system does.
I also want to reiterate, this is a process, as I just indicated in response to Senator Peace's question and comments earlier, a process that is not finalized until there is a determination by the full Senate on whether to act upon the recommendations made by this particular Committee.
So, that process can be terminated anywhere along the line should compliance be found by the Committee.
That's a 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
critical one, because it may address some of the concerns, whether I agree or disagree with them, Mr. Kirby, may address some of those concerns.
I also want to reiterate, there is a fundamental question as to whether, in an investigative proceeding, there is a right to assert the type of objections that you find in a court proceeding, civil or criminal.
We recognize the right,
for example, in the most obvious case of self incrimination.
But for many of the objections which are primarily evidentiary, Page 71
8ENERGY.TXT 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 there is a question as to whether in fact they are really -there is even any authority to assert them at this particular stage.
But we will address the objections nonetheless.
Also, the subpoena, the issue on June 28th was not a response to the subpoena.
The issue was compliance with.
Now, we're going to get into some nuances, I'm sure, and debate that to the Nth hour.
But bear that in mind, that with the subpoena, it's not like a response to a discovery request in a litigation arena, where a response that is all objections is deemed a response.
Here we're dealing with compliance.
And finally, in my general comments, and I'll get right to the objections themselves, Mr. Kirby, from the Chair's perspective, I understand the argument that you're trying to make that we are really -- we are being treated differently than the other market participants.
And I agree with the sentiments
you've heard from many of the Committee Members, that I don't agree with that argument.
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
The response and dealings that we've had with Enron, at least up until now, and you've made some comments today that may reflect what I perceive to be a change in the approach Enron is taking, but up to now, the approach to Enron has been fundamentally different than the other market participants.
The other market participants, as you correctly point out, or most of them, asserted objections.
That's true.
But along with their objections, they engaged in active discussions with us about confidentiality, setting up the document depository, providing documents, et cetera.
There's
been a fundamental difference, at least from the perception of Page 72
8ENERGY.TXT 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the Chair, as to how Enron has responded to the legislative subpoena versus the rest of the market participants.
Let me go to the objections themselves, Mr. Kirby, and I'll run through them relatively quickly so that we get to the point.
dissertations.
I'm going to start on Page One because there are some preliminary objections, and then you have specific numbered objections.
And for the audience's purposes, no, we are not going document request by document request, and cover all 104.
The way that Mr. Kirby's office handled the objections -- which I think was a very logical way, by the way, Mr. Kirby, made it for ease of handling; I thank you for that -is, they asserted approximately 17 objections, and then for each question, they said, "Objection 1, 3, 5," et cetera.
8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 We're just going to quickly go through the preliminary and then the 17 objections.
I'll make my comments, We're not here for long legal
open it up to you, Mr. Kirby, open it up to the Committee.
MR. KIRBY: Could I just respond to one of the
points so we sort of stay on track, your Honor.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: You may.
I want to address the issue about --
that Enron was not a part of the discussion in the protective order.
From a historical perspective, the first document It was not sent to
requests were sent to five generators.
Enron.
We were requested about three weeks later, and I wasn't
even involved in the process.
Then the discussions were -- and I know, Senator, because I was at one of the hearings -- you made the statement: The way the Committee intends to deal with this, they're going Page 73
8ENERGY.TXT 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 to deal with the generators and then Enron.
And I know
representatives have talked to you about that.
So, but I participated as soon as I got involved.
I participated in the discussions, had great input, I like to think, on the protective order.
We participated along the way,
and it was always -- we were, in fact, at one point, Mr. Drivon and I had the discussion that, you know, Enron is behind learning curve because we came into the process later.
But we have participated.
So, I don't want there
to be a misconception that, A, we didn't participate, and B, this Committee has always taken the position, at least with me and with anybody else, it's going to deal with the generators, then Enron is next.
We understood that.
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
So, in fairness, to say that, you know, we haven't participated, we -- I got all the draft protective orders.
I had my input.
As the Committee knows, and Mr. Drivon will confirm, Mr. Kleinman acted as the spokesman because it didn't make sense to have six different lawyers.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: We understand that.
We covered
this extensively at the last hearing.
MR. KIRBY: I want to make clear that I was So, I don't want to create
having full input with Mr. Kleinman.
the impression that, well, we sat on the sidelines and refused to participate.
We were actively involved.
But Mr. Kleinman
had been designated, because the generators were going first, to be the spokesman on the issues of confidentiality.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Okay, let's go forward.
The first preliminary objection, and for the audience sitting here, so you're not completely in the dark, I'll briefly describe what the objection is that we're talking Page 74
8ENERGY.TXT 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 about.
On Page One, Mr. Kirby, "Preliminarily, Enron objects that the investigation by the Committee violates the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate, regulate, and administer the wholesale electricity market in California 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 and elsewhere."
I understand your comments here, that you are not, if I hear you correctly, Mr. Kirby, you are not using that objection as a means of refusal to produce documents.
But so it's clear, I will give you at least the Chair's quick comments on that particular objection.
The Chair at least disagrees -- yes, Mr. Drivon.
MR. DRIVON: Mr. Chairman, I think it's important
at this point to have Mr. Kirby tell us whether or not Enron still makes that objection.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. DRIVON: Fair question.
In other words, does Enron still say
that they object, "that the investigation by the Committee violates the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate," comma, dot, dot, dot.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: Mr. Kirby.
Your Honor, it has been Enron's
position from Day One that the exclusive jurisdiction to investigate, regulate, and administer the wholesale electricity market is FERC.
But you are absolutely correct, Senator, that Page 75
8ENERGY.TXT 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 having said that, and having preserved that objection, we are not refusing to produce documents based solely on that objection.
I think that's clear.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR BOWEN: I hope that's been clear.
Senator Bowen.
In the event that the state
exercised the power of eminent domain and took the transmission lines and all the generating assets, would you disagree that we 8 would no longer, as state owners, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission? MR. KIRBY: things.
Senator, could you -- I would ask two I think that that's the
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
Could you give me that again?
question that I certainly didn't come here prepared to argue or even consider.
But I'm not sure I understand your question, and it's my fault, not yours.
SENATOR BOWEN: The question, well again, we are
here not just to understand what happened, but to make determinations about what the electricity generation and transmission system should look like in this state.
And there is, I think, little question that municipal and state owned utilities are not subject to the jurisdiction of FERC on the wholesale market.
FERC itself has
said, "We do not very power over the Bonneville Power Authority.
We do not have power over the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, over BC Hydro," over a variety of public utilities.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: with my apologies? Senator Bowen, can I interrupt
Because of our time, would you mind if we go
through the objections first, and then return to anything? SENATOR BOWEN: CHAIRMAN DUNN: No.
Thank you.
SENATOR BOWEN: The point just is that it may be Page 76
8ENERGY.TXT 25 26 27 28 that right now FERC has jurisdiction over the wholesale market, but exactly the same constituents of the power generating and transmission system could, if owned by the state rather than by private utilities, be non-FERC jurisdictional.
Then we would 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
have jurisdiction to look at all of these things.
We can't make that determination without information.
Again, the legislative subpoena has a different
purpose than a trial subpoena.
MR. DRIVON: And Senator, their objection is, as
I read it there, and he is saying, yes, they make the objection, they object on the grounds that this Committee does not have the power to make this investigation.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Mr. Drivon.
What I will do quickly from the Chair's perspective is, that as to that objection, whether we have a debate about it being asserted or not -- I'm not sure it is or isn't here -- but Mr. Kirby, so that you know what the position of the Committee, at least the Chair is as recommended to the Committee, is that that objection is overruled.
The Senate investigation does have the power to investigate.
It is very broad, and it includes the ability to Yes, I understand that,
look into the wholesale electricity market to determine if there is legislative corrective action that is necessary and within our jurisdiction to do so.
Next, I'm on Page Two, Mr. Kirby.
MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, to move it faster, I
would agree -- is that the Chair's ruling on objection Number 1? CHAIRMAN DUNN: You're right.
I was going to say
when I got to Objection 1, that relates to your Preliminary One in the same stance.
Page 77
8ENERGY.TXT 28 So, and the same goes for the next one because 8 your next one in your preliminary comments is: "Enron further objects that the Committee's subpoena seeks to exercise jurisdiction over voluminous documents located outside the State of California, and thus beyond the jurisdiction of the subpoena issued in California by the Committee."
That relates to your numbered Objection Number 3, if I'm correct.
MR. KIRBY: what it relates to.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: All right.
I agree, your Honor.
That's exactly
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
The Chair's recommendation on that particular objection is to overrule the objection.
Again, the legislative
subpoena is a different legal animal than a subpoena that is provided by the CCP for litigation purposes, and that, in fact, we believe, based upon legal authority available, that we have the power to reach to documents that exist outside of California but that are within the control of a person, corporation, et cetera, that has a legal presence in the State of California.
MR. KIRBY: Just briefly, could I get any legal
authority for the Committee's position? CHAIRMAN DUNN: The answer is, I'm giving you After we finish
what I'm giving you at this point, Mr. Kirby.
here, if we want to discuss further on it, we can.
Next, and again, that's numbered Objection Number 8 3, but I want to make sure we take care of the preliminary ones.
Page 78

8ENERGY.TXT 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 This next one was the objection that was raised or addressed by Senator Peace.
I'm on Line 10, Page Two:
"Enron further objects that the Committee's investigation, including the subpoena, is related to do California Attorney General's investigation, which is fatally and irreparably compromised by the blatant public bias and hostility which the Attorney General, as the State's highest legal officer, has displayed toward Enron and its officers."
That objection, from Chair's recommendation, is overruled.
This investigation is not related to the California They are entirely separate
Attorney General's investigation.
investigations.
We have no power to involve ourselves or
influence the Attorney General's investigation and vice-versa, and they are for different purposes.
Again, this investigation is to determine if any legislative action is necessary.
I suspect, although I don't know the thinking of the Attorney General, that that is for purposes of either civil or criminal liability, which is not at issue in this particular investigation.
Moving to Line 17, Page Two: 8
1 2 3 4
"Enron further ... objects to the instructions and definitions contained in the subpoena on the grounds they are vague, Page 79
8ENERGY.TXT 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ambiguous, burdensome, argumentative and beyond the scope and extent of both the subpoenaing party's legal and regulatory authority and subpoena power."
I think we've already addressed the scope question there, Mr. Kirby, with respect to on the grounds they are vague, ambiguous, burdensome, and argumentative.
I know you have raised questions, not integrity questions, but clearly the question of whether I am in a good position to be ruling on them when I drafted and put input into the draft of them.
But I review them again to look at them, to
determine, at least from my perspective, as an outsider looking in at this industry, they did not appear to be vague and ambiguous, burdensome, et cetera.
But I will -- my recommendation is to overrule the objection, but where your client, Enron, really doesn't understand a question, we're happy to engage in discussions with you to clarify those questions as well.
MR. KIRBY: Senator, I wasn't there, but it has
been reported that when the Committee considered the subpoenas and the breadth of materials requested -- the Rules Committee, I'm sorry, the Rules Committee -- that comments were made that 8 no one on the Committee could possibly live long enough to review the documents that had been requested, which I think is a reflection on the over-broad nature as well.
SENATOR PEACE: seriously.
[Laughter.]
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Yes, exactly.
Page 80 There you go, taking things too
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8ENERGY.TXT 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Let me make a point on that one, Mr. Kirby, because clearly, from the Rules Committee perspective, they forever have to watch over the resources available to the State Senate.
Nobody questions that at all.
We knew at the outset of this, and we discussed it in very early meetings with the representatives from the market participants, that the issue of documents would be voluminous.
And where we can minimize each other's burdens, we
are very willing to do that, still are willing to do that, and will continue to engage in those discussions so we that don't have you produce a bunch of documents that are going to sit idle in a warehouse.
And we will continue those discussions with all
the market participants.
Next, I'm on Line 23 of Page Two: "Enron hereby states it objects to each specific request made in the 112 separate categories sought by the subpoena, many of which are directed to generators and have no application to Enron."
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
I'm going to surprise you here, Mr. Kirby.
That
objection is partially granted because you are right, some of them do go to generators.
MR. KIRBY: Should I say Hallelujah? Just bear this in mind when you
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
make comments to your client, or to any media representatives, that your assumption they'd all be overruled is incorrect.
That also relates to one of the numbered ones, so we are actually clicking off some of the numbered ones as we're going through here as well.
Page 81
8ENERGY.TXT 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 So, where the question, of course, is a generator-directed question that was inadvertently included in the request to Enron, such as maintenance logs on gas-fired generation facilities in California, clearly that objection is well-founded.
Next, Line 27, Page Two, "Enron's right to be ..." they object because the requests: "... including those that are of a constitutional nature, as they implicate Enron's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and its due process rights ...."
Again, from the Chair's recommendation, I recommend that we overrule that objection.
I think the legal
authority is solid that, in fact, we do have the right generically to subpoena witnesses and documents, and it does not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.

This relates to basically the confidentiality We have engaged in negotiations, as everybody is aware, Where there are legitimate

grounds for confidentiality claims, Mr. Kirby, we have always been and continue to be willing to provide the protection that is available, that we can provide to you for legitimately Page 82
8ENERGY.TXT 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 confidential, privileged, proprietary matter.
We've done that with others.
We've done that
with the ISO, the PX, et cetera, and we will, of course, do that with respect to your concerns in that regard as well.
MR. KIRBY: Senator, I didn't look at the Mirant
agreement, but does it provide for a court protective order? CHAIRMAN DUNN: It does not provide for it.
It's
a written agreement between the Committee, subject of course to Leg.
Counsel's approval, and the market participants.
case it was Mirant.
I'll state each of these objections.
Some of In that
them do not need to be addressed because we've already done it in the preliminary matter.
Mr. Kirby, I'm on Page Three, starting with your Objection Number 1: 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
"The Subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it improperly seeks to invade the exclusive jurisdiction of FERC over the wholesale electricity market."
I've already addressed this one. recommendation is to overrule the objection.
Objection Number 2: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it improperly seeks information deemed confidential under any applicable FERC tariff, rule or procedure."
We've already addressed this one.
The Chair's Page 83 The Chair's
8ENERGY.TXT 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 recommendation is to overrule it as to nonconfidential, but we are and continue to be willing to enter into reasonable confidentiality agreements to protect those that have legal grounds for protection, such as FERC tariffs, or legitimate trade secrets, et cetera.
Number 2.
Objection Number 3: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it improperly seeks the production in California of documents located outside the state of 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 California."
We've already addressed this one. recommendation is to overrule the objection.
Objection Number 4: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it improperly seeks production of trade secrets pursuant Texas law, California Civil Code Section 3426.1, or any similar statutory or case law."
Again, this one is overruled to the extent that the claim of trade secrets, et cetera, is not founded on solid legal ground, but where there are legitimate trade secrets, et cetera, this Committee will provide confidentiality for those documents, as we have done with some of the other market participants already.
Objection Number 5: "The subpoena is void and/or Page 84 The Chair's So, that deals with Objection
8ENERGY.TXT 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 unenforceable in that it improperly seeks documents and information which constitutes or contains sensitive and proprietary financial information, the same claims of confidentiality which the Attorney General of California, on behalf of the Governor of California, has been repeatedly 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 asserting in San Diego Superior Court Action No.
GIC 764413."
The recommendation of the Chair on that is the same as the other confidential-related objections, in that where they are legitimately protected documents under the applicable legal authority, we will provide confidentiality protection.
Objection Number 6: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable because the Declaration of Senator Joseph L. Dunn in support of the subpoena is legally defective in that it is conclusory and argumentative, does not contain the requisite facts, is not based on the personal knowledge of the Declarant, and is impermissibly stated as, 'the Committee is informed and believes ....'" and there is a case cite in the objection at this point in time.
The Chair's recommendation is to overrule that Page 85
8ENERGY.TXT 23 24 25 26 27 28 objection.
Again, it's premised on the fundamental, from the
Chair's perspective, the fundamental confusion between a legislative subpoena and a court-issued subpoena that is found in litigation procedures.
From our review of the law, the Declaration actually is unnecessary, although provided, unnecessary for 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
legislative subpoenas.
Senator Bowen.
SENATOR BOWEN: Thank you, Mr. Dunn.
I think to further that just a little bit, it makes no sense for a legislative subpoena to require that the declarant have personal knowledge.
There are, after all, only
120 of us, and it's highly unlikely that, out of 120 Legislators, that somebody would always have personal knowledge as to any matter that might be a proper subject of investigation.
So, it's just ludicrous to use that condition in
a legislative proceeding.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY: Okay.
May I respond briefly? Hold on, Mr. Kirby.
We're going
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
to give you the chance to respond at the end here.
Okay, let me go to Number 7, Objection Number 7, again on Page Four: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it seeks documents and information already in the Committee's possession or equally available to the committee from other public sources in California."
As to that objection, it may be well founded.
Page 86
8ENERGY.TXT 26 27 28 And where you believe that we are in possession of such documents that you don't wish to just repeat the production, Mr. Kirby, we are happy to hear that from you.
We do not seek 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
for a repetitive production of the same documents that you believe are in our possession or are accessible to this Committee from public sources.
MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, I had this discussion
with Mr. Drivon about, for example, all of the documents, if documents were submitted to the Cal ISO, and I know that they have been subpoenaed by the Committee requiring Enron to try to reproduce documents that you've already subpoenaed from Cal ISO.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Yes, I'm in agreement with you,
if the documents really are the same.
However, as you know -- now I'm going to draw you back to your litigation world -- the document of Letter X that may be submitted to the ISO might differ slightly than that same letter in the files of Company Y.
MR. DRIVON: Or substantially.
Or substantially different.
CHAIRMAN DUNN:
So, we're going to be cautious about that, but if legitimately we're seeking the identical documents, your objection is well founded, and we don't want you to have to repeat it, and we don't want duplicative documents this the various depositories.
SENATOR BOWEN: Again, Senator Dunn, for the
purposes of those who are not lawyers, you're talking about things like a date stamp that may differ on a document or handwritten notes; is that the -CHAIRMAN DUNN: Senator Bowen.
That's absolutely correct,
Thank you for the clarification.
So, we could have a letter from Mr. Smith to Page 87
8ENERGY.TXT 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Mr. Jones dated November 1st, but the copy that may sit with ISO may be what's oftentimes called a clean copy, and copy of that same letter that sits in Acme Generator's files may actually have marginalia or other sort of very slight differences that might make a difference in the investigation itself.
going to be caution for that.
But again, if we're really talking about identical information, we're not seeking duplicative production of those.
Moving on, Objection Number 8: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable because the Declaration accompanying the subpoena fails to show by personal knowledge and with specificity the materiality or relevance of the documents sought by this request."
Refer to my recommendation in Objection Number 6 regarding the need for the Declaration as well as what's required when it relates to a legislative subpoena versus a subpoena under the CCP in a litigation context.
Objection Number 9: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that this request is impermissibly vague and indefinite."
Now, that's one that goes to each different 9 1 2 document request and really can't be resolved without looking at the specific document category that's been subpoenaed.
Page 88 So, on So, we're
8ENERGY.TXT 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 that particular one, we'll simply leave it as, Mr. Kirby, where in fact your client really doesn't understand because it's vague and indefinite, just let us know and we're happy to engage in the discussions and resolve those sort of what I'll consider to be relatively minor disputes through further discussions.
Objection Number 10: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that the specific request is argumentative, conclusory or incomprehensible in nature."
The recommended ruling by the Chair is the same as for Number 9, it applies to document requests specifically.
And where your client really has that concern, we'll engage in discussions to clarify the specific document request or category that's been subpoenaed.
Objection 11: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it purports to call for mass production of huge volumes of documents, such that it is unreasonably burdensome and oppressive in nature, and not reasonably specific in scope."
With respect to this one, the recommendation of 9 the Chair is to overrule the objection, but I want to share some comments with you, Mr. Kirby.
As I mentioned before, we knew at the outset that examining the market behavior in the California wholesale electricity market would be document-intensive, to say the Page 89
1 2 3 4 5
8ENERGY.TXT 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 least.
Perhaps more document-intensive than your legal career We knew that.
has ever seen before, and perhaps even mine.
So, what we have said throughout the meetings -not for Mr. Kirby's benefit, he knows this, but for everybody else's benefit -- is, we want to manage the production in a way that is practical for us on the Committee and here in the Senate, and practical for the market participants.
We are working on that issue on an ongoing basis.
It is for that reason, both minimize the burden on the market participants, and minimize the burden on this Committee, that we established a priority list of documents that we asked to be put into the depositories first, so that it could be manageable.
As we go forward, we'll continue to provide second and third priority lists of documents so that this can be done in a reasonably focused fashion and doesn't require the proverbial data dump of documents, although there may be some cynical market participants that would prefer to go that route.
We're trying to minimize the burdensomeness of our requests as we take each step.
We know this is document-intensive.
We will
continue to act in good faith and hope the market participants will continue to do so, as they've done up to now, with respect to managing the burden for both the Committee and the market 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
participants in the wholesale electricity market.
Objection Number 12: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable because the subpoena was not personally served on a custodian of records of Enron as required by, among other laws, California Code Page 90
8ENERGY.TXT 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the objection.
of Civil Procedure Section 1987."
The subpoena was served upon the agent for service as required under California law.
The custodian of
records, that official individual, we do not know the identity of that individual and is why we chose to serve the agent for service.
Again, this also relates to what I believe as the Chair to be a fundamental difference between legislative subpoenas and court-issued subpoenas.
And the Chair's
recommendation is to overrule that objection.
Objection 13: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable because the subpoena is not accompanied by a court order authorizing its issuance."
Again, the Chair's recommendation is to overrule This is not a judicial subpoena.
It's an
entirely different legal animal.
It's a legislative subpoena.
Don't worry.
10
We're almost there, everybody.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Objection 14: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it improperly seeks documents outside of the Committee's proper investigatory authority."
This is similar, albeit not identical, to documents outside of the State of California.
So, the real
issue in this objection is, what is the scope of our investigative authority, and I believe relates probably to the FERC objection asserted earlier here.
Page 91
8ENERGY.TXT 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 that objection.
Objection 15: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that the request seeks documents and information which are privileged under Texas law, federal law, California law and other relevant statutes and case law."
I believe actually this is pretty close to one of 10 the other ones that we had, so I will refer back to that particular objection.
But where, in fact, there are legitimately privileged documents, the Committee always has been, still is, and always will be willing to enter into confidentiality agreement, as we have done with other market participants, subject to Leg.
Counsel's approval.
that one in there.
Objection 16: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it consists of repetitive boilerplate requests which have no relevance to this responding Page 92 I want to make sure I get objection.
The Chair's recommendation is to overrule this Our investigatory authority is very, very broad, and
it must relate, of course, to a proper legislative purpose, which I've stated at the outset here is whether, in fact, we need to take any legislative action with respect to the market behavior of the wholesale electricity market here in California.
Again, the Chair's recommendation is to overrule
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
8ENERGY.TXT 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 objections.
party, e.g., seeking documents pertaining to electricity generation plants, costs of generation, maintenance or outages at such generation plants, when this responding entity owns no such electricity generation plants in California."
Mr. Kirby, this was one of your preliminary I surprised you by saying "sustained" where the
question actually is not applicable to the position of Enron in the California energy market.
Just let us know which one of those you believe it doesn't apply to, and certainly we're not trying to make your 10 client respond to something they have no ability to respond to.
And the last objection, Objection 17: "The subpoena is void and/or unenforceable in that it seeks documents and information protected by an individual's rights to privacy."
I will reassert the comments with respect to confidentiality generally here.
Where it's a legitimate right
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
to privacy, we are willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Enron as we have done with other market participants.
Before I turn it over to Mr. Kirby to respond to those recommended rulings by the Chair, any questions, comments, or concerns by the Committee? SENATOR BOWEN: Just one question, and it has to
do with that last provision regarding the right to privacy.

8ENERGY.TXT 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 to.
Bowen.
Again, if you look at -- and I don't expect you I'll just give it to you -- Document Request Number 51, it 10 What exactly are we contemplating that's other than a trade secret or commercially confidential information that might be covered by that? CHAIRMAN DUNN: Bowen, we'll turn to Mr. Kirby.
Can you provide us examples of what Enron may be referring to with respect to the rights of privacy? MR. KIRBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator I think to answer that, Senator
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
is for two identified individuals, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, and then department heads.
And it goes through their
telephone bills, their telephone message slips, all of their travel expenses, their e-mails, their calendars.
Those matters are relating to personal activities that I'm sure if someone served a subpoena on you, Senator, you would say that is.
And California has probably the leading
recognition of right to privacy of an individual.
I think, if you will note, and to confirm that these were not simply in a boilerplate, that is the only category that that right to privacy pertains to.
SENATOR BOWEN: But you're not asserting that the
calendar or appointments that are professional of a business executive is private information and not subject to subpoena power, are you? MR. KIRBY: know.
First of all, I'm sure you can recognize, I've never seen any of these calendars.
issue.
But we have a jurisdictional Senator, it may well be.
I don't
We have an issue as to whether or not that is in fact an Page 94
8ENERGY.TXT 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Enron document in the first place or a private document.
that's the objection here.
Certainly, my view is, looking at it on the face of it, is that someone's calendar is a private, individual matter.
SENATOR BOWEN: I suspect you wouldn't find the And
case law supporting that in litigation.
There is law on that matter with regard to the 10 Governor, provoked by the press's attempt to get Governor Wilson's calendar, which I think they were not allowed to do on the grounds that it was a matter of protecting the privilege of constituents, not the Legislature.
MR. KIRBY: Could I get the cite on that? Somebody versus Wilson.

SENATOR BOWEN: MR. KIRBY:
I want to be very clear -I would be very skeptical of
SENATOR BOWEN:
claims that, I mean, obviously what is desired is information about whether either of those two individuals met, for example, with ISO Board members who might have been setting policy, with other generators or market participants, with members or staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
I would resist any attempt to limit in particular that kind of information.
the same kinds of things.
It would be very useful for this Committee to know if we're looking at whether we have a market structure that overly relies on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it would be very useful to know whether there's regular off-the-record contact between FERC, key FERC staff investigating market manipulation, and generators and market participants, particularly after today's FERC action, which is Page 95 And the telephone logs clearly go to
8ENERGY.TXT 24 25 26 27 28 another Enron victory.
It's Ken Lay's dream world of having
condemnation power in four regional transmission organizations.
MR. KIRBY: I just wanted to answer her question.
Okay, go ahead, Mr. Kirby.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: MR. KIRBY:
No, no, that was the question, is it 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
an event.
And I don't have these -Can I just finish? I don't have the 112
categories memorized, so I wouldn't want it to be stated, but I know that that was the reason for raising the claim of right to privacy as an objection, because you have very specific, and in my opinion, horribly over broad requests that are directed to a number of individuals.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: And as I said, Mr. Kirby, in my
recommended rulings to the Committee as a whole, that where you can establish legitimate legal grounds for that, and I agree with Senator Bowen, that there is a misperception generally in the legal profession that the right of privacy over documents, the legal profession has a broader impression of what reality has, the legal basis for privacy objections.
But again, where you can establish that on a document-by-document basis, we are willing to enter into the confidentiality agreement.
Senator Peace, and then, Mr. Kirby, get ready for your final comments, Mr. Drivon, and then I think we may be ready to move forward.
SENATOR PEACE: Two points.
Just as an aside with respect to the privacy issue, I don't think any of us are interested in Mr. Lay or anybody else's personal -- and to the extent that that kind of situation can be accommodated, we should go the extra mile to Page 96
8ENERGY.TXT 27 28 make sure that we're not extracting information that's associated with his personal life.
10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR PEACE: Agree.
Second, I want to make sure that
we get characterized on the record here how serious Enron's decision to go to court is.
And I really object to -- and
Counsel's made very clear -- that you've mischaracterized his communication with you in an effort try make it look as though our counsel recommended that you take this action.
This is an action taken by Enron.
And I want to
put firmly on the record how serious an action this is from a constitutional perspective.
You have attempted to characterize the relationship between you, Enron, and the others we have served subpoenas, and the Chair or this Committee, as though we are combatants.
These are Legislators.
They probably have a
variety of viewpoints with respect to ultimately adjudicating in a legislative context what's the appropriate thing to do based upon the receipt of this information.
For example, it could very well be that, after looking at this information, Ms. Bowen is the Chair of the Energy Committee, and having gotten the benefit of Mr. Dunn's work here, may come to the conclusion that California should follow Texas's lead in getting control of the entire transmission grid in order to isolate itself from FERC.
And that's the point that Ms. Bowen alludes to in the necessity of understanding more about what kind of access the various companies have to FERC and its staff.
That's a particularly important question for 10 Page 97
8ENERGY.TXT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 positions are.
And I just want to make sure that you are communicating back to your client the seriousness of the escalation, because you just went to war with the State of California.

You just declared war on this state's political lawyers.
I think you know perfectly well how absurd these Enron, because Enron literally is the largest employer of former FERC employees in the world.
important here.
Now, for you to suggest that you need to go to some, quote-unquote, "neutral third party" to rule on these kinds of objections would be, in my view, the judicial equivalent of telling a judge that the judge has to go out of the courtroom to find some uninvolved party.
We are fact finders, as you actually, I think, have subconsciously proven today by consistently referring to the Chair as "his Honor".
MR. KIRBY: You didn't refer to him as -To a trial lawyer -No, but listen to what you did.
He's referring to a trial lawyer So, those questions are very

I said, I don't want to come to this hearing tomorrow
and have the first question out of Senator Dunn's mouth be, "Mr. Kirby, has your client taken any steps to legally challenge the subpoena that was -- that is the subject of this proceeding?" And if I say no, he'd say, "Fine, you've waived your right to challenge that subpoena."
Mr. Drivon and I were on the same page.

SENATOR PEACE: miscommunication.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR PEACE: Hold on.
Counsel has said both publicly Do not characterize that as a
and privately, it's not a miscommunication.
You are trying to hide behind -- which is a very important clarification -- that Counsel didn't want you to come in here and use the prior communication as an alleged essentially legal advice, saying, "Well, we were told we didn't have to go to court, and therefore you kept us from preserving 11 some right."
You made an independent legal judgment, or your client made an independent legal judgment.
I would argue it's
1 2 3 4 5 6
more of a political judgment than a legal judgment.
But you decided to go in court.
That's fine.
But don't sit here and simultaneously play the victim by Page 99
8ENERGY.TXT 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 claiming you're being treated differently than everybody else.
It takes quite -- you have to go a long way to manage to get far enough over on the evil scale to get beyond Reliant and Dynegy, but you've succeeded.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Mr. Kirby, let's go back to any
comments you wish to make on the Chair's recommended rulings.
We've been given a grace until 1:45, so let's all of us do it quickly.
MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, this will not be in any
particular -- I want to address the comments -- the ruling and the comments by Senator Bowen about the requirement for a declaration.
There's no requirement that I'm aware of, and I don't believe we ever made the argument, that the declaration has to be from a Legislator.
Ms. Montgomery, Mr. Drivon, every
day lawyers have subpoenas duces tecum issued by declaration.
But our position is, when you ask for a subpoena duces tecum, you must have a declaration, and it has to comply with the law.
And the Court, Chair, has ruled otherwise, but that's our position, and I stand on it, your Honor.
But I want to make the point that we're not 11
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
saying that the declaration can only be from a Senator.
What
we're saying is, once the declaration -- and I dare say that -CHAIRMAN DUNN: Let me correct you.
Nobody's suggesting that you were making the argument it had to be from a Senator or didn't have to be from a Senator.
And again, Mr. Kirby, I just want to remind you, and now I'm going to pretend to be the "your Honor", anything new that you want to add? We don't want to plow through the old Page 100

Anything new you want to add here? MR. KIRBY: Could the Chair explain to me what
the procedure is now in terms of voting on what I have -CHAIRMAN DUNN: Yes.
I know what your question
I don't mean to cut you off, Mr. Kirby.
Yes.
Unless there's some new legal argument you
wanted to advance to any of the objections, I'm prepared to make a recommendation via a motion to this Committee that will embrace what the next steps are.
I said to you about a half an hour ago, bear with me, because that recommendation, while clearly isn't going to be satisfactory to Enron, may provide the relief to the due process argument that you have advanced both in your papers and today.
So, unless you have other comments, I'm happy to make that recommendation at this point.
MR. KIRBY: to the objections.
Does the Chair make recommendations on the objections, and the entire panel or a quorum has to vote? 11 My question though is, I want to go

CHAIRMAN DUNN: right.
Give us the opportunity to talk, we will do it.
Mr. Drivon, as we're waiting for some of the
other Members to arrive for the motion, any additional comments you wish to make? And again, same cautionary comment I gave to
Mr. Kirby, don't plow over old ground.
Page 102
8ENERGY.TXT 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 MR. DRIVON: No, Senator, but what I would like
to do is bring us back to where we are, because I don't think that the work of this Committee today is finished when we have this motion voted upon.
Because this only deals with Step One
of the situation today, ruling on the objections.
We still have not determined what's going to happen after the objections are ruled on, whether or not there is in attendance today a custodian of records, those kinds of questions.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: I understand, and I appreciate
your comments, but those issues, I think, will also be embraced within the motion that I've been jotting out, listening to everybody here.

SENATOR BOWEN: question to refresh my memory.
Let me just ask one further
I believe that when Senator Morrow made the motion at the last hearing of this Committee, that it included what was, in essence, an automatically triggered mechanism for expungement -CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR BOWEN: come into compliance.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: That's true, Senator Bowen, and True.
-- should either Enron or Mirant
you'll hear it in my motion here as well, too, which is the middle ground I keep alluding to in rather vague terms to Mr. Kirby.
SENATOR BOWEN: In other words, the goal was not
to create a contempt finding, but rather to secure the information that the Committee needs in order to do its work Page 103
8ENERGY.TXT 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 product.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: Yes.
Just for those that are here for the Select Committee to Investigate, as soon as we finish, please exit out into the hall for anybody you want to talk to, et cetera, so that we get Senator Speier's committee.

We need to do this quickly.
We've had a grace
period that we are pushing to beyond its limit.
The Chair's going to make the following motion.
If everyone would stay closely in tune to it, there are many parts to it.
It's going to be one motion, but relate to both of
the companies that are before us today, Mirant and Enron.
Let me begin with Mirant. as follows: The Chair's motion is
As to Mirant, that we terminate and purge the
process of contempt and rescind the motion that was made as to Mirant last hearing, June 28th; that we establish a hearing date in approximately 30 days to review continued compliance with the subpoena by Mirant.
Those two points as to that company.
As to Enron, the motion is to adopt the Chair's recommendations as to the rulings on the objections; that we continue the process of contempt by forwarding a report to the full Senate.
However, that report must be written.
It will be
prepared but not available for referral to the full Senate until, at the very earliest, early next week, but that it be prepared and circulated for signature; but that if at any time prior to that report being referred to the full Senate Enron comes into compliance by agreeing to do what the other market Page 104
8ENERGY.TXT 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 participants have done thus far, which is establish a document depository, which may have already been done, provide the priority documents, and sign the confidentiality agreement, that the report will not be referred to the full Senate for further action in this contempt process; and if such progress is made, that the same ruling as to Mirant today would then apply to Enron.
11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Any clarification necessary on the motion? Senator Escutia.
SENATOR ESCUTIA: I'd like a point of
clarification with regard to compliance.
CHAIRMAN DUNN: SENATOR ESCUTIA: Yes.
Assuming all applicable
privileges apply, are you asking for full compliance, partial compliance, substantial compliance? CHAIRMAN DUNN: The answer is, we have provided
to each of the market participants, Senator Escutia, a list of, I believe -- Mr. Drivon, correct me if I'm wrong -- 10 categories of documents -- 16.
My apologies.
Sixteen
categories of documents which we called the priority requests, and that we will terminate the contempt process if they agree to comply immediately with those 16 categories, production of those 16 categories.
Senator Peace.
SENATOR PEACE: Does agreement to comply also
imply the dropping of the court challenge? CHAIRMAN DUNN: to that whatsoever.
My position as to that, at least the Chair's position, is the same as it was yesterday, Mr. Kirby: whatever you feel you need to do, and we will respond Page 105 Do No.
We didn't make any reference
