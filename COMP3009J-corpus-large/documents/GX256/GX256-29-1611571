INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO STRATEGY
Coastal habitats - those habitats making up the shoreline strip of shallow water and the lands immediately adjacent to it - are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world and perform vital ecological processes.
These coastal habitats can include areas of shallow marine water, rocky shoreline, estuaries, marshes, sand- and mudflats, eelgrass beds, kelp beds, and intertidal algae.
In the Georgia Basin, coastal habitats support populations of fish, birds, and other wildlife that are often nationally or internationally significant.
Millions of resident and migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, and other birds make use of critical migration and wintering habitat in the Georgia Basin as part of the Pacific Flyway.
The area also supports a high percentage of vulnerable, threatened, and endangered wildlife and plant species, as well as highly-valued fish and shellfish.
Coastal areas also tend to be centres of human population settlement and resource development.
The Georgia Basin is no exception.
Urban expansion, dyking, and other resource-based activities have contributed to extremely high losses of estuarine and other wetland habitats in this region beginning in the 1900's, and high population growth rates continue to threaten remaining coastal habitats.
As more coastal communities seek to expand and diversify their economies, partly as a result of downturns in traditional resource-based activities, there are even more pressing needs to ensure that new growth and development is more environmentally sustainable and directed to less sensitive areas.
If there is to be a healthy, productive, and biologically diverse Georgia Basin environment for generations to come, it is essential to prevent the further loss and degradation of coastal habitats.
This means protecting remaining coastal habitats as well as the interconnected marine, riverine, and terrestrial ecosystem processes that sustain them.
1.1 Puget Sound-Georgia Basin International Task Force
The Premier of British Columbia and the Governor of W ashington signed an Environmental Cooperation Agreement in 1992 committing the province and state to work together on transboundary environmental problems.
The BC/W ashington Environmental Cooperation Council was formed and water quality was soon identified as a high-priority issue requiring immediate, joint attention.
Several task forces, including the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin International Task Force, were established to coordinate cross-border efforts related to the shared waters of the Georgia Basin and Puget Sound.
The Environmental Cooperation Council convened a Marine Science Panel in 1994 which identified the following priority issues for the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin waters: 1.

DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
Loss of estuarine wetlands and other nearshore habitat was identified as the most important threat to the health of these shared marine waters, in part because such losses were considered to cause significant and often irreversible harm.
Separate W ashington and BC work groups were set up to address loss of nearshore habitats.
This strategy was prepared by the BC Nearshore Habitat Loss W ork Group (for a list of W ork Group members, see Appendix A).
The actions and recommendations it contains are intended to support and complement the recommendations of the W ashington W ork Group as outlined in their 1998 document entitled "Nearshore Habitat Loss in Puget Sound: Recommendations for Improved Management".
The member agencies and organizations of the BC Work Group remain committed to working cooperatively with Washington to address matters of mutual interest and concern, including: research; habitat classification and inventory; habitat restoration; and sharing of educational and planning tools and resources.
This strategy should also be considered in conjunction with the recommendations and activities of other work groups under the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin Task Force, particularly those of the Exotic Species W ork Group and the Protect Marine Life W ork Group, that address other issues posing threats to coastal habitats (e.g. introduced species in intertidal areas, control of ballast water discharge, etc.)
1.2 Purpose
This strategy is intended to address the recommendations regarding loss of estuarine wetlands and other nearshore habitats that were made by the Marine Science Panel under the BC/W ashington Environmental Cooperation Council, and specifically: Â· Â· Â· 1.3 to provide information on the status of coastal habitat protection in the Georgia Basin to identify specific commitments to action by W ork Group member agencies and organizations that help to address gaps or weaknesses in the current management regime to make additional recommendations for improving coastal habitat protection and management in the Georgia Basin and in British Columbia as a whole.
Coastal Habitat Defined 1
For the purpose of this strategy, the general area of interest is the "coastal zone" encompasses the subtidal (nearshore) area below zero chart datum (zero tide) to iso-bath depth, the intertidal (foreshore), and the supratidal (backshore) to the lim influence (see Figure 1).
The limit of marine influence varies in different locations strictly defined for the purposes of the study.

Between the shores of British Columbia and W ashington are shared waters that include the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound (Figure 2).
The Georgia Basin contains the Canadian portion of those shared waters, plus portions of the adjoining slopes of Vancouver Island and the mainland coast of British Columbia.
The Georgia Basin is approximately 260 km long and 20 km wide and is located at the southernmost reach of British Columbia's 29,500 km of coastline.

DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
The Georgia Basin is estuarine; it is enriched by freshwater, nutrients, and sediments from more than 400 rivers and streams that flow from Vancouver Island, other smaller islands, and the Coast and Cascade Mountains.
These rivers and streams form sub-estuary habitats where they meet with marine waters.
Throughout the basin, intertidal and subtidal habitats commonly contain eelgrass beds, intertidal algae, kelp beds, and estuarine marshes.
Rich estuarine and wetland habitats make up approximately 6% of overall shoreline length and 23% of shoreline area in the Strait of Georgia.2 These habitats are critical to an enormous diversity of marine invertebrates, birds, marine mammals, and terrestrial species during all or portions of their life cycles.
Anadromous fish in the Georgia Basin include all Pacific salmon species, eulachon, and several sea-run trout species.
The Fraser River alone produces more salmon than any other river system in the world and 50% of the British Columbia salmon production.
Herring, other marine fish, and species such as seals and sea lions, also depend on coastal habitats for key life cycle stages.
Subtidal areas are frequently preferred feeding sites of the vulnerable gray whale and harbour porpoise, as well as diving ducks.
Highly valued shellfish beds and a number of nonvascular plants are also unique to such habitats.
Georgia Basin coastal areas are part of the critical stopover and wintering areas for almost all the bird species recorded in BC that move within or through the Pacific Flyway.
More raptorial birds, shorebirds, waterfowl and other water birds winter here than anywhere else in Canada, and the international significance of the area is widely recognized.
3 4 Of the 355 red-listed , and 432 blue-listed species of vertebrate animals and vascular plants recorded province-wide by the BC Conservation Data Centre (CDC), 119 (or 34%) of the redlisted and 112 (or 26%) of the blue-listed species occur within the Georgia Basin.
Of these, some 29 red-listed and 37 blue-listed species are known to occur specifically within coastal habitats.
Several of these are considered globally vulnerable or imperiled.

Threats to Georgia Basin Coastal Habitats
Less than 4% of the coastal wetlands and estuaries in the Georgia Basin are currently protected under federal and provincial legislation.
Approximately 23% of the nearshore has already been urbanized and less than 4% of the upland portions of the Strait of Georgia are still in their natural state.
Young forest (
More than 3 million of the 4 million people currently in British Columbia live along the coast and over 2.7 million (68%) live in the Georgia Basin.
The population of the Georgia Basin has grown by 125% over the past 25 years.
By 2021, it is projected to increase by a further 37%, with growth continuing to centre primarily around the coastal cities of Vancouver, Victoria, and the rapidly growing communities along the east coast of Vancouver Island (see Figure 3).
Dyking, primarily for farming, altered much of the estuarine habitat and other wetlands in the Georgia Basin beginning in the early 1900's.
Since then, urban development and expansion, forestry, and other resource activities within or adjacent to coastal habitats have contributed to further degradation of these areas.
The cumulative effects of urban growth have been substantial.
About 30% of the natural areas developed in the Lower Mainland between 1967

and 1982 were originally wetlands (Pilon and Kerr, 1984).
In the Fraser Lowland and parts of Vancouver Island, it is estimated that 50% to 70% of the original wetland habitat has disappeared and most other major river estuaries and coastal streams in the Georgia Basin have been similarly reduced or Figure 3: Georgia Basin Population Growth (source: Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative)
altered.
In some areas, such as the Fraser River waterfront of Vancouver, coastal habitat losses are near 100 percent.
W ater quality in these coastal habitats has been negatively impacted by such changes as shifts in water flow regimes (e.g. dams, diversions, accelerated runoff from urban areas), pollution (e.g. pesticides, excess nutrients, sewage, waste, oil and other chemicals), increased sedimentation from forestry and other activities, and dredging.
A summary of some of the major causes and effects of coastal habitat loss in the Georgia Basin is provided in Appendix B. Coastal habitat loss and alteration have contributed to the elimination of some wildlife and fish species from all, or portions, of the Georgia Basin.
There have been significant reductions in the numbers of many others (e.g. all species of Pacific salmon and other anadromous fish, eulachon, Marbled Murrulet, Great Blue Heron, Brant, and Peregrine Falcon).
Some plant species have also been lost from waterfront areas as a result of urban development.
In areas of the Victoria waterfront, for example, a number of rare plant species once recorded there no longer occur, including the W estern pearlwort, beach sand-spurry, Macoun's meadowfoam and Howell's montia.7 Human-induced changes have also allowed both exotic and native species to invade or expand their ranges with negative or unknown impacts on resident native species

(e.g. Purple Loosestrife, Atlantic Salmon, Scotch Broom, Japanese Oyster Drill, Green Crab, and Opossum).
2.0 Focus and Limitations of Strategy
Human activities that have the most direct and evident impacts on coastal habitats in the Georgia Basin are the main focus of this strategy.
There is an emphasis on impacts originating within or immediately adjacent to those coastal habitats, although it is recognized that the interconnectivity of ecological systems means that activities affecting coastal habitats may sometimes be located a considerable distance away.
The strategy does not address weather events, geological processes, or large-scale, natural changes that may be accelerated by human activities, such as global warming.
These types of changes, however, should be monitored and accounted for, wherever possible, in overall land and resource use strategies.
The strategy summarizes significant ongoing and planned actions of the W ork Group member agencies and organizations as well as their shared priorities for preventing further coastal habitat loss and degradation.
It reflects the input and affiliations of the W ork Group members and is not an exhaustive review of the activities and initiatives affecting coastal habitats in the Georgia Basin.
Because of the vital roles played by other federal and provincial agencies, local governments, First Nations, non-governmental organizations, and the general public in bringing about improved protection of coastal habitats, partnership approaches are supported and encouraged wherever possible.
3.0 Vision, Goal, and Principles
The vision: A Georgia Basin with naturally diverse and healthy coastal habitats, as well as interconnected marine, riverine, and terrestrial habitats, to support biologically diverse and self-sustaining fish and wildlife populations, for both their inherent values and their overall contribution to quality of life in the Basin.
The goal: Prevent further loss and degradation of coastal habitats and, where practicable, restore degraded coastal habitats in the Georgia Basin The following principles guide the specific strategies required to address this goal and move toward achieving the overall vision: Ecosystem-based, adaptive management Integrated planning that is based on ecological boundaries and adaptive management, which includes monitoring and feedback, should be used wherever possible.
Protection of existing habitats with strategic guidance for enhancement and restoration Initiatives that help protect existing high quality coastal habitats and/or provide strategic guidance for restoration and enhancement should be encouraged.
Partnerships, local participation, and stewardship
6
DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
Partnerships and collaboration among all levels of government, First Nations, nongovernmental organizations, other stakeholders, and the general public should be supported as key mechanisms for protecting coastal habitats.
Precautionary Principle Because of the complexity of ecological systems, where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to coastal habitats, scientific uncertainty should not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation, and precautionary actions should be encouraged.
4.0 Strategies to Prevent Coastal Habitat Loss in the Georgia Basin
Using existing expertise, technology, and resources more effectively and adaptively is fundamental to improving coastal habitat protection and management.
Continued pressures on important and vulnerable habitats and growing public support for habitat protection have increased both the opportunities and the necessity for partnership ventures and joint stewardship projects.
These partnerships may involve various levels of government, First Nations, non-governmental organizations, private landowners, land users, and the general public.
Such broad participation can be crucial to coastal habitat protection and management efforts.
Existing partnership ventures and integrated planning initiatives are key implementation mechanisms for many of the strategies identified in this report.
For example, the Pacific Estuary Conservation Program (PECP)8;/Pacific Coast Joint Venture (PCJV)9 and other initiatives now being integrated under the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI)10; as well as the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative (GBEI)11, the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy (PMHL)12, the joint federal/provincial Marine Protected Areas Strategy (MPAs)13, and the Stewardship Technical Committee (STC)14, figure prominently in the commitments to action and general recommendations outlined in the following sections.
A variety of other partnership ventures and multi-agency planning efforts also continue to be instrumental in improving cooperative planning and management of specific coastal areas, including such initiatives as the Fraser River Estuary Management Program (FREMP), the Fraser Basin Council (FBC), the Burrard Inlet Environmental Action Plan (BIEAP), the Squamish Estuary Management Plan (SEMP), and the Baynes Sound Roundtable.
Information on some of these and other initiatives can be found in the list of websites in Appendix C or the table in Appendix D.
For the purposes of this report, strategies to prevent coastal habitat loss and degradation in the Georgia Basin were grouped into four general categories reflecting the needs to: 1) identify all important and sensitive coastal habitats; 2) secure high priority habitats (e.g. the most vulnerable/threatened of the important and sensitive habitats identified); 3) improve management of coastal habitats, including restoration of degraded habitats; and 4) improve stewardship of coastal habitats.
7
DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
Under each category, there is a brief summary of the current status, and then a number of strategic objectives and associated actions are identified to help address gaps or weaknesses in the current management regime.
These actions reflect specific commitments on the part of the W ork Group member agencies and organizations, either alone or through participation in existing partnership initiatives.
Recommendations are also made to address some of the remaining gaps.
May of these would require the involvement of other levels of government, including First Nations, non-governmental organizations, and the general public.
4.1 Identifying Important and Sensitive Coastal Habitats
Ready access to accurate and up-to-date information is essential to guide habitat securement, management, and stewardship efforts.
This information is obtained from inventories of coastal habitats, ecological evaluations (monitoring, modelling, impact analyses, etc.), and other research and information gathering efforts.
Various coastal habitat inventory, assessment, and monitoring initiatives are underway for BC.
The BC Land Use Coordination Office (LUCO) has undertaken a coast-wide biophysical inventory that has resulted in a range of inventory information, from coarse video-imaging to detailed site evaluation, for over 25,000 kilometres (or 85%) of BC's coast.
This inventory system is the basis for provincial physical and biological shorezone mapping and has been adopted as a Resource Inventory Committee (RIC)15 Standard for BC (See Table 1 ).
The method has also been adopted and used for inventory of shorelines in W ashington State.
LUCO has also developed a coastal atlas for the Southern Strait of Georgia that identifies biophysical resources and human uses as well as shoreline sensitivity and countermeasures for oil spill cleanups.

The BC Conservation Data Centre (CDC)17, within the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks (MELP), maintains records of the occurrence and ecological status of vertebrates, invertebrates, vascular plants, and plant associations in BC.
This information is used for Sensitive Ecosystem Inventory (SEI)18, Sensitive Habitat Inventory and Mapping (SHIM), and 8
DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
other initiatives for identifying and assessing habitats.
CDC Information on marine species is currently limited, however, particularly for invertebrates (e.g. crustaceans, shellfish) and marine plants (e.g. sea weeds).
To date, there have been few systematic surveys of BC's coastal/marine flora and fauna.
British Columbia has made considerable progress in developing comprehensive and standardized systems to inventory the coastal zone and to rank rare, sensitive, and/or vulnerable species and habitats.
The key challenges are to address remaining information gaps and to integrate the information into meaningful coastal habitat management practices.
The Georgia Basin Ecosystem Conservation Partnership19 under the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative is one of the initiatives helping to address such gaps.
The partnership is currently compiling and consolidating information from the CDC and other member agencies and organizations on important habitats within the Georgia Basin, including coastal areas.
This information will facilitate comparisons between habitat sites and assist in setting priorities for conservation and management.

Efforts to various m Â· Â· Â·
A number of ongoing initiatives remain vital to the long-term protection of coastal habitats in the Georgia Basin.
For example, the PECP/PCJV partners have been acquiring or otherwise securing key coastal wetlands and associated upland habitats in BC since the 1980's.
21 The Habitat Conservation Trust Fund, the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Partnership, the Vancouver Island W etland Management Program (VIW MP) and other individual conservation organizations and conservation partnerships also continue to be instrumental in securing coastal habitats.
Federal and provincial Crown land may be protected in parks, ecological reserves, or other designations that significantly restrict land or water use activities.
There are over 100 BC Parks and Ecological Reserves in BC that have marine and/or coastal components.
The Federal Provincial Marine Protected Areas Strategy aims to coordinate all existing federal and provincial marine protected areas programs under a single umbrella to achieve a national system of marine protected areas on the Pacific coast by 2010.
This initiative should afford new opportunities to protect coastal habitats using the provincial and federal Parks Acts, Ecological Reserves Act, Oceans Act and the proposed federal Marine Conservation Areas Act.
Other legislative measures that offer differing degrees of control over land use include: federal National W ildlife Areas and Migratory Bird Sanctuaries; provincial W ildlife Management Areas, Forest Practices Code measures, Land Act reserves; and conservation covenants that protect lands through legal agreements between a private landowner and a land conservation 22 organization or public body.
There are additional designations that do not offer specific legal protection but can provide national or international recognition of important habitat values.
Such recognition can help to increase public awareness and lever additional resources and management attention (e.g. Ramsar designation for wetlands of international importance, W estern Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (W HSRN) sites, Important Bird Areas (IBAs), Sensitive Ecosystem designation, etc.)

4.3 Improving Management of Coastal Habitats
In 1998, the Province of British Columbia released its Coastal Zone Position Paper, which presents the Province's longer-term vision, interests, and objectives for management of the coastal zone and its resources.
This paper is the basis for the Province of British Columbia's discussions with the Government of Canada to develop a National Oceans Strategy and provides some context for actions identified in this strategy.
To better understand the wide array of legislation, policies, and initiatives at the federal, provincial, and local levels currently affecting management of coastal habitat, the BC Nearshore Habitat W ork Group funded a background study, "Preserving British Columbia's Coast: A Regulatory Review" (Nowlan, 1999).25 The report was prepared by W est Coast Environmental Law and some of its key information and recommendations for legislative, regulatory, and policy improvements are referenced in this strategy.
A more recent "Canada-British Columbia Fish Habitat Management Agreement", signed in July, 2000 by federal and provincial fisheries agencies, aims to conserve and protect fish and to increase certainty, consistency, and efficiency in efforts to protect fish habitat.
The Guide to Stewardship Bylaws, the Greenways Guide, and a conservation manual prepared for Sensitive Ecosystems Inventory26 are good references for the range of planning actions that local governments may take to improve protection of coastal areas (refer also to Section 4.4 of this document for information on stewardship initiatives).
One of the strongest forms of planning
14
DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION
protection for local governments is to designate a sensitive coastal area as a "development permit area", in which no development can take place until a permit has been issued.
These designations may specify that an area must remain free from all development or can ensure that development follows established guidelines.

4.4 Improving Awareness and Stewardship of Coastal Habitats
Increased understanding can contribute to increased respect for the critical ecological roles of coastal habitats, the substantial social and economic benefits they provide, and their vital importance to fish and wildlife.
The challenge for governments and other stewardship agencies is to find a way to make information accessible to all levels of society about the need for conservation of coastal habitats and about the tools available for achieving stewardship goals.
Different documentation must be targeted to different user groups such as land use planners, decision-makers, developers, property owners, volunteer stewards, and the general public.
Federal and provincial government agencies and private organizations are currently coordinating the publication and distribution of stewardship documents under a "Stewardship Series" banner through a cooperative Stewardship Technical Committee29.
A wide variety of stewardship documents have been produced in the form of guidelines, brochures, handbooks, and other reports that provide information about habitat values, applicable environmental laws, and actions that can be taken to help protect habitats.
A majority of these documents focus on freshwater and terrestrial areas, though many also contain information relevant to coastal habitats.
Of the guidelines and other stewardship documents currently listed by the Stewardship Centre, about 35 of the total 47 contain some information relevant to coastal habitats.
Initiatives that involve partnerships between community groups, local governments, and federal and provincial government agencies are often the most successful in encouraging participation

and improving the results of stewardship efforts.
There are a number of programs underway that support stewardship of coastal habitats such as the Urban Salmon Habitat Program30, Fisheries Renewal BC31, the Habitat Conservation and Stewardship Program32, the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund33, Forest Renewal BC (Resource Inventory and W atershed Restoration Programs)34, the Habitat Restoration and Salmon Enhancement Program35, and the Greenfields program.
Although challenges remain, the Stewardship Technical Committee, as well as the Stewardship Centre, the Fisheries Project Registry, and other centralized data sources, are beginning to improve overall coordination among various stewardship initiatives.

The Pacific Estuary Conservation Program (PECP) is a partnership of government and non-governmental organizations that has been securing coastal wetlands in BC since the 1980's.
Member agencies and organizations currently include, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada, the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund, Ducks Unlimited Canada, and The Nature Trust of BC.
The PECP is now acting as the securement arm of the Pacific Coast Joint Venture (PCJV).
For more information see: http://www.ec.gc.ca/press/pecp_b_e.htm and http://ramsar.org/key_awards99_interview_pecp.htm 9 The PCJV was initiated in 1989, under the umbrella of the North American W aterfowl Management Plan (NAW MP), as an international partnership of Canadian and American government agencies and non-governmental bodies working to secure, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands from BC to northern California.
The North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) has recently been created to foster greater coordination and cooperation among Canadian, American and Mexican bird initiatives.
In Canada, four main conservation initiatives will be coordinated and integrated through NABCI--the NAW MP for ducks, geese and swans, the Partners in Flight (PIF) initiative for songbirds and other landbirds, the Canadian Shorebird Conservation Plan (CSCP) for sandpipers and plovers, and W ings Over W ater (W OW ) for seabirds, colonial waterbirds, and related species.
This integration will enhance biologically-based and landscape-oriented approaches to conservation of bird populations.

Establishes the Islands Trust Fund to acquire and hold land or interests in land for the protection of special areas and features within
Regulated forestry practices can mitigate impacts on coastal habitats in many different ways.
Coastal habitats are not specifically addressed in the code, but the Code can be used to establish Riparian Management Areas (RMA) around fish bearing water bodies or in community watersheds.
Marine Sensitive Zones (MSZ) must be identified in forest development plans required under the code and the Riparian Management Area Guidebook (RMAG) must then be followed.
References to the protection of sensitive resource features can apply to coastal areas not protected by a MSZ.
The trust exercises authority with respect to local planning and development and can protect coastal habitat.
