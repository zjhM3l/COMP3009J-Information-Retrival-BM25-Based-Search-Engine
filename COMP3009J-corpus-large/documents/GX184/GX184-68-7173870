Top of Page Records of the Military Intelligence Division
The Military Intelligence Division (MID) was responsible for the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of military information, and among its major staff duties from 1939 to 1945, included the supervision of United States military attaches and military missions abroad (2), liaison with military attaches and missions in Washington from accredited foreign countries, negative (or counterintelligence) as well as positive intelligence work, and participation in joint intelligence-collection activities with the Navy and with other agencies of the Federal Government.
The March 1942 reorganization of the War Department included a major overhaul of the MID.
The Intelligence Branch was replaced by the Military Intelligence Service (MIS), which assumed principal responsibility for collecting, evaluating, and disseminating intelligence information.
Additional changes followed during the war, so that by 1944 MIS consisted of the following major components: 1) Information Group 2) Intelligence Group; 3) Administrative Group; and, 4) Counterintelligence Group.
MID records for the interwar period largely consist of a central correspondence file, with associated indexes.
The pre-1942 records, for the most part, are located in the Archives I Building (3)
Formerly Security-Classified Intelligence Reference Publications ("Regional File") Received From U.S. Military Attaches, Military and Civilian Agencies of the United States, Foreign Governments, and Other Sources, 1922-1944 (Entry 77)
The records are arranged alphabetically by name or country or region and thereunder according to a numeric-subject filing scheme initially prepared by MID in 1920 as the Index Guide for Classification of Military Information.
This index organized intelligence materials for a particular country or region into general and secondary subject categories, each of which was assigned four-digit numerical designations.
In the 1940 edition of the index, information was organized into nine general categories: Geographic (1000-1320); Population and Social Conditions (2000-2950); Political (3000-3870); Economic (4000-5070); National Defense (5900-5990); Army (6000-6970); Navy (7000-7945); Air-Civil (8000-8290); and, Air-Military (9900-9960).
For each country or region, additional miscellaneous subject files, correspondence, or memorandums are often appended to the end of the numeric-subject files.
The Numerical Series of Intelligence Documents ("ID File"), which began in June 1944, was the successor to this series.
See Records of the Army Staff (RG 319) for the "ID" File.

Formerly Security-Classified Numerical Series of Intelligence Documents ("ID File") June 1944-1955 (Entry 85A)
Arranged numerically (1-948,410) with some additional subseries and bulky files located at the end of the series.
The "ID" files, which succeeded the wartime "regional files," relate for the most part to the postwar period; ID numbers 1-205000 are most pertinent for the period June 1944-September 1945.
Despite the indicated date period, a number of reports furnish intelligence with effective dates as early as 1942.
As with the regional files, the "ID" materials constitute records originated by the Military Intelligence Service and its subordinate organizations, together with intelligence data supplied by other U.S. Army, Navy, and civilian organizations and by British and other Allied intelligence agencies.
Many individual reports in this series have been withdrawn or transferred to other intelligence collections, usually indicated by a withdrawal sheet.

Top of Page Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) Collection
The predecessor of the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) was the Military Intelligence Service's Counterintelligence Branch (before March 1942 designated the Counterintelligence Branch, G-2), which supervised the general counterintelligence activities of the CIC detachments in the field.
CIC Detachments were quite active in post-war activities in Germany and Austria in efforts to locate war criminals, Nazi records, and looted property.
Many of NARA's holdings concern investigations of foreign individuals and organizations during and after the war.
Declassified records have generally been "sanitized" to protect security-classified information and still remain subject to NARA restrictions on privileged information.
Records of the Investigatory Records Repository The records of the Investigatory Records Repository (IRR) are arranged in two series: the impersonal and the personal name files.
The impersonal files include files on a number of subjects and organizations; the personal name files includes dossiers on individuals.
IRR Case Files : Impersonal Files
This series includes reports, memorandums, interrogations, interviews, cables, affidavits, and other records collected in the investigation of individuals and organizations.
Many case files relate to German wartime intelligence, security, and special forces organizations and operations.
For a complete listing see the finding aid in the consulation area in Room 2400.
Also, please note that some of the files in this series of records are still classified.
