Enoch Train is an "instrumental-contemporary-acoustic-Americana-folk ensemble" dedicated to recording and performing traditional and original melodies from around the world in a fresh and innovative manner.
When immigrants came to America long ago, they carried the music of their homelands in their hearts.
Later, in public gatherings or at church worship services, they sang this music and shared it within their "melting pot" communities.
This music helped to establish a new musical tradition in a budding nation.
Enoch Train celebrates the diversity of the people of America by exploring these melodies.
Led by producer/musician Clive Romney, and comprised of some of the best studio musicians in the state of Utah, Enoch Train brings fresh expression to the songs and tunes that have become so well known in American culture, and introduces us to other sounds from around the world.
Guitar, woodwinds, bass, mandolin, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and drums of all shapes and sizesto name just a fewpaint a musical picture that leaves the listener with renewed excitement for the music of America.
The Enoch Train was an actual sailing ship that brought immigrants from Europe and North America in the late nineteenth century.
Upon the occasion of its launch in 1852, the Boston Daily Atlas call the Enoch Train the largest clipper ship in the world, and praised it by writing, "Never was there a ship to which the term beautiful was more appropriately applied."
Enoch Train, the band, took the name in honor of those who sailed in search of a new and better life, bringing with them the traditions of their homelands and creating new traditions in a new land.
Enoch Train band consists of:
Clive Romney:Mandolin, Guitar, Banjo, Percussion Janice Walter:Fiddle, Guitar, Mandolin, Accordian Rich Dixon:Guitars, Dobro, Mandolin Rob Honey:Bass, Guitar Daron Bradford:Flute, Clarinet, Oboe, English Horn, Pennywhistle, Saxes, Recorder, Quena, Sampona, Shakuhachi, etc.

Formed in Chicago in 1997, The Fry Street Quartet (FSQ) brims with exuberance and energy.
The quartet's 2001 debut at Weill recital Hall in New York "spoke of precision, preparation, excitement, profound heritage, and ultimate satisfaction" (New York Concert Review).
Their performance earlier that season at the 92^nd Street Y in New York was hailed by the New York Times as "a triumph of ensemble playing."
Winners of the 2000 Millennium Grand Prize at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition and the first prize at the 2000 Yellow Springs Competition, the FSQ performs nationally and internationally, with concerts this year in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and others, and a concert tour of the Balkans sponsored by Carnegie Hall and the U. S. State Department.
Committed to education, in 1999 the Fry Street Quartet applied and was chosen to participate in Chamber Music America's three-year "Rural Residencies" program (funded by the National Endowment for the Arts).
The quartet spent three years working with the community of Hickory, North Carolina in outreach, education, chamber music activities, and serving as principal players in North Carolina's Western Piedmont Symphony.
The quartet was recently named Faculty Quartet in Residence at Utah State University, where it continues to influence and encourage future generations of musicians.
The Fry Street Quartet will present during the next two seasons "From Prodigy to Master" a series of six concerts exploring the first and last works by the grand old master-composers of the string quartet genre.
In one evening, hear the Mozart's precocious Opus 13, written by the composer at 16 years old, and then his Opus 590, written in the year of the composer's untimely death.
Such juxtapositions shed a new light on classical music's masterpieces and unearth some fascinating seldom-heard early works.
In Haydn's Quartet, Op.1, we see "the father of the string quartet" first exploring the new genre that would become his trademark, with the excitement and naivete of a young man.
In Haydn's Opus 77, No. 2, we hear "Papa Haydn," now an old man composing with wisdom and ease on a lifetime of experience, and also being inflruenced by the younger composers: Mozart, the prodigy who admired Haydn greatly, and Beethoven, Haydn's own irreverent and rebellious student.
The series showcases the early genius of a teen-aged Mozart and Mendelssohn, and displays incredible artistic development and innovation through the brilliant lives of Beethoven, Haydn, Dvorak, and Schubert.
Outreach Options: 1) A two-hour interactive master class/string chamber music workshop for string students which culminates in a student concert and a short performance by the Fry Street Quartet.
2) A young people's "informance" blending performance with lively activities and discussion previewing the upcoming concert.
3) An outreach concert for a non-traditional audience (hospital, prison, retirement home, etc.)
Technical Requirements: 4 armless chairs.
sufficient lighting for performers to see their music well and a quiet defined space for listening only.
Noisy air-conditiooning , or heating systems should be avoided.
Also, the space should not be open for any purpose other than listening to the concert or presentation..

Over the years Sharron has developed an amazing vocal range with a style that is unique and original to Bluegrass music.

He creates powerful rhythm patterns as well while throwing in bass runs and chops demonstrating remarkable skills on the old 'round hole'.
Bill is a great tenor singer adding lead and harmony vocals to the mix.
He has great song writing skills as well which will be demonstrated on the band's next CD release.
He is also the 2001 Utah State Champion on Fiddle and Mandolin.

RUSS EVANS creates forward movement with his driving mando in the Band.
His passion for Bluegrass is reflected in his strong chops and percussion style of playing.
Living in the rural farm country of Utah, Russ has written many of the band's tunes that reflect all aspects of that life style from "witching" wells to Native American influences as well as Gospel.
He is one of the founders and the promoter of the Birch Creek Bluegrass Festival in Central Utah, which is held on his 200 acre farm as well as promoting a concert series in rural Utah.
Russ is married to the bass player in Gift Horse and is purported to be the Father of their three children.
DREW WILLIAMS has that great ear for the high and lonesome sound and creates powerful leads and fillers throughout the music.
Drew has played the fiddle for over 19 years and demonstrates his love for traditional as well as contemporary styles of bluegrass music.
He also shows off his skills in the band on the mandolin.
His rapid fire, clean and accurate technique on both instruments keeps the band in high gear.
He is finishing his degree this year in tech/ed and we hope he continues to keep all his didgets.
