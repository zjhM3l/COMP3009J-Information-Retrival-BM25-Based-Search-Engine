G. BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RESEARCH ON RELATED TOPICS
The legislative mandate for this report requires inclusion of summaries of "relevant research on the SSI program by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and others."
Given the volume of research that has been done since the inception of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, we concluded that we could most effectively optimize interested readers' access to this information by developing a comprehensive bibliography, rather than by attempting to synopsize numerous, sometimes lengthy and complex documents.
In addition, in this and future reports, we expect to provide summary information on certain current research projects related to the SSI program.
Section 1 below presents information on six such projects commissioned by SSA.
Future reports will provide the results of these studies.
Section 2 presents a list of reference sources that include studies and reports regarding various aspects of the SSI program prepared by, or under contract for, the Social Security Administration.
The list also includes information gleaned from the extensive holdings of the Library of Congress regarding studies that have been conducted by public and private entities regarding SSI payment levels, recipients, and reform proposals.
It is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of relevant studies.

Research Topics
a.
Policy Evaluation of the Effects of the 1996 Welfare Reform Legislation on SSI Benefits for Children with Disabilities
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 substantially tightened the childhood SSI eligibility criteria.
This legislation also requires that all SSI children be redetermined based on the adult disability criteria after turning 18 years of age.
SSA has awarded a policy evaluation task order contract to the RAND Corporation to design a study of both the net effect of this legislation on SSA's caseloads and program costs and the impact of losing SSI benefits on the children affected by the law.
Through this contract, SSA will obtain answers to the following questions: * What are the characteristics of the children who are affected by the legislation? * What is the impact of the legislation on children with disabilities who were receiving SSI benefits prior to welfare reform? * What happens to these children in terms of their family income, living arrangements, utilization of medical services, and other relevant outcomes? * What is the overall net impact of welfare reform on SSI caseloads and costs, taking into account both terminations and new allowances?
The study will provide descriptive and quantitative estimates of the effects of the legislation on the children who were on the rolls prior to the enactment of the legislation through analyses of SSA administrative data and currently available survey data.
In addition, the study will provide estimates of the net effect of the legislation on the number of children on the SSI rolls, total benefit years, and program cost, accounting for both terminations and new allowances.
Qualitative data are collected through a limited number of case studies of affected children, their families, and service providers in four States.
The study design has been completed and the contract for the study itself is expected to be awarded in the Summer of 2000.
b.
Design and Implementation of Survey of Children with Disabilities
Due to the widely acknowledged shortcomings of existing data sources for evaluating the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and for tracking SSI children unaffected by welfare reform, SSA has undertaken to design and implement a national survey of children with disabilities.
The last formal, nationally representative survey of SSI children was conducted for SSA in 1978 by Urban Systems Research 
Among the questions the survey will be designed to answer are the following: * What is the cost of caring for a disabled child? * What are the uses of SSI benefits? * What alternative sources of care are available to disabled children who lose SSI benefits? * How is quality of life and utilization of medical services impacted by gaining or losing SSI benefits? * What is the impact of receiving childhood SSI benefits on parental labor force participation?
The goal is to collect data that will allow SSA to further evaluate the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and their families, as well as to evaluate future changes to the SSI program that may affect children.
This project consists of two broad activities: survey design and survey implementation.
SSA has awarded a survey design task order contract to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.
Mathematica's tasks include designing the sampling plan, developing the survey instrument, pre-testing the survey instrument, and drafting an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance package.
A survey implementation contract will be completed after the design is solidified.
SSA currently anticipates that data collection will begin late in calendar year 2000.
c. Policy Evaluation of the Overall Effects of Welfare Reform on SSA Programs--Phase I Evaluation Design
Future cutbacks in non-SSA welfare programs may result in increased applications among some groups of people.
Awards to such applicants would increase the growth of SSA's disability programs and program costs.
Thus, while some aspects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (such as provisions restricting the eligibility of children) are expected to decrease SSA caseloads and program costs, other changes (most notably the replacement of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program by block grants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) may work in the opposite direction.
Therefore, a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of the overall net effects of the welfare reform legislation must take account of the effect of non-SSA welfare reform provisions on SSA's programs.
A task order contract was awarded to the Lewin Group to propose an evaluation design for the Welfare Reform Act's effect on non-SSA programs that might affect applications and awards for SSA programs.
The study proposes that the effects should be measured in combination with specific State demonstrations in selected States.
The report reviews the characteristics of many State demonstrations and highlights State evaluation projects in California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
Using nationally representative data before welfare reform and State-to-State variations before welfare reform, the study assesses the likely magnitude and direction of indirect welfare reform effects on SSA caseloads in the future.
The study concludes that they cannot be precisely measured with national level survey data matched to SSA records or with State-to-State differences across time.
As part of the analysis, the project provides descriptive survey data of SSI participants by age and gender and statistically analyzes the transition onto SSI with these data.
In addition, it develops an analytic framework and methodology for future retrospective studies of the overall effects of welfare reform on SSA caseloads, and includes a systematic assessment of existing and potential new data collection necessary to track the longer-term effects of welfare reform on SSA caseloads.
d. Project NetWork
The Project NetWork demonstration was SSA's first large-scale initiative to assist DI beneficiaries and SSI applicants and recipients in returning to employment through a combination of intensive outreach and case management services.
A rigorous evaluation component based on a randomized field experiment design has been an integral part of the demonstration design.
Under contract with SSA, Abt Associates, Inc. is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the Project NetWork demonstration.
Because of their richness, the databases that are potentially available from the demonstration can be utilized to conduct studies focusing on issues relevant for targeting future SSA return-to-work initiatives.
The narrower objectives of the project focus on the Project NetWork case management approach.
With help from contractors, a comprehensive administrative records database has been developed by SSA staff containing detailed information on: * 8,248 Project NetWork participants randomly assigned to receive case management services or to a control group, and * 138,613 eligible nonparticipants living in the demonstration areas.
The database includes information on the receipt of SSI and DI benefits and earnings, prior to the demonstration period through the post-demonstration period, and a set of demographic and diagnostic variables.
A wide array of survey data has been collected on a random sample of project eligibles--covering all DI beneficiaries and SSI applicants and recipients--living in the demonstration areas.
Both project participants who volunteered for the demonstration and nonparticipants have been interviewed at baseline.
The survey data file contains information on both economic and non-economic variables affecting the decision to volunteer for return-to-work programs that is not available from SSA administrative record systems; for example, the survey has detailed information on functional limitations, health (including mental health status), cognitive functioning, motivation, and substance abuse.
Study findings to date focus on the feasibility of applying case management on a large scale, the feasibility of reaching out to hard-to-serve segments of beneficiaries and applicants, and measures of project outcomes.
e. State Partnership Return-to-Work Demonstrations--Design and Implementation of the Net Outcomes Evaluation
In the fall of 1998, the Social Security Administration's Office of Disability and Income Security Programs (SSA/ODISP) and the Department of Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration (ED/RSA) announced the award of 12 SSA and 6 RSA projects with annual funding (renewable for 5 years) under State Partnership agreements and grants.
These projects are designed to assist States in developing alternative program structures and service delivery systems that increase the successful employment of persons with disabilities who are receiving SSI and SSDI.
A technical assistance, monitoring and data collection contract was also awarded by SSA/ODISP at that time to facilitate consistent cross-site data collection from these demonstrations.
In the Spring of 1999, SSA's Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics (SSA/ORES) awarded an 18-month task-order contract to evaluate the net impact of these projects.
The contractor will design a two-part comprehensive evaluation of the net-outcomes produced by the State demonstrations.
The Core net-outcome evaluation will rely primarily on SSA administrative data and will use appropriate statistical methods to define comparison groups and determine the net impact of the State demonstrations on participants.
To the extent made possible by the quality of additional demonstration data from the States, the evaluation contractor will also implement a Supplemental net-outcome evaluation.
Both of these aspects of the contract will focus primarily on the evaluation designs, but the contractor will be required to test and implement these evaluations for participants through the term of the task order.
f. Ticket to Work
The evaluation of the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program will examine the following: * Total and net costs of the program, * The impact of the program on beneficiary work outcomes and reliance on SSA benefits, * The individual and service provision characteristics of service providers and provider networks, * The appeal of the program among the eligible population, and * The satisfaction of participants with the program in general.
To the degree possible, the evaluation will utilize information from SSA administrative data and from the Ticket-to-Work implementation process.
Such data will be insufficient, however, to cover many of the evaluation topics required under the legislation.
This will be especially true for eligible non-participants and comparison individuals in areas where the Ticket Program is not fully implemented.
A significant survey effort will therefore be required to supply the necessary supplemental information to meet these evaluation requirements.
Due to the relatively short implementation time line of the program, the evaluation will have two components.
The first phase will involve a task order contract to provide data development from existing sources, design of the supplemental data survey, and design of the specific evaluation components to meet the legislative requirements.
The second phase will utilize a multiyear contract to carry out the supplemental data survey and evaluation design, and provide the congressional evaluation reports mandated in the law.
