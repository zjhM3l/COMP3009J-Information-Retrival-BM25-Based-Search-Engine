SHELLFISH AQUACULTURE ON MARTHAS VINEYARD Richard C. Karney Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
First, I should like to thank Carlos and Scott for scheduling this meeting.
The timing is perfect to kick off our Marthas Vineyard Private Aquaculture Initiative, an aquacultural training program funded under the NMFS Fishing Industry Grants Program.
The 11 fishermen selected to participate in the training program are in the audience this morning.
I have been in the aquacultural business for over 20 yr and I feel comfortable using the term explosive to describe development in the industry over the past couple of years.
Increased consumption of seafood in light of its dietary health benefits, combined with a decline in natural stocks, has resulted in price increases attractive to aquacultural development.
Of the seafood readily available in local fish markets and supermarkets, much is now farmed.
This includes Atlantic salmon, channel catfish, trout, prawns, and shrimp.
The bivalve mollusks [northern quahogs, eastern oysters, bay scallops, and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis)] increasingly are advertised as cultured
.
If anything that grows in water is not yet in commercial culture, it at least is being considered for aquaculture, and methods are being developed for its culture.
The list runs the gamut from abalone, alligator, and baitfishes, through crayfishes, geoducks, lobsters, mahi mahi, pearl oysters, and ornamental seahorses, to seaweeds, sponges, scallops, and sturgeons
.
INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT
Currently, aquaculture is labor intensive, which has favored its development in the third world.
The Chinese have been especially successful adapting scallop culture techniques developed by the Japanese.
These techniques include spat collectors, pearl nets, and lantern nets, and have been used to culture scallop species imported from the eastern coast of the United States.
Starting with 26 broodstock bay scallop, the Chinese now control the major portion of the worlds production of our bay scallop! Right here in Edgartown, Massachusetts, a recognized center of the bay scallop fishery, the local A
The fishermen here receive $7-8/lb for shucked meats of the same species of scallop, and suffer from the competition of the cheap foreign import.
I have heard that a good buck can be made buying the Chinese product at $3.99 and mixing it with the local catch! But, I am sure that has been just wishful thinking.
Clearly, the local product is fresher and superior, but the fact remains that there is local consumption of the cheaper cultured Chinese product.
In Chile, the same Japanese lantern net technology has been employed in a highly successful private venture.
In operation less than a decade, this venture employs over 600 people, annually produces over 100 tons of scallop product, and has just been listed on the British stock exchange.
Clearly, the third world is beating us at this part of the aquacultural game.
LOCAL OPERATIONS
However, within our region, especially on Cape Cod, some significant private aquaculture has developed.
Karl Rask, who has championed the development of the private aquacultural industry on the cape, informs me that presently there are 111 operations, mostly 2- and 3-acre farms (the largest is 33 acres), producing a farmgate value of about $4 million.
Northern quahogs are the number-one product, with eastern oysters a close second.
There is a little production of softshells (Mya arenaria), blue mussels, and bay scallops.
Vineyard waters are still essentially devoted to the wild fishery.
However, we have been leaders in the development and application of aquacultural technology to the public management of our wild fisheries.
For the past 18 yr, the Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group, in cooperation with local town shellfish departments, has publicly cultured economically important, local species including northern quahogs, bay scallops, and eastern oysters.
Our public stock enhancement program includes the operation of a solar-assisted shellfish hatchery.
The hatchery produced over 15 million seed shellfish last year.
Hatchery production includes axenic culture of microscopic phytoplankton needed to feed developing shellfish.
Small phytoplankton cultures are worked up into larger 18-l and 250-l cultures in the greenhouse at the hatchery.
Once adequate algal food stocks are produced, broodstock shellfish are brought into the hatchery and spawned.
When ripe, the quahogs, scallops, and oysters are treated to repeated thermal stimuli in the laboratory, mimicking changes in water temperature that elicit spawning in the natural environment.
The great fecundity of shellfish (we average over a million eggs per female) makes these species excellent candidates for aquaculture.
With adequate care and protection, the culturist can easily produce millions of shellfish.
In the big picture of providing protein for a growing global human population, bivalves also score highly.
Bivalves are herbivores, low on the food chain, and efficient producers of protein.
Fertilized eggs are counted, then cultured in filtered, heated seawater for the duration of the 2-3 wk swimming larval cycle.
During this period, larvae are fed cultured phytoplankton daily.
Every other day, culture tanks are drained, cleaned, and refilled with heated, filtered seawater.
Shellfish larvae are sieved, culled, and suspended in the tanks.
At the end of the larval cycle, shellfish absorb their swimming organs, develop a foot, and become a miniature version of the adult.
After this metamorphosis, they are called juveniles.
Juveniles are moved to flowing water systems.
Our hatchery is located on a rich estuary with dense natural phytoplankton blooms.
The plankton-rich water is pumped over the filter-feeding shellfish, so there is little need for additional feeding with costly cultured phytoplankton.
In the hatchery, quahog juveniles are grown on downweller sieves, and, eventually, in upweller silos.
We have succeeded in moving seed as small as 1 mm to floating sandbox nursery trays that are suspended in the natural environment.
As most predation on small quahogs is from nonswimming crabs, the survival rate is high in the floating nursery trays.
The trays are largely inaccessible to the crawling crabs.
From June, field culture continues until October when the quahog seed is Ã¯Â¿Â½-Ã¯Â¿Â½ inch in length.
The seed then are broadcast in the natural public shellfish beds.
Very young juvenile scallops are similarly grown on downweller sieves in the hatchery.
Larger scallop seed is grown to between 2 and 5 mm in raceways before being moved to floating field nursery cages.
After about 2 mo under ideal conditions of temperature and low density, seed scallops attain a size of about Ã¯Â¿Â½ inch, and are broadcast into historically productive areas of the saltwater ponds.
Oyster larvae cement themselves to a substrate during metamorphosis.
They are cultured using a method known as remote setting.
Large hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest developed this method.
At the end of the swimming stage, oyster larvae develop a distinctive eyespot.
These eyed larvae are screened from culture vessels, wrapped in damp paper towels, and refrigerated overnight.
They are then released over bags of oyster shell in tanks of aerated seawater at a site near the growout pond.
Within a couple of days, the oyster larvae cement themselves to the shell, and the shellbags are hung from a raft in the saltwater pond.
After about a month, the shellbags are emptied and the shell with attached oyster seed is planted on the pond bottom.
Breeding of genetic shell tags into hatchery stock helps to track survival and determine success of the stock enhancement program.
After about a dozen years of serious hatchery production and seeding, some town shellfish constables report that 10-20% of the quahog harvest has brown notata shell markings.
About 80% of our hatchery quahog production is tagged with the notata markings.
This genetic trait was rare in the local population and harvest before the seeding program.
Likewise, shell color variation can be used to mark bay scallops genetically.
The Marthas Vineyard Shellfish Group pioneered the use of shell coloration to tag the bay scallop.
In 1979, we produced an F2 generation with 95% displaying distinctive orange shells.
But when we found that the brightly colored, orange shells increased bird predation, we changed our tag to a striped pattern.
Although still distinctive, the striped pattern may provide the shells some camouflage, thus protecting them from predators.
Predator control is a major factor in our ability to succeed.
Local shellfish constables have established trapping programs for crabs and starfish.
The Town of Edgartown initiated a bounty system and paid fishermen for predators they removed.
No matter how successful our public aquacultural program has been, our limitations in manpower and funds prevent us from realizing the maximum yield possible from the islands waters.
Private aquacultural ventures, on the other hand, can do better.
Indeed, private culture in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, using only 3% of the total bottom dedicated to shellfish aquaculture, out-produced the wild harvest from the remaining 97%.
It is the policy of the Marthas Vineyard Private Aquaculture Initiative to encourage private aquaculture on the Vineyard.
Encouragement consists of a program of education, training, and cooperative extension-like individual assistance.
The Vineyards long history as a public fishery will be a constraint to private development.
By contrast, it is interesting to note that much of the development on Cape Cod is in Wellfleet areas with a long history of private oyster leases.
On the Vineyard, interest in aquaculture has heightened within the last year, as evidenced by an increase in the number of applications for shellfish culture leases.
Much of the interest is from the fishing community which not that long ago considered aquaculture a threat to the public fishing areas and to marketplace competition.
With their natural stocks declining and fishing areas closing, these same fishermen now see aquaculture as their next source of income.
Another constraint to the Vineyards private aquacultural ventures is our high standard of living, accompanied by high labor cost and outrageously expensive waterfront property.
Furthermore, our predominantly tourist economy also competes for use of our waters.
Its concerns for aesthetics and for providing recreation pose additional obstacles to local development of aquaculture.
On the positive side, the islands popularity and bustling local restaurants can make any local aquacultural product a marketers dream.
Nantucket Island faces similar constraints and opportunities in developing aquaculture.
We are encouraged by their innovative, private-public, cooperative program.
Fishermen are employed in a private venture in public waters.
The town provides them with seed and public bottom on which to culture seed.
In return, they give the town half of their production.
The town uses its half to seed public beds in order to enhance its stock.
The Nantucket program may very well serve as a model for the Vineyard.
Public stock enhancement efforts here lack the manpower to maximize the size and survival of publicly cultured seed.
At the same time, many eager local aquaculturists cannot produce due to a lack of available aquacultural areas.
Public-private cooperation could benefit all concerned.
