Ms. Ross was a long-time Social Security employee who played key staff roles at SSA, especially in the area of legislation.
She was also active in the National Academy of Social Insurance and was a friend and research associate of several important Social Security figures, including, most-especially, Robert M. Ball.
Ball often sent drafts of his work to Mary for her expert review and input.
Indeed, in the copy of his 1978 book "Social Security: Today and Tomorrow," that he gave to Mary, Ball penned this inscription: "To Mary Ross, who helped with this book more than anyone else.
Affectionately.
Bob."
Throughout her working career Mary saved virtually every document that came across her desk.
Among her papers are hundreds of memoranda, Congressional hearing reports, copies of multiple versions of developing legislation, and reports, studies and booklets on a wide range of subjects.
The researcher will not find a large trove of personal letters or papers about Mary or her activities.
Nor do these papers focus on Mary Ross' career or accomplishments.
Mary was much too self-effacing to assemble an archive of that type.
Rather, most of the material here consists of official and published documents that Mary saved and organized.
Mary Ross' papers are a kind of mini-library of the most important developments in Social Security program over the past 30 years or so.
(Mary Ross Oral History Interview)
Acknowledgments: We want to thank the representatives of the Mary Ross estate for their cooperation in the transfer of this important collection to the SSA Archives.
In particular, we want to thank the Executor of the estate, Mr. Bennett Bosky, for his support.
We also owe special debts of gratitude to two people: Mary's close friend, Johnnie Albertson, who was an enthusiastic advocate of this project, and who provided both moral and financial support; and Mary's nurse, Linda Michaut, who sweated along with us in the manual labors necessary to sort through the materials and box them up for transport to SSA.
Without their generous help, it would have been impossible to preserve this important collection of Social Security papers and to preserve the intellectual legacy of Mary Ross.
