[smalljunk.gif] PROTECT YOURSELF BEFORE you receive unsolicited e-mail PROTECT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS * CONTACT YOUR ISP; don't wait for your ISP to contact you about the protections under Washington's law.
1.
Authorize your ISP to disclose you have a Washington e-mail address 2.
Encourage your ISP to provide this disclosure service if they don't have it
* REGISTER YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS through the Washington State Association of Internet Service Providers
As long as the location of a Washington e-mail address is available to the would-be spammer, whether or not they actually check all possible sources of this information, they are prohibited from sending unsolicited e-mail in violation of the law to a Washington resident.
AFTER you've received unsolicited e-mail * BLOCK FUTURE E-MAILS FROM SENDER - Once you've been "spammed" ask your ISP to block all future e-mail from the sender.
This is an important step that can help you and thousands of other subscribers.
Once an ISP has reason to believe their network is being used to send unlawful unsolicited commercial e-mail, they can block all further e-mail sent to its subscribers from the address or domain name of the sender.
