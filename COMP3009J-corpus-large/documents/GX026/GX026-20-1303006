Back Link back to the Photo Gallery Next Photograph of the 90's booth that was put together by NPARL Technician Kim Mann.
NPARL technician Kim Mann put together items for the 90s booth including the Pacific yew tree sprigs shown on the table.
The Pacific yew tree was the original source of taxol, an active ingredient shown to combat ovarian and breast cancer.
In the 1990s, ARS scientists developed a technique to grow taxol-producing cells in tissue culture, sparing the Pacific yew tree population from potential decimation.
In that same decade ARS scientist also developed Oatrim, a fat substitute.
Visitors to this booth were invited to participate in a taste test between regular brownies and brownies made with Oatrim.
