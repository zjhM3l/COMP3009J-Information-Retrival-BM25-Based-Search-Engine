Inputs, Outputs and Activities: FY 2002 Program: USAID will use DA funds to support conservation and sound resource use in critical bio-diverse areas.
These funds will provide technical assistance and training to help NGO partners and communities develop and implement participatory natural resource management plans, to protect not only the resources that provide their livelihood, but also up to 70% of Quito's water supply.
Additional technical assistance will accelerate development of long-term financing for conservation of Quito's watershed, basic to the region's economic and social development.
Land titling for the 300,000 hectare Afro-Ecuadorian Ethnic Reserve will be completed, and training will support broader adoption of low-impact forestry management practices.
The Awa Indigenous Federation (bordering one of the most conflictive areas of southern Colombia) will receive a second year of technical assistance and training (e.g. forestry and wildlife management) to improve its capabilities to manage the ChocÃ¯Â¿Â½ biodiversity "hotspot."
A new activity will be initiated, in coordination with the on-going Northern Border program, to provide technical assistance and training for biodiversity conservation and to consolidate land tenure (boundary definition and marking) for indigenous peoples groups along the northern border.
This will help stabilize this conflict-prone area and prevent unauthorized colonization and conversion of some of the world's richest habitats.
A community-based ecotourism program on Isabela Island (Galapagos) will be further developed, laying the foundation for alternatives to environmentally destructive over-fishing.
This should also help reduce conflict, as GOE-enforced catch limits have repeatedly led to violent protests by local fishermen.
USAID will use ESF funds to enhance the Galapagos National Park's capabilities to monitor and protect the Galapagos Marine Reserve through the purchase of specialized equipment.
Scientific assessments demonstrate that commercial tuna fishing in the Reserve can negatively affect the Galapagos' biological diversity through heavy bycatch on sea lion, shark, turtle, albatross, and other endangered species.
Enhanced GNP response capabilities will help ensure that the Reserve's biological diversity is adequately protected, even as Ecuador increases its tuna exports.
Also, these additional assets will greatly enhance Ecuador's abilities to monitor and address the illegal movement of precursor chemicals and drugs in the Galapagos.
Planned FY 2003 Program: In December 2000 USAID carried out an external evaluation of its environment program, which is now being used to guide the revision of the environment strategy.
The findings and recommendations of the evaluation have been used to improve program focus by identifying priority program areas for FY 2003 resources.
The first area is enhanced protection of Quito's watershed, which will work with local partners, communities, other donors and the GOE to help consolidate and improve management of the watershed's five protected areas.
Adequate water provision is an increasingly high priority for Quito, especially given that this region reportedly has the highest concentration of biological diversity.
The second high-priority program area is conservation of the Galapagos Islands, especially the Marine Reserve.
Activities will include technical assistance and training to further develop low-impact community-based ecotourism, and conflict reduction with broader engagement of stakeholder groups including the commercial fishing sector.
The third program area (to be funded in part with ESF funds) includes expanding work with indigenous groups along the fragile northern border, to build their technical and administrative capabilities to manage rich biological resources and reduce vulnerabilities to the pressures from southern Colombia.
Technical assistance to develop endowment funds for these groups for long-term conservation will be a priority, exploring opportunities such as collaboration with local oil companies and the Tropical Forestry Conservation Act.
Performance and Results: Ecuador may have more biological diversity per unit area than any other country on earth and USAID's program is helping to conserve substantial areas of this globally significant habitat.
In 2001, 1.4 million hectares were better managed with USAID's support through implementation of participatory natural resource management plans.
This number is expected to exceed 3.0 million hectares by the mid-point of the new Strategy period.
Capacity-building has played an important role in this success, and by 2001 the program's five local NGO
In December 2001 the Galapagos Marine Reserve was declared a UNESCO Global Patrimony, a landmark victory for conservation--and USAID.
implementing partners considerably improved their administrative and financial capability (e.g., active Board of Directors, accurate financial reporting) and leveraged almost $7 million in non-USAID funds to support their efforts.
Improved policies and legal frameworks helped to facilitate better management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
At the same time, resource-based conflicts in the Galapagos are likely to continue, and USAID will provide expert technical assistance (e.g., through the National Marine Fisheries Service) to strengthen the scientific basis for consensus on fisheries management.
During this reporting period, Quito's electric company (an important water user) agreed to provide $45,000 per year to the Quito Water Fund, bringing the Fund's total capital to approximately $500,000.
An important outcome of this program will be to accelerate consolidation of indigenous territories strategically located along the northern border, thereby providing a stronger social and physical barrier to the spread of the coca economy and related violence.
Improved policy and legal frameworks will greatly contribute to the protection of this rich bio-diverse region and encourage better conservation and management practices by citizens.
Finally, USAID support will contribute to the growth of the Quito Water Fund to assure long-term financing for conservation of the watershed.
Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies: USAID works with CARE (through FY 2002), The Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund, and their local NGO partners.
Activities in the Galapagos are implemented through the Galapagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Foundation, and USAID anticipates their continued involvement in the future.
USAID expects to issue a competitive procurement in FY 2002 for its new activity with indigenous groups along the northern border.
