Laurence D. Charlet, Agricultural Research Service Fargo, ND 58105
OBJECTIVES
Reduce crop losses by developing management strategies for sunflower insect pests, including banded sunflower moth and the sunflower stem weevil using parasitoids and microbial agents, and other biologically-based methods such as cultural control and host-plant resistance.
Develop increased knowledge on biology, ecology and insect-host interactions, including potential for biological and cultural control of red sunflower seed weevil, sunflower beetle, and sunflower midge in partnership with State and ARS cooperators.
APPROACH
Collections of sunflower stem weevils, red sunflower seed weevils, banded sunflower moths, soil samples, and sunflower plants will be examined for pathogens.
Pathogen isolates will be identified and bioassayed using feral or reared insects.
Wild and cultivated sunflower will be evaluated for resistance to banded sunflower moth.
Components in sunflower pollen, seeds, or other plant parts determined to convey resistance will be identified and synthesized.
Banded sunflower moth and sunflower stem weevil larvae will be collected from cultivated and native sunflower species to locate new parasitoids and their biology, abundance, and impact determined.
The interaction of insects and disease on sunflower production will be determined through trials conducted in NE, CO, and KS.
The potential use of different planting dates as a control tactic to reduce damage from sunflower beetle will be evaluated and the impact on parasitism monitored.
The life history, emergence, flight, and oviposition of sunflower midge will be studied and host-plant resistance of hybrids and inbred lines measured.

OBJECTIVE
Increase genetic diversity of cultivated sunflower through collection of wild sunflower germplasm and incorporation of useful genes into a semi-domestic background.
Wild and interspecific germplasm will be evaluated for oil quality, disease resistance, and insect resistance.
Develop an RFLP genetic map of sunflower, develop and characterize primary trisomics, and to integrate agronomically important genes onto the RFLP map.
Investigate if LOX pathway metabolites function in sunflower defense against pests.
APPROACH
Additional populations of several wild sunflower species from various geographic regions of N. America will be collected.
All germplasm accessions will be deposited in the Helianthus collection at the Regional Plt Introduction Stn, Ames, IA. Population accessions of wild species will be evaluated for oil concentration and for fatty acid composition.
Wild sunflower species will be evaluated for disease tolerance to the major sunflower diseases and insects.
Interspecific hybridization will be conducted by crossing domestic H. annuus with various accessions of wild species.
Embryo culture techniques will be used to obtain difficult cross combinations.
Specific useful genes will be transferred into cultivated sunflower.
Species and genomic relationships will be evaluated cytologically.
Resulting amphiploids from chromosome doubling will be evaluated on their ability to increase backcross seed set as well as their function as bridges to convert wild species and cultivated lines.
Genes of agronomic interest will be mapped onto the sunflower RFLP map.

OBJECTIVES
Transfer genes for resistance to the red sunflower seed weevil into cultivated sunflower.
Increase the percent of oleic acid in sunflower.
Continue to develop new markers for an RFLP genetic map of sunflower and map genes for important traits onto the genetic map.
Develop a sunflower database accessible on the internet.
APPROACH
Construct a plasmid containing a delta-endotoxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporate it into the sunflower genome through an Agrobacterium tumafaciens mediated transformation system.
Obtain seed from the transgenic sunflower and test progeny for the new gene.
Test transformed progeny for resistance to the red sunflower seed weevil.
Transfer sunflower with an additional desaturase gene.
Develop additional RFLP markers from cDNA of various organs of the sunflower plant.
Map genes for downy mildew and rust resistance, fertility restoration, and nuclear male sterility onto an RFLP genetic map.

Agricultural Research Service Fargo, ND 58105
OBJECTIVES
To develop diverse sources of sunflower germplasm for economically important traits and adaptability to U.S. growing conditions and investigate genetic inheritance.
To investigate altering the fatty acid composition of sunflower seed, study inheritance, and develop germplasm.
Develop evaluation methods and identify disease resistance in sunflower germplasm.
Investigate alternatives to genetic disease resistance.
Monitor sunflower pathogen severity in North Central and High Plains areas.
APPROACH
Sunflower germplasm will be developed from crosses with diverse sources such as cultivars, populations, interspecific crosses with wild Helianthus spp., and plant introductions and released to industry after testing for economically important traits and adaptability to U.S. environments.
Gene action controlling important production traits will be investigated using biometrical analyses and heritability determinations.
Sunflower with a lower saturated and mid-oleic level will be developed and inheritance studied, with these traits meeting specifications of the oil industry regarding dietary concerns of consumers of vegetable oil.
Efficient inoculation and disease evaluation methods will be developed and disease occurrence and new pathogens will be monitored and identified.
Disease management options other than genetic resistance will be investigated.
