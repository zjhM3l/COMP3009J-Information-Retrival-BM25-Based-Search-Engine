Ethnic Observances: * Labour Day - Trinidad * Artigas Day - Uruguay * Juneteenth freeing of slaves in Texas (Emancipation) - United States
JUNETEENTH
Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, is the name given to emancipation day by African-Americans in Texas.
On that day in 1865 Union Major Gordon Granger read General Order #3 to the people of Galveston: "The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.
This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.
The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages.
They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere."
Large celebrations on June 19 began in 1866 and continued regularly into the early 20th century.
African-Americans treated this day like the Fourth of July and the celebrations contained similar events.
In the early days, the celebration included a prayer service, speakers with inspirational messages, reading of the emancipation proclamation, stories from former slaves, food, red soda water, games, rodeos and dances.
The celebration of June 19 as emancipation day initially spread from Texas to the neighboring states of Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
In modern times it has also appeared in Alabama, Florida, California, and other states.
