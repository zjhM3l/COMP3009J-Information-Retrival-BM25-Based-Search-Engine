QUESTION: At least four U.S. citizens were stopped right before boarding the plane to Iceland and dozens of more were -- had their ticket canceled by the Icelandair, just because the Chinese President is paying a state visit to Iceland in (inaudible).
And those people's names were found on a so-called list, name list, of Falun Gong practitioners.
So do you agree that those people don't have the right to go to Iceland, to travel to Iceland, just because the Chinese President --
MR. REEKER: Well, I too -- we have also heard these reports.
I would have to really refer to the Government of Iceland for the specifics on them.
We take no position on the beliefs or practices of the Falun Gong members.
Our consistent position is that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals should be respected.
I think in the context of this case, there were five U.S. citizens who had been detained at the airport in Iceland, and we understand they were admitted into Iceland on Wednesday, June the 12th, on condition that they agree to abide by certain rules of conduct while in the country.
And a U.S. Consular Official visited them during their detention.
All were in good health, and there have been no allegations of any mistreatment by Icelandic authorities.
We have asked the Government of Iceland for an official explanation of its actions.
I think Icelandic officials have already stated publicly, that I have seen, that their government took these actions, these steps, as a security precaution for the visit of the President of China, which takes place -- is taking place this week.
There was a June 10th announcement from Iceland's Ministry of Justice that noted that measures were not intended to limit freedom of expression or to prevent peaceful protest, but rather to ensure public order and make it possible for the Icelandic police to ensure the safety of a foreign head of state.
And obviously, as a sovereign state, Iceland has the right to make immigration decisions as it sees fit.
So again, I would refer you to the Government of Iceland for their comments on that.
QUESTION: The second question, a follow-up, is thinking about the name list.
Would you comment -- because sources say that those name list was received from someone in the United States, part of them.
And I'm just --
MR. REEKER: Someone in the United States?
QUESTION: Mm-hmm.
MR. REEKER: I'm not aware that the United States Government has an --
QUESTION: No, not --
MR. REEKER: Okay.
QUESTION: Not --
MR. REEKER: I really couldn't comment.
I don't know anything about a name list.
And again, I would refer you to the Icelandic Government for something that really involves them.
QUESTION: Phil, maybe you've said it, but how long were these people detained?
MR. REEKER: I think it was a day or two.
I don't have -- they were detained on Tuesday, June 11th, by Icelandic authorities at the airport, and they were released on Wednesday the 12th.
QUESTION: May I go back to North Korea, please?
MR. REEKER: Please.
QUESTION: About the asylum incident in Beijing.
Chinese Foreign Ministry official refused to hand -- hand back the detained man to South Korean Embassy.
You said yesterday U.S. was extremely concerned about that.
What do you say at this point?
MR. REEKER: I'd say that we are extremely concerned about that, reports that the Chinese police entered uninvited into the premises of the South Korean Embassy in Beijing.
And as I said yesterday, we regard the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises as a bedrock principle that is essential to the conduct of international relations, and we certainly expect all nations to abide absolutely by their very solemn legal obligations regarding such inviolability under the Vienna Conventions.
So this is something that our Embassy in Beijing is monitoring.
They are aware of that situation.
The matter is being handled, I believe, by the actual governments concerned.
So that's about what I have for you at this point.
QUESTION: Phil, on that, you said yesterday that you weren't aware of the Embassy in Beijing receiving a note that the Chinese Foreign Ministry reportedly sent out asking or telling all foreign embassies to hand over or -- to hand over any North Koreans that they may have, that they may be sheltering in the compounds.
Do you know if the -- has the U.S. Embassy in Beijing received such a notice?
MR. REEKER: I don't know.
We don't have any North Koreans in our Embassy or our consular property, so I don't -- I don't know if we've gotten that.
I can continue to ask.
I just --
QUESTION: And when you do, can you find out what your position would be on the -- if you would accept the request --
MR. REEKER: I don't think we would answer a hypothetical anyway, Matt, but I'm happy to ask if we received a --
QUESTION: No, no, no, it's not -- I'm not hypothetical, I don't think.
It's would you regard such a request as legitimate if it, in fact, were made for a foreign government to say that you have to turn over asylum-seekers in your embassy compound?
MR. REEKER: Again, I don't know if we'll be able to answer it, depending on whether there was actually such a situation or not, but we'll look into that.
