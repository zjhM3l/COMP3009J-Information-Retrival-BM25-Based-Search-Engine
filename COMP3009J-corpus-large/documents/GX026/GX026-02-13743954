pif2as.gif (4771 bytes) Partners In Flight--Research and Monitoring Needs Input Form pif2as.gif (4771 bytes) The purpose of this project is to create a searchable database containing information about all of the research and monitoring needs identified in the PIF State and Physiographic Area Bird Conservation Plans (BCPs).
Although the Input Form will only be accessible to a limited number of people, the Search Form will eventually be accessible to all (scientists interested in potential research projects, managers interested in PIF priorities, PIF Working Group Chairs and Regional Coordinators compiling lists of research/monitoring needs for various reasons, etc.).
In order to make this search work, if a need is identified in more than one plan, it should be entered separately for each.
Please Note: Press Enter Record or Clear Record at bottom of form instead of using the back key of your browser.
Title (required): (Please make this a short description of the research, monitoring, methods or technology problem/question to be addressed; this field is limited to 125 characters.)
_______________________________________________________________________
Pre-Defined Keywords: (Select keywords from this list that apply; this field is limited to 6 words or phrases.
If the keywords for this Need are not in this list, you can provide your own user-defined keyword in field below.
To select more than one keyword/phrase, press the CTRL key down and click left mouse button on each of the keywords you wish to select.
If you want to undo your selection, press the CTRL and click left mouse button on highlighted keywords to be removed.)

User-Defined Keywords: (If the keywords in the pulldown menu do not describe your need, enter descriptive keywords/phrases here.
This field is limited to 6 words or phrases separated by commas (not to exceed a total of 255 characters).
Please try to use the Species Focus field for listing individual species, but the Keyword field can be used to cover groups of species, e.g. raptors, waterfowl, warblers.
You are encouraged to develop broad rather than very specific keywords, keeping in mind the kind of searches that people will do.)
__________________________________________________
Species Focus: (Select species from this list, if applicable - e.g., if this question targets a single species or species suite; limit 6 species.
To select more than one species press the CTRL key down and click left mouse button on each of the species you wish to select.
If you want to undo your selection, press the CTRL and click left mouse button on highlighted species to be removed.)

Bird Conservation Plan (required): (Select the Physiographic Area or State plan in which this need is identified; limit 1.
States are near the end of the list.)

Short Description (required): (Provide a few sentences describing the problem/question.
Please feel free to lift existing language from the plan.)

In identifying the location(s) in which this activity will be conducted below, you are encouraged to think specifically about the need identified in this particular plan rather than more broadly about a larger need that may exist.
We hope to use this database to test whether the BCPs are really identifying these broad issues across the continent by searching to see how many plans identify a particular issue.
