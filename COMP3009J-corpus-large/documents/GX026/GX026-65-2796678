For many amateur radio operators receiving a "CQ", or general call, from an astronaut in space is the thrill of a lifetime.
But for former astronaut Dr. Owen K. Garriott, the thrill was in making a call from space and receiving a response from "hams" down on Earth.
"Ham" is the nickname given to amateur radio operators, a group of hobbyists who enjoy contacting other hams in faraway locations.
Dr. Garriott, who has been a ham for over 40 years, was the first astronaut to take a ham radio into space, pioneering the way for an amateur radio space program that continues to grow.
"It was my good fortune to take the first amateur radio into space on STS-9 in November 1983," Dr. Garriott said.
"In my spare time only, I managed to hold up an antenna to the window and to talk to amateurs on Earth."
Communications between astronauts and people on the ground are normally limited to "official" channels with mission controllers, but Dr. Garriott's initiative has made contact with astronauts available to people around the world.

Dr. Garriott originally proposed the idea of taking a ham radio into space on his first space mission, Skylab 3, but the details weren't worked out in time.
He persisted, though, and finally flew a small hand-held transmitter/receiver aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.
"When in orbit over land, I could make a CQ, which is a general call, and see who responded," Dr. Garriott said.
"I used a well-designed, hand-held antenna, known as a 'cavity antenna', which could be Velcro-ed^Ã¯Â¿Â½ to the window.
It was about 24 inches in diameter and looked somewhat like a large aluminum cake pan.
The transceiver then connected to the antenna."
In addition to the general calls, Dr. Garriott made a few calls to specific Earth-bound hams at prearranged times and dates.
"I had specified particular times and frequencies beforehand," Dr. Garriott said.
"Among others, I was able to speak with the Amateur Radio Club in my hometown of Enid, Oklahoma, with my mom, with Senator Goldwater, and with King Hussein, who was an avid ham."

Since that first voyage into space, NASA has sent ham radios into space on dozens of Shuttle flights, and astronauts have spoken to hams around the world.
"There has been substantial amateur radio activity in space since I first brought one up," Dr. Garriott said.
"There is now a program called SAREX that is allowing for more and more activity."
SAREX, which stands for Space Amateur Radio Experiment, involves schools around the world.
Students dialog with orbiting astronauts about space flight and on-board experiments.
Individual amateur radio operators also get to join the fun, and are eager for contact with the astronauts.
Specially designed shuttle "QSL" cards, which are postcards used by hams to confirm two-way contact or reception of a signal, are among the most prized in a ham's collection -- even to a king.
"(King) Hussein, call letters JY1, regarded his 1983 contact with Owen Garriott, W5LFL, on board Space Shuttle Columbia, as a high point in his amateur radio career," reported David Sumner, Executive Vice President of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in a special bulletin following the death of Jordan's long-time King.

SAREX Shuttle missions will continue this fall, and soon amateur radio will be a permanent part of the International Space Station.
"Shannon Lucid used a ham radio while on MIR," said Dr. Garriott.
"NASA saw how using an amateur radio would be a good thing for astronauts to do in their spare time on the space station."
The Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) program will begin shortly after the Station is permanently manned.
Since astronauts will be staying longer in space while on the Station, there will be more opportunities for ham radio contacts.
Many astronauts are already ham operators, and others plan to qualify just so they can talk to folks from space.
If you are a ham operator, or if your class would like a chance to talk to astronauts in space, come join the team!
The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation, known as AMSAT, and NASA jointly sponsor the SAREX program.

In order to obtain a license, a ham must pass a test about radio theory, rules and regulations, and International Morse Code.
There are three grades of licenses, each at progressively higher levels of proficiency: Technician, General and Amateur Extra.
Any licensed ham can chat with the Shuttle.
Once an amateur has passed the test, the FCC gives the new operator a set of "call letters."
This is the amateur's "name" on the air, just like an AM or FM radio station's call letters.
The first letter indicates the ham's nationality.
In the United States, the first letters are A, K, N, or W. Dr. Garriott's call letters are W5LFL.
There are more than 1.5 million licensed hams worldwide, including more than 400,000 Americans.
