2002 SSI Annual Report Contents Previous Next Glossary __________________________________________________________________ G. RESEARCH ON RELATED TOPICS
The legislative mandate for this report requires inclusion of information about "relevant research on the SSI program by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and others."
Section 1 of this appendix presents information on important research projects undertaken by SSA that have recently been completed.
Section 2 describes major ongoing projects.
Section 3 presents a bibliography of studies that have been conducted by public and private entities regarding SSI payment levels, recipients, and reform proposals.
The bibliography is selective and contains only items published since 1990.

Recently Completed Work
a.
Policy Evaluation of the Effects of the 1996 Welfare Reform Legislation on SSI Benefits for Children with Disabilities
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 substantially tightened the childhood SSI eligibility criteria.
The legislation also required that all SSI children be redetermined based on the adult disability criteria after turning 18 years of age, and that continuing disability reviews be performed every 3 years for children whose disability is expected to improve.
Under contract to SSA, the RAND Corporation has completed a study of the effect of the legislation on SSI caseloads and costs and the impact on the children who lost benefits.
The study provides descriptive and quantitative estimates of the effects of the legislation on the children who were on the rolls prior to the enactment of the legislation through analyses of SSA administrative data and currently available survey data.
Qualitative data were collected through a limited number of case studies of affected children, their families, and service providers in four States (see Inkelas et al. 1999, 2000).
In addition, the study provides estimates of the effect of the legislation on entry into the SSI program, the SSI caseload, and program costs, accounting for both terminations and new allowances (see Rogowski et al. 2002).
The study finds that the long-term effect of the legislation on SSI caseloads and costs is greater than the initial impact.
This result stems from reduced entry into the program due to stricter eligibility rules, greater exits from the program due to continuing disability reviews, and the ongoing impact of the annual age-18 redeterminations.
b. Analyses Using SSA's Model of Financial Eligibility for SSI
Using Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data matched to administrative records, SSA researchers have developed a model of financial eligibility for SSI that has been used to estimate the rate of participation among eligible elderly and the effects of various options to modify the SSI program (see Davies et al. forthcoming).
The model suggests that the rate of participation among eligible elderly was about 63 percent in 1991.
The model was also utilized to simulate the potential effects of several approaches to expand the SSI program to fight poverty among the elderly.
Approaches focusing on incremental changes in the Federal benefit rate, the general income exclusion, and the asset test appear roughly equally effective in reducing the poverty gap among the elderly on a cost-equivalent basis, while two approaches focusing on relaxing the earned income exclusion are less effective.
The financial eligibility model has also been utilized to study eligibility for Medicare buy-in programs (see Rupp and Sears 2000).

Ongoing Research
a.
National Survey of Children with Families
Due to the widely acknowledged shortcomings of existing data sources for evaluating the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and for tracking SSI children unaffected by welfare reform, SSA has undertaken to design and implement a national survey of children with disabilities.
Among the questions the survey is designed to answer are the following: * What is the cost of caring for a disabled child? * What are the uses of SSI benefits? * What alternative sources of care are available to disabled children who lose SSI benefits? * How is quality of life and utilization of medical services impacted by gaining or losing SSI benefits? * What is the impact of receiving childhood SSI benefits on parental labor force participation?
The goal is to collect data that will allow SSA to evaluate future changes to the SSI program that may affect children and to further evaluate the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and their families.
Data collection for the survey will be completed in summer, 2002, and data files are expected in the fall.
b. Evaluation of the State Partnership Initiative Return-to-Work Demonstrations
In the fall of 1998, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education announced the award of 12 SSA cooperative agreements and 6 Rehabilitation Service Administration systems-change grants under State Partnership Initiatives (SPI).
SPI projects are designed to assist States in developing alternative program structures and service delivery systems to increase employment of persons with disabilities who are receiving SSI or SSDI.
Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.
(MPR), under contract to SSA, is designing and testing an evaluation methodology for the SSA SPI projects.
The core evaluation will rely on SSA administrative data and will use appropriate methods to define comparison groups and determine the net impact of SPI interventions on participants.
A supplemental net-outcome evaluation will take advantage of any additional data provided by individual SPI projects.
MPR is testing its evaluation methodology and will provide its final report in September 2002.
c. Evaluation of the Ticket to Work
The evaluation of the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program will examine the following: * Total and net costs of the program, * The impact of the program on beneficiary work outcomes and reliance on SSA benefits, * The individual and service provision characteristics of service providers and provider networks, * The adequacy of incentives for providers to supply services, * The appeal of the program among the eligible population, and * The satisfaction of participants with the program in general.
To the degree possible, the evaluation will utilize information from SSA administrative data and from the Ticket to Work program implementation process.
Such data will be insufficient, however, to cover many of the evaluation topics required under the legislation, particularly the analysis of nonparticipation among eligible beneficiaries.
A significant survey effort will therefore be required to supply the necessary supplemental information to meet these evaluation requirements.
The design of the evaluation is largely complete, and SSA expects to issue a contract to implement the evaluation in fall 2002.
SSA is also holding a technical workshop in May 2002 to obtain advice from outside experts on the adequacy of incentives for providers to supply services to people with significant disabilities.
