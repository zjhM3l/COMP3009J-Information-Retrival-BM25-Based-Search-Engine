Bean Blossom is the site of the annual Bill Monroe Memorial Bluegrass Festival.
This string-music festival was originated in 1967 by Bill Monroe, the father of American bluegrass music.
It has now become the oldest, continuously running annual bluegrass festival in the world.
The multi-day event, held in the natural setting of an outdoor amphitheater on the wooded grounds of the Bill Monroe Memorial Music Park and Campground, features a style of music which is wholly American in origin.
The term "bluegrass music" defines a distinct type of country music; it was named for Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys, which he named in honor of his home state of Kentucky.
