An input device that recognizes and displays handwritten alphanumeric characters within an electronic device display, comprising:
a plurality of adjacent switches arranged in an array, wherein each switch in the array produces, in response to user activation during a handwriting stroke, a respective, different analog voltage; an analog/digital converter that converts a sequence of analog voltage signals produced by a user activating one or more of the switches during the handwriting stroke into a sequence of digital values; and a processor that processes the sequence of digital values, that recognizes an alphanumeric character that corresponds to the handwriting stroke of the user, and that displays the recognized alphanumeric character within the display.
