17 Case Studies
Background

In the Southeast alone, over 500 natural wetlands such as this cyprus strand in Florida receive discharges from POTWs and other point sources.
Natural wetlands (e.g., swamps, bogs, marshes, fens, sloughs, etc.) are being recognized as providing many benefits, including: food and habitat for wildlife; water quality improvement; flood protection; shoreline erosion control; and opportunities for recreation and aesthetic appreciation.
Many of these same benefits have been realized by projects across the country that involve the use of wetlands in wastewater treatment.
Many freshwater, brackish, and saltwater wetlands have inadvertently received polluted runoff and served as natural water treatment systems for centuries.
Wetlands, as waters of the U.S., have been subjected to wastewater discharges from municipal, industrial and agricultural sources, and have received agricultural and surface mine runoff, irrigation return flows, urban stormwater discharges, leachates, and other sources of water pollution.
The actual impacts of such inputs on different wetlands has been quite variable.
However, it has only been during the past few decades that the planned use of wetlands for meeting wastewater treatment and water quality objectives has been seriously studied and implemented in a controlled manner.
The functional role of wetlands in improving water quality has been a compelling argument for the preservation of natural wetlands and in recent years the construction of wetlands systems for wastewater treatment.
A growing number of studies have provided evidence that many wetlands systems are able to provide an effective means of improving water quality without creating problems for wildlife.
However, in some cases evidence has shown a resulting change in wetland community types and a shift to more opportunistic species.
There remain, however, concerns over the possibility of harmful effects resulting from toxic materials and pathogens that may be present in many wastewater sources.
Also, there are concerns that there may be a potential for long-term degradation of natural wetlands due to the addition of nutrients and changes in the natural hydrologic conditions influencing these systems.
At least in part due to such concerns, there has been a growing interest in the use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment.
Constructed wetlands treatment systems are engineered systems that have been designed and constructed to utilize the natural processes involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microbial assemblages to assist in treating wastewater.
They are designed to take advantage of many of the same processes that occur in natural wetlands, but do so within a more controlled environment.
Some of these systems have been designed and operated with the sole purpose of treating wastewater, while others have been implemented with multiple-use objectives in mind, such as using treated wastewater effluent as a water source for the creation and restoration of wetland habitat for wildlife use and environmental enhancement.

A recently expanded Subsurface Flow constructed wetland system serves the small community of Monterey in Highland Co., Virginia.
Constructed wetlands treatment systems generally fall into one of two general categories: Subsurface Flow Systems and Free Water Surface Systems.
Subsurface Flow Systems are designed to create subsurface flow through a permeable medium, keeping the water being treated below the surface, thereby helping to avoid the development of odors and other nuisance problems.
Such systems have also been referred to as "root-zone systems," "rock-reed-filters," and "vegetated submerged bed systems."
The media used (typically soil, sand, gravel or crushed rock) greatly affect the hydraulics of the system.
Free Water Surface Systems, on the other hand, are designed to simulate natural wetlands, with the water flowing over the soil surface at shallow depths.
Both types of wetlands treatment systems typically are constructed in basins or channels with a natural or constructed subsurface barrier to limit seepage.
Constructed wetlands treatment systems have diverse applications and are found across the country and around the world.
While they can be designed to accomplish a variety of treatment objectives, for the most part, Subsurface Flow Systems are designed and operated in a manner that provides limited opportunity for benefits other than water quality improvement.
On the other hand, Free Water Surface Systems are frequently designed to maximize wetland habitat values and reuse opportunities, while providing water quality improvement.
