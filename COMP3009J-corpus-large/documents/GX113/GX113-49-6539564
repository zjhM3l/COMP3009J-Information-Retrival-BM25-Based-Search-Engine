Image Map for Other Links of Interest Section BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE) Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also known as "mad cow disease", is one of several brain-wasting diseases (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies - TSEs) that affect adult cattle.
The disease causes holes to form within the brain cells; this, in turn, leads to a spongy appearance of the brain and a display of erratic behavior.
The incubation period for BSE can be from four to six years long.
BSE was first confirmed in the United Kingdom in 1986.
According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, there have been no cases of BSE in the United States
