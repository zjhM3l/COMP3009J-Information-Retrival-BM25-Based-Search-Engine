Free Water Surface Constructed Wetlands Systems _____________________
"The wide diversity of organisms coupled with the high level of productivity makes a marsh a hot bed of biological activity.
The most striking improvement is the removal of suspended solids.
Suspended solids in the Arcata STP are algae which supply oxygen in their secondary treatment ponds.
These algae solids become entrapped, impacted, and isolated in small quiescent areas around the stems and underwater portions of aquatic plants as the water moves through marshes.
The algal solids in these quiescent areas become food sources for microscopic aquatic animals and aquatic insects.
This predation plays an important part in removing the solids and in moving energy through the food chain in the wetland.
Over time, wetlands continue to separate and deposit suspended solids building deltas comprised of organic matter.
At some point this detrital layer in the bottom of the marsh along with dead aquatic plants may need to be removed.
Based on Arcata's experience this maintenance requirement is not expected until at least 8-10 years of operation at design loads."

Just how do constructed wetlands, in this case free water surface systems, remove pollutants from the wastewater effluent? These systems affect water quality through a variety of natural processes that occur in wetlands.
An explanation of the major processes involved are effectively described by Robert A. Gearheart in a paper contained in the proceedings of a conference on wetlands for wastewater treatment and resource enhancement at Humbolt State University in Arcata, CA, during 1988 ^รยน: Free Water Surface Constructed Wetlands Systems
Dissolved biodegradable material is removed from the wastewater by decomposing microorganisms which are living on the exposed surfaces of the aquatic plants and soils.
Decomposers such as bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes are active in any wetland by breaking down this dissolved and particulate organic material to carbon dioxide and water.
This active decomposition in the wetland produces final effluents with a characteristic low dissolved oxygen level with low pH in the water.
The effluent from a constructed wetland usually has a low BOD as a result of this high level of decomposition.
Aquatic plants play an important part in supporting these removal processes.
Certain aquatic plants pump atmospheric oxygen into their submerged stems, roots, and tubers.
Oxygen is then utilized by the microbial decomposers attached to the aquatic plants below the level of the water.
Plants also play an active role in taking up nitrogen, phosphorus, and other compounds from the wastewater.
This active incorporation of nitrogen and phosphorus can be one mechanism for nutrient removal in a wetland.
Some of the nitrogen and phosphorus is released back into the water as the plants die and decompose.
In the case of nitrogen much of the nitrate nitrogen can be converted to nitrogen gas through denitrification processes in the wetland."

This site is a popular spot for local schools to tour and study wetlands ecology.
One of the multi-purpose elements of the project is public education and recreation.
Free Water Surface constructed wetlands treatment systems and related natural systems used as a part of treatment systems have been successfully used across the country.
Many of these systems have been designed and operated to not only improve water quality, but to also provide high quality wetland habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife.
Many of the systems are operated as wildlife refuges or parks as well as a part of wastewater treatment, reuse or disposal systems.
In some cases these systems also provide an area for public education and recreation in the form of birding, hiking, camping, hunting, etc.
The operational experience and research results reported to date suggest that the growing interest in managing constructed wetlands systems as a part of wastewater treatment and habitat creation/maintenance efforts offers considerable opportunities for the future.
The technical feasibility of implementing such projects has been clearly demonstrated by full-scale systems in various parts of the country.
However, it is also clear that there is still a long way to go before such systems will be considered for routine use.
While existing projects have demonstrated the potential for future use of constructed wetlands systems, there is an obvious need for further study to improve our understanding of the internal components of these systems, their responses and interactions, in order to allow for more optimum project design, operation and maintenance.

Case Studies
Descriptions of 17 carefully selected projects located in 10 states (see Figure 1) are provided that help describe the full range of opportunity to treat and reuse wastewater effluents that exist across the country today.
They include systems involving both constructed and natural wetlands, habitat creation and restoration, and the improvement of municipal wastewater effluents, urban stormwater and river water quality.
Many of the projects received Construction Grants funding and several were built on Federal lands.
All experience extensive wildlife usage, some providing critical refuge for rare plants and animals.
Several are relatively new projects while others have been operating for 15-20 years.
There are projects involving as few as 15 acres and several with more than 1,200 acres of wetland habitat.
Among those described in this document are projects which have received major awards such as the ASCE Award of Engineering Excellence, the ACEC Grand Conceptor Award, and the Council Award, the ESA Special Recognition Award, and the Ford Foundation Award for Innovation in a Local Government Project.
The case studies demonstrate that wastewater can be effectively treated, reused and recycled with free water surface wetland systems in an environmentally sensitive way.
They also demonstrate that wastewater treatment and disposal can be effectively integrated into recreational, educational, and wildlife habitat creation/wetland restoration efforts so as to enhance the value of a citys capital investment in wastewater treatment facilities.
Greater recognition of these model projects may help lead to projects of high quality being developed in the future.
