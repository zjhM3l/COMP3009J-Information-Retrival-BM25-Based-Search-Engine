Attention: Foreign Policy Aids and Interns
Dear Colleague,
We would like to draw your attention to an invitation you received for a screening of the award-winning documentary, Good Kurds, Bad Kurds.
This event is co-sponsored by Amnesty International USA, Arms Sales Monitoring Project, Center for Defense Information, Fund for Constitutional Government and Washington Kurdish Institute in conjunction with the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.
The film will be shown on Thursday, June 22nd at 5:00 p.m. in room B-369 Rayburn House Office Building with a reception immediately following.
The film, Good Kurds, Bad Kurds: No Friends but the Mountains, probes an issue largely ignored by the mainstream media: the Turkish military's violations of the human rights of Kurds in southeast Turkey.
Kevin McKiernan, the film's director/producer, will be present to answer questions following the movie.
This film was awarded the Human Rights Prize at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival 2000 and the Best Documentary at the Atlanta Film and Video Festival 2000.
Turkey's twenty million Kurds are not officially recognized by the Turkish government as a distinct people.
Education and broadcasting in the Kurdish language are banned by the Turkish government.
The Turkish military has a long history of human rights abuses against the Kurdish minority.
It has waged a 15-year war against Kurdish guerrillas who are fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
More than 37,000 people on both sides have been killed in the conflict.
We hope that you will join us for this movie screening and reception.
If you have any questions please contact Jeannette Windon (Rep. John Porter) at x5-4835.
