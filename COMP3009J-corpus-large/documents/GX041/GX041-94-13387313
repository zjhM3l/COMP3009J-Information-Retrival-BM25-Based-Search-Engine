Interactive Mapping (Population/Demographics and Crime)
The SPIDR TractMapper is provided by DPD as another option for accessing and exploring population and demographic data, as well as crime data and the location of City facilities and services.
Population and demographic data and information are available on DPD's Population and Demographics site.
Additionally, crime data are available on SPD's website.
There are two versions of the TractMapper depending on the base layer of interest.
TractMapper 1990 uses census tracts from 1990 as the base map layer while TractMapper 2000 uses the tracts from Census 2000.
Note about web browser requirements and alternative formats for accessibility: The TractMapper will work only with: * Internet Explorer 5.0+ or MSN Explorer * Show Pictures enabled * VML (Vector Markup Language) installed
Over time we will expand support for other browsers, browser versions, and platforms, as best as possible.
This work is a pilot project to explore the use of new web technology with potential applicability to interactive mapping.
So, while we continue to work on expanding accessibility to these data in this interactive format, please note that the data contained here can be accessed in alternative formats at the sites listed below.
Get Microsoft Internet Explorer
If you do not have Internet Explorer version 5.0 or greater installed on your computer, you can get it by visiting the Microsoft download site.
Choose TractMapper Version: [Census 2000 Tracts] [BUTTON Input]
Want a glimpse of what you can do with this TractMapper application? Check out the help guide for the AxioMap software, the underlying software used to deliver the TractMapper application.

Interactive Mapping (City Real Property and General Purpose)
The City of Seattle Real Property Finder is provided by Seattle Public Utilities and the Fleets 
This site can be used to display the location of City properties (owned, leased, etc.).
Other data layers, such as tax parcels, can be displayed at a larger scale.
Additionally, you can obtain information about parcels, City property management areas, and general zoning by use of the "identify" function.
Note: You can enter an address or select a neighborhood to create your initial map and then turn off the City property data layer.
Then, you could use this site as a general-purpose interactive mapping tool for the Seattle area (with access to general tax parcel and zoning information, if desired).

* American Factfinder -- demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
* Demographic Data Viewer -- tool provided by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center at NASA-funded CIESIN (Columbia).
* Maps on Demand -- US EPA site that offers online access to environmental data and other data layers.
* TIGER Map Server -- Census Bureau's online mapping site with 1990 Census data and 1998 TIGER/Line geographic data.

Notes on technology behind the TractMapper: 1.
Internet Explorer version 5.X supports the use of Vector Markup Language (VML) to deliver interactive vector graphics from a web server to a web client (your computer/web browser).
VML is an application of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) that can be interpreted by this browser.
XML promises to improve the management and delivery of content on the World Wide Web.
Currently, the only web browser to fully support VML is IE 5.X.
There are other emerging formats for delivery of interactive vector graphics, such as the SVG (scalable vector graphics) format currently under evaluation and specification for use on the WWW (W3C candidate recommendation as of Nov. 2, 2000).
This format may require the use of a free browser plug-in (e.g., Adobe's SVG Viewer) for interpretation.
Eventually, it may be supported natively by web browsers.
We will continue to monitor technology developments in this area with the goal of maintaining this resource with the latest available technologies that are effective, cost-effective, and widely available.
2.
AxioMap software (vers. 1.2.7) is used to deliver this mapping application via the WWW. AxioMap stands for Application of XML for Interactive Online Mapping.
AxioMap was developed by ELZA Research and is now maintained and distributed by LandV.
For more information about this software please visit the ELZA Research/LandV web site.
