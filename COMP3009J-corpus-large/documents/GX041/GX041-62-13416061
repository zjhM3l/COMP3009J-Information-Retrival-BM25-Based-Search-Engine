I. 4^th Quarter 
The team reviewed the preliminary data that Don provided.
The team agreed that we wanted to format the data to provide the following information:
Â· Average score for each question
Â· Range or variation of quarterly averages for each question
Â· Slope of the averages for each question
Â· A comparison of the current quarter with the same quarter the previous quarter.
In addition the team agreed that for presentation purposes there should be a graph (page) for each question which included:
Â· A line graph of the historical quarter data
Â· The slope line
Â· A concise narrative or analysis points related to the question and ratings.
II.
Comment Card Text Comments
The team followed up on previous meeting discussion about analyzing comment card narrative or text comments.
The team is interested in categorizing, sorting or labeling comments as they are entered into the master spreadsheet (probably by entering new columns for sorting purposes).
It was noted that this would only sort hard copy comment cards and not electronic cards.
The team decided that comments related to "Did any of our staff make your visit especially successful?" would simply be sorted into positive or negative.
We will report a raw number count of comments and also list staff members that received positive comment(s).
Comments related to "Are there additional services or improvements you would like to see?" would be sorted into the following categories:
Â· Services
Â· Resources
Â· Environment
Â· Staff
Â· Support Services
Â· Technology
Â· Job Referral/Placement
Â· Misc/Other
III.
Data Display
The team reviewed the mock up for the public data display that Brian provided.
The team continues to support the idea of a single page display showing a rating scale for two or maybe three questions.
The questions/rating responses can change over time and I the team decided to start by displaying the "Ideal.." question, "Got what I came for" and "Staff is courteous" if three questions are shown or the "Ideal.." question and "Staff is courteous" questions if only two questions are displayed.
Brian will prepare new mock ups to be reviewed at the next meeting.
IV.
Mystery Shopper Update
The Whatcom Management Team is deciding how to share Mystery Shopper information.
The CQI team will consider this issue after the Whatcom Management Team makes its decisions.
V. Focus Groups
There is no longer a need to conduct a focus group on WTS.
There is the possibility of a future need for a focus group related to the Tour-of-Services which would be conducted with the Whatcom CUT.
