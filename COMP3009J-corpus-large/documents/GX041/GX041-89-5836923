Representative George Miller and California Democrats Call for Full Investigation Into Enron's Hand in California Energy Crisis
Thursday, May 9, 2002
WASHINGTON - Along with 29 California Democrats, U.S. Representative George Miller (D-Martinez) sent a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee today calling for a full investigation into the business conduct and pricing practices of Enron Corp. in California and the West during 2000 and 2001.
"
Recently produced internal memoranda show that Enron may have systematically gamed the energy trading system, using techniques that added to electricity costs and congestion on transmission lines.
The documents also describe falsified power-delivery schedules, the submission of false information to the state, and the effective increasing of costs to all market participants by knowingly increasing the congestion costs
," the letter stated.
"There is a huge amount of evidence pointing to illegal business practices by Enron and other companies that cheated Californians out of billions of dollars.
The time has come to provide some answers."
said Representative George Miller, Ranking Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee.
"Since last summer, when families were overcharged as much as $9 billion dollars for power, the California Delegation has been calling for a full investigation into whether Enron manipulated California's energy market."
Coined "Death Star" and "Get Shorty," the internal Enron memos describe plans for elaborate schemes to deliberately manipulate California's energy market and force consumers to pay exorbitant energy prices.
Federal regulators released these documents Monday.
"Enron has proved to be the "death star" - the evil empire that worked up devious plans to defraud California energy consumers last summer, rob thousands of employees of their retirement nest-eggs this year, and spent millions on lobbyists to gain access to this Administration," said Representative Miller.
Miller and 23 other members of the California Delegation are still waiting for a response to a similar request they made for a full investigation in February to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
"I cannot imagine why the leadership of the Committee has been completely unresponsive to our concerns that energy giants are cheating our constituents," said Miller.
