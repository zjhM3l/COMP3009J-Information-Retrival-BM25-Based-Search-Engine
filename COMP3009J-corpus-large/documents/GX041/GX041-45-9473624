SUCH IDENTIFICATION CARD SHALL BE RENEWED ANNUALLY AS LONG AS THE INDIVIDUAL CONTINUES TO PRACTICE PHARMACY.
Expiration of the Current Identification Card
(A)
All pharmacist identification cards expire on September 15th of each year.
(B)
When proper and complete application for a renewal identification card has been made before the September 15th deadline, and the processing and issuance of such card requires time beyond that date, a pharmacist may continue to practice with his/her previous card until the new identification card is received.
Conversely, when proper and complete application has not been made before September 15th, the previous identification card lapses and the pharmacist is not legally licensed to actively engage in the practice of pharmacy in this state.

The CEUs must be obtained on or after July first of the year that is three years prior to the year in which evidence of the C.P.E. is required for identification card renewal.
Beginning in 2004, the CEUs must be obtained on or after March first of the year that is three years prior to the year in which evidence of the C.P.E. is required for identification card renewal (e.g.-in 2004: on or after March 1, 2001).
(c)
Ohio's C.P.E. requirement is 6.0 CEUs.
At least 0.3 CEUs of that total must be in Ohio Board-approved Jurisprudence (program numbers must end in 03); the remaining CEUs may be in any subject (program numbers must end in 01, 02, 03, or 04).
SECTION II - Alternative Methods - Statement [see SAMPLE REPORT FORM B]
For use by Out-Of-State Pharmacists in States With Mandatory C.P.E.
(a)
Ohio registered pharmacists who hold a current license in states where continuing education is mandatory, and who do not practice pharmacy in Ohio, may renew their Ohio identification card by verifying on their C.P.E. report form that they have a current and valid pharmacist license in that state and have met the C.P.E. requirements of that state.
SECTION III - Alternative Methods - Specialty Certification [see SAMPLE REPORT FORM C]
For use by Pharmacists Certified in Board-Approved Specialty Certification Programs
(a)
Ohio registered pharmacists who have met the requirements of an Ohio Board-approved pharmacy practice specific specialty certification program may satisfy the C.P.E. requirements, except for the 0.3 CEUs of Ohio Board-approved jurisprudence, by verifying on their C.P.E. report form that they are currently certified in a certification program.
At a minimum, such pharmacy practice specific specialty certification programs shall consist of:
(i)
Periodic re-certification examinations;
(ii)
Documentation by the certification program that the
pharmacist is currently certified by the program;
(iii)
Other requirements as determined by the Board.
(b)
Pharmacists who choose to meet their C.P.E. requirements in this manner are still required to provide evidence of having completed at least 0.3 CEUs of Ohio Board-approved C.P.E. in Jurisprudence.
(B)
Item (3) above is only required of pharmacists who have to show evidence of having continued their pharmacy education at intervals not to exceed three years.
Unless the pharmacist can use an alternative method [see Section II and Section III above], evidence of 6.0 CEUs of approved C.P.E. shall be submitted by the due date indicated on the C.P.E. report form.
At least 0.3 CEUs of those required for renewal must be obtained in Ohio Board-approved programs in Jurisprudence.
(1)
Each Ohio registered pharmacist has been assigned to one of three groups.
Each year one of the groups is required to show evidence of having obtained the required C.P.E.
A pharmacist may determine the year in which he/she will be required to report C.P.E. by referring to the third digit of their eight-digit identification number and the following schedule:
Ohio R.Ph. No. 03-1-XXXXX will report August 1, 2004
[except those newly registered between 08/01/2003 and 07/31/2004 will report

[except those newly registered between 08/01/2002 and 07/31/2003 will report
for the first time on August 1, 2006, then every three years thereafter]
(2)
Keep all certificates and other documented evidence of participation which have been issued for approved CEUs for a period of one year following the year in which evidence was required for renewal.
The only time the Board will request the original documents or certificates of participation is when the Board is conducting an audit of the report forms, when the pharmacist identification card has lapsed, or when a question arises as to whether or not a mistake has been made on a report form (e.g.-wrong program number or amount of credits for a particular program).
PHARMACISTS ARE ADVISED THAT AUDITS ARE BEING CONDUCTED ANNUALLY AND THEY ARE CAUTIONED TO KEEP ALL C.P.E.
RECORDS IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 4729-7-03(A) OF THE OHIO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE.
(3)
A pharmacist engaged in an occupation other than the practice of pharmacy must meet the C.P.E. requirements in order to maintain his/her pharmacist identification card.
Renewing/Reinstating A Lapsed Identification Card
(A)
If a registrant does not provide ALL of the required documents for renewal, his/her identification card cannot legally be renewed and will lapse on September 15th of the year in which such documents are required.
A pharmacist whose identification card has lapsed MAY NOT engage in the active practice of pharmacy in Ohio until he/she has a valid and current identification card.
(1)
When an identification card has lapsed for less than sixty days, the identification card may be reinstated anytime prior to November 15th of the year in which the identification card lapsed by submitting the required application and check or money order in the amount of $97.50.
(2)
When an identification card has lapsed for more than sixty days but less than three years, the identification card may be reinstated by submitting the required application and check or money order in the amount of $135.00.
(3)
In addition to (1) or (2) above, if required to show evidence of continuing pharmacy education (C.P.E.), the C.P.E. report form listing approved programs taken within the three years immediately preceding the actual date of application must be submitted with the ORIGINAL Certificates of Participation documenting the experiences reported.
All required documents must be properly completed, signed, and dated.

All required documents must be properly completed, signed, and dated.
(B)
Any individual whose license was not renewed because of service in the armed forces of the United States may be granted a renewal of such license at the usual cost upon presentation of a renewal application accompanied by satisfactory evidence of honorable discharge or separation under honorable conditions within six months of such discharge, if not otherwise disqualified because of mental or physical disability.
The renewal application must be accompanied by a C.P.E.
Report Form showing the approved continuing pharmacy education taken within the three years immediately preceding the actual date of application and the original Certificates of Participation documenting these experiences.
Inactive Registration Status
(A)
Ohio does not have an "inactive" status for pharmacists.
The renewal requirements apply only to a pharmacist's identification card to actively engage in the practice of pharmacy in Ohio and have no effect on the licensure of an Ohio pharmacist.
Failure to renew the identification card does not revoke the Certificate of Licensure (R.Ph.) but lapses the privilege to actively engage in pharmacy practice in Ohio.
(B)
When an identification card to actively engage in the practice of pharmacy in the state of Ohio lapses, the individual's "current" status code is removed from the data processing computer that prepares for distribution all renewal applications, labels for newsletters, news releases, and publications for the Board.
In order to continue receiving newsletters, news releases, and publications from the Board, the individual may request to be placed on the Board's "Sunshine Notice Mailing List".
The cost for this service is $25.00 per fiscal year (July 1 to June 30 or any part thereof), and may be renewed prior to the beginning of each fiscal year.
Except for renewal applications, all mailings can be found on the Board's Web site (www.state.oh.us/pharmacy/) free of charge.
You must contact the Board office to obtain a renewal application.
(C)
In order to reciprocate an Ohio license to another state, the individual must be licensed in Ohio by examination and possess an active and current identification card.
General Information
(A)
Applicants who submit an application and fail to qualify for renewal shall have their application rejected and shall forfeit the fee.
(B)
A pharmacist may reciprocate a license only from a state in which the license was obtained by examination.
(C)
Each pharmacist to whom an identification card or renewal identification card has been issued shall immediately sign the identification card.
(D)
Each pharmacist shall have his/her identification card or renewal identification card on his/her person while engaged in the practice of pharmacy.
(E)
Every pharmacist who changes his/her mailing address shall notify the Board of Pharmacy, in writing, of the new address within 30 days after the effective date of such change.
(F)
Every pharmacist who changes his/her place of employment shall notify the Board of Pharmacy, in writing, of the address of the principal place where they practice their profession, within 30 days, after they have commenced such practice and have caused their certificate of licensure to be conspicuously displayed in such place as required under Section 4729.12 of the Ohio Revised Code.
