People Smugglers Trying to Use Planes, Says Australian Minister Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Canberra, Australia, March 31, 2003 More people smugglers in Indonesia have been trying to sneak illegal immigrants into Australia via planes, says Australia's Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.
But he is quoted as saying that "there is no evidence in terms of the unauthorized air arrivals that we see that has been successful."
In 2001, the Australian government began using its navy to pick up boat people before they reached Australia.
The effort has been highly successful: there have been no smuggler boats detected; before 2001, some 8,000 boat people reached Australian shores in a period of two years.
According to Ruddock, 224 asylum seekers arrived illegally by air in Australia in 2003; in 2002, the number was 1,193.

Frenzied Machete Attacks Are the Punishment of Choice for the Secret Mobster of the Triads Part 3 from a series Deadly Venom of the Snakeheads; Gangs of Scotland By Richard Elias and Andrew Walker, Daily Record, March 18, 2003 Chinese Triads operating in Scotland -- such as the 14K, Wo Sing Wo and Sui Fong -- are growing more violent in recent years, and many of their "foot soldiers" are illegal Chinese immigrants.
Compounding the problem, according to this report, is that the illegal immigrants arrive in the United Kingdom without documentation, which British authorities must have before the illegal aliens can be expelled.
British police must release the illegal immigrants while authorities apply to the Chinese Embassy in London for duplicate papers.
The process can take weeks or even months, leaving plenty of time for the illegal immigrants to "disappear."
Chinese Triads are making deep inroads into many aspects of organized crime in Scotland, and there are reports that some prominent Chinese business leaders in Scotland are Triad members, according to this report.
Police in Glasgow have established a specialist south-east Asian intelligence desk to deal with the growing problem of Triad crime.
Comic Book Discourages Migration By Susan Ferriss, Cox News Service, Dateline Santa Maria Tepantlali, Mexico, published in The Washington Times, March 18, 2003 The State office for Attention to Migrants in Mexico's southern Oaxaca state has published a 20-page comic book designed to discourage illegal immigration.
What Are You Betting When You Migrate, Oaxacan? is based on true stories that are blended to provide a cautionary tale featuring heroes, villains, tearful mothers, grieving widows and sage village elders.
Despite a healthy tourism industry, Oaxaca has many poor among its 3.5 million population.
About 2 million people of Oaxacan origin live in the United States; migration has emptied many of Oaxaca's villages of their young men.
Last year, 24 Oaxacans died attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexican border.
Aida Ruiz, director of Oaxaca's migrant office is quoted as saying: "We came up with the comic book because we wanted to demystify the idea that everything goes great for the migrant.
It's very true that some do quite well.
But for others, there is a big price."
Plans are in the works to translate the comic book, which is currently available only in Spanish, into some of Oaxaca's main indigenous languages.
Jail for Florida Farm Bosses The Guardian, March 17, 2003 There have been six federal prosecutions for slavery in the Florida agricultural industry in the past five years, according to this report.
Many of the workers involved were illegal immigrants who owed money to their smugglers and were made to work for months, sometimes years, to pay their debts.
All the while they were charged for lodging and food and threatened with violence if they attempted to escape.
Three contractors convicted last year of slavery, extortion and firearms offences were jailed for 30 years and forfeited assets worth $3 million.
A south Florida tomato grower was convicted in 1999 and jailed for three years for keeping 30 people in isolated swampland near Immokalee and forcing them to work.
In 1997, three contractors were jailed for 15 years each for forcing 400 workers who owed smuggling money to work under the watch of armed guards for 10-12 hour days and $20 dollars a week.
Vietnamese Boat People Lured to Flee with "Crime Pays" Story By George W. Russell, South China Morning Post, Dateline Hanoi, March 16, 2003 People smugglers are telling would-be Vietnamese "refugees" that a jail term in Hong Kong will lead, upon their release, to a Hong Kong government cash handout equal to U.S.$673 and permanent residency.
Vietnamese officials arrested 36 people on two small boats about to leave Haiphong, a port city that has long been a traditional departure point for illegal immigrants.
Their smuggler, Nguyen Ngoc Sang, had told them that they should commit a crime upon reaching Hong Kong so they would be sent to prison.
Thu Huong Nguyen-Vo, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied boat people cases is quoted as saying: "To less informed Vietnamese, the story might not seem so incredible.
They may think there may be companies in Hong Kong trying to circumvent (legal) channels...to get cheap labor imported."
Fast Fed Nails ID Ring By John Marzulli, New York Daily News, March 14, 2003 Customs agent Edward Carey pulled over a vehicle driven by "suspicious characters" carrying more than $3 million worth fake Social Security and green cards.
The two Mexican illegal immigrants arrested were part of a ring operating in Queens, New York.
John Varrone, a special agent in charge at the Department of Homeland Security is quoted as saying: "The individuals who buy false documents are involved in crime, as we learned from September 11, where three of the terrorists had forged documents."
Investigators will be tracking down the ring's customers.
Jobs Training Leaves Gap at Garment Factories By Daisy Hernandez, The New York Times, March 13, 2003 Many long-time workers are leaving the garment factories of Chinatown for paid job-training classes they hope will lead to better-paying jobs.
"Chinatown's garment factories are already reeling from the export of work to overseas factories, fashion industry problems and the difficulties of manufacturing in New York City," Hernandez writes.
The September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center also hurt Chinatown businesses.
In response, a relief organization called The September 11 Fund was established.
It makes paid training in fields like hotel hospitality, truck driving and home health care available to some 1,500 workers who lost their jobs or income because of the attacks .
Dislocated workers who qualify get a weekly stipend of $300 for 25 to 35 hours of training a week for three months.
That is about the same or more than garment factory workers make.
Editor's note: Chinatown's garment industry has provided attractive job opportunities to many Chinese legal and illegal immigrants.

Illegal Immigration, Drug Trafficking a Problem on Reservation Associated Press Newswires, Dateline Tucson, Arizona, March 10, 2003 Native Americans living on the Tohono O'odham Nation reservation are trying to get federal funds to help them deal with illegal immigration.
The reservation shares a 75-mile border with Mexico, and on any given day, some 1,500 illegal immigrants use the reservation to sneak into the United States.
Drug dealers operate there as well.
Tribal officials say they don't have the police services to deal with the onslaught of illegal immigrants and drug dealers, which is polluting their lands, instilling fear in some residents and corrupting others.
Foreign Born Population at Record High, Though Growth Rate Slows By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press, Dateline Washington, March 9, 2003 The foreign-born population in the United States has reached a record high -- about 32.5 million as of March 2002, according to a Census Bureau estimate.
Foreign-born persons represent about 11.5 percent of the total 282.1 million U.S. population.
A faltering U.S. economy and the repercussions of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks may have reduced the influx of the foreign-born.
About 1.2 million people arrived in the United States during the 12 months ending March 2002; 2.4.
million the previous year.
See the Census Bureau's report, The Foreign-Born Population in the United States: March 2002 (P20-539)
IOM Calls for an End to Violence Against Migrant Women and Trafficking IOM No. 857, Dateline Geneva, March 7, 2003 The International Organization of Migration (IOM), in honoring International Women's Day, called for an end to violence against migrant women and the trafficking of women and children.
According to IOM's World Migration Report 2003, almost 50 percent of the world's 175 million migrants are women.
In some areas women make up an even greater percentage: Sri Lankan women working overseas represent 65 percent of all Sri Lankan migrant workers; Filipino women account for 70 percent of all Filipino migrant workers.
But with greater mobility for women comes greater exposure to forced labor, sexual exploitation and violence, the report says.
Women are also more likely to accept jobs with dangerous working conditions and lower wages.

Health Care for Illegal Aliens Draining Tax Funds Says Federation For American Immigration Reform U.S. Newswire, Dateline Washington, March 4, 2003 Senators Jeff Bingaman (Democrat of New Mexico) and John McCain (Republican of Arizona) have introduced the Federal Responsibility for Immigrant Health Act, S. 2449, which would require the federal government to reimburse state and local governments for providing health care services to undocumented immigrants.
The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) told Congress March 4 that in 2000, some $190 million -- about 25 percent -- of uncompensated costs for hospitals located on the U.S. southwest border were for the treatment of illegal immigrants.
Federal law requires U.S. hospitals to provide emergency treatment for anyone needing it.
But the huge unpaid costs run up by illegal immigrants have led many hospitals to cut back on staffing and services and to increase rates; some hospitals have been forced to close.
Immigration Naturalization Service's Duties Fall to Homeland Agency By Michelle Mittelstadt, The Dallas Morning News, Dateline Washington, March 1, 2003 On March 1, the old Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was formerly part of the U.S. Justice Department, became the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), part of the new Department of Homeland Security.
BCIS will deal with citizenship, naturalization, and work permit issues.
INS's enforcement personnel will be reassigned either to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, which will be responsible for border security, or the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which will enforce immigration laws within the U.S. interior.
