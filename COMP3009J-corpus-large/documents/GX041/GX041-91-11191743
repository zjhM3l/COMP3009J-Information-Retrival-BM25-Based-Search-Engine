Over time, this leads to osteoarthritis, an irreversible condition.
The hip and knee are especially vulnerable to osteoarthritis because they play a part in most everything we do.
Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise and heat treatments can help ease the pain, stiffness and swelling of osteoarthritis, there may come a time when those treatments fail to bring relief.
Who needs surgery? Some signs that it may be time to consider a hip or knee replacement, called arthroplasty, include: [arrowred2.gif] night pain [arrowred2.gif]
But younger people who have sports-related injuries or other accidents may also benefit.
What happens before surgery? If you need arthroplasty, youll be asked to get pre-op tests to prevent or minimize complications.
What happens during surgery? Both knee and hip arthroplasty are usually done under local anesthesia.
During a knee replacement, the worn cartilage and bone are removed and resurfaced with metal and plastic.
During a hip replacement, the hip joint is replaced with a metal ball and the socket is resurfaced with metal and plastic.
When does rehabilitation begin? Soon after surgery, a physical therapist will help you perform exercises that strengthen the joint and increase the range of motion.
Your knee will be placed in a machine that will bend the knee for you.
A patient-controlled pump will allow you to administer pain medication so that you are comfortable.
A walker or crutches will help you get around.
Rehabilitation will continue after your short hospital stay with physical therapy sessions three or four times a week for about six weeks.
Three weeks after surgery, your doctor will remove your sutures and monitor your progress during follow-up exams.
X-rays taken during these checkups can alert your VA medical team to any problems when they are still highly treatable.
What are the risks? Infection is the main risk of surgery, but antibiotics help lower that risk.
To prevent blood clots from developing in the calf, patients must inject blood thinners daily for three weeks after surgery.
In hip replacement, there is a risk of dislocation (slippage of the joint out of the socket).
But patients learn the dos and donts that will help them avoid dislocation.
The road to recovery People who have arthroplasty usually drive again within six weeks, but full recovery takes two to three months.
At that point, the advantages will be clear.
The surgery will take away your pain, let you walk normally without a limp and without any aids, like crutches or a cane, and help you get back to your usual activities.
If you have any questions about hip or knee replacement or think you or a loved one might need arthroplasty, talk to your VA healthcare provider.
