TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY 1701 NORTH CONGRESS AVENUE AUSTIN, TEXAS 78701 F OREWORD
I n 1990, when the state plan for the education of gifted students was adopted by the Texas State Board of Education, the mandate to identify and serve these students was just beginning.
That plan was designed to provide program guidance and to assure that all students had the opportunity to be fairly and accurately assessed for advanced level services.
A new Texas state plan was adopted by the State Board of Education in November 1996, and built on the first effort, taking districts and campuses to the next level of program implementation: refining existing services and creating additional curricular options that lead to exceptionally high levels of student performance.
The 1996 plan was designed to accomplish the two requirements that are included in Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code.
First, the acceptable column of each section of the plan is to be used as the basis of program accountability.
The indicators in this column reflect those activities that are included in the District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) review process.
The second requirement of the law is that the state plan serve as a guide for the improvement of program services.
This task is accomplished through the second and third columns of each section, which indicate recognized and exemplary levels of commitment on the part of district and campus personnel.
These activities, which are neither mandated nor proscribed, represent methods that educators and community members may decide to use to improve services for students.
Updates of promising practices will continue to supplement these indicators so that districts and campuses have a comprehensive set of alternatives that can be implemented to improve student performance and meet the state goal that is a part of this plan.
Districts that have successfully implemented the second and/or third columns of each section throughout the district, or in large districts through a vertical team of campuses K-12, now have the opportunity to be recognized for their excellence by applying for state recognition of their gifted program services as recognized or exemplary through a process called "DEC+".
Texas faces many formidable tasks as we enter the twenty-first century.
Success in meeting those responsibilities can be achieved only if all Texas students are educated to their maximum capabilities.
By focusing on the goal of this plan that gifted students develop "innovative products and performances that are advanced in relation to students of similar age, experience, or environment" we can assure that Texas meets the future with confidence that all its students have been challenged to work at the highest levels.
It is hoped that this state plan will continue to assist districts in meeting their obligations to gifted students.
Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code requires that the State Board of Education periodically update a state plan for the education of gifted and talented students to guide school districts in establishing and improving programs for identified students.
This revised addition of the plan is being published to reflect changes passed by the State Board of Education in February 2000.
The development of this plan in 1990 and 1996 was a group effort with input coming from local district educators, regional service center personnel, and from the general public.
This input continues to be very important and useful as we periodically revise the plan.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students continues to be recognized throughout the nation as a model for designing quality program services that meet the needs of advanced and gifted learners.
With your continued commitment and dedication, we will maintain quality program services in Texas and our plan will continue to serve as the archetype for others.

18 vii OVERVIEW hroughout the United States, there has been a call for America's students to master more complex skills and to demonstrate understanding of more sophisticated content.
In response, states throughout the country have increased their expectations for student performance.
However, while basic competencies are being raised, often there is little done to enhance services for more advanced learners.
National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent, published by the United States Department of Education in 1993, notes that, "Most American students are encouraged to finish high school and earn good grades.
But students are not asked to work hard or master a body of challenging knowledge or skills.
The message society often sends to students is to aim for academic adequacy, not academic excellence (p.1)."
To assure that this trend is reversed in Texas, the State Board of Education has adopted numerous incentives that encourage districts to support services that go beyond the minimum and that meet the needs of gifted learners.
In order to express its commitment to high level learning opportunities for all students, the Texas State Board of Education adopts the following as its goal for services for gifted learners.
T STATE GOAL FOR SERVICES FOR GIFTED STUDENTS Students who participate in services designed for gifted students will demonstrate skills in self-directed learning, thinking, research, and communication as evidenced by the development of innovative products and performances that reflect individuality and creativity and are advanced in relation to students of similar age, experience, or environment.
High school graduates who have participated in services for gifted students will have produced products and performances of professional quality as part of their program services.
According to Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code, the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students forms the basis of program accountability for state mandated services for gifted/talented students.
The plan, then, is developed to be compatible with the Texas accountability system.
"Acceptable" performance measures are included for five areas of program performance.
This level reflects those actions that are included in either state law or rule.
However, some districts, in collaboration with the communities they serve, will provide more comprehensive services.
To offer some guidance to those districts or campuses, examples of "recognized" and "exemplary" performance are included in the plan.
While these actions are not mandated by the state, they provide viable targets that local district educators seeking excellence, both for their district and for their students, may strive to attain.
In all cases, those activities in the "recognized" column include and build on those actions included in the "acceptable" column.
In turn, "exemplary" actions build on those that merit a "recognized" designation.
Providing comprehensive services to advanced and gifted learners will be a challenge to districts.
To assist them in their work, the Texas Education Agency will: implement and monitor any state and/or federal legislation designed to provide educational opportunities for gifted/talented students; refine and implement a system that provides recognition for districts and/or campuses that attain "recognized" and "exemplary" status as indicated in this plan; develop materials designed to assist districts in the development of model assessment procedures and program options; facilitate partnerships among parents, institutions of higher education, communities, and school districts to design comprehensive advanced-level services; sponsor demonstration projects and develop materials that support the implementation of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs in middle and high schools throughout Texas; collaborate with business and industry to provide additional opportunities for gifted students; and provide information on evaluation results, developments, and achievements in the field of gifted education to all interested parties.
Through the combined efforts of the Texas Education Agency, the regional education service centers, local district personnel, and the communities they serve, all children will have an education that provides challenging academic opportunities that enable them to reach their full potential.

FOUNDATION SCHOOL PROGRAM Subchapter C. Special Allotments Ã¯Â¿Â½42.156.
Gifted and Talented Student Allotment (a) For each identified student a school district serves in a program for gifted and talented students that the district certifies to the commissioner as complying with Subchapter D, Chapter 29, a district is entitled to an annual allotment equal to the district's adjusted basic allotment as determined under Section 42.102 or Section 42.103, as applicable, multiplied by .12 for each school year or a greater amount provided by appropriation.
Funds allocated under this section, other than the amount that represents the programs share of general administrative costs, must be used in providing programs for gifted and talented students under Subchapter D, Chapter 29, including programs sanctioned by International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement, or in developing programs for gifted and talented students.
Each district must account for the expenditure of state funds as provided by rule of the State Board of Education.
If by the end of the 12th month after receiving an allotment for developing a program a district has failed to implement a program, the district must refund the amount of the allotment to the agency within 30 days.
Not more than five percent of a district's students in average daily attendance are eligible for funding under this section.
