Agenda Item 13 Discuss Licensing Â· LICENSING FEE UPDATE Â­ At the February 13-14, 2003 meeting, the board requested that the licensing examiner resend the October 8, 2002 letter to the new Occupational Licensing Director requesting that fees listed in 12 AAC 02.310 be amended.
A motion was made at the October 3-4, 2002 meeting requesting an amendment to Occupational Licensing Fees of the Board of Pharmacy as follows: - 12AAC 02.310(a)(5) Pharmacy Intern fee $25.
(lower $25) - 12AAC 02.310(b)(3) In State Pharmacies $ 150.(raise $50) - 12AAC 02.310(b)(7) Out of State Pharmacies $150.
(raise $50) - 12AAC 02.310(b)(8) Pharmacy Technicians $25.
(lower $25) However, after reviewing the previously proposed fees in light of the current budget report, the board feels that the original fee recommendations will not cover the pending costs of increased investigations and regulation projects.
In consideration of these increased costs, the board recommends adjusting fees so that facility and pharmacist fees will increase, while pharmacy intern and pharmacy technician fees will decrease.
On a motion duly made by Mr. Bohrer, seconded by Mr. Miller, and approved unanimously, it was RESOLVED to approve adjusting licensing fees per Proposed Fee Schedule #2 as follows: - 12AAC 02.310(a)(5) Pharmacy Intern, $25; - 12AAC 02.310(b)(1) Pharmacist, $250; - 12AAC 02.310(b)(2) Wholesale Drug Distributor, $250; - 12AAC 02.310(b)(3) Pharmacy, $250; - 12AAC 02.310(b)(5) Drug Room, $250; BR/dgl/478br
ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING APRIL 24-25, 2003 PAGE 13 OF 23 Â· 12AAC 02.310(b)(7) Pharmacy Located outside of state, $250; 12AAC 02.310(b)(8) Pharmacy Technician, $25;
LICENSE STREAMLINING - Several regulations that would streamline the licensing process have been submitted for public notice.
The licensing examiner reported that revisions to applications and checklists for Wholesale Drug Distributors, Pharmacies, Out-of-State Pharmacies, Pharmacists, Pharmacy Interns, and Pharmacy Technicians are being worked on.
The new applications should be available soon.
The board discussed streamlining licensure requirements for new pharmacy graduates who seek "Licensure by Examination."
12 AAC 52.090(2)(d) Examination Requirements and Registration requires applicants for "Licensure by Examination" to wait 60 days after submitting an application, before taking the exam.
This regulation was required in the past when the board wrote and administered the pharmacist license exam, and needed the 60-day period to set up the exam.
Now that the exams are administered by NABP, there is no reason for the 60 day waiting period.
NABP requires that exam candidates are Pharmacy program graduates, but the board could see no reason to delay the licensing of new graduates.

Â· HB No. 239 ("An Act directing the Department of Public Safety to establish an Internet-based identification and tracking system relating to controlled substances that are prescribed for human use; and relating to the manner in which prescriptions for controlled substances may be filled by a pharmacists.")

In a ddition, the board noted that there would be considerable costs in establishing such a data base project, and that funding could be a problem.

SB No. 41 ("An Act relating to medical care and crimes relating to medical care...").

The licensing examiner responded to a question asked by the board at the February 14, 2003 meeting about why the 2002 Direct Costs are almost double the 2001 Direct Costs.
Direct costs reflect actual billed hours by staff, including the licensing examiner, supervisors, paralegal, investigators, and regulation specialist.
The rise in costs is due to increased investigations, regulation projects and training.
Board members requested that the division review the board's recommendations for licensing fee adjustments to cover these increased costs.

Agenda Item 18 Correspondence National Pharmacy Technician Association (NPTA) - Continuing Education Regulations

To allow electronic prescription transmission, the current regulation would need to be modified.
On a motion duly made by Mr. Miller, seconded by Ms. Bueler, it was RESOLVED to revise 12 AAC 52.510(a)(1) to read: the prescribing practitioner does not [HAND WRITE] indicate on the prescription drug order that a specific brand must be dispensed, using BR/dgl/478br

Rod Gordon, RPh - Sammuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital Pharmacy (PHA R 308) Licensing Question.
Mr. Gordon asked the board whether a new pharmacy license would be required if this hospital sets up an additional pharmacy.
The board responded that the hospital would be operating two pharmacies in separate locations and each location would require a separate license.
(AS 08.80.157 Licensing of Facilities.
"If operations are conducted at more that one location, each location shall be licensed by the board.")
In addition, the pharmacies would be serving two different patient groups, beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries, and would have different purchasing contracts for the two groups.
The board stated that the two pharmacies should be separately licensed and recommended that they review the requirements of their Federal purchasing contracts.

AS 08.80.157(b) " The board may by regulation determine the licensure classification of facilities and establish minimum standards for the facilities."
AS 08.80.157(c) "The board shall establish by regulations the criteria that a facility must meet to qualify for licensure in each classification."
AS 08.80.157(f) "The board shall specify by regulation the minimum standards..."

Add a new license classification for a "remote" pharmacy location.

The wording of this regulation may need to change to allow telepharmacy.
12 AAC 52.210 "Pharmacist Duties.
Except as provided in 12 AAC 52.220, the following duties may be performed only by a pharmacist: (1) receiving an oral prescription drug order, including refill approval or denial that includes any change to the original prescription drug order; (2) consulting with a prescriber regarding a patient or prescription; (3) interpreting a prescription drug order; (4) determining the product required for a prescription; (5) interpreting date in a patient medication record system; (6) making a final check on all aspects of a completed prescription and assuming the responsibility for a filled prescription, including the accuracy of the drug prescribed and of the prescribed drug's strength, labeling and proper container; and (7) consulting with a patient or a patient's agent regarding a prescription or information contained in the patient medication record system."
The board will have to determine if a pharmacist can perform all the duties listed in 12 AAC 52.210 from a different location, and protect the public health, safety and welfare.
12 AAC 52.420 Security (c) "All drugs, devices, and other items or products that are restricted to sale by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist shall be kept in the prescription department."
The board discussed whether "personal supervision" could be electronic supervision via computer, two-way video and audio links.
12 AAC 52.420 Security (d) "The prescription department shall be locked by key or combination to prevent access when a pharmacist is not on-site.
12 AAC 52.420 Security (f) Prescriptions shall be stored in the prescription department and may not be removed unless a pharmacist is present..." 12 AAC 52.995 Definitions.

Mr. Miller distributed an outline of telepharmacy regulations, "Alaska TelePharmacy".
The regulations include Purpose and Scope; Definitions; Guidelines for Pharmacies and Pharmacists; Rule Exceptions; and Suspension and Termination.
Mr. Miller emphasized that "real time" computer, video, and audio monitoring, security checks, and overrides by the pharmacist-in-charge must be in place to BR/dgl/478br

The Board discussed how a remote facility would be licensed and whether the regulatory authority exists to determine a new license category.
The Licensing Examiner reported that the Regulations Specialist stated that the Board appears to have authority under AS 08.80.157(b) and 12 AAC 52.010 to designate a new licensing type and to define a "remote site" and to set up telepharmacy regulations.
The Regulations Specialist also noted that the Department of Law does not review regulation proposals, but that the regulations would have to go through the regulation process before an official determination of regulatory authority is made.
Ms. Leboef asked whether a telepharmacy pilot project soon to be implemented by a Native Health Corporation would be under the jurisdiction of the Board of Pharmacy.
The board noted that current Board of Pharmacy regulations, as well as the proposed telepharmacy regulations, apply to pharmacies and not to remote clinics and village health aids working under the supervision of a prescribing physician.
(AS 08.80.390) The TelePharmacy Ad-hoc Committee will continue to work on drafting regulations and the discussion will be continued at the next meeting.
Angie Leboeuf left the meeting at 4:25 p.m. Â· Patient Counseling Ms. Soden expressed concern about the occurrence and extent of patient counseling.
Current Alaska pharmacy regulation 12 AAC 52.585 Mandatory Patient Counseling, requires that the pharmacist "make an offer to provide counseling."
Ms. Soden noted that Washington pharmacy law requires counseling for all new prescriptions: "the pharmacist must orally explain to the patient or the patient's agent directions for use..."
Ms Soden suggested that, for the health and safety of the public, that the board amend 12 AAC 52.585 Mandatory Patient Counseling.
The wording in 12 AAC 52.585(a) "make an offer to provide" should be replaced with "shall verbally provide counseling."
On a motion duly made by Ms. Bueler, seconded by Mr. Bohrer, and approved unanimously, it was RESOLVED to revise 12 AAC 52.585(a) Mandatory Patient Counseling to read: "With each new prescription dispensed, the pharmacist shall verbally [MAKE AN OFFER TO] provide counseling to the patient or the patient's caregiver on matters considered significant in the pharmacist's professional judgement.
[THE OFFER SHALL BE MADE VERBALLY BY THE PHARMACISTS OR BR/dgl/478br
ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING APRIL 24-25, 2003 PAGE 22 OF 23 THE PHARMACIST'S AGENT].

(Leave items 1 through 10 as written.)
RESOLVED to revise 12 AAC 52.585(b) [IF A PATIENT OR PATIENT'S CAREGIVER ACCEPTS THE OFFER TO PROVIDE COUNSELING] "A pharmacist shall counsel the patient or the patient's caregiver face-to-face."
(Leave all other parts of the regulation as written.)
The board noted that adopting these regulations would not result in any cost to private persons.
The board requested that Ms. Nelson include a statement in the newsletter about the proposed amendments to the mandatory counseling regulations.
