Moloney, Commissioner form date: 5/14/02 007 STATE ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENT EDUCATION DATE: TO: FROM: RE: February 1, 2003 State Board of Education State Advisory Committee for Gifted and Talented Education Annual Report to the State Board for 2001-2002 Inclusive through December 2002.
The State Advisory Committee for Gifted and Talented Student Education is comprised of parents, educators, and community members informed and interested in gifted education.
The Committee met five times during the 2001-2002 school year to discuss issues pertaining to the education of gifted and talented students in Colorado with the purpose of providing perspective and making recommendations to the State Board of Education.
Meetings included updates from the Colorado Department of Education, School Board of Education, association and legislative updates, and discussion of timely issues related to gifted education.
Endorsement, funding, and accreditation continued to be topics of concern.
Members participated in sub-committee work sessions to address charges concerning commensurate academic growth, identification, and budget.
Chairs of the sub-committees conducted additional meetings to study and respond to charges.
In the fall of 2002, an interim state consultant for gifted education and the Chair of the Committee facilitated two additional sub-committees: By-Laws revisions and development of a Membership Committee.
Charges for 2001-2002 Commensurate Growth To define commensurate academic growth To develop guidelines or recommendations on how districts and schools can show commensurate growth for gifted and talented students in the context of the accreditation and accountability processes.
Identification To make recommendations to the Board for the development of a resource guide for the identification of gifted students and the implementation of guidelines 008 Budget This sub-committee was discontinued due to the informal ruling that gifted and talented state funds must be administered through administrative units (not individual districts) as stated in Colorado law.
The original charge involved recommendations for supporting district budgets.
By-Laws To revise the By-Laws according to guidelines established by the School Board of Education, congressional district representation, and to bring clarify to questions about membership and tasks.
Membership Committee The newly formed Committee met twice to begin developing guidelines, timelines and documents.
The committee initiated a new timeline for recruiting and approving new members.
** Documents included in this agenda item are reports from three sub-committees: Commensurate Growth, Identification, and By-Laws.
The new Membership Committee will submit a report in the fall when a membership packet and guidelines will be completed.
Charges Recommended for the Remainder of 2001-2002 At the December 2002 meeting, the Committee outlined the following charges recommended for study during the remainder of the school year: To study issues in school districts regarding gifted identification and programming, especially small districts, and to make recommendations for implementation of quality programming efforts To oversee the development of an Identification Resource Guide To develop a Member's Informational Packet and complete the development of documents needed by the Membership Committee.
The Committee would like to express appreciation to the State Board of Education for supporting liaison activities to the advisory committee, especially Evie Hudak and Jared Polis.
In the spirit of continuing quality communication, the Committee respectfully requests the opportunity to meet with the State Board of Education during a work session in the coming year.
Efforts will be made to request additional time with the Board so that more detailed information and a broader perspective concerning the education of gifted and talented students may be shared and questions or issues discussed.
009 Guidelines for Measuring Commensurate Academic Growth for Gifted and Talented Students The State Advisory Committee for Gifted and Talented Student Education September 2002 Background In 2001, the State Board of Education adopted Accreditation Rules requiring schools and districts to provide specific means for documenting and reporting the academic achievement and progress of all students, including gifted and talented students (Colorado Code of Regulations, 2001).
Since then, the Board has asked the State Gifted and Talented Education Advisory Committee to make recommendations on how schools and districts can provide evidence that gifted and talented students are achieving academically and progressing in their learning commensurate with their exceptional ability.
Commensurate Academic Growth The concept of "commensurate academic growth" is key to providing evidence that gifted and talented students are achieving and growing as a consequence of their educational programs in schools and districts throughout Colorado.
The following definition was developed by the State Gifted and Talented Education Advisory Committee: "Commensurate academic growth" means the academic progress that can be measured and should be expected of a gifted/talented student in the student's area or areas of exceptional ability or exceptional potential.
Commensurate academic growth is achieved through appropriate instruction that is matched to the student's current performance level in the learning curriculum, readiness for new learning, and exceptional abilities.
Based on this definition, gifted and talented students should be making substantial and adequate academic gains in the curricular area or areas that match their exceptional abilities.
Such gains should be determined by measuring from a point of optimum performance before instruction (current performance level or baseline) to a new level of optimum performance after appropriate instruction is provided (measured academic gain).
It is very likely, and should be expected, that gifted and talented students will start from baseline performance in a given curricular area at a point ahead of their age and grade-level peers.
It should also be expected that, given appropriate instruction matched to these students' abilities and needs, gifted and talented students will move farther than their age and grade-level mates in their growth in the standard curriculum over the course of the instructional period.
Achievement gains in the curricular area should be used for establishing a new baseline for the subsequent instructional period.
This proposition is consistent with the notion of value-added growth that should be sought for all students as reflected in Colorado's Educational Accountability Act (Colorado Revised 010 Statutues, 22-7-101 et seq.) and the State Board's Rules for the Accreditation of School Districts (Colorado Code of Regulations, 2001).
Recommendations The set of recommendations presented in the following chart intended to provide assistance to schools and districts in determining and documenting commensurate academic growth of gifted and talented students.
These recommendations are keyed to the Colorado Accreditation Indicators presented in the Accreditation Rules and amplified in the Colorado Department of Education's Colorado Accreditation Program: Implementation Guidelines (Colorado Department of Education, 2001).
In addition, the recommendations speak only to those Accreditation Indicators that require demonstrations of evidence of student achievement or school/district planning and program implementation.
Recommended Strategies for Developing Evidence of Commensurate Academic Growth for Gifted and Talented Students Pertinent Accreditation Indicators 4.01 (1)(a) Educational Improvement Plan Context for Gifted and Talented Student Education This indicator deals in part with setting high and attainable student achievement goals for all students, including gifted and talented students.
Key to setting and achieving high achievement goals for gifted and talented students is the ability of the school and district to identify these students appropriately and to plan and implement instructional programming that will truly allow them to grow academically according to their potential.
Recommended Strategies Ã¯Â¿Â½ Set advanced achievement goals for gifted and talented students in the academic areas in which gifted and talented students show exceptional ability.
Specify and utilize appropriate and adequate means for identification of individual gifted and talented students, including specifying the area or areas of exceptional ability.
Know and utilize appropriate curricular and instructional modifications for meeting the special educational needs of gifted and talented students in their area or areas of exceptional ability.
At beginning of each year for each grade level, predict and document the Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4.01 (1)(b) CSAP Goals Schools and districts should expect that gifted and talented students, as well as Ã¯Â¿Â½ 011 other academically ambitious and able students, should perform at the advanced level on CSAP in areas in which they have identified exceptional abilities and/or previous advanced level performance.
Maintaining and increasing the number of students performing at the advanced level on CSAP will likely increase the school's and district's weighted score index for accountability purposes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ number and names of students who should achieve advanced level of performance for each area assessed by CSAP (reading, writing, math, and science).
Identify these students based on one or more of the following: their areas of exceptional ability, their actual classroom learning performance, and prior advanced level performance.
Track the actual CSAP performance of these students from year to year to determine longitudinal progress; track for individual students as well as for this student category.
Disaggregate achievement data for gifted and talented students individually and as a group; analyze data to determine if discrepancies exist between expected and actual performance in each curricular area.
Analyze data to determine if discrepancies in actual performance exist among subcategories of gifted 4.01 (1)(c) Closing Learning Gaps "Learning gap" in relation to gifted and talented students refers to discrepancies between expected and actual academic performance in areas of students' identified exceptional abilities.
Gifted/talented students and other potentially high-achieving students are especially susceptible to academic underachievement.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 012 Discrepancies in academic performance among subpopulations of gifted and talented students (gender groups, ethnic populations, socio-economic groups) are common and should be identified and addressed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4.01 (1)(d) Value-Added Growth "Value-added growth" for all students is considered to mean a year's growth in measured academic achievement over a year's worth of instructional programming.
Gifted and talented students are characterized, in part, by their exceptional rate and depth of learning, especially in their area or areas of exceptional ability.
It should be expected that gifted and talented students will make curricular gains greater than is typical for other students of their age and normal grade placement.
Value-added growth for gifted and talented students should be regarded as greater than one year's growth in the standard curriculum over the course of one year of instruction.
On the other hand, curricula that have been Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ and talented students (e.g., gender groups, ethnic populations, socio-economic groups).
Build into educational improvement planning, at both the school and district levels, specific strategies for reducing the gap between expected and actual academic achievement for relevant gifted/talented and other potentially high-achieving students; give special attention to discrepancies among sub-populations of gifted/talented students.
Purposefully seek to maintain advanced level performance capability with these students from year to year.
Provide advanced learning options in all curriculum areas at all levels; provide opportunity for continuous progress in advanced learning from year to year.
Utilize off-level assessment to show greater than one year's growth in the typical curriculum.
Utilize a variety of assessment strategies to demonstrate advanced learning in curricula that has been differentiated for 013 specially differentiated or adapted to the learning characteristics and needs of gifted and talented students may define value-added growth in terms of end-of-year (or end-of-instructional-period) performance specific to the special programming provided.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ exceptionally able learners.
Document special programming strategies used with gifted and talented students, including methods used for determining program impact on the students.
4.01 (1)(e) Data Regarding Achievement in Other Curriculum Standards Areas Gifted and talented students may possess exceptional abilities or be able to apply their exceptional abilities in areas other than those assessed through CSAP.
Given the appropriate advanced level learning opportunities, these students are likely to exhibit extraordinary interest and be able to demonstrate extraordinary learning and content performance in science, history, geography, art, music, physical education, foreign languages, economics, and civics.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide advanced learning opportunities in curricular areas not assessed through CSAP.
Develop assessment strategies in these curricular areas for determining and documenting advanced level production and performance, knowledge and skill application, and insightful, critical, and creative thinking.
