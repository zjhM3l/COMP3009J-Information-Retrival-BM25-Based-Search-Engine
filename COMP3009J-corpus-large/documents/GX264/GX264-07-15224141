Linking Prevention and Intervention to Academic Success Introduction Linking Prevention and Intervention to Academic Success is a practical resource guide.
It describes instructional support programs and services and their direct or indirect roles in academic performance.
The programs and services described in this guide are school and community based.
They promote academic success, personal and social development for all students, and offer a proven record of prevention and intervention to overcome barriers to learning.
Barriers to learning can include migration, language barriers, mental health issues, physical or emotional abuse, alcohol and other drug abuse, teenage pregnancy and parenting, violence in schools and communities, lack of parental involvement, homelessness, and inadequate nutrition.
An unfortunate outcome for some youth is academic failure, truancy, and dropping out.
Each program described in this guide can make a difference in a child's life.
Depending on the child's needs, one or a combination of the programs, using a comprehensive approach, can help a child overcome barriers to learning.
The resource guide provides a list of programs, services, and activities related to academic standards.
The connections to academic standards that are highlighted in this document enable educators and student support personnel to deliver services within the common context of improved academic learning.
From a national, state, and local research perspective, the resource guide provides information about the ability of student support programs, services, and activities to have a positive impact on academic performance.
This information will help school districts make decisions concerning implementation of prevention and intervention initiatives based on local needs and priorities.
Personnel who use this document will gain a greater ability to communicate the impact of these programs to everyone involved in maximizing all children's success.

Background Information Pennsylvania has made considerable progress in public education renewal.
The vision of linking prevention and intervention to academic success is part of the Pennsylvania Department of Education's continuing efforts to improve academic standards, assessment, and professional development.
In the summer of 2001, the Bureau of Community and Student Services and the Partnership for Educational Excellence Network (PEEN) formed the Maximizing All Children's Success Committee that developed this resource guide.
Representatives from other bureaus of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education were part of this effort as well as the Center for Schools and Communities.
This committee brought groups that support education together to explore ways to enhance academic success for all children.
In the last decade, many discussions about education have centered on the poor academic performance of American students and how to help all children reach their fullest potential.
Educators are experiencing tremendous pressure to drive up students' scores on standardized tests.
Student assessment, standards implementation, and accountability are school priorities.
As a result, educators are forced to justify time and money spent on student services presumably geared solely to improving social and emotional aspects of children's lives despite the clear link between social and emotional competence and academic success.
The goal of standards-based renewal is to help all students reach higher levels of learning.
Including all students, in its broadest sense, is at the heart of the "standards" and the "No Child Left Behind" movements.
Thus instructional support programs that serve the diverse student population are essential strategies for education renewal as part of a school's mission.
The mission of the Bureau of Community and Student Services is to help all Pennsylvania children succeed academically and grow to be healthy and responsible citizens, productive workers and effective parents.
All of the bureau's efforts and initiatives, including this resource guide, are directed at fulfilling this mission.
To that end the bureau administered programs that are directed to student mentoring, dropout prevention, safe schools, safe and drug-free schools, student assistance, character education, pregnant and parenting teens, service-learning, education of the homeless children, migrant education, and other student needs.
These initiatives are geared to improve the social and emotional well-being of children and ultimately enhance their academic performance.
This resource guide addresses initiatives of the bureau programs geared to prevention and intervention strategies.
Other support programs such as Alternative Education for Disruptive Children, Classroom Plus, Instructional Support Team and Supplemental Education Services are also included in this resource guide.
Definitions to Help Understand the Information Provided in Each Matrix Program-This column identifies the program and provides a general description of the purpose of the program.
Most of the programs listed operate under the Bureau of Community and Student Services.
Other support programs such as Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth and Instructional Support Team are included in this resource guide.
Activities-This column provides examples of selected program activities.
Not all activities are listed.
Student Impact-This column provides examples of how activities have a direct or indirect impact on academic achievement or academic success.
Chapter 4- This column identifies how the program activities connect with Chapter 4.
Chapter 4, of the Pennsylvania Code of Education establishes rigorous academic standards and assessments to facilitate the improvement of student achievement and to provide parents and communities a measure by which school performance can be determined.
This Chapter also sets forth requirements for instruction, graduation, strategic planning and assessment based on academic standards.
State Board of Education of Pennsylvania regulations, Chapter 4 can be found on the Department of Education web site www.pde.state.pa.us.
See regulations.
Academic Standards-This column identifies how the program activities connect with academic standards.
Academic standards is what a student should know and be able to do at a specific grade level.
Understanding the content standards represent the ability of a student to explain and exhibit comprehension and recognition of the significance of a concept and its connectedness to the whole by applying knowledge in a multitude of practical ways to new and different situations.
In designing educational programs, school districts are now required to provide for student attainment of academic standards as described in Chapter 4, as well as any additional locally developed academic standards that may be described in their strategic plans.
In accordance with Chapter 4, school districts must have, at a minimum, academic standards for students in the following disciplines: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening Mathematics Science and Technology Environment and Ecology Health, Safety and Physical Education Civics and Government Economics 3 Geography History Arts and Humanities World Languages Family and Consumer Sciences Career Education and Work
Standards are found in the Department of Education web site www.pde.state.pa.us.
See standards.
Linking Prevention and Intervention to Academic Success was the result of the collaboration and support of the subgroup of the Committee Maximizing All Children's Success, Resources for Schools and Programs.
Mission of the Subgroup-Resources for Schools and Programs: To link prevention and intervention programs and services to academic success.
Goal 1`: To develop a practical guide that explains how specific programs relate to academic success.
Goal 2: To develop a resource or tool that can be used to link programs and services to specific Academic Standards.
Goal 3: To develop a training resource kit that can be distributed to schools and communities

Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth Programs Statutory Authority: XIX-C (Act 30 of 1997 and Act 48 of 1999) Program The Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth Program was created to assist public school districts (single or in consortiums), intermediate units, area vocationaltechnical schools, charter schools, and special program jointures to provide an alternative setting for the education and counseling of youth who are disruptive in the regular classroom setting due to their ongoing behaviors.
Programs may be provided on the school site, at alternative or private sites, or in county jails, and detention centers.
The educational/counseling services may be contracted with a PDE approved private provider.
The programs can be provided during regular school hours, after hours, or on Saturday.
Activities The minimum requirements of an Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth Program include: A.
The program must be developed in consultation with the faculty, administration staff, the school, parents, and members of the community.
B. Policies must be established that identify those students eligible for placement in the program, comply with the informal hearing procedures set forth in 22 PA Code Â§ 12.8 and placement can only take place after other methods of discipline have been utilized, unless the seriousness of the student's behavior warrants immediate placement.
C.
The instruction must recognize the student's needs and prepare them for successful return to the regular school curriculum d/ li f Student Impact Although the goal of the program is to temporarily remove students from the regular classroom and return them once they have the tools to not be disruptive, students have achieved the following in alternative education settings: Â· Increased attendance rates.
Improved GPA.
Improved behavior and/or social skills.
Achieved treatment goals.
Received positive employer feedback.

What We Have Learned From Evaluations of Federal Dropout-Prevention Programs.
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1998.
This research shows that some programs were effective but there was great diversity in programs and outcomes.
However, results also point to a need to explore more individualized diagnostics and better predictors of who will drop out.
Researchers found that risk factors commonly used by dropout-prevention programs to identify likely dropouts often do not predict accurately which students will drop out, which can undermine program effectiveness.
They also looked at whether school performance and other factors can be used to identify girls at risk of teenage parenthood, noting that frequent absenteeism is the most important predictors.

Character Education Program Character education is a national movement creating schools that foster ethical, responsible, and caring young people by modeling and teaching good character through emphasis on universal values that we all share.
It is the intentional, proactive effort by schools to instill in students important core traits such as caring, civic virtue and citizenship, justice and fairness, respect, responsibility and trustworthiness.
There are 11 Principles of Effective Character Education according to the Character Education Partnership.
1.
Classrooms discuss and establish a code of ethics.
All curriculum areas consider how civic values, democratic principles, citizenship, rights and responsibilities and character traits can be integrated with academic standards.
2.
Students have a wide range of il i dhl Activities Character education is not an initiative that can be compartmentalized into specific activities; it includes all elements of school life.
It must include attitudes, feelings and behavior.
To support the 11 Principles Elements of Effective Character Education, some possible, activities and initiatives can include the following.
Student Impact Schools and districts may have a wide variety of "programs" that can be considered Character Education including; Service Learning, Communities of Caring, Conflict Resolution, Peer Mediation, Moral Reasoning, Cognitive Development, Social and Emotional Learning, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Ethical Fitness, Moral Education, and others The impact of Character Education programs is determined by the program design.
In general terms Character Education programs have been shown to develop character traits (caring, respect, honest, fairness, responsibility, trustworthiness, etc) in students participating in well designed, integrated Character Education initiatives and in some programs to; Â· Â· reduce discipline referrals increase participation in Chapter 4 and Standards Chapter 4 General Provisions: Section 4.2 Â­ Purpose Academic Standards and Planning Section 4.11 Â­ Purpose of Public Education Section 4.12 Â­ Academic Standards Section 4.13 Â­ Strategic Plans Curriculum and Instruction: Section 4.21 Â­ Elementary Education: Primary and Intermediate Levels Section 4.22 Â­ Middle Level Education Section 4.23 Â­ High School Education Section 4.24 Â­ High School Graduation Requirements Character Education is a pervasive philosophy of a school and should be present consistently in all classrooms.

Community members work with the students to address needs and strengthen assets.
For positive character development students think about not only their actions and experiences but how their actions and experiences affect others, the community, and the future.
11.
Utilize a wide range of evaluation tools to give all members of the school and the community ways to express their thoughts and feelings about the character development in the schools and whether programs are meeting the mission established for character development..
Use a "community/school barometer" to chart the present and developing character of the school..
10.
The school must recruit
parents and community members as full partners in the character-building effort.
11.
Evaluation of character
education should assess the character of the school, the school staff's functioning as character educators, and the extent to which students manifest good character.

Academic achievement has been affected consistently and positively by one-on-one tutoring of elementary students.
Tutoring by older students, adult community volunteers, trained paraprofessionals and certified teachers has produced substantial long-term improvements in students' achievement in reading and math.

Tutoring provided by other students has positive effects on both tutors' and tutees' academic achievement and attitudes toward the subject covered across all achievement levels.
(Cohen, Kulik 
Research consistently finds that family involvement has a direct, positive effect on children's achievement and is the most accurate predictor of a student's success in school.
Reading/Writing Programs help low-achieving students recognize that focusing on reading and writing skills is the foundation for effective learning in all other subjects.
When all groups in a community provide collective support to the school, an infrastructure is created that provides a caring, supportive environment where youth can thrive and achieve.

RTL programs provided services such as after-school and summer programs, tutoring and parenting skills classes.
Evidence of increased success in school included: Â· Elementary school teachers reported improvement in the academic performance of 51% of students referred for academic problems.
Â· Middle and high school students referred for academic problems showed a small but statistically significant increase in GPA.
Â· Elementary school teachers reported significantly fewer attendance problems for students referred for attendance problems.

Â· Â· Â·
Actual attendance data for attendance referrals in all grade levels showed that 53% of the students improved their attendance.
Elementary school teachers rated a significant improvement in behavior among students who had been referred for behavior problems.
Students referred for behavior problems and who had at least one referral or detention at baseline received significantly fewer office referrals or detentions.

(p. 9) National Dropout Prevention Center website The Center has "identified 15 effective strategies that have the most positive impact on the dropout rate."
Below are those strategies which relate to the Education Mentoring Initiative.
Early interventions: Â· Family Involvement: Research consistently finds that family involvement has a direct, positive effect on children's achievement and is the most accurate predictor of a student's success in school Â· Reading/Writing Programs: Early interventions to help low-achieving students recognize that focusing on reading and writing skills is the foundation for effective learning in all other subjects.
Basic Core Strategies: Â· Mentoring/Tutoring: Mentoring is a one-to-one caring, supportive relationship between a mentor and a mentee that is based on trust.
Â· Out of school experiences: Since learning happens all day long, 365 days a year, many schools are providing after-school and summer enhancement programs designed to eliminate information loss, inspire interest in a variety of areas, and expand the knowledge base.
Making the Most of the Wider School Community: Â· Community Collaboration: When all groups in a community provide collective support to the school, an infrastructure is created that provides a caring supportive environment where youth can thrive and achieve.

As a result of opportunities and reinforcements experienced in social groups that model, condone, or approve of these behaviors, individuals may be encouraged to engage in such behaviors (Bourgois, 1995). (p. 285) Academic achievement has been affected consistently and positively by one-on-one tutoring of elementary students.

Tutoring provided by other students has positive effects on both tutors' and tutees' academic achievement and attitudes toward the subject covered across all achievement levels.
(Cohen, Kulik 
There is some evidence that the teaching of social and emotional skills in schools also can have long-term effects on academic achievement (Elias, Gara, Schuyler, Brandon-Muller 
(p. 300) Strategies and Successes in School Dropout Prevention: A Forum Brief, from the American Youth Policy Forum, 1995 Some student behaviors are more likely precursors of dropping out of school than others.
For example, there is a strong correlation between repeated school tardiness and absenteeism and dropping out, while participation in extra-curricular activities tends to lead to staying in school because it provides students with another "hook" if they reject the academic side of school.
Low basic skills, being over-age for one's grade, social isolation, frequent moves to different schools, deficient support systems, siblings who have dropped out, and low socio-economic levels also correlate with a potential to leave school early.
Policy decisions can have important effects on the incidence of dropping out.
Dr. Smink indicated several widely used policies that directly result in young people dropping out of school.
These include: out-of-school suspensions; graduation requirements; no opportunities to make up work; no summer school; automatic failure if more than ten days are missed; grade retention.
Some policies may need to be changed; others are based on real needs and could be adapted to prevent dropping out.
For example, students could receive in-school suspension or have strict requirements to keep up with work while out of school.
In another example, summer, alternative or Saturday school could be used to make up work to avoid the necessity to retain students in the same grade.
The National Dropout Prevention Center uses the following techniques to address the needs of youth at-risk of dropping out of school: school restructuring, prevention, mediation, intervention and recovery...
The National Dropout Prevention Center considers the following criteria important for the success of dropout prevention programs: ...
Mentoring Â­ a relative inexpensive strategy, since it involved volunteers, which reaps substantial rewards in part because it convinces students that someone really cares about whether they complete school or not and really cares about them....
School-based Mentoring: Studies Find BBBS School-based Mentoring Highly Effective, Third Edition, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America According Â· 64 Â· 58 Â· 60 to teachers, who referred all of the students in the Big Brothers Big Sisters School-Based Mentoring Study: percent of students developed more positive attitudes toward school.

They (students) were also less likely than their peers to repeat a grade, and their average number of unexcused absences also dropped.
Big Brothers Big Sisters School-Based Mentoring: Evaluation Summary of Five Pilot Programs, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, December 1999 Unexcused absences and being previously retained are two factors that significantly increase the likelihood that a youth will drop out of high school.
Since mentoring is shown to decrease unexcused absences and retainment, it is reasonable to assume that mentored youth will be less likely to drop out of high school.

The Pennsylvania Migrant Education program conducted a yearlong program evaluation study done by a third-party evaluator.
The stated purposes of the evaluation were to determine: Â· Â· Â· The degree to which migrant education programs in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are in compliance with federal requirements The level of effectiveness of programming The extent to which programming provides equitable access to programs and services for migrant children and their families
The evaluation includes measures to determine the effectiveness of programs within the nine project areas of the Commonwealth as well as measures to determine the overall effectiveness of the program for the Commonwealth.
Based on the data collected as reported in this evaluation, the following overall observations about the Pennsylvania Migrant Education Program are provided: Staffing Â· Â· Â· Â· Individuals involved in educating migrant students in Pennsylvania are dedicated, well-educated, versatile, hardworking professionals They share a common understanding of the goals and purpose of the migrant education program Staffs have great pride in their program and their work.
They believe Pennsylvania leads the nation in its efforts to education migrant students Project Area staff are diverse in culture and language and reflect the families they serve
Satisfaction with State Migrant Division Direction Â· Â· Project Area staff are satisfied overall with the state administration of the program They welcome the training, statewide initiatives, program guidelines, and administrative support provided by the state 65
Â· Â·
They acknowledge and support the vision of the state leadership They appreciate the autonomy each Project Area has in meeting the goals of the program
Findings about Project Area Staff Â· Project Area managers have responsibility for implementing the MEP program in each project area.
They develop budgets, hire and manage staff, provide curriculum support, arrange transportation, develop partnerships, and communicate with state MEP staff.
There is close communication among Project Area Managers and other role-alike groups.
Recruiters play an indispensable role in identifying eligible families/students and are a key link between the program and the home.
Student support staff is key to ensuring the quality of the instruction, of implementing an appropriate educational plan for each child based on the needs assessment.
Data specialists are key to the accurate reporting of student data, and the maintenance of databases.
Â· Â· Â· Â·
Findings about Programs Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· The categorical nature of the funding for the program ensures that migrant children receive the support they need and that is intended for their continued academic achievement.
The summer program is a key component of the MEP program that is unique to each project area.
The schedule, curriculum, activities are designed by the PA staff to meet the needs of their students.
The focus is on enhancing the achievement of students, while building the self-esteem and the cultural pride of students.
There is some cross-project area sharing of curriculum, and other resources.
Each summer program has an extensive complement of partners that enhance the educational, physical and social experiences of the students.
Upper grade and college MEP students serve as staff.
International staff enriches some summer programs.
The regular school program is a key component of the MEP program.
Support for student achievement is the major focus of the extended day programs.
66
Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·
Programs are designed at the Project Area level, to meet the needs of students and comply with the directives of the state.
Curriculum is determined in conjunction with the classroom teacher.
All eligible students are identified by recruiters and encouraged to attend.
Parents are kept informed about the purpose and value of the program.
Transportation is often provided.
Student Support Specialists are the key designers of the curriculum and oversee instruction.
These programs may be before, during or after school, or on Saturdays.
Programs are held in a variety of locations including schools, colleges, and other community facilities.
Eligible students not served by summer and extended day programs receive home-based programming.
Findings about Parent Involvement Â· Â· Â· Parents are essential to the program at the state and local level, and are encouraged to be actively involved in the education of their child.
Project area staffs are committed to helping parents become advocates for their children.
Parents are actively included in the program, some as staff, and others through parent activities.
Findings about other issues related to the MEP Â· Â· The State has no certification for teachers of English as a second language.
This impacts the quality of the instruction students receive especially in more remote areas.
Overall, the MEP has strong relationships with the school districts.
The Project Area staff supplement, and not supplant the education the districts are required to provide to the migrant students.
However, some project areas may need state support in working with some school districts that have not developed strong partnerships with the MEP staff.
67
Recommendations The following recommendations are based on the findings from the Evaluation of the Pennsylvania Migrant Education Program: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Keep the MEP as a categorical program Provide more support for a longer period of time Â­ through the college experience Continue to support the decentralized system of delivering services through the Project Areas Advocate for the State to consider additional requirements for teachers of English-Language Learners Provide strong support for Project Areas in informing districts about the requirements for educating children of migratory workers Explore how classroom teachers utilize the Student Portfolios from summer programs in the regular school year Continue to educate the districts about the roles of the MEP staff, and the requirements for data collection Continue to educate the districts about the role of the extended day and summer programs and encourage them to partner with the Project Areas Continue to pursue reciprocal data sharing with other states Continue to educate the public about migrant education Advertise the successes of the program Examine staff turnover and its relationship to salaries and benefits offered by the Project Areas
Summary The Pennsylvania Migrant Education program is a strong, comprehensive program as evaluated on the Eight Tasks.
Each of the tasks examined are being carried out by the project managers and their staff with knowledge of the students, the program, the state curriculum and accountability system, and the culture of the communities.
68
In addition a yearlong look at technology integrated into curriculum was evaluated through a third-party evaluator.
The results of that study are as follows: Technology Integrated Instruction Â·Significant differences in pre/post test scores of control and experimental groups Â·Both groups improved Â·Improvement of experimental group was greater in all areas.

Not only were academic effects reported, but also behavioral, emotional and motivational gains were also cited.
The Planning and Evaluation Service of the U. S. Department of Education published a three-volume study, The Same High Standards for Migrant Students: Holding Title I Schools Accountable which examines how the federal Migrant Education Program (MEP) is helping migrant students succeed in school and meet academically challenging standards, and whether states and districts are including migrant students in standards-based reforms.
The study found that principals and teachers in Title I schools serving migrant students have lower expectations about how well their students can perform than teachers in other Title I schools.
Fewer seniors in Title I schools with migrant students have taken higherlevel mathematics courses compared with seniors in other schools.
Title I schools with migrant students have higher percentages of 69
inexperienced teachers, teachers who are teaching in fields for which they are not certified, as well as teachers who hold emergency or temporary certification.
Many of the Title I schools that served migrant students used different standards for their Limited-English Proficient students.
A significant percentage of migrant students did participate in state or district assessments in the 1997-1998 school year, but very few of these schools received the results of the assessments disaggregated by migrant status.
Some states and school districts are implementing promising practices to promote continuity of instructional services for migrant students to respond to the effects caused by changing schools on students' academic performance.
Key Findings: A Summary Â· Expectations about student performance were low in Title I schools serving migrant students.
Some principals in Title I elementary schools with medium-to-high numbers of migrant students reported that standards were too hard for a significant portion of their students, and that a large percentage of these students were not prepared to do the work at the next grade level.
This finding is similar to NLSS findings concerning differences between the highest-poverty and lower-poverty Title I elementary schools.
Many of the Title I schools that served migrant students used different standards for their Limited-English Proficient students.
Many migrant students are also Limited-English Proficient.
Over half of the Title I schools with medium-to-high numbers of migrant students are classified as schools with 25 percent or more Limited-English Proficient students.
Contrary to the requirements of the Title I program, principals in Title I elementary schools reported that their schools used alternate state content standards and different student performance standards for Limited-English Proficient students.
States' knowledge of migrant student participation in assessments was weak.
States reported that they did not have a way to estimate the percentage of migrant students participating in assessments because the number of students exempted from assessments is typically a local decision that is often not reported to the state.
Based on national survey data, principals reported that 70 percent of migrant elementary students and 90 percent of migrant secondary students participated in assessments in the 1998-1999 school year.
Mobility and language difficulties were the two leading barriers to migrant students' participation in statewide assessments.
Few schools with migrant students received disaggregated achievement scores.
The single greatest barrier to evaluating migrant student achievement data systems is the lack of capacity that most state and local data systems currently have to link individual migrant student records with state and district databases.
Few states pursue data on graduation and dropout rates because of the investment of resources involved, and because they are not legislatively required to do so.
Fewer students in Title I schools that serve migrant students were enrolled in higher-level courses.
Fewer seniors in Title I schools with medium-to-high numbers of migrant students had taken higher-level mathematics courses compared with seniors in other Title I schools.

Teachers in schools serving migrants were less experienced.
Teachers in Title I elementary schools with medium-to-high numbers of migrant students had fewer years of teaching experience than teachers in other Title I elementary schools.
These schools also reported that more teachers were teaching in fields for which they were not certified and held emergency or temporary certification.
Many of these differences were similar to those between highest- and lower-poverty schools.
Title I schools with migrant students tend to be much poorer, and have high proportions of students who are minorities and limited-English proficient.
Many of the differences between Title I schools with no or few migrant students and schools with medium-to-high numbers of migrant students parallel the differences between Title I schools that are relatively lower in poverty and those that are highest-poverty.
A few states and school districts are committed to aligning local instruction between programs that shares migrant students.
In particular, these states and districts were committed to aligning with the students' home base schools for curricular content and course requirements.
Some examples of alignment policies included the following: LEP students were placed in the same type of English acquisition program as their home base school; trading partners compared their individual languages assessments scores to place migrant students in the same types of coursework; and trading partners agreed on common grade placement policies.
Technology is enabling states and districts to access other states' and districts' content and performance standards.
The use of technology provided solutions to the problems of accessing information and providing instruction to difficult-to-reach students.
Technology was used to transfer information on students' academic records between trading partners, provide individualized instruction, and provide access to another state or district's assessments and standards.

This article summarizes the evidence regarding the link between academic performance and health risk behaviors, including substance abuse, delinquency, teen sexual activity, and violence.
Contains 64 references.
The social development model is outlined to organized evidence on effective schools.
The theory provides and example of a framework that can be used to select and implement school and classroom practices to promote the development of academic, social and emotional competence in children.
It also provides examples of effective practices in promoting academic, social and emotional competence.

Increased evidence shows that when adolescents feel cared for by people at their schools and feel like a part of their school, They are less likely to use substances, engage in violence, or initiate sexual activity at an early age.
This study examined the association between school connectedness and the school environment to identify ways to increase students' connectedness.
Positive classroom management climates, participation in extracurricular activities, tolerant disciplinary policies, and small school size were associated positively with higher school connectedness.

What schools do to prevent problem behavior and promote safe environments.
Journal of Educational and Psychological Consultation, 12, 313-344.
This article reports results from a survey conducted in a probability sample of U.S. public, private, and Catholic schools to obtain information about the nature and extent of activity to prevent problem behavior.
Results imply that schools engage in a large number of activities ranging from security and surveillance, through school climate change, to counseling and curricular or instructional programs.
Most schools have strict rules about dangerous behaviors.
Suspension is used extensively and expulsion appear unnecessary.
Many of the activities in which schools are engaged to prevent safety and prevent problem behavior have not been the subject of evaluation, so research provides little information about the effectiveness of what schools now do.

Service-Learning (www.pitt.edu/~psla) "Service-learning is a method of teaching that enriches learning by engaging students in meaningful service to their schools or communities through careful integration with established curricula."
-Corporation for National and Community Service.
Program Service-learning efforts are different in each school because each school and community has different needs and assets.
Some projects involve one class for just a few weeks while others involve the whole school for many years.
Service-learning is a method whereby students learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service that is conducted in and meets the needs of communities.
Service-learning is coordinated with an elementary school, secondary school, institution of higher education, or community service program and the community.
Activities Although specific activities are determined by individual projects, all service learning contains the following elements: Students select service based on community need and student input.
Teachers, students, and community partners link research and curriculum goals to service-learning effort.
Students cooperate to address community need through direct, indirect or advocacy service.
Teachers, students, and community partners guide reflection activities to solidify the link between the curriculum, service, and student and community development.
Student Impact Using service learning as a teaching methodology has many impacts on students, classrooms and school environments.
These impacts which have been found in an array of rigorous studies include: Â· Â· Increased attendance Increased grades
Chapter 4, Standards and IEP Each Service-Learning project will address a different group of standards and IEP goals (see example below).

Academic development through service learning has been the focus of several studies in which researchers have found a correlation between service learning participation and increases in students' grades (Dean 
Additionally, research suggests service learning increases students' likelihood of reporting that they performed to their potential, ability to apply course principles to new situations, and classroom learning (Markus et al., 1993).
Related findings suggest a correlation between service and decreased truancy (Yates 
Still others have demonstrated a relationship between service learning participation and an increased likelihood of course completion, as well as an increased ability to link course lessons to civic or career situations (Axsom, 1999).

Supplemental Educational Services (SES) Statutory Authority: Section 1116(e) of No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, Public Law 107-110
Program Supplemental educational services are additional academic instruction for lowincome students grades 1-12 enrolled in Title I schools that are in their second year of school improvement, in corrective action or in restructuring status.
Activities The types of instruction available include individual tutoring, small group instruction or distance learning in the areas of reading, math and language arts by Pennsylvania approved SES providers after regular school hours.
Student Impact The intent of supplemental educational services is to aid eligible students who are in identified schools in need of improvement and ensure that students can achieve at high levels.
Chapter 4 and Standards Supplemental educational services are to be aligned with the Pennsylvania academic standards and the curriculum of the student's local school.
Chapter 4 Â­ Academic Standards and Assessment General Provisions: Section 4.2 Purpose Academic Standards and Planning: Section 4.11 Â­ Purpose of Public Education Section 4.12 Â­ Academic Standards Section 4.13 Â­ Strategic Plans Curriculum and Instruction: Section 4.21 Â­ Elementary Education Â­ Primary and Intermediate Levels Section 4.22 Â­ Middle Level Education Section 4.23 Â­ High School Education Section 4.24 Â­ High School 98
Identified schools for improvement must notify parents of eligible students that SES will be made available to their child.
If there are too many eligible students who seek services, then the school will have to give priority to the lowest-achieving eligible students.
Parents choose an approved SES provider to best meet their child's needs.
If not satisfied
with services, parents may select another approved provider for SES.
Local school should monitor the services their students are receiving to determine the effectiveness on student performance.
Parents and teachers will receive a "report card" for their child from the service provider on a frequent basis indicating the student's progress or lack thereof.
School district pays SES service providers for student services with Title I, Part A funds.
The cost per student is the lesser of the actual cost of the services or the per-child allocation under Part A of Title I.

Academic achievement has been affected consistently and positively by one-on-one tutoring of elementary students.
Tutoring by older students, adult community volunteers, trained paraprofessionals and certified teachers has produced substantial long-term improvements in students' achievement in reading and math.

Research consistently finds that family involvement has a direct, positive effect on children's achievement and is the most accurate predictor of a student's success in school.
Reading/Writing Programs help low-achieving students recognize that focusing on reading and writing skills is the foundation for effective learning in all other subjects.
When all groups in a community provide collective support to the school, an infrastructure is created that provides a caring, supportive environment where youth can thrive and achieve.

Evidence of increased success in school included: Â· Elementary school teachers reported improvement in the academic performance of 51% of students referred for academic problems.
Â· Middle and high school students referred for academic problems showed a small but statistically significant increase in GPA.
Â· Elementary school teachers reported significantly fewer attendance problems for students referred for attendance problems.
Â· Actual attendance data for attendance referrals in all grade levels showed that 53% of the students improved their attendance.
Â· Elementary school teachers rated a significant improvement in behavior among students who had been referred for behavior problems.
Â· Students referred for behavior problems and who had at least one referral or detention at baseline received significantly fewer office referrals or detentions.
Present and Accounted for: Improving Student Attendance Through Family and Community Involvement, Joyce L. Epstein 
Cross-sectional (Kaplan, Peck 
They exhibit a pattern of increasing absenteeism throughout their schooling.
Efforts to decrease high school student dropout rates therefore might be most effective if substantial resources are directed toward preventing elementary and middle school students' withdrawal and distancing from education.
(p. 308) School characteristics and practices can influence rates of absenteeism and truancy among students...
Historically, schools have addressed issues of truancy by blaming individual students.
Truant and chronically absent students were considered deviants (Corville-Smith, 1995; Hoyle, 1998).
Schools rarely involved families until the problem was so severe that the students were failing their courses.
Families are now being recognized as an important influence on student attendance and an important resource 105
for decreasing truancy and chronic absenteeism (Cimmarusti, James, Simpson 
For example, parent involvement in checking homework and reading with a child is associated with improved report card grades, achievement scores, and subject-specific skills (Epstein, 1991; Epstein, Simon 
Other researchers have reported that specific family involvement practices such as parental monitoring, parent-child discussions, parent participation at the school, and PTA membership are linked to student attendance (Astone 
Some parenting activities are more likely than others to affect attendance.
The extant studies suggest that schools that want to increase daily student attendance are more likely to succeed if they reach out and work with parents in specific ways to address this problem.
(p. 309) After controlling for prior rates of student attendance and mobility, a study of 39 elementary schools found that the quality of family, school and community partnership programs was associated with rates of student attendance (Epstein, Clark, Salinas 
(p. 314) A few specific activities that involve families and the community on issues of attendance helped to reduce the percentage of students who missed 20 or more days of school... activities were rewarding students for improved attendance, connecting parents with school contact persons, and making home visits.
(p. 314) Schools that offered after-school programs reported greater increases in average daily student attendance and decreases in chronic absenteeism.
After-school programs are beneficial to parents who work and who need afternoon daycare for their children.
However, these programs really are targeted to students.
Students may be motivated to come to school so that they can participate in activities that are organized in the after-school program.
The impact of after-school programs, however, may also reflect some schools' overall sensitivity to the needs and challenges facing the families and communities they serve.
(p. 315-316) The study suggests that schools are more likely to improve student attendance and reduce chronic absenteeism with three broad strategies: (a) taking a comprehensive approach to attendance with activities that involve students, families and the community; (b) using more positive involvement activities than negative or punishing activities; and (c) sustaining a focus on improving attendance over time. (p. 317)

National Dropout Prevention Center website The Center has "identified 15 effective strategies that have the most positive impact on the dropout rate."
Below are those strategies that relate to the Successful Students' Partnership Initiative.
Early interventions: Â· Family Involvement: Research consistently finds that family involvement has a direct, positive effect on children's achievement and is the most accurate predictor of a student's success in school.
Â· Reading/Writing Programs: Early interventions to help low-achieving students recognize that focusing on reading and writing skills is the foundation for effective learning in all other subjects.
Basic Core Strategies: Â· Mentoring/Tutoring: Mentoring is a one-to-one caring, supportive relationship between a mentor and a mentee that is based on trust.
Â· Alternative Schooling: Alternative schools today are designed to provide an alternative to dropping out of school, with special attention to the student's individual social needs and the academic requirements for a high school diploma.
Alternative schools exist at all levels of K-12.
Â· Out of school experiences: Since learning happens all day long, 365 days a year, many schools are providing after-school and summer enhancement programs designed to eliminate information loss, inspire interest in a variety of areas, and expand the knowledge base.
Making the Most of Instruction: Â· Professional Development: Teachers who work with at-risk youth need to feel supported and need to have an avenue by which they continue to develop skills, techniques, and learn about innovative strategies.
Making the Most of the Wider School Community: Â· Systemic Renewal: A continuing process of evaluating goals and objectives will provide an organizational structure that allows each school to develop a learning environment that ensures quality education for all students.
Â· Community Collaboration: When all groups in a community provide collective support to the school, an infrastructure is created that provides a caring supportive environment where youth can thrive and achieve.
Â· Career Education/Workforce Readiness: Workforce readiness programs recognize that youth need specific skills to prepare them to measure up to the larger demands of today's workplace.
Â· Violence Prevention/Conflict Resolution: Students who don't feel safe at school will not want to stay in school.
Dealing with conflict constructively is a skill that when adopted into a school's culture will provide a safe environment for learning.

Therefore, it is incumbent upon educational institutions to intervene with these students in order to help them build a sense of belonging and a sense of acceptance.
(p. 27) Low attendance may reveal embedded school culture or climate issues that should be further explored.
Systemic changes such as those outlined in Breaking Ranks: Changing an American Institution, a research-based report of the National Association of Secondary School Principals (1996), are necessary in order to sustain meaningful improvements in student attendance and achievement.
Exploring the Social Contexts Influencing Student Success of Failure: Introduction, R. Van Acker 
Community services that do work provide coordinated and integrated children's services across school and community organizations.
The linking of parent, school and community resources through integrated efforts helps amplify children's and youth's sense of nurturance and support.
Effective and high-achieving schools serving students at risk for school failure tend to be smaller, highly engaged with families and the community, and more nurturing than low-achieving schools (Wang 
Effective schools implement site-specific 108
plans for school improvement; employ teams of teachers for the planning and delivery of instruction; and mobilize community and school resources to support a comprehensive, coordinated plan to meet the individualized needs of all students, including those who are at risk for school failure.
Any effort to prevent school failure must take important social contexts into consideration when designing prevention and intervention programs.
The family, peer group, the neighborhood and community, and the school each plays a critical role in child and youth development.
Any school-based effort to promote student success also should involve strategies that are nurturing and academically engaging.
"Social-Emotional Learning: A Foundation for Academic Success," by Karin Frey, Ph.D., Committee for Children Students without supportive peer relationships tend to do poorly in elementary school (Wigfield et.
Al., 1998) and are more likely than other students to drop out of high school (Asher 
"Academic Performance and School Success: Sources and Consequences," 1997, by J. David Hawkins, Issues in Children's and Families Lives, Volume 8 Children who develop a commitment to succeed in school and who feel a sense of attachment to school and to their teachers are more successful academically than other children (Harachi, Abbott, Catalano 
Strategies and Successes in School Dropout Prevention: A Forum Brief, from the American Youth Policy Forum, 1995 Some student behaviors are more likely precursors of dropping out of school than others.
For example, there is a strong correlation between repeated school tardiness and absenteeism and dropping out, while participation in extra-curricular activities tends to lead to staying in school because it provides students with another "hook" if they reject the academic side of school.
Low basic skills, being over-age for one's grade, social isolation, frequent moves to different schools, deficient support systems, siblings who have dropped out, and low socio-economic levels also correlate with a potential to leave school early.
Policy decisions can have important effects on the incidence of dropping out.
Dr. Smink indicated several widely used policies that directly result in young people dropping out of school.
These include: out-of-school suspensions; graduation requirements; no opportunities to make up work; no summer school; automatic failure if more than ten days are missed; grade retention.
Some policies may need to be changed, others are based on real needs and could be adapted to prevent dropping out.
For example, students could receive in-school suspension or have strict requirements to keep up with work while out of school.
In another example, summer, alternative or Saturday school could be used to make up work to avoid the necessity to retain students in the same grade.
The National Dropout Prevention Center uses the following techniques to address the needs of youth at-risk of dropping out of school: school restructuring, prevention, mediation, intervention and recovery.
Following is a description of each of these techniques: 109

Restructuring schools so that they meet the needs of the learner is essential to successful and lasting education reform.
Restructuring demands a match between the needs of the students and the characteristics, climate, and practices of the settings in which the student must function or receive services.
Prevention includes approaches that anticipate, forestall, or deal with cognitive, social or personal problems before they irreparably impair a student's ability to perform.
Mediation is the process of providing an educational environment that ensures success for all students from pre-school through the 12th grade.
Mediation strategies are innovative curricular, instructional, and other school experiences designed to foster student engagement in learning.
Mediation is what you do before you "remediate" Â­ it means "Doing It Right the First Time."
Mediation and school restructuring are related: both rely on a systemic approach, rather than a huge number of unconnected programs with only short-term funding.
Intervention is designed to interrupt or modify academic, school, or personnel problems that are negatively affecting a student's performance.
Recovery seeks to reunite young people with learning and education once they have left school.
This is, by its very nature, the most difficult, expensive and least successful of approaches to meeting the needs of dropouts.
Recovery can only focus on a small number of former students.
For these reasons, the Center has de-emphasized recovery and concentrated most on prevention.
The National Dropout Prevention Center considers the following criteria important for the success of dropout prevention programs: Â· Professional Development Â­ Teacher Education programs don't usually equip teachers to work with young people in at-risk situations, so additional training is needed.
Â· Raising Reading Levels Â· Linking social services with schools helps the students and their families with a range of needs.
Â· Different Learning Styles Â· Mentoring Â· Peer-to-Peer Counseling Â· Alternative Schools Â· Parental Involvement "Respecting Cultural Diversity When Planning a Dropout Prevention Program," April 2000, by Roselyn Polk and Bill Evans, Children, Youth and Families Education and Research Network (CYFERNet) Some Â· Â· Â· components likely to contribute to academic failure among adolescents: Boredom Differing cultural and gender expectations Lack of parental involvement 110
Â· Â· Â·
Low self-concept and inadequate social skills Stress and pressures in family and peer relations A sense of alienation and isolations
"School Dropout Prevention: Information and Strategies for Educators," by L. Hale and A. Canter, 1998 National Association of School Psychologists, from the National Mental Health and Education Center Who is at risk for dropping out? Ethnic status: Demographic information suggests that while African American students complete high school at a lower rate than whites, when adjusted for differences in family socioeconomic status, their completion rate is comparable.
Hispanic and Native American students, however, have lower high school graduation rates than whites and blacks, even when economic status is taken in to consideration...
Gender: ... boys and girls do no significantly differ in dropout rates.
However, they seem to drop out for different reasons: Girls are most likely to drop out of school due to pregnancy and marriage, while boys are more likely to drop out to seek employment.
Additionally, boys are twice as likely to dropout as girls due to behavioral difficulties.
Achievement: Poor academic performance is the single strongest predictor of dropping out of school.
Poor grades and low test scores, regardless of ability, may increase student frustration and reduce motivation to stay in school.
Additionally, retention in grade in highly related to dropping out of school Â­ some research indicates that retained students are three times more likely to dropout than nonretained students.
Behavior: Students who drop out are more likely to have a history of serious behavior problems than those who complete high school, and this history may date back to the primary grades.
Prevention efforts may be enhanced by viewing behavior problems as symptoms of disengagement from school that can be addressed if identified early.
School attendance: School dropouts have higher rates of chronic truancy and tardiness than those who stay in school.
Attendance problems can be an early signal that the student is disengaging from the schooling process; daily school attendance reflects both student motivation and parental support.
Student attitudes toward school: Students who drop out are more likely to perceive the school setting as nonsupportive and/or irrelevant.
Some researchers suggest that the students' psychological attachment to school and investment in learning are keys to academic and social success, and consequently keys to remaining in school.
Family characteristics: Limited economic resources are highly related to school dropout rates, but the relationship appears to be indirect.
Many at-risk factors are related to family income Â­ parents' education, single parenting, academic achievement, behavior problems and school attendance.
Peer relationships: Dropouts are more likely than nondropouts to report social isolation and lack of involvement in schoolbased social activities.
While dropouts tend to be involved in community-based activities, those who remain in school build social networks connected to school activities and develop a sense of "belonging" to the school that seems critical to continued engagement.
School organization and practices: The school itself appears related to dropout rates.
Schools with rigid, retention policies, widespread administrative transfers, emphasis on competency testing, tracking and perceived "unfair" discipline practices tend to have higher dropout rates.
Large class size, high teacher turnover, low teacher expectations for student performance, 111
and perceived lack of support for students with academic and behavior problems are also related to student decisions to drop out.
Community Values: The student's community can also contribute to the desire to remain in school or drop out.
Employment opportunities for unskilled workers might encourage dropouts, while communities that clearly value education and encourage schoolcommunity partnerships are more likely to establish programs and foster attitudes that maintain student engagement in schooling.
Supports available to ethnic minority and low-income students are critical to ensure school completion.
Prevention and Intervention Strategies Prevention activities might include incentives and supports to improve attendance: programs to encourage parent involvement; early intervention for academic difficulties (such as peer tutoring programs); community and school-based mentorships; and partnerships with community business to connect school to work.
Development of high school alternative programs that provide nontraditional approaches to vocational training and high school completion will also provide options for students who have not been successful in meeting the academic or social demands of the typical school program.
What Can Teachers Do to Help Students Stay in School? Â· Focus on student goals: Instead of focusing on why the student is unsuccessful in school, have the student identify what he wants to get from the school experience.
Â· Encourage school involvement: If students' lack of academic success restricts them from every activity except academics, they often see no value in continuing to try.
"Academic Performance and School Success: Sources and Consequences," 1997, by J. David Hawkins, Issues in Children's and Families Lives, Volume 8 Children who develop a commitment to succeed in school and who feel a sense of attachment to school and to their teachers are more successful academically than other children (Harachi, Abbott, Catalano 
As a result of opportunities and reinforcements experienced in social groups that model, condone, or approve of these behaviors, individuals may be encouraged to engage in such behaviors (Bourgois, 1995). (p. 285) If expectations are developed through a process that extends opportunities for active involvement to include faculty, staff, students and parents; if the endeavor helps develop skills for participation in the process; and if those who participate are recognized for their participation, commitment to the school and its standards and their maintenance should be broadened (Mortimore, 1995). (p. 286) Academic achievement has been affected consistently and positively by one-on-one tutoring of elementary students.
Tutoring by older students, adult community volunteers, trained paraprofessionals, and certified teachers has produced substantial long-term improvements in students' achievement in reading and math.
(Wasik 
(p. 289) The studies summarized here provide consistent evidence that interventions to improve classroom management and teaching practices in elementary schools can promote the academic performance of students, including those at greater risk of academic failure and health compromising behaviors. (p. 292) Probably the clearest implication from the Gottfredson (1986) study is that in the context of a whole-school improvement effort, selective and indicated preventive interventions with students at greatest risk of school failure and health-compromising behaviors can have beneficial effects on academic success and on a major health and education goal, that is, school completion, even when implemented late in development.
(p. 298) The Comer, Gottfredson, and Felner intervention studies provide evidence that elementary and secondary schools can be reorganized to achieve key characteristics of effective schools.
Each of these interventions explicitly involved faculty in more joint planning and the use of consistent approaches toward students, emphasized learning, and explicitly involved parents more actively in school life and the education of their children.
(p. 299) It (high quality public education) includes school administrators who view their role as leadership in the creation of a community of commitment to learning and positive social development through the communication of high expectations for achievement and behavior; the modeling of instructional and personal leadership; and the development of opportunities and recognition for involvement of parents, students, teachers, helping professionals and community residents in the life of the school.
(p. 300) Education and Community Building: Connecting Two Worlds, Institute for Educational Leadership, 2001 Many schools are working to improve results by aligning all aspects of their programs.
By forging closer connections among instruction, student services and parent involvement, schools ensure a sharper focus on their central concern: improved student achievement.
(p. 3) Community Schools: Improving Student Learning/Strengthening Schools, Families and Communities, A Handbook for State Policy Leaders, Coalition for Community Schools, Institute for Educational Leadership, 2002 When community schools provide supports for families, family involvement in school programs increases and family functioning improves.
In many instances, the quality of life in the community also improves (Dryfoos, 2000). (p. 3) An evaluation (of the Polk Brothers Foundation's Full Service Schools Initiative) by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago found:...
When families see the school as a friend of the family and a safe haven, they are more likely to support the school in maintaining high expectations for learning and appropriate behavior.

(March, 2002).
This paper describes and evaluates the effectiveness of the Extended-Day Academic Support Program (in Arlington, MA), a 10-week after-school program that focused on improving student achievement, specifically in writing.
It begins with the program's three goals: improving grade 4, 5, and 8 students' achievement in writing; providing professional development for teachers in the teaching of writing; and giving parents access to information about how they can help support their children's writing development at home.
The paper addresses organization of the program, program evaluation components, preliminary findings and results, and pre- and postassessment writing results.
It notes that teachers, students, and parents were generally positive in their perceptions of the program, and that, for the most part, posttests showed a great deal of growth, especially in topic development and organization.
