26 Appendices A. Gifted Education Organizations B. Web Sites and E-Mail addresses INTRODUCTION When Act 917 of 1995 changed the funding process to local school districts regarding gifted and talented students it became necessary to update the Program Approval Standards for Gifted and Talented Programs.
The Department of Education saw this as an opportunity to include many areas and program options, which were not available in 1986 when the original document was written.
This update has been a long process but we feel confident that the document is now current and reflects national standards.
The Arkansas Department of Education wishes to thank the following people for attending meetings to update the Program Approval Standards and for editing numerous drafts.
The Department sought suggestions and ideas from as many sources as possible.
Each of the following people represented groups of educators, parents, community members, higher education and the Governor's Advisory Council for Gifted Education.
Input from all was necessary to ensure the continuation of a well developed document which has been, and continues to be, requested from around the nation: Tommie Sue Anthony, Mandy Bell, Linda Boswell, Heidi Cox, Mable Donaldson, Kim Duell, Roger Eveland, Marna Gardner, Beth Greenway, Davis Hendricks, Linda Johnson, Lynn Lovette, Brian Mefford, Gwen Morgan, Hazel Parker, Janet Parrish, Barbara Prichard, Ann Robinson, Danny Slay, Jeanna Westmoreland, and Ezerene Williams.
1 OVERVIEW
Responding to the concern for educational programming for gifted and talented students, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 106 of 1979.
This legislation established the Office for the Education of Gifted and Talented Children, headed by an administrator to direct the state program.
Funds were appropriated to provide financial assistance to school districts operating programs for gifted and talented students
.
Guidelines were developed to provide information to assist districts in planning, implementing, and evaluating programs for gifted and talented students.
This document, Education of Gifted and Talented Students: Guidelines for Local Education Agencies, was approved by the State Board of Education in 1981.
Since that time, a number of pieces of legislation enacted have had a profound effect on gifted education.
Act 445 of 1983, the Quality Education Act, established minimum standards for accreditation of public schools and authorized the State Board to name a committee to recommend regulations, criteria, and minimum standards.
The Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools, which were adopted by the State Board of Education February 22, 1984, included a provision that all districts must provide a program for gifted and talented students.
Act 34 of 1983, First Extraordinary Session, the School Finance Act, provided funding for districts which were developing or operating programs for gifted and talented students.
The Department of Education was directed to set aside annually, beginning in 1984-85, funds for program development, not to exceed $6 million.
Districts which were operating approved programs were eligible to receive funds based on an "add on" weight of .25 for each student identified as gifted and talented (funding was based on no more than five percent of the district's average daily membership).
The original guidelines developed to assist districts were then refined and updated and became the Rules and Regulations for gifted education in Arkansas.
This document, Gifted and Talented Program Approval Standards, was approved by the State Board of Education in 1987.
Act 917 of 1995 changed the funding process to local school districts regarding gifted and talented students.
The new law now stipulates an expenditure requirement replacing the funding provision that had previously existed.
This expenditure requirement reads: Local school districts shall expend from state and local revenues not less than the following amounts on gifted and talented programs, in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education - the previous year's average daily membership participating in gifted and talented programs, up to five 2 percent (5%) of the previous year's average daily membership, multiplied by fifteen hundredths (.15) times the base local revenue per student.
The following definition shall guide districts in providing services and opportunities for students identified as gifted and talented in Arkansas: Gifted and talented children and youth are those of high potential or ability whose learning characteristics and educational needs require qualitatively differentiated educational experiences and/or services.
Possession of these talents and gifts, or the potential for their development, will be evidenced through an interaction of above average intellectual ability, task commitment and /or motivation, and creative ability.
3 PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENT The purpose of this document is to establish the minimum standards for approval of programs which meet the requirements of the Standards of Accreditation adopted by the State Board of Education February 22, 1984, and have been effective since June 1, 1987.
Included are guidelines, which enable school districts to: 1) Establish equitable criteria for identification of gifted and talented students; 2) Establish programs which will lead to appropriate educational opportunities for these students; and 3) Establish procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of the provisions of these educational opportunities.
School districts may choose to work cooperatively to develop and operate programs for their gifted students.
Any mention of "district" in this document applies also to a group of districts working as a cooperative.
This definition does not include Educational Service Cooperatives established under Act 349 of 1985.
Standards for approved programs are listed on the following pages.
Evidence verifying compliance should be kept on file in the district so that it will be available for review by the Department of Education when the district is monitored.
Please note that these are minimum, not optimum, standards.
Districts are encouraged to go beyond them in providing educational opportunities for their gifted and talented students.
No school district may establish criteria which are less than the standards required in this document and the Arkansas Department of Education's Rules and Regulations for Gifted and Talented Program Approval.

18 8.00 PROGRAM OPTIONS Gifted children are as different from each other as they are from other children.
They have needs for differing amounts of homogeneous grouping, and at various stages of development their interests differ.
No single program option can ever meet all of the needs of all gifted children.
However, approved programs must meet for a total of 150 minutes a week during the regular school day.
Programs should be systematically developed, with long-range goals that are coordinated to guide the development of gifted students from the time they are identified through graduation from high school.
There must be consistency among the program's components; curriculum objectives and evaluation procedures need to be based on the district's philosophy of education.
Most program alternatives will include some kind of combination of enrichment (experiences which supplement the regular curriculum), acceleration (activities designed to allow students to progress at a rate faster than average), and guidance (planned activities that promote understanding of the self and one's relationship to others).
Districts are encouraged to be innovative in designing programs that combine these elements in ways that best meet the needs of their gifted students.
In whatever form the program for the gifted is organized, there must be clear delineation of roles, responsibilities, and coordination procedures.
A written table of organization outlining lines of responsibility and authority must be developed.
Possible administrative arrangements for providing programs for the gifted are listed below.
They represent the organizational patterns used in gifted programs across the United States.
Please note that these are descriptions of ways to organize program options, not prescriptions.
No matter which administrative arrangement is used, a minimum of 150 minutes a week direct instruction must be provided.
Exceptions to the 150 minutes requirement may be granted upon written request to the Department of Education, Office of Gifted and Talented, in the following circumstances: a.
If an approved teacher provides direct instruction to identified gifted students on a regular basis for at least 75 minutes per week, the remainder of the required 150 minutes may be met in the regular classroom, provided that there is a written management plan and that activities are developed and supervised by an approved teacher.
b. Independent studies and mentorships are developed in consultation with an approved teacher.
Though these program options may not require 150 minutes per week contact time an approved teacher 19 must meet with the student for at least 30 minutes per week to assess progress.

(see 5.00, paragraph 2) D. Whole Group Enrichment: An approved teacher of the gifted works with the classroom teacher to design enrichment curriculum for the whole class.
This option is considered long-term identification and therefore a portfolio should be maintained to document student(s) actions/responses.
The delivery of services to students must be at least 30 minutes a week.
The approved teacher of the gifted and the classroom teacher may organize teaching responsibilities as needed.
This option may be used in conjunction with other options to serve identified students.

B. Concurrent enrollment in high school and college: Student is enrolled in college courses while continuing to attend high school (SECONDARY).
Districts may choose to implement more than one of the foregoing patterns.
However, the maximum total of identified gifted students for whom a full-time teacher of the gifted may provide direct services is 75.
Waivers from this requirement, based upon program options offered, may be requested in writing by individual districts.
STANDARD EVIDENCE VERIFYING COMPLIANCE 8.01 Program is systematically developed, with long range goals that are coordinated to guide the development of gifted students from the time they are identified through graduation from high school.
A table of organization is developed which clearly delineates roles, responsibilities, and coordination procedures.
Identified students' placement in program options is based on their abilities, needs and interests, and resources of the district.
23 Written program goals 8.02 Copy of table of organization 8.03 Student assessment data 8.04 Administrative arrangements are used which promote interaction among gifted students and both their intellectual and chronological peers.
A minimum of 150 minutes a week direct instruction must be provided during the regular school day.
Schedule 8.05 Program Schedule 24 9.0 CURRICULUM Curriculum for the gifted must differ not only in degree, but in kind.
It is important to avoid simply "more of the same."
It should be coordinated with the district's basic curriculum objectives but must be in place of rather than in addition to required classroom work.
Students should not be penalized for being identified as gifted by being given extra work.
Teachers should be sensitive to student interests and talents in planning both cognitive and affective activities.
To assure that curriculum opportunities are appropriate to the abilities, accomplishments, interests, and cognitive and affective needs of gifted students, modifications should be made in content, process and/or product.
Content refers to the body of knowledge presented to the student.
Differentiation may be made in level of complexity, pace of learning, or degree of abstractness.
Another means of differentiation is the study of topics not ordinarily a part of the regular curriculum.
The process skills, which should be a part of the curriculum for gifted students, include critical thinking, creative thinking, independent learning skills, research skills, problem-solving, and logic.
Students in a gifted program should be expected to achieve a greater degree of proficiency in these skills than would be required in the basic curriculum.
Products are the end result of a learning experience.
Gifted students should be encouraged to develop products that use new techniques, materials, and forms.
They should be encouraged to select a specific area of interest and talent and pursue an intensive study rather than be assigned a prescribed problem.
Results of such investigations should be communicated to an appropriate audience.
Curriculum objectives must be carefully sequenced for continuity.
Development of a scope and sequence will avoid the "grab-bag" approach.
STANDARD EVIDENCE VERIFYING COMPLIANCE 9.01 Curriculum for the gifted extends or replaces the regular curriculum.

Evaluation, as it is applied to the program for the gifted, involves both a determination of the program's effectiveness and assessment of student growth.
The purpose is to provide accurate, timely, and relevant information to decisionmakers for improving program options offered gifted students.
The plan for evaluation is based on program objectives and is reviewed annually to determine its effectiveness in providing appropriate information.
This ensures that program changes or modifications reflect relevant data.
There are two purposes of evaluation: to provide information so that modifications and adjustments can be made in a program as it develops and to examine overall program effectiveness.
The evaluation plan must contain procedures for assessment in both these areas.
Only if the evaluation is carefully planned is it probable that really useful information can be obtained.
To make reasonable judgments about the effectiveness of various facets of the program, all components should be included in the overall evaluation plan identification, staff development, program options, curriculum, community involvement, program expenditures, and the evaluation process itself.
A variety of procedures including questionnaires, surveys, charts, graphs, statistical analysis, anecdotal data, etc., should be used because different components of the program call for different techniques.
Neither outcomes of the program nor attitudes of any stakeholders should be ignored.
Input should come from students, teachers, administrators, parents, school board members, other community members, and statistical analysis of enrollment and achievement data.
Program evaluation should also reflect an assessment of how the gifted program contributes to and articulates with the overall district improvement plan.
Evaluation of student growth must be based on appropriate and specific criteria and should include self-appraisal and criterion-referenced and/or standardized instruments.
It must be kept in mind that programs for the gifted deal with a unique population.
Gifted students' progress cannot be fully assessed by standardized tests, which have been normed on a heterogeneous group because these tests will not present a true picture of student growth in gifted students.
In fact, if a student has scored at the top of the scale on a test, the phenomenon of "regression toward the mean" may result in a lower score on the retest.
In choosing methods to measure student progress, care should be taken to ensure that the methods chosen: 1) are in agreement with program objectives; 2) involve the student in self-evaluation; 3) consider process as well as product; and 4) are appropriate and valid assessments of the population being tested.
26 The results are compiled into an annual report.
This report is provided to the State Department of Education, Office of Gifted and Talented, the local school board, school faculty and administration, parent groups and other appropriate audiences to seek formative feedback, resources, developmental assistance, and demonstrate reasonable accountability.
Participation in the gifted program must be noted on students' transcripts and permanent records.
