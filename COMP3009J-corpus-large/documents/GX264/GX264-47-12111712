____________________________________________________________________________ VENDOR RELATIONS AND AGENCY ROLES Local agencies are the primary point of contact between vendors and the WIC Program.
An effective working relationship between a local agency and the authorized WIC vendors in its service area is essential.
This assures satisfactory food delivery to the agency's WIC participants.
In larger agencies with sufficient staff, one staff person should be designated as the agency's vendor liaison.
The state agency Vendor Coordinator provides technical assistance to local agencies and authorized vendors on vendor matters.
The state agency Director is responsible for over-all policy and decisions regarding Alaska authorized WIC vendors.
The following is a list of agency roles: Activity Application Training State Agency Authorize/re-authorize vendors.
Provide training to local agencies.

Page5-3 Revision date 04/01/03
Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ______________________________________________________________________________ The state agency authorizes a sufficient number and distribution of vendors to assure reasonable participant convenience and access.
The state agency considers vendor applications on an on-going basis.
Authorization Process The following steps are taken in the process of authorization of a new vendor: 1.
Vendors wishing to participate in the WIC Program should contact the State WIC Vendor state.
The contact information for the WIC Vendor Staff is as follows: WIC Program Section of Maternal, Child 
Upon receipt of the vendor's request, and if a vendor is needed in that area, an information packet will be mailed to the applicant vendor within 10 days.
The information packet will include a WIC Vendor Application and Price Sheet which must be completed and returned to the address listed above.
The WIC Price Sheet information will be reviewed to determine competitiveness of prices.
The packet will also include the WIC Food List, a vendor manual, vendor guide and video.
3.
A pre-agreement on-site visit is made by a WIC representative for all initial vendor applications.
The local agency representative must complete the PreAgreement On-Site Vendor Visit Report and Price Sheet and send them to the state agency Vendor Coordinator.
The visit will determine if: Â· There is sufficient stock of WIC food items; Â· The submitted prices are accurate; Â· The location of the store is accessible to WIC participants; Â· Fresh merchandise is available and the store is clean; Â· Vendor understands information contained in the information packet, including the WIC Vendor Manual; and Â· Vendor's state and local operating licenses or permits are current.
Copies of these forms are included at the end of this chapter.
The local agency representative should remind vendors that this is a pre-agreement inspection only, and that they are not yet authorized to redeem WIC warrants until notified by the state agency.
4.
A report of the visit is then reviewed by the State WIC Office.
The WIC Vendor Coordinator will make a determination concerning the offering of an
Vendor Authorization
Page 5-4 Revision date 04/01/03
Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ____________________________________________________________________________ Agreement.
If an agreement is offered, the vendor will be mailed a WIC Vendor Agreement for signature.
5.
The signed WIC Vendor Agreement is returned to the State WIC office for countersignature by the State WIC Director.
A copy of the countersigned Vendor Agreement will be returned to the vendor.
6.The Vendor will be notified of the date they may begin accepting WIC warrants.
The vendor must not accept WIC warrants before this date.
Vendor Selection Criteria
Vendor Selection Criteria
The following criteria are used in reviewing vendor applications: Accuracy and Completeness All information in the application must be accurate and complete.
Vendor applications must be signed in ink.
Minimum Stock of WIC Foods The applicant must agree to stock all of the required WIC foods at all times in the quantities, sizes, and brands specified in the WIC vendor agreement.
Competitive Prices and Price Limitations Prices must be comparable as well as be within the price limitations of vendors in similar geographic area and/or volume of business.
Accessibility To Participants The applicant must be located in an area where a minimum of 10 WIC participants routinely shop and must be open at least 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.
Business Integrity Vendors may not be authorized if the current owners, officers, or managers have been convicted of or have had a civil judgment during the last 6 years for the following: fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, receiving stolen property, making false claims, or obstruction of justice.
Food Stamp Compliance The State agency may not authorize a vendor applicant that is currently disqualified from the Food Stamp Program or that has been assessed a Food Stamp Program civil money penalty for hardship and the disqualification period that would otherwise have been imposed has not expired.
Review of Inspection Report The on-site inspection report certifies that the applicant meets WIC vendor criteria and documents that initial vendor training has been performed.
Page5-5 Revision date 04/01/03
Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ______________________________________________________________________________ Approval/Disapproval of Applications Based on the information provided in the WIC vendor application and the on-site inspection report, the state agency will approve or disapprove the WIC vendor application.
All vendors will be notified in writing regarding the status of their application.
Vendors applicants that are denied authorization may appeal the decision to the Director of Public Health.
The final step in becoming a WIC vendor is the submission of a signed vendor agreement by the vendor to the state agency.
The vendor agreement must be signed by a vendor representative who has legal authority to obligate the vendor.
If the vendor is part of a corporate chain, a vendor agreement must also be in effect for the corporation.
Original agreements are kept on file by the state agency.
Once authorized, the vendor is assigned a vendor number for administrative purposes, and provided with a copy of the signed Vendor Agreement.
The vendor must not begin cashing WIC warrants until after the agreement has been signed by the state WIC Director and the vendor has been notified by the state agency that the agreement has been signed and warrants may now be cashed by the vendor.
Vendor Re-authorization Vendor agreements are in effect for two years from October 1, or initial date of authorization, through September 30.
At the state agency's discretion they are renewed at the beginning of each biennial year.
At least thirty days prior to the expiration of a vendor agreement, the state agency will send a notice of reauthorization to the vendor if in good standing with WIC requirements.
Minimum Stock Requirements for Small Rural Vendors Rural vendors provide an alternative to mailing monthly food boxes to rural and "bush" participants.
There are many advantages of having a local store in small villages.
Participants and local agencies do not have the problems of lost or damaged food boxes, and participants have access to fresher foods.
Shopping for WIC foods is a practical nutrition lesson, in which participants must pick out the most nutritious foods, such as 100% fruit juice and low sugar cereals, from the variety of choices available on a grocery shelf.
Because of the small number of participants as well as other customers served by these vendors, they may be exempted from some of the WIC minimum stock requirements for infant formula, infant cereal and/or fresh milk.
Local agencies, in partnership with vendors, make the recommendation to the state agency that a small rural vendor be given some or all of these exemptions.
The local agency recommendation should be made after a meeting with the vendor applicant during the on-site inspection visit by local agency staff, which is made as part of the application process for new vendors.

Vendor Reauthorization
Minimum Stock for Small Rural vendors
Page 5-6 Revision date 04/01/03
Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ____________________________________________________________________________ The decision to exempt a vendor from some of the WIC minimum stock requirements is made by the state agency, and becomes part of the Vendor Agreement with the state.
This decision is reviewed biennially as part of the Vendor Agreement reauthorization process.
The exemption status of a vendor can also be changed during the year.
For example, if a vendor originally agreed to stock infant formula but later found that redemptions for formula were too low and formula stock was going out of date, the local agency could make a recommendation to the state agency that the vendor's exemption status be changed.
If however there is a need for formula, the local WIC agency will inform the vendors to stock the formula at their store.
Vendors must then stock the formula within 72 hours of local WIC agency request.
Local agencies must carefully monitor the performance of these small rural vendors.
Formal or informal vendor site visits must be made when agency staff travel to these villages to provide participant services.
Reports of any problems from participants or health care providers in villages require immediate local agency follow-up by telephone or an on-site visit.
If the local agency determines that the vendor is not in compliance with minimum stock or other WIC Program requirements, the state agency should be notified.
Written warnings, sanctions, suspension or disqualification may be imposed by the state agency in cases where the vendor does not take acceptable action to rectify the situation.
VENDOR TRAINING Vendor training consists of interactive training, educational buys, refresher training and annual training.
Local agencies are provided by the state office with training on how to conduct vendor training and as well as training materials such as vendor guide, video and training outline.
Interactive Vendor Training Interactive training is provided to vendors at the time of initial authorization, and at least once every 3 years.
All new vendors must receive an interactive training prior to being authorized to redeem WIC warrants.
Initial vendor training is designed to provide new WIC vendors with an extensive and thorough overview of program rules and regulations.
The store manager must also be provided with additional initial interactive training.
Managers will receive further orientation and explanation of vendor responsibilities that includes a review of: Â· Â· All sections of the WIC Vendor Manual, giving particular emphasis to the vendor agreement and maintaining minimum inventory requirements at all times.
The vendor's responsibility for training employees.
Interactive Vendor Training

Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ______________________________________________________________________________ outline, vendor video, the "Cashier Instructions for Accepting Alaska WIC Warrants", and the "Cashier Quiz" from the WIC Vendor Manual.
Educational Buys An educational buy is a training tool that may be used during routine monitoring visits.
The local agency is encouraged to have a WIC representative conduct a mock redemption of a WIC warrant with one of the vendor's cashiers.
This should be done with the prior knowledge of the store manager.
This will assist in determining if the WIC transaction is being handled according to proper procedures and provide cashiers and managers an opportunity to improve performance should problems be detected.
Once the transaction is concluded, the representative will discuss the results of the buy with the store manager.
If problems are detected, refresher training should be conducted.
Documentation of this training should be done on the vendor monitoring form included at the end of this chapter.
Refresher Training Refresher training may take place during routine monitoring visits to strengthen and update vendor and cashier knowledge concerning WIC warrant processing procedures.
Vendors needing training assistance should be identified prior to site visits whenever possible.
Refresher training occurs with the cooperation of authorized vendors and works best with advance notice and coordination.
Refresher training may be requested by the vendor or it may be mandated by the state agency for vendors with a history of program errors and/or violations.
Documentation of this training should be done on the vendor monitoring form included at the end of this chapter.
Refresher training may include the subject areas in the Vendor Training Outline.
Refresher training must include dedicated time with the store manager.
Particular emphasis should be given to program compliance.

Sanctions
Local agencies must advise the state agency in writing of any abuses indicative of possible fraud or abuse of which they may become aware.
Abuse of the program by a vendor is just cause for termination of a vendor agreement.
Lesser penalties will be applied or administrative action may be taken, depending on the severity of the program violation.
Prior to disqualifying a vendor, the state agency will make a determination to ensure adequate participant access to WIC supplemental foods.
In areas where participants do not have access to another WIC vendor, the violative vendor may be imposed civil money penalties in lieu of disqualification.
However, the State Page5-17 Revision date 04/01/03
Chapter 5 - Vendor Relations ______________________________________________________________________________ agency may not impose a civil money penalty in lieu of disqualification for third or subsequent mandatory sanctions.
The State will include documentation of its participant access determination and any supporting documentation in the file of each vendor who is disqualified or receives a CMP in lieu of disqualification.
Participant access will be considered inadequate if: 1) Participant cannot travel to another authorized vendor within a maximum distance of 15 miles; or 2) Participant is unable to access another authorized vendor by the road system.
(e.g. participant will need to fly by plane or travel by boat to reach another WIC vendor); and 3) Mailing of WIC food boxes is not viable in the area The state agency will notify the WIC Program Food and Consumer Service, USDA, when a vendor is disqualified from the Alaska WIC Program.
The state WIC Director will determine the specific sanctions to be applied and action to be taken, and will notify the vendor in writing of the action taken and of the right to appeal.
A copy of the letter will be sent to the appropriate local agency.
The effective date of the suspension or disqualification of a vendor will be designated in the letter of notification to the vendor.
An appeal of suspension or disqualification will not have the effect of delaying the effective date of the action, unless the Director of Public Health determines otherwise.
A disqualified vendor may apply for recertification at the end of the disqualification period.
A vendor's history of noncompliance with WIC Program procedures, policies and regulations will be used as a criterion in determining whether such vendor is eligible to have a new WIC Vendor Agreement with the state agency.
The vendor's history of noncompliance with the Food Stamp Program will also be considered.
Errors The state agency understands that most violations of WIC Program regulations made by vendors are the result of error or misunderstanding of regulations, not deliberate fraud or abuse.
Vendors will be notified of errors, and will be offered additional training opportunities by the appropriate local WIC agency.
If errors continue, and it appears that efforts to deal with them through education are not effective, the state agency may take administrative action such as placing the vendor on probation or may lead to disqualification.
Errors of this type include but are not limited to the following: Â· Collecting sales tax on WIC purchases.
Â· Accepting WIC warrants outside of the valid dates shown on the warrant.
Â· Requiring a customer to make a cash purchase to redeem a WIC warrant.
