Town of Holden Beach, North Carolina SECTION 1: COMMUNITY PROFILE History Town Hall (constructed on July 10, 1970) sits on a tract of land that was given to the Town of Holden Beach by Emma Davis Holden, in loving memory of her husband, the late Dr. Rothschild H. Holden, D.D.S.
While Governor of Colonial North Carolina, Royal Governor Dobbs granted this tract of property on the Atlantic Ocean to Benjamin Holden in 1756 and it has been in the Holden family continuously since then.
It has been known as Holden Beach since 1785, according to official Colonial Records of that year.
The Town of Holden Beach was chartered by an act of the Municipal Board of Control on the 14th day of February 1969.
Geography Located in the southeast portion of Brunswick County, North Carolina, Holden Beach is midway between the historic port of Wilmington, North Carolina and the tourist attractions of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
The Town is located in the lower coastal plain of the state with elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 7 feet.
The Town of Holden Beach covers a land area of 3.44 square miles, which includes .48 square miles of water area (see Basemap of Holden Beach, NC Appendix E).
According to the 2000 Census there are 793 full time residents in the Town.
However, Town officials state that during the tourist season (mid-summer) the population swells to more than 15,000 to 17,000.
Climate The climate of Holden Beach in the summer is hot and humid with an average temperature of 77.6 degrees.
Land is frequently cooled during warm weather months by sea breezes.
Winters are cool having an average temperature of 47.3 degrees with brief cold periods.
Rain occurs throughout the year and, at times, is considered to be fairly heavy.
The average annual rainfall is approximately 56.9 inches, with 46 percent falling between June and September.
Geology Holden Beach is in a low-lying area with flat topography, adverse soil conditions, and poor natural vegetative cover.
Holden Beach contains an ever changing shoreline and two dynamic inlets at the east end (Lockwoods Folly) and the west end (Shallotte).
The physical landform of the island protrudes on the east and west ends and is separated by a narrow portion of the island at its center.
Of special note, the island has been eroding for many years and the Town has taken proactive measures to avoid the loss of shoreline.
These measures will be discussed in later portions of this plan.
Soils According to the soil survey published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1986, and the Septic Tank Suitability Map study prepared by the Division of Coastal Management (1996) the soil types found in Holden Beach are: BO Â­ Bohicket CA Â­ Carteret Loamy Fine Sand Co Â­ Corolla Fine Sand Du Â­ Duckston Fine Sand NeE Â­ Newhan Fine Sand NhE Â­ Newhan Fine Sand, Dredged
23
Community-Based Hazard Mitigation Plan All six types have severe limitations for septic tanks due to flooding, wetness, or poor filtering characteristics.
Bohicket (BO) soils are silty clay loam soils that are nearly level and poorly drained on tidal flats at elevations of 0 to 3 feet above sea level.
This soil has native vegetation adapted to tidal marsh.
Carteret (CA) soils are silty clay loam soils that are nearly level and poorly drained on tidal flats at elevations of 1 to 3 feet above sea level.
Surface runoff is very slow.
Permeability is very rapid.
Carteret soils also have native vegetation adapted to tidal marsh.
Important vegetation consists of smooth cordgrass and small areas of black needlerush.
Corolla (Co) soils are fine sand which is nearly level, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained soils on the inland side of the Outer Banks in low areas adjacent to undulating sand ridges.
Surface runoff is slow with very rapid permeability with high seepage rate.
Duckston (Du) soil is fine sand that is nearly level, poorly drained soil joining the marshes of the coastal area.
Surface runoff is very slow with very rapid permeability.
The water table is 1 to 2 feet below the surface and fluctuates with the tide and is subject to occasional flooding.
Newhan (NeE) is fine sand that is excessively drained soil on ridges between the beach and the inland side of the coastal area.
Some areas of this soil have vertical slopes joining the beach with elevations ranging from 5 to 30 feet.
Surface runoff is slow with very rapid permeability.
This soil is poorly suited to recreational and residential development due to slope, high seepage, caving of cutbanks, and sandiness.
Lawns and shrubs are difficult to establish due to leaching of plant nutrients.
This soil may have slopes ranging from 2 percent to 30 percent.
Newhan (NhE) is excessively drained, sandy dredge spoil.
Surface runoff is slow with rapid permeability.
The seasonal high water table is approximately 4 feet below the surface.
This soil is poorly suited to residential or recreational use because of slope, high seepage rates, caving of cutbanks, and sandiness.
Slopes can range from 2 percent to 30 percent.
Water Resources Holden Beach is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the south, the Intracoastal Waterway on the north, Shallotte Inlet on the west, and Lockwood Folly Inlet on the east end of the island.
Adjacent to the shores of these bodies of water is a dense level of residential development.
These bodies of water also provide for aquatic life propagation and survival, fishing, and secondary recreation.
Holden Beach retains its potable water from Brunswick County, which gets its water from the Cape Fear River.
There are currently two main waterlines coming to the island from Brunswick County.
To assist in the consistency of water pressure the Town and County jointly control pumping stations and a 300,000 gallon elevated tank located on the island.
There are approximately 2,080 taps distributed throughout the Town limits.
Natural Resources According to the 1997 CAMA Land Use Plan Holden Beach contains classified Areas of Environmental Concern (AEC's).
24
Town of Holden Beach, North Carolina Coastal Wetland (AEC's) Â­ These are predominately salt-water marshes associated with the northern boundary of Holden Beach.
They serve as a critical component in the coastal ecosystem.
Estuarine Water (AEC's) Â­ These waters also exist along the northern edge of the Town.
These waters are the dominant component and bonding element of the entire estuarine system, integrating aquatic influences from both land and sea.
Public Trust Water (AEC's) Â­ In Holden Beach these waters include the Atlantic Ocean, Intracoastal Waterway, and adjacent navigational canals.
They support valuable commercial and sports fisheries, have aesthetic value, and are important resources for economic development.
Estuarine Emergent Wetlands (AEC's) Â­ These are located primarily at the western end of Holden Beach adjacent to the Intracoastal Waterway and west of Sailfish Drive.
However, they can also be found between the northern edge of Sailfish and Swordfish Drive and the Intracoastal Waterway, between the northern edge of High Point Street and the Intracoastal Waterway, between High Point Street and the western side of Boyd Street, and at the eastern end of the island adjacent to the Intracoastal Waterway on the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway right-of-way.
Estuarine Woody Wetlands (AEC's) Â­ In Holden Beach these areas occur west of Sailfish Drive, between High Point Street and Boyd Street, between Scotch Bonnet Drive and Greensboro Street, on the north side of Greensboro Street right-of-way, and at the eastern end of the island on Corps of Engineers property.
Freshwater Emergent Wetlands (AEC's) Â­ These are located just west of Sand Dollar Drive on land owned by the Corps of Engineers.
Freshwater Woody Wetlands (AEC's) Â­ In Holden Beach these lands are located at the eastern end of the island and north of Ocean Boulevard East.
According to the North Carolina Heritage Program, Holden Beach has 6 threatened species found in or near the waters of Holden Beach.
The following are threatened species posted on the state and federal endangered list: Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) American Alligator (Alligator mississippinesis) Loggerhead Seaturtle (Caretta caretta) Green Seaturtle (Chelonia mydas) Carolina Gopher Frog (Rena capito capito) Seabeach Amaranth (Amaranthus pumilus) The North Carolina Heritage Program also identifies several significantly rare species found in or near the waters of Holden Beach.
The following are significantly rare species posted on the state and federal endangered species list: Wilson's Plover (Charadrius wilsonia) Freckled Blenny (Hypsoblennius ionthas) Beach Morning Glory (Ipomoea imperati) West Indies Meadow Beauty (Rhexia cubensis) Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) Moundlily Yucca (Yucca gloriosa)
25
Community-Based Hazard Mitigation Plan In addition there are several natural community or special habitat areas identified by the North Carolina Heritage Program, which are at risk of endangerment in the area of Holden Beach that are listed on the state and federal endangered list: Coastal Fringe Evergreen Forest Coastal Fringe Sandhill Pond Pine Woodland Small Depression Pond Tidal Cypress Â­ Gum Swamp Tidal Freshwater Marsh Colonial Waterbirds Nesting Site (Gull*Tern*Skimmer Colony)
Recreation Holden Beach hosts two public festivals each year: the Festival By the Sea held in October and the Day at the Docks held in April.
Additionally, the town collaborates with Brunswick County and the Holden Beach Merchants Association to sponsor the Concerts on the Coast program each summer.
Holden Beach also has a vast array of recreational activities such as: fishing, shell-fishing, boating, and other water activities, which are associated with the Atlantic Ocean, Intracoastal Waterway, Lockwood Folly Inlet, and Shallotte Inlet.
There are a total of 28 ocean access points that are provided by the Town of Holden Beach.
Population Trends Research shows that the growth in Holden Beach has been constant over the last 20 years.
Table 1.1 shows that the population in Holden Beach is increasing at a decreasing rate.
In 2000, the U.S. Census counted 787 persons residing in Holden Beach which is 161 persons more than in 1990.
The largest growth came between 1980 and 1990.
During that decade the population more than doubled with an additional 394 persons being added to the count.
It is reasonable to assume that the Town will continue to see an increase in population.
However, it is also reasonable to believe that this increase will continue to happen at a decreasing rate.
