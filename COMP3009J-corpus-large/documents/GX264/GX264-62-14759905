Executive Summary The University of Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research (IPR) conducted this research for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
The survey was conducted by mail in July and August 2002.
The survey was mailed to individuals in the following groups: ODOT Central staff; ODOT District staff; elected officials; county engineers; planners; transit systems and members of the trucking industry.
For the purpose of this report these groups are referred to as "stakeholders."
A total of 646 surveys were returned and included for analysis.
The mail survey asked these groups similar questions as those asked of Ohio residents in a telephone survey conducted in July 2002.
The major conclusions that can be drawn from this study include:
Transportation Issues Facing Ohio Â· Stakeholders mention several transportation issues as most important in Ohio: the maintenance and condition of the roads and highways in Ohio; funding and budget issues related to transportation; traffic and congestion; safety; and the lack or need for public transportation or alternative modes of transportation.
When survey respondents were asked about seven transportation issues and the importance of these issues for the future, respondents rank these issues in the following order (on a scale where 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important): Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Improving the safety of using Ohio's roadways (Avg. rating: 4.41); Improving transportation systems that help stimulate the growth of business in Ohio (Avg. rating: 4.04); Using information technology to provide real-time information about traffic accidents and congestion (Avg. rating: 3.65); Reducing the amount of time required for people to drive from their homes to where they work or shop (Avg. rating: 3.52); Providing alternatives to car travel (Avg. rating: 3.42); Providing better linkages among different methods of transportation, such as bicycle, pedestrian, car, bus, train, airplane, so that it is easy to go from one method to the other (Avg. rating: 3.39); and Limiting the expansion of roadways to reduce urban sprawl (Avg. rating: 3.11).
Â·
Â·
i
Overall Ratings of Ohio's Roads and Highways Â· A substantial majority of survey respondents rate the overall quality of Ohio's roads and highways as good or better.
Stakeholders give an average rating of 3.26 to the quality of Ohio's roads and highways (on a scale where 1=poor and 5=excellent).
A substantial majority of respondents also rate the overall safety of Ohio's roads as good or better with most respondents saying the safety of the roads and highways is "good."
Stakeholders give this issue an average rating of 3.29.
Â·
General Transportation Issues in Ohio Â· When respondents were asked about the importance of nine general transportation issues they rated the following three items the highest (on a scale where 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important): Â· Â· Â· Â· Relieving traffic congestion in Ohio (Avg. rating: 4.20); Reliability of travel time on Ohio roadways (Avg. rating: 3.93); and Having access to Ohio's airports (Avg. rating: 3.74).
Stakeholders rate the following two general transportation issues lowest in importance: Â· Â· Having access to a passenger rail system (Avg. rating: 3.05); and Having access to easily ride a bike from one place to another (Avg. rating: 2.86).
Â·
Stakeholders give ODOT their highest performance rating to the following two general transportation issues (on a scale where 1=poor and 5=excellent): Â· Â· Having access to Ohio's airports (Avg. rating: 3.24); and Reliability of travel time on Ohio roadways (Avg. rating: 2.98).
Â·
Survey respondents give ODOT the lowest performance rating on the following two issues: Â· Â· The availability of different methods of travel other than automobiles in Ohio (Avg. rating: 2.21); and Having access to a passenger rail system (Avg. rating: 1.94).
ii
Â·
Based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate as currently being only good, fair, or poor and which respondents also specify as important, the stakeholders do not identify a general transportation issue that should receive attention.
Over one-third of stakeholders say ODOT's effort to beautify highways and interstates in Ohio is "extremely important" or "very important."
Stakeholders give this issue an average rating of 3.15 in importance.
Over one-fourth of respondents think noise walls are "extremely important" or "very important."
Stakeholders give noise walls an average importance rating of 2.84.
Â·
Â·
Roadway Maintenance and Safety Issues Â· When survey respondents were asked about the importance of 13 roadway maintenance and safety issues they rated the following three items the highest: Â· Â· Â· Â· Visibility of road signs at night (Avg. rating: 4.49); Keeping snow and ice removed from the roadways (Avg. rating 4.47); and Maintaining traffic signals on roadways (Avg. rating: 4.41).
Although many of the roadway maintenance and safety issues are "extremely important" or "very important" to most respondents, stakeholders rate the following roadway maintenance and safety issue lowest in importance: Â· Maintaining the appearance of roadside areas, which includes mowing and eliminating weeds (Avg. rating: 3.49).
Â·
Stakeholders give ODOT the highest performance rating on the following three roadway maintenance and safety issues: Â· Â· Â· Keeping snow and ice removed from the roadways (Avg. rating: 3.81); Maintaining traffic signals on roadways (Avg. rating 3.72); and Visibility of road signs during the day (Avg. rating 3.66).
Â·
Survey respondents give ODOT the lowest performance ratings on the following three roadway maintenance and safety issues: Â· Â· Maintaining the appearance of roadside areas, which includes mowing and eliminating weeds (Avg. rating: 3.21); The smoothness of the riding surface of the roadways (Avg. rating: 3.09); and iii
Â· Â·
Keeping roadsides free from litter (Avg. rating 3.02).
Again, based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate lowest on performance and which respondents also specify as important, the following roadway maintenance and safety issues should receive attention: Â· Â· Â· Â· Keeping debris removed from the pavement; Maintaining clear road stripes and pavement markings; Safety of rest areas; and Visibility of road signs at night.
Roadway Construction Issues Â· When respondents were asked about the importance of nine roadway construction issues they rated the following three items highest: Â· Â· Â· Â· Keeping construction zone signs easy to read and understand (Avg. rating: 4.48); Keeping travel lanes in construction zones clearly marked (Avg. rating: 4.45); and Adequate location of advance warning signs prior to a construction zone (Avg. rating: 4.39).
Although all these roadway construction issues are highly important to stakeholders, they rate the following two issues lowest in importance: Â· Â· Providing advance information on construction projects (Avg. rating: 3.94); and Using electronic message signs in some construction project areas (Avg. rating: 3.89).
Â·
Stakeholders give ODOT the highest performance rating on the following three roadway construction issues.
Each of these issues focuses on the communication of construction projects to the public: Â· Â· Â· Posting speeds allowed in construction work zones (Avg. rating: 3.61); Keeping construction zone signs easy to read and understand (Avg. rating: 3.52); and Adequate location of advance warning signs prior to a construction zone (Avg. rating: 3.49). iv
Â·
ODOT receives the lowest performance rating for the following two construction issues: Â· Â· Providing and marking detour routes (Avg. rating 3.16); and Keeping delays associated with construction as short as possible (Avg. rating: 3.08).
Â·
Again, based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate lowest on performance and which they also specify as important, the following roadway construction issues should receive attention: Â· Â· Keeping delays associated with construction as short as possible and Providing and marking detour routes.
Â·
Slightly over one-third of stakeholders agree with the following statement: ODOT should complete construction projects in shorter periods of time, even if other projects will be delayed or eliminated.
A majority of stakeholders (62%) disagree with the statement, while 38 percent agree.
A majority of stakeholders agree with the statement: ODOT should completely close state and local routes that are under construction in order to shorten construction time even if travelers had to take a detour.
A majority of respondents (60%) agree with the statement, while 40 percent disagree.
at construction projects to be "extremely useful" or "very useful."
Â·
Â· Most survey respondents (63%) find the portable flashing electronic message signs used
Public Transportation Â· Most stakeholders see public transportation as important to the quality of life in their community.
Stakeholders give this issue an average importance rating of 3.01 (on a scale where 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important).
About one-half of respondents rate the quality of public transportation in their community as at least "good."
Stakeholders give an average rating of 2.56 to the quality of public transportation in their community.
A majority of stakeholders rate the overall safety of public transportation in their community as "good" or higher.
Stakeholders give the safety of public transportation an average rating of 3.21.
Over one-fourth of survey respondents say having a public intercity bus service is "extremely important" or "very important" to their community.
Stakeholders give this issue an average importance rating of 2.91.
Â·
Â·
Â·
v
Transportation Characteristics of Respondents Â· Thirty-one percent of stakeholders say they have used public transportation in Ohio during the past year.
Sixty-nine percent of stakeholders have not used public transportation in Ohio during the past year.
Almost all stakeholders, 98 percent, depend on personal vehicles most of the time to get where they want to go.

Importance and ODOT Performance Matrix Â­ General Transportation Issues Figure 4.3 plots the importance and performance ratings for general transportation issues.
By combining the results of these items from the importance ratings and the performance ratings, it is possible to construct a matrix that can be used for decision-making.
The vertical axis displays items as they are rated by the survey respondents in terms of the importance of the issue.
The horizontal axis displays how respondents rate ODOT's performance in these areas.
This chart illustrates how respondents rate ODOT's performance on these issues along with the importance respondents give these issues.
Upper Left Quadrant High Importance; Low Performance Lower Left Quadrant Low Importance; Low Performance Upper Right Quadrant High Importance; High Performance Lower Right Quadrant Low Importance; High Performance
The points plotted on the matrix are mean averages of the ratings.
The solid, thicker line represents the scale midpoint (3), while the dotted, thinner line represents the average of all nine general transportation issues.
The average importance rating for all nine general transportation items is 3.42 and the average ODOT performance rating is 2.53.
The thin line will be used as the reference point for evaluating importance and performance on these items since this line reflects how each general transportation item is rated against the other general transportation items.
Items that fall in the upper left quadrant should receive priority attention.
Located in this quadrant are items that respondents give high importance, but receive relatively low performance ratings.
For the general transportation issues no items fall into this quadrant.
Items that fall into the upper right quadrant are those items survey respondents give high importance to and those that give ODOT relatively high performance ratings.
These items include the following: Â· Â· Â· Relieving traffic congestion in Ohio (h); Reliability of travel time on Ohio roadways (i); and Having access to Ohio's airports (e).
18
Items that fall into the lower right quadrant are those that respondents see as less important, but also where they give ODOT high performance ratings.
No items fall into this quadrant.
Items that fall into the lower left quadrant are general transportation issues that respondents see as less important, but also give lower performance ratings to.
This quadrant includes: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Having access to a passenger rail system (d); Availability of different methods of travel other than automobiles in Ohio (g); Having access to easily ride a bike from one place to another (c); Availability of public transportation in cities and rural areas (a); Having access to easily walk from one place to another (b); and Ease of getting to public transportation in the area near where you live (f).

Roadway Construction Issues Importance of Roadway Construction Issues (Figure 6.1; Table 6.1): In the 2002
ACCESS OHIO Stakeholder Survey respondents were also asked about the importance of nine roadway construction issues.
Respondents rate most of these roadway construction issues as "extremely important" or "very important."
Almost all respondents rate the following three issues as "extremely important" or "very important": Â· Â· Â· Keeping construction zone signs easy to read and understand (96% and Avg. rating: 4.48); Keeping travel lanes in construction zones clearly marked (95% and Avg. rating: 4.45); and Adequate location of advance warning signs prior to a construction zone (93% and Avg. rating: 4.39).
Eighty to ninety percent of respondents rate four roadway construction issues as "extremely important" or "very important."
These four roadway construction issues include: Â· Â· Â· Â· Keeping delays associated with construction as short as possible (88% and Avg. rating: 4.27); Providing and marking detour routes (87% and Avg. rating: 4.24); Maintaining two lanes of traffic at all times during interstate construction (80% and Avg. rating: 4.18); and Posting speeds allowed in construction work zones (82% and Avg. rating: 4.14).
Although a majority of respondents rate the following two roadway construction issues as "extremely important" or "very important," they are the lowest ranked issues in importance: Â· Â· Providing advance information on construction projects (71% and Avg. rating: 3.94); and Using electronic message signs in some construction project areas (68% and Avg. rating: 3.89).

Conclusions
The major conclusions that can be drawn from this study include: Transportation Issues Facing Ohio Â· Stakeholders mention several transportation issues as most important in Ohio: the maintenance and condition of the roads and highways in Ohio; funding and budget issues related to transportation; traffic and congestion; safety; and the lack or need for public transportation or alternative modes of transportation.
When survey respondents were asked about seven transportation issues and the importance of these issues for the future, respondents rank these issues in the following order (on a scale where 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important): Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Improving the safety of using Ohio's roadways (Avg. rating: 4.41); Improving transportation systems that help stimulate the growth of business in Ohio (Avg. rating: 4.04); Using information technology to provide real-time information about traffic accidents and congestion (Avg. rating: 3.65); Reducing the amount of time required for people to drive from their homes to where they work or shop (Avg. rating: 3.52); Providing alternatives to car travel (Avg. rating: 3.42); Providing better linkages among different methods of transportation, such as bicycle, pedestrian, car, bus, train, airplane, so that it is easy to go from one method to the other (Avg. rating: 3.39); and Limiting the expansion of roadways to reduce urban sprawl (Avg. rating: 3.11).
Â·
Â·
Overall Ratings of Ohio's Roads and Highways Â· A substantial majority of survey respondents rate the overall quality of Ohio's roads and highways as good or better.
Stakeholders give an average rating of 3.26 to the quality of Ohio's roads and highways (on a scale where 1=poor and 5=excellent).
A substantial majority of respondents also rate the overall safety of Ohio's roads as good or better with most respondents saying the safety of the roads and highways is "good."
Stakeholders give this issue an average rating of 3.29.
51
Â·
General Transportation Issues in Ohio Â· When respondents were asked about the importance of nine general transportation issues they rated the following three items the highest (on a scale where 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important): Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Relieving traffic congestion in Ohio (Avg. rating: 4.20); Reliability of travel time on Ohio roadways (Avg. rating: 3.93); and Having access to Ohio's airports (Avg. rating: 3.74).
Stakeholders rate the following two general transportation issues lowest in importance: Having access to a passenger rail system (Avg. rating: 3.05); and Having access to easily ride a bike from one place to another (Avg. rating: 2.86).
Stakeholders give ODOT their highest performance rating to the following two general transportation issues (on a scale where 1=poor and 5=excellent): Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Having access to Ohio's airports (Avg. rating: 3.24); and Reliability of travel time on Ohio roadways (Avg. rating: 2.98).
Survey respondents give ODOT the lowest performance rating on the following two issues: The availability of different methods of travel other than automobiles in Ohio (Avg. rating: 2.21); and Having access to a passenger rail system (Avg. rating: 1.94).
Â·
Based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate as currently being only good, fair, or poor and which respondents also specify as important, the stakeholders do not identify a general transportation issue that should receive attention.
Over one-third of stakeholders say ODOT's effort to beautify highways and interstates in Ohio is "extremely important" or "very important."
Stakeholders give this issue an average rating of 3.15 in importance.
Over one-fourth of respondents think noise walls are "extremely important" or "very important."

Â·
Again, based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate lowest on performance and which respondents also specify as important, the following roadway maintenance and safety issues should receive attention: Â· Â· Â· Â· Keeping debris removed from the pavement; Maintaining clear road stripes and pavement markings; Safety of rest areas; and Visibility of road signs at night.
53
Roadway Construction Issues Â· When respondents were asked about the importance of nine roadway construction issues they rated the following three items highest: Â· Â· Â· Â· Keeping construction zone signs easy to read and understand (Avg. rating: 4.48); Keeping travel lanes in construction zones clearly marked (Avg. rating: 4.45); and Adequate location of advance warning signs prior to a construction zone (Avg. rating: 4.39).
Although all these roadway construction issues are highly important to stakeholders, they rate the following two issues lowest in importance: Â· Â· Providing advance information on construction projects (Avg. rating: 3.94); and Using electronic message signs in some construction project areas (Avg. rating: 3.89).
Â·
Stakeholders give ODOT the highest performance rating on the following three roadway construction issues.
Each of these issues focuses on the communication of construction projects to the public: Â· Â· Â· Posting speeds allowed in construction work zones (Avg. rating: 3.61); Keeping construction zone signs easy to read and understand (Avg. rating: 3.52); and Adequate location of advance warning signs prior to a construction zone (Avg. rating: 3.49).
Â·
ODOT receives the lowest performance rating for the following two construction issues: Â· Â· Providing and marking detour routes (Avg. rating 3.16); and Keeping delays associated with construction as short as possible (Avg. rating: 3.08).
Â·
Again, based on the assumption that priority should be given to those issues which respondents rate lowest on performance and which they also specify as important, the following roadway construction issues should receive attention: Â· Â· Keeping delays associated with construction as short as possible and Providing and marking detour routes.
54
Â·
Slightly over one-third of stakeholders agree with the following statement: ODOT should complete construction projects in shorter periods of time, even if other projects will be delayed or eliminated.

Constant, never-ending highway repair and reconstruction seems wasteful and unnecessary.
Why can't highways be built of materials that will last longer without constant repair? Is this a mechanism for reward of contractors and unions at out expense? Why don't we have better alternatives to the car? Small planes, trains, buses, high-speed rail? Is this our way of rewarding the autoworkers and unions and manufacturers? Why does general aviation cost so much? A small, 30 year old plane that should cost $7,000-10,000 goes for $80,000?? Land use patterns that rely less on the automobile should be a priority.
