IV.
Water Quality Improvement Criteria (Maximum 10 Points) Points are awarded based on the condition of the waterbody that the proposed project will affect.
For waterbodies that are included in both the surface water restoration and protection sections, the higher total point rating under either one of those sections must be used, but not both.
A. Surface Water Restoration (Use the 303(d) List to select one criterion only Â­ Max 10pts) The 303(d) List identifies impaired waters, known as Water Quality Limited Segments (WQLS's), for which required technology based controls are inadequate to meet water quality standards.
The list includes the watershed segment and name, suspected substances and potential sources of the impairment, and the priority for setting a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL).
Using the 303(d) List, points are assigned if the project benefits a waterbody with a high, medium, or low priority for TMDL development.
Also, points can be given if the project indirectly addresses a waterbody designated for TMDL development.
If the project benefits a waterbody in which more than one TMDL priority is identified, the priority with the highest point value should be used.
The Clean Water Action Plan uses a Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) approach to assess the condition of watersheds and based on the condition, classify the watersheds into one of four categories.
Category 1 identifies watersheds that do not meet clean water or other natural resource goals and need restoration.
Category 1 Priority Watershed uses watershed restoration priorities to identify the watersheds that are most in need of restoration during the next two years.
Bonus points are awarded to projects that benefit a Category 1 Priority Watershed.
B. Surface Water Protection (Use the Clean Water Action Plan to select one criterion only Â­
Max 6pts) Category 2 of the Clean Water Action Plan identifies watersheds currently meeting water quality goals but need preventative actions to sustain water quality and aquatic resources.
Points are awarded to projects that benefit Category 2 Watersheds.
Category 3 of the Clean Water Action Plan identifies pristine or sensitive watersheds that need an extra level of protection.
Selected Category 3 Watersheds are those Category 3 Watersheds with four or more selected indicators that meet Category 3 benchmarks.
Points are awarded to projects that benefit Category 3 Watersheds or Selected Category 3 Watersheds.
Bonus points will be awarded to projects that address a regional/local watershed plan to benefit water quality.
Examples of these plans include the Drinking Water Source Water Assessment Plans, Wetland Protection Watershed Plans, and the NPDES Municipal Stormwater Permit Plans.
C. Ground Water Protection (Select one criterion only Â­ Max 8pts) Points are as well as which the points will awarded to projects that benefit a Wellhead Protection Area for a public water supply, a Type I-III Aquifer.
A Wellhead Protection Area is the area surrounding a well from ground water is drawn.
Type I-III Aquifers are defined in COMAR 26.08.02.09.
Equal be awarded for projects that benefit any one of these categories of aquifer.
Bypass Mechanism and IUP Amendments: The Project Bypass Policy is summarized below.
A project identified on the Intended Use Plan (IUP) for funding may be bypassed to include another project for funding under the following situations: Â· Â· Bypassing of project in order to address existing or potential hazardous emergency condition as determined by the Department.
Bypassing of project within fundable range based on readiness to proceed.
a. b.
The owner notifies MDE that project will not proceed and/or does not intend to use the SRF.
The owner notifies MDE of intent to use SRF but not within 12 months.
Before MDE may bypass one or more projects on the Project Priority List (PPL) and the IUP, a letter must be sent to each of the system owners whose project may be bypassed to provide an opportunity to respond or provide additional information as appropriate.
A response must be received by MDE in writing within sixty (60) days of the letter, or MDE will conclude that the system owner is not interested in the SRF loan.
Upon concurrence to be bypassed by one or more system owners, MDE may then offer available loan funds to the next, unfunded project in order of their appearance on the PPL.
Projects that are moved up into the fundable range through this bypass mechanism must be amended into the appropriate IUP, and meet all requirements of the SRF Program.
If additional funds are available or if an existing IUP project is bypassed, MDE may amend the IUP to include new projects based on the priority ranking.
If the PPL needs to be amended to include a new project not previously identified, an opportunity for public comment will be provided through a notice in the "MDEnvironment ", a monthly newspaper with a circulation of over 6,500, including local governments.
Adequate time for review and comments will be provided prior to formal amendment of the PPL with new projects.
The Department will notify the EPA of any amendments and other changes that affect binding commitments or cash draws as EPA must approve changes to the EPA Payment System.
The IUPs submitted in prior years may be amended in this manner.
Tie Breaker: In the case of a tie in the priority ranking, projects will be selected in the order of the population served, drainage area treated, and linear feet restored.
The project benefiting the larger population, drainage area, and linear feet will be rated higher.
Public Participation: The draft IUP, PPL, and substantive changes to the Integrated Project Priority System are subject to a public hearing.
