Ar nette and Marjorie C. Walsleben The topic of this Bulletin is the national ef for t to reach youth who are absent or tr uant from school because of schoolassociated fear and intimidation.
The ongoing series of OJJDP Bulletins that centers on reaching these youth is part of the Youth Out of the Education Mainstream (YOEM) initiative, a joint ef for t of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Depar tment of Justice, and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, U.S. Department of Education.
The YOEM initiative focuses on at-risk youth who are truant, dropouts, fearful of attending school, suspended or expelled, or in need of help reintegrating into mainstream schools from juvenile detention and correctional settings.
Each Bulletin in this series highlights one of these five separate but often related categories of problems that cause youth to forsake their education and thus place themselves at risk of delinquency.
Little more than half a centur y ago, when the United States faced challenging times, an American president warned the countr y's citizens that they had nothing to fear but fear itself.
Once again, the countr y faces a threat: the invasion of safe havens for youth--its schools--by community violence and its concomitant, fear.
This Bulletin deals with some manifestations of street violence that have encroached on schools, territor y formerly thought to be inviolate: bullying, gangs, the possession and use of weapons, substance abuse, and violence in the community.
It documents the concern that educators, parents, students--citizens in general--have expressed.
The Bulletin also outlines strategies and describes programs that reveal that these same citizens are working vigorously in creative par tnerships to revitalize schools and make them safer.
Fr om the Administrator Thoreau once wrote in his jour nal that "nothing is so much to be feared as fear."
For many school-age children, however, fear is a realistic response to conditions in and around their schools.
The adverse effects of this fear are far reaching and often long lasting.
When fear keeps children out of the classroom, it can limit their prospects and their potential contr ibutions to society.
America was founded on the promise of oppor tunity.
Ever y child in our Nation deser ves the chance to live the Amer ican dream, and education is the pathway to that dream and to a fulfilling and productive life.
We must not allow fears engendered by bullying, gangs, weapons, and substance abuse to disrupt children's jour ney toward a better tomorrow.
Public Opinion Television news programs, daily newspapers, government reports, and results of public polls bombard citizens regularly with accounts of assaults, sex crimes, robberies, murders, and vandalism, and with the public response to such crime.
This bombardment could feed the fear that much of the public already feels.
However, in 1996, the juvenile arrest rate for murder was at its lowest level since the beginning of the decade.1 A 1996 analysis of juvenile homicides examined where such crimes occurred and found that 56 percent of the countr y's juvenile homicide arrests were made in six States and that four large metropolitan centers (containing only 5.3 percent of the Nation's juvenile population) accounted for 30 percent of such arrests.2 Nonetheless, the media have helped engender widespread fear Combating Fear and Restor ing Safety in Schools examines the climate of violence that threatens our schools and descr ibes steps that concer ned citizens are taking to restore secur ity and calm.
Because our children look to us to make their world safe, we must all become advocates for prevention and intervention programs such as those profiled here.
I hope that this Bulletin will encourage you to suppor t effor ts to eliminate the fear that plagues too many of our schools.
Shay Bilchik Administrator S G OVC RA MS Invasive Violence National data regarding rates of actual victimization at school are not available.
Schools and school districts currently are not required to repor t incidents of school cr ime and violence to any one national agency.
National infor mation that is available regarding student victimization is usually based on sur veys that poll a representative sample of students (and educators) about their own experiences and often about their perceptions of the violence experienced by others at school.
These results are often then generalized to apply to the total population.
However, a trend is developing toward standardizing incident repor ting on State and local levels.
This trend will help refine, expand, and update data regarding school crime and violence and will help to target limited resources to address issues of student victimization and school crime and violence.
that violent acts are taking an unacceptable toll on the lives, education, and opportunities of many young people in this country.
A 1993 national school-based sur vey that polled a representative sample of high school students showed that students' fear for their personal safety at school or traveling to or from school compelled as many as 4.4 percent of responding students to miss a day of school each month.
3 Of the respondents to a 1996 national random telephone sur vey of more than 1,300 high school students, nearly half of those in public high schools reported drugs and violence as serious problems in their schools.4 Data from a fall 1993 national sur vey polling 1,000 teachers and 1,180 students in grades 3 through 12 revealed that 23 percent of the responding students and 11 percent of the responding teachers had been victims of violence in and around schools.5 In addition to fearing personal victimization, many students also feel fear in response to violence experienced by other students.
For example, in August 1993, USA WEEKEND published an unscientific sur vey, the results of which were based on the written answers of 65,193 students (6th through 12th graders) who responded individually or as class members.
Sixty-three percent repor ted that they would learn more at school if they felt safer; 43 percent avoided restrooms; 20 percent avoided hallways; and 45 percent avoided the school grounds.
6 In a recent survey sponsored by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, nearly one-fourth of students in grades 7 through 12 reported that their schools had very serious problems regarding social tension and violence.
These problems were measured by students reporting the occurrence on their campuses of specific behaviors, such as hostile or threatening remarks between groups of students, threats or destructive acts other than physical fights, turf battles between groups of students, physical fights among groups of friends, and gang violence.7 Not only are many students afraid to attend school, but many parents and citizens in general also express concern for children's safety at school.
A 1994 national sur vey of parents of public school 3d through 12th graders indicated that 40 percent of parents of high school students were "ver y or somewhat worried" about their child's safety while in school or going to and from school.8 The National League of Cities surveyed 700 communities nationwide, including urban, suburban, and rural areas.
Results of that 1994 sur vey revealed that 80 percent of the respondents said violence was a serious problem in classrooms, hallways, and playgrounds; 40 percent repor ted that violence in schools had increased noticeably during the past 5 years.
In addition, 25 percent of the schools participating in the sur vey reported that in the previous year, students had died or suffered injuries requiring hospitalization as a result of violence.9 A community's manifestations of street violence--bullying, gangs, the possession and use of weapons, substance abuse, and violence in the community--could be a direct cause of the decline in educational opportunity.
These manifestations cause students to be fearful of going to school.
Both the topics and the promising strategies reported at the end of each section represent an overview developed by staff at the National School Safety Center (NSSC), in partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and the U.S. Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program.
The strategies suggested are a distillation of information gathered from NSSC's work on the Youth Out of the Education Mainstream initiative and school site assessments, examinations of curriculums, consultations with experts and youthser ving professionals in the field, and sur veys of topical ar ticles published in government reports, periodicals, newspapers, and the NSSC publications School Safety and School Safety Update.
Bullying The acts of violence featured in headlines are not the only concerns on today's school grounds.
Age-old "lesser" forms of violence are also widespread in and near schools.
Among the problem s confronting students and schools is bullying--the more insidious and fear inducing because of its commonplace occurrence at school and away from the notice of adults.
In this countr y, bullying has traditionally been viewed as some per verse sort 2 of child's play, its occurrence usually eliciting the common phrase, "Kids will be kids."
Today, bullying is rightfully being recognized for what it is: an abusive behavior that often leads to greater and prolonged violent behavior.
This phenomenon is more accurately termed "peer child abuse."
Schoolyard bullying, which occurs in kindergarten through 12th grade, spans many different behaviors--from what some may call minor offenses to the more serious criminal acts.
Name calling, fistfights, purposeful ostracism, extortion, character assassination, libel, repeated physical attacks, and sexual harassment all are bullying tactics.
In May 1987, international authorities on schoolyard bullies and victims gathered at Har vard University for a Schoolyard Bully Practicum, which was sponsored by NSSC in conjunction with OJJDP.
The practicum was one of the first meetings of prominent researchers, psychologists, school and law enforcement authorities, and public relations practitioners for the purpose of developing an awareness and prevention program to address bullying in the United States.
The following list of ser vices, strategies, and suggested training classes were identified by practicum participants as ways to mediate bullying: x Rules against bullying that are publicized, posted schoolwide, and accompanied by consistent sanctions.
x Student and adult mentors who assist victims and bullies to build self-esteem and to foster mutual understanding of and appreciation for dif ferences in others.
x A buddy system that pairs students with a particular friend or older buddy with whom they share class schedule information and plans for the school day and on whom they can depend for help.
x An on-campus parents' center that recruits, coordinates, and encourages parents to take part in the educational process, volunteer, and assist in school activities and projects.
x Classes for adults in parenting skills and for students in anger management, assertiveness training, and behavior modification training.
x Behavior contracts signed by students and parents and written behavior codes for students, teachers, and staff members that are circulated to all parents and students.
x Emphasis on discipline that stresses right behavior instead of reprimands that focus on punishing wrong behavior.
x Friendship groups that suppor t children who are regularly bullied by peers.
x Peer mediation programs and teen courts that train students to mediate problems among themselves.
x Conflict and dispute resolution curriculums available in all grades.
x Close monitoring of cafeterias, playgrounds, and "hot spots" where bullying is likely to occur away from direct adult super vision.
x Cooperative classroom activities and learning tasks, with care taken to var y the grouping of par ticipants and to monitor groups for balanced reception and treatment of participants.
x Classroom and schoolwide activities designed to build self-esteem by spotlighting special talents, hobbies, interests, and abilities of all students.
x Publicity about organizations and groups that build children's social skills and self-discipline, such as the Boys 
Both bullies and their victims need help in learning new ways to get along in school.
Curriculum developers and publishers now offer a variety of prevention/ inter vention materials to eliminate bullying from school life.
Three programs, highlighted in NSSC's School Safety, are outlined below.10 x No Bullying program.11 This Johnson Institute program, first implemented last year in schools across the country, pinpoints the "tell or tattle" dilemma facing many victims of bullying.
Weapons Carrying weapons to school has become an acceptable risk for many students, both those who are fearful and those who intend to exploit others.
Underlying the reasons students bring weapons to school may be the societal attitude that violence is an effective way to deal with problems.
Television and movies depict violence as an effective problem-solving technique used by "good guys" and "bad guys" alike.
Regardless of whether weapons are used in an act of aggression or as a defense against another's aggression, the reason weapons are brought to school often is related to the proliferation of gangs and drug activity on or near many school campuses.
A weapon is any instrument used with intent to inflict physical or mental harm on another person.
Although school officials are concerned with all weapons, knives, guns, and explosive devices present the greatest threat to school safety.
Weapons have been found and used on school campuses nationwide.
Of the 3,370 high school students sur veyed in the 1996 Twenty-Seventh Annual Survey of High Achievers, 29 percent reported that they knew someone who had brought a weapon to school, and 17 percent claimed it was not very difficult to obtain weapons at school.20 When looking at the prevalence of gun possession in particular, the 1995 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey found that 12.7 percent of student respondents knew someone who brought a gun to school.21 According to the same study, the percentage of students reporting this increased as their age increased (see figure 1).
A periodic sur vey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nearly 12 per cent of the polled students in grades 9 through 12 carried a weapon on school property during the 30 days preceding the sur vey, and 7.3 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the sur vey.22 In a study measuring schoolassociated violent deaths from 19921994, 77 percent of the deaths were due to firearms (see table 1).23 Startlingly, the cost of a death due to a single 22-cent, 9-millimeter bullet has been documented as including the following expenses: juvenile hall and jail costs for 1 year for four suspects, $85,710; a 2-week trial, $61,000; crime scene investigation, $13,438; medical treatment, $4,950; autopsy, $2,804; and State incarceration costs if the four suspects are convicted and ser ve 20 years, $1,796,625--for a grand total of $1,964,527.24 Extrapolated costs in terms of lives cut short and loved ones' grief, lost potential and productivity, and resulting damage to the Nation's psyche and society are inestimable, but nonetheless real.
Examples of strategies being implemented to prevent or inter vene in the use of weapons in schools include: x Passage of State and local gun-free school zones legislation.
x Passage of the Gun-Free Schools Act in 1994, which states that students be expelled if found with a weapon at school.
x Public awareness campaigns, such as a Boston billboard nearly the length of a football field depicting the faces of children and other victims of gun violence, "the largest of 200 signs erected Gang Prevention Through Ta rg eted Outreach, a national program first implemented in 1991 by the Boys 
Local Boys 
The clubs also use direct outreach methods to approach youth in the community.
The program focuses on enhancing a youth's communication, problem-solving, and decisionmaking skills.
Noting progress monthly, club professional staff help youth focus on specific developmental goals.
These goals include staying in school and out of the cour t system, improving scholastically, bonding with positive adults, and more frequently par ticipating in club events and activities.
In fiscal year (FY) 1997, B
In FY 1998, B
More than 140 clubs have implemented Targeted Outreach since its inception.
A previous process evaluation of the program found that once enrolled, 90 percent of the youth came to the club once a week or more, and 26 percent began to come in daily.
Many youth who par ticipated in club and civic activities received recognition for the amount and/or quality of their par ticipation, and 48 percent improved their academic performance.
A process and outcome evaluation has been funded by OJJDP and is currently being designed by Public/Private Ventures (P/PV).

Some survey results are discussed in more detail below.33 x Seniors.
Of the approximately 16,000 seniors surveyed, 54 percent had used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes; more than one-four th had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding their completion of the survey; one-eighth smoked half a pack of cigarettes or more daily; and more than half had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey. x Sophomor es.
Of the approximately 16,000 sophomores surveyed, 47 percent had used an illicit drug at least once; 23 percent had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey; almost 9 percent smoked half a pack of ciga- rettes or more daily; and 40 percent had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey. x Eighth graders.
Of the approximately 19,000 eighth graders surveyed, 29 percent had used an illicit drug at least once; nearly 13 percent had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding the sur vey; 3.5 percent smoked half a pack of cigarettes or more daily; and 24.5 percent had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding the survey.
Not only are adults disturbed by this national epidemic, but students are also concerned.
Regarding factors that contribute to violence against teens, three in five teens blamed drugs, according to a study sponsored by the National Crime Substance Abuse A fourth problem area that concerns educators, parents, law enforcement officials, legislators, and the public at large is the use and trafficking of drugs and alcohol in America's schools.
Recent sur vey by the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Ser vices.
A recent, comprehensive national sur vey of dr ug abuse in America was released August 6, 1997, by the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Services.
Based on a 1996 representative sample of the U.S. population ages 12 and older, including people who live in households and group quar ters such as dormitories and homeless shelters, the report pictured "the bright and the dark side of drug use by adolescents."
For the first time since 1992, illicit drug use by U.S. adolescents declined.29 The sur vey includes information on drug use, specifically revealing information on use of heroin, hallucinogens, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cocaine and offering population breakdowns featuring youth ages 12 to 17 and 18 to 26.
While the rate of drug use among youth ages 12 to 17 fell from 10.9 percent in 1995 to 9.0 percent in 1996,30 the survey indicated that in this age bracket, there was more first-time heroin use, increased use of hallucinogens, fewer teens who believed cocaine is harmful, and little change in cigarette smoking.31 An estimated 62 million Americans were found to smoke, including 4.1 million adolescents ages 12 to 17.
Smokers in this age bracket were found to be about 9 times as likely to use illicit drugs and 16 times as likely to drink heavily as nonsmoking youth.32 Annual sur vey by the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research conducts an annual survey that tracks the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in public and private schools in the continental United States.
The Monitoring the Future Study, also known as the National High School Senior Survey, is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The 1997 sur vey results reveal a leveling off of most drug use following the steady rise in use since the National Youth Gang Center The proliferation of gang problems in large and small cities, suburbs, and even rural areas over the past two decades led to the development of a comprehensive, coordinated response to America's gang problem by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
The OJJDP response involves five major components: x Implementation and operation of the National Youth Gang Center.
x Demonstration of the Comprehensive Community-Wide Approach to Gang Prevention, Inter vention, and Suppression in selected communities.
x An independent evaluation of the demonstration program.
x Training and technical assistance regarding community-wide responses to gangs.
x Targeted acquisition and dissemination of gang mater ials via the Juvenile Justice Clearinghouse.
What's Its Purpose? The National Youth Gang Center assists State and local communities in the collection, analysis, and exchange of information on gang-related demographics, legislation, literature, research, and promising program strategies.
What Does the National Youth Gang Center Do? The National Youth Gang Center : x Identifies promising gang prevention and inter vention program strategies.
x Analyzes gang-related legislation.
x Collects and analyzes statistical data on gangs.
x Collects and reviews gang literature.
x Coordinates activities of the Youth Gang Consor tium, a collection of Federal, State, and local agency representatives who wish to ease gang program development, information exchange, and ser vice deliver y between agencies.

9 Safe Alternatives and Violence Education (SAVE) is a violence awareness education curr iculum designed for 10- to 17-year-old students (and the parents of such students) who are found carr ying a weapon on or near a school campus.
The program was designed in 1993 in conjunction with a countywide effor t to reduce weapon possession by youth, especially on school campuses.
When a student is found in possession of a weapon on or near a school campus, the student and a parent are required to attend the SAVE program classes.
Addressing the relationship between violence and the media, the realities of weapon possession, and the consequences of violence, the class is a one-time, 6-hour, interactive violence awareness curriculum offered year-round on Saturdays.
Referrals may be made by police agencies, juvenile cour t/probation officials, local schools, community agencies, or parents.
Each SAVE class is staffed as needed by three police officers and a language translator.
Program administration is handled by one full-time coordinator and a supervising sergeant.
Several San Jose school districts use the SAVE program, either as an alternative to school expulsion or as a condition of suspension/expulsion.
In Apr il 1997, the Center for Educational Planning, a division of the Santa Clara County Office of Education, published a program impact evaluation of SAVE.
The evaluation reveals that almost 91 percent of the 372 students included in the study have had no subsequent weapons offenses after par ticipating in the SAVE program.
In addition, approximately 69 percent of the study par ticipants have had no subsequent offenses of any type.

Violence in the Community While bullies, gangs, weapons, and substance abuse all contribute to the fear experienced by many of today's students, violence in America's neighborhoods and communities cannot be overlooked.
Notwithstanding the sometimes unfounded and overgeneralized fear and apprehension about violence among children and adults, often fueled by the media, violence in America is a legitimate concern for ever yone.
Likewise, research and statistics regarding juvenile victimization cannot be entirely discounted as mere media sensationalism.
For example, according to America's Children: Key National Indicators of WellBeing, a repor t released in 1997 by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics in Washington, D.C., almost 2.6 million youth ages 12 to 17 were victims of violent crimes in 1994.
For this study, violent crimes were defined as simple and aggravated assault, rape, and robber y.43 The Federal Interagency Forum fosters coordination and collaboration in the collection and repor ting of Federal data on children and families, drawing on numerous data sources.
In 1995, high school seniors reported the following types of victimization at school: having something stolen (more than 41 percent); having property deliberately damaged (26 percent); being Prevention Council (NCPC), the National Institute for Citizen Education in the Law (NICEL), and OJJDP.34 In the 1996 TwentySeventh Annual Survey of High Achievers, almost one-half of the responding students stated that drug dealing occurred at their schools and in American society, 20 percent blamed drugs for the level of violence in their schools, and one in three believed drugs and alcohol were the most serious problems facing their high schools, a percentage that had more than doubled since the previous year's sur vey.35 Perhaps one of the main reasons so many students repor t using alcohol and other drugs is their availability.
Researchers for NCPC and NICEL interviewed 2,023 students in public, private, and parochial schools in grades 7 through 12 during the fall of 1995.
Twenty-nine percent said that it was "ver y easy" to get illegal drugs in their neighborhoods and another 31 per cent said that it was "somewhat easy or not ver y hard."36 Why do students regard alcohol and other drug use as one of the leading causes of violence on their campuses, and why does substance abuse trigger fear? Many students fear for the lives of their friends who have turned to alcohol and other drugs to cope with the problems, stress, or bore- dom they experience in their daily lives.
Often it is violence--including extortion, theft, prostitution, or drug dealing--that supports their habitual substance abuse.
Gangs who fight over their territorial rights to sell drugs on the street or on campus also engender fear.
With the encroachment of the drug subculture onto school campuses, many young people fear that they may succumb to peer pressure and end up addicted to drugs, thereby subjecting themselves to physical, mental, and emotional harm; risking the loss of opportunities to succeed; and compromising their long-held goals.
Strategies used to counter the influence of drugs and drug users among students include the following: x Declaring specified areas surrounding schools to be Drug-Free School Zones.
x Instituting educational programs at all school levels that teach students to resist drugs, for example, the Life Skills Training Program,37 which teaches drug resistance, self-management, and general social skills; Project STAR,38 which includes the involvement of the entire community, mass media effor ts, and health policy change; and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.Ã¯Â¿Â½),39 which is currently taught in many elementar y and middle schools.
10 x Changed the way they went to or from school (13 percent). x Carried a weapon (e.g., bat, club, knife, gun) to protect themselves (12 percent). x Got lower grades in school than they think they other wise would have (12 percent). x Stayed home from school or cut class (11 percent). x Found someone to protect them (10 percent). x Stopped attending a particular activity or sport (10 percent).
Approximately 1 in 8 students changed the way they went to and from school and more than 1 in 10 stayed home from school or cut class because of concerns about crime and violence in their communities.
Such behavior reveals that many students fear for their personal safety while merely attempting to attend school.46 The roots of violence reach deep into society, tapping into such complex conditions as poverty, racism, joblessness, and hopelessness.
Each epidemic of violence triggers "knee-jerk" calls for legislation and quick fixes.
Often, however, little is done in the long run to change conditions that give rise to violent behaviors.
It should be apparent that educators by themselves cannot carr y out their mandate of educating children while trying to rid their schools and surrounding communities of violence.
The National Association of School Boards of Education has pointed out, "A community problem necessitates community-wide solutions.
What has been coined `school violence' is nothing more than societal violence that has penetrated the schoolhouse walls."47 Community violence gives rise to subsets of associated violence that impact schools.
The effects of campus violence can be devastating to both individual students and specific learning environments.
Schools that lack effective discipline, respect for academic standards, and basic humanitarian values falter in their mission to provide safe and effective learning environments.
Students who live in fear of violence, witness violent acts, or actually become victims of violence suffer an array of consequences ranging from personal injur y and debilitating anxiety that inter rupt the learning process to a pattern of absence and truancy that can lead to dropping out of school and delinquency.
Such disassociation restricts individual options and limits the development of academic and life skills.
Listed below are some of the types of legislation and collaborative programs under taken by national, State, and local threatened with a weapon (more than 15 percent); and being threatened without a weapon (more than 23 percent).
Of these seniors, 4.7 percent had been injured with a weapon and 11.4 percent had been injured without a weapon.44 Many young people, aware of the dangers that exist within their communities and schools, feel compelled to make changes in their lifestyles.
Louis Harris and Associates, Inc., conducted a sur vey for NCPC and NICEL, Between Hope and Fear: Teens Speak Out on Crime and the Community.
Sur vey results were obtained from inter views of a nationally representative sample of more than 2,000 students in grades 7 through 12.
The purpose of this 1995 sur vey was to focus on "the effect of the awareness and fear of violence and crime on young people and the loss of freedom that results."45 Of the students inter viewed, 29 per cent said that they worried about being victimized in a drive-by shooting, and 46 percent had made at least one change in daily routines because of concerns about personal safety and crime and violence in their communities.
Following is a list of changes made in daily routines: x Changed friends (22 percent). x Avoided particular parks or playgrounds (20 percent).
The Adolescent Social Action Program (ASAP) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) uses peer resistance and decisionmaking training to increase self-efficacy, social responsibility, and life skills.
Youth par ticipants engage in social action activities to address conditions that lead to high-risk behaviors, such as substance use and abuse, gangs, and violence.
Preliminar y research findings indicate a significant impact on the development of positive coping skills, the ability to influence others, and reduced rates in teen drinking behaviors.
For more than 14 years, ASAP has operated in more than 30 communities in New Mexico, including Native-American reser vations and small, rural Hispanic communities.
At the hear t of ASAP is the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, whose model emphasizes listening, dialog, and action.
Small groups of students are taken on super vised visits to a local or regional hospital (three visits), a detention center (one visit), and the Metro cour t (one visit).
The students inter view the patients and inmates and listen to their stories.
Then, using cr itical thinking strategies, they examine the consequences of the patients' and inmates' actions through dialogs led by trained graduate and undergraduate university facilitators and reflect on their own lives.
ASAP staff also conduct and develop local and national training for teachers, community groups, and health professionals on empower ment-based education, peer education, and working with youth.

11 x School districts, in response to local needs, have stepped up effor ts to improve school security by installing security aids or devices and providing ser vices such as: y Completing criminal background checks on teachers and school staff members before a work assignment is made.
y Establishing Neighborhood Watch programs in areas near schools.
y Recruiting parents to provide safe houses along school routes and to monitor "safe corridors" or walkways to and from school.
y Enlisting parent volunteers to monitor hallways, cafeterias, playgrounds, and school walkways in order to increase visibility of responsible adults.
y Creating block safety watch programs carried out by area residents at school bus stops as a crime deterrent for school children and area residents.
agencies working in partnership that are producing positive results in reestablishing schools as safe havens for learning: x Nearly all States have developed some sor t of crime-free, weapon-free, or safe-school zone statute.
Most States have defined the zones also to include school transportation and locations of school-sponsored functions.
x The above statutes have given rise to zero-tolerance policies for such things as weapons and drugs.
These policies are enforced by school districts and individual schools, often with support from local police forces or school-based resource officers.
x Federal regulations established in 1994 mandate that all school districts set up programs to test school bus drivers for drug and alcohol use.48 x Schools are forging partnerships with court officials, probation officers, and other youth-serving professionals to share information on and monitor students who have criminal records or who are in aftercare programs following their terms of incarceration in juvenile justice facilities.49 x School districts are formulating crisis prevention/inter vention policies and are directing individual schools to develop such policies and individual safeschool plans.
y Fencing school grounds to secure campus perimeters. y Replacing bathroom doors with zigzag entrances, to make it easier to monitor sounds, and installing rolldown doors to secure bathrooms after hours.
y Designating one main door entr y to school, equipping exits with push bars, and locking all other doors to outside entr y. y Installing bulletproof windows.
y Equipping the school with closedcircuit video surveillance systems to reduce property crime such as break-ins, theft, vandalism, and assaults.
y Designing landscaping to create an inviting appearance without offering a hiding place for trespassers or criminals.
y Installing motion-sensitive lights to illuminate dark corners in hallways or on campus.

Parents and Schools Succeeding in Providing Organiz ed Routes to Tr avel (PASSPORT) is a joint effor t of the Visalia Unified School District, Visalia Police Depar tment, parents, and community-based organizations.
The Califor nia program provides super vised routes for students to use when traveling to and from school in high-crime or gang-or iented areas.
Parents receive a letter and map that indicate recommended travel routes.
Parent volunteers stand in front of their homes and "just watch" dur ing specified hours.
Fights, intimidating behaviors, or unsafe activities are immediately repor ted to the nearest school or to other appropriate agencies.
While on duty, parents wear badges bearing the school name and district logo; the back of the badge lists phone numbers for the school, the distr ict student ser vices office, confidential hotlines, and the gang suppression unit.
Par ticipating businesses along the route display bright yellow signs in their windows.
These businesses have agreed to allow students to use the phone if they are threatened or intimidated.
Students may remain at the business location until their parents pick them up.
School administrators and the safe school coordinator routinely monitor and walk the PASSPORT routes, and the police department regularly patrols the PASSPORT communities and routes.
Media publicity about PASSPORT encourages all citizens to watch over schoolchildren to ensure their safe passage to and from school.
The program depends on cooperative, volunteer effor ts; actual dollar costs are minimal.

12 Creating Safer Schools During the past decade in America, educational opportunity has gradually eroded in the Nation's schools.
That opportunity has been undermined by violence and the fear of violence.
Yet the Nation's basic precepts are intact: to provide educational opportunity, foster individual accomplishment in a diverse society, and preser ve guaranteed rights and freedoms for all citizens.
Numerous prevention and intervention strategies have been outlined here, each developed to ensure that the Nation's schools are able to educate children in safe environments and that all youth have the opportunity to learn, grow, and mature as socially responsible citizens.
Although these strategies are a good starting point, more such inter ventions are needed.
Through the efforts of educators, law enforcement officials, and parents-- working in concert to implement these strategies and continuing to test new ones--it is possible to reduce the violence found in today's schools and create safe schools in ever y community.

E. Lotke and V. Schiraldi, An Analysis of Juvenile Homicides: Where They Occur and Gang Resistence Is Paramount (G.R.I.P.)
In an attempt to curb gang membership and discourage future gang involvement, the city of Paramount, CA, initiated the G.R.I.P. program, former ly known as Alternatives to Gang Membership, which combines the resources of families, schools, and local gover n ment.
The program attempts to discourage future gang membership by teaching children the har mful consequences of this lifestyle and by pe rsuading them to choose positive alternatives.
Initiated in 1982, the program includes three major components.
The first involves neighborhood meetings that provide parents with suppor t, assistance, and resources as they tr y to prevent their children from joining gangs.
These meetings, conducted in both English and Spanish, often use audiovisual materials and focus on educating parents about gang activity, increasing family involvement, suppor ting spor ts and recreation programs, and increasing neighborhood unity to combat gang proliferation.
The second component comprises a 15-week course for fifth grade students and a 10-week course for second grade students.
The lessons deal with graffiti, peer pressure, tattoos, the impact of gang activity on family members, drug abuse, and alter native activities and oppor tunities.
Finally, a school-based followup program is implemented at the ninth grade level to reinforce what children lear ned in the elementar y grades.
The program builds self-esteem and also focuses on the consequences of a criminal lifestyle, the benefits of higher education, and future career oppor tunities.
This program has undergone five separate studies.
The first tested elementar y students before and after par ticipation in the program.
Pr ior to par ticipation, 50 percent were undecided about gang involvement, but after par ticipation, 90 percent responded negatively toward gangs.
The second study, also using a pre/post design, replicated the results of the first.
However, this study included a control group that was not exposed to the program; this group showed no change in their attitudes (50 percent undecided) over the same period of time.
The third and four th studies surveyed seventh and ninth graders, respectively, who had par ticipated in the fifth grade program; 90 percent (from both studies) indicated that they still had negative attitudes about gangs or stayed out of them.
The final study cross-checked the names of 3,612 former program par ticipants with local police records and found that 96 percent were not identified as gang members.

Bully-Pr oofing Your School.12 This program, available from Sopris West since 1994, uses a comprehensive approach.
Key elements include conflict resolution training for all staff members, social skills building for victims, positive leadership skills training for bullies, intervention techniques for those who neither bully or are bullied, and the presence of parental support
Second Step.13 The Committee for Children's Second Step curriculum teaches positive social skills to children and families, including skill building in empathy, impulse control, problem solving, and anger management.
Initial results indicate that students are able to identify more often with other people's feelings and are more readily able to control anger.
In the effor t to make schools and communities safer for children, it is important that educators, parents, and policymakers be encouraged to support schoolwide programs that address all forms of violence, including bullying and its organized manifestation, gangs.Bullying Among Childr en and Youth Susan P. Limber and Maur y M. Nation Recent research in the United States and abroad has documented that bullying is a common and potentially damaging for m of violence among children.
Not only does bullying har m both its intended victims and the per petrators, it also may affect the climate of schools and, indirectly, the ability of all students to lear n to the best of their abilities.
Moreover, the link between bullying and later delinquent and cr iminal behavior cannot be ignored.
Although studies of comprehensive antibullying programs are scarce in the United States, evaluation data from other countries suggest that adopting a comprehensive approach to reduce bullying at school can change students' behaviors and attitudes, reduce other antisocial behaviors, and increase teachers' willingness to inter vene.
Stimulated by the pioneer ing wor k of Dan Olweus in Norway and Sweden, researchers from several nations-- Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, Japan, Norway, and the United States-- have begun to explore the nature, prevalence, and effects of bullying among school children.
Their findings provide compelling reasons for initiating interventions to prevent bullying.
Its high prevalence among children, its har mful and frequently endur ing effects on victims, and its chilling effects on school climate are significant reasons for prevention and early intervention effor ts in schools and communities.
The phenomenon of bullying deserves special attention by educators, parents, and children concer ned with violence prevention for two significant reasons.
First, the prevalence of bullying and the har m that it causes are ser iously underestimated by many children and adults.
It is cr itical that any violence prevention strategy wor k to raise the awareness of children, school staff, and parents regarding the link between bullying and other violent behaviors.
Second, the nature of bullying does not necessar ily lend itself to the same interventions that may effectively reduce other types of conflict among children.
Because it involves harassment by powerful children against children with less power (rather than a conflict between peers of relatively equal status), common conflict resolution strategies such as mediation may not be effective.
Definition Bullying among children is understood as repeated, negative acts committed by one or more children against another.
These negative acts may be physical or verbal in nature--for example, hitting or kicking, teasing or taunting--or they may involve indirect actions such as manipulating friendships or pur posely excluding other children from activities.
Implicit in this definition is an imbalance in real or perceived power between the bully and victim.
changes in behavior were more pronounced the longer the program was in effect.
Moreover, students repor ted significant decreases in rates of truancy, vandalism, and theft and indicated that their school's climate was significantly more positive as a result of the program.
Not sur pr isingly, those schools that had implemented more of the program's components exper ienced the most marked changes in behavior.
The core components of the Olweus antibullying program have been adapted for use in several other cultures, including Canada, England, and the United States.
Results of the antibullying effor ts in these countries have been similar to the results exper ienced in the Scandinavian countries, with the effor ts in Toronto schools showing somewhat more modest results.
Again, as in the Scandinavian study, schools that were more active in implementing the program obser ved the most mar ked changes in repor ted behaviors.
Intervention Model The first and best-known inter vention to reduce bullying among school children was launched by Olweus in Norway and Sweden in the ear ly 1980's.
Inspired by the suicides of several severely victimized children, Norway suppor ted the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to address bullying among children in school.
The program involved inter ventions at multiple levels: x Schoolwide interventions.
A survey of bullying problems at each school, increased supervision, schoolwide assemblies, and teacher inser vice training to raise the awareness of children and school staff regarding bullying. x Classroom-level inter ventions.
The establishment of classroom rules against bullying, regular class meetings to discuss bullying at school, and meetings with all parents.
x
Individual-level interventions.
Discussions with students identified as bullies and victims.
The program was found to be highly effective in reducing bullying and other antisocial behavior among students in primar y and junior high schools.
Within 2 years of implementation, both boys' and gir ls' self-repor ts indicated that bullying had decreased by half.
These Bullying in the United States Although there have been few studies of the prevalence of bullying among American schoolchildren, available data suggest that bullying is quite common in U.S. schools.
In a study of 207 junior high and high school students from small midwester n towns, 88 percent reported having observed bullying, and 77 percent indicated that they had been victims of bullying during their school careers.1 A study of 6,500 students in fourth to sixth grades in the rural South indicated that 1 in 4 students had been bullied with some regularity within the past 3 months and that 1 in 10 had been bullied at least once a week.
Approximately one in five children admitted that they had bullied another child with some regularity in the previous 3 months.
2 These figures are consistent with estimates of several other researchers.
Further more, contrar y to popular belief, bullying occurs more frequently on school grounds than on the way to and from school.3 Continued on next page 4 Consequences of Bullying Studies of bullying suggest that there are shor t- and long-term consequences for both the perpetrators and victims of bullying.
Students who are chronic victims of bullying experience more physical and psychological problems than their peers who are not harassed by other children 4 and they tend not to grow out of the role of victim.
Longitudinal studies have found that victims of bullying in early grades also reported being bullied several years later.5 Studies also suggest that chronically victimized students may as adults be at increased risk for depression, poor self-esteem, and other mental health problems, 6 including schizophrenia.7 It is not only victims who are at risk for shor t- and long-ter m problems; bullies also are at increased risk for negative outcomes.
One researcher found that those elementar y students who were bullies attended school less frequently and were more likely to drop out than other students.8 Several studies suggest that bullying in ear ly childhood may be a cr itical risk factor for the development of future problems with violence and delinquency.
For example, Olweus' research found that in addition to threatening other children, bullies were several times more likely than their nonbullying peers to commit antisocial acts, including vandalism, fighting, theft, drunkenness, and tr uancy, and to have an arrest by young adulthood.9 Another study of more than 500 children found that aggressive behavior at the age of 8 was a powerful predictor of criminality and violent behavior at the age of 30.10 Antibullying Initiative Until recently, little attention has been given to the establishment of antibullying initiatives in U.S. schools.
Within the past several years, a number of school-based programs have been developed to address bullying, although the degree to which they embrace a whole-school approach to the problem var ies.
Only one U.S. program has been based explicitly on the comprehensive model developed by Olweus in Sweden and Norway.
Through a grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Gar y B. Melton, Susan P. Limber, and colleagues at the Institute for Families in Society of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, have adapted Olweus' model for use in rural middle schools in that State.
Inter ventions are focused at the levels of the individual, classroom, school, and community at large.
A comprehensive evaluation involving 6,500 children currently is under way to measure the effects of the program.

S.P. Limber et al., June/July 1997; D. Olweus, "Victimization by peers: Ante- Gangs A significant factor contributing to a climate of fear and intimidation in schools is the presence of youth gangs in the community and at school.
Based on a 1995 national sur vey of 4,000 local law enforcement agencies in urban, rural, and suburban areas, the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that there are as many as 23,000 youth gangs in the United States with more than 660,000 members.
The existence of youth gangs has been repor ted in all 50 States.14 The fear associated with gangs is related to such student-expressed concerns as the following: x Fearing gang disruptions at school or in the neighborhood.
x Encountering gang members on the way to and from school.
x Anticipating violence from known gang members enrolled at school.
x Receiving specific threats or being harassed by gang members who stake out territor y on school campuses or in neighborhoods.
x Facing peer pressure to join a gang. x Being mistaken as a gang member during school or in neighborhood skirmishes between rival gangs.
x Feeling threatened by school/neighborhood graffiti displaying gang territorial claims.
x Perceiving an increased presence at school of firearms and other weapons related to gang activity.
5 Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) is a program designed to reduce youth violence and gang membership through a curriculum taught by law enforcement officers to elementary and middle school students.
G.R.E.A.T. students are given the oppor tunity to discover for themselves the ramifications of gang violence through structured exercises and interactive approaches to lear ning.
Included in the curriculum are many optional and extended activities that reinforce classroom instr uction.
The law enforcement representatives and teachers wor k together to teach students to become responsible members of their communities, set goals for themselves, resist peer pressure, and resolve conflicts and problems.
Law enforcement officers become cer tified G.R.E.A.T. officers by attending either a 1- or 2-week training program, depending on their qualifications.
The training is provided free of charge at locations around the countr y. G.R.E.A.T. has trained more than 2,700 officers since 1991.
These officers deliver G.R.E.A.T. to students in more than 1,300 communities and on U.S. militar y bases around the world.
In 1995, under a grant from the National Institute of Justice, the University of Nebraska completed a cross-sectional sur vey of 5,935 eighth graders, 45 percent of whom had par ticipated in the G.R.E.A.T. program; the rest were used as a comparison group.
Preliminar y results suggest that G.R.E.A.T. had a significant impact on changing the behavior of students.
G.R.E.A.T. students exhibited more prosocial behaviors and attitudes than nonpar ticipants.
They were more attached to their parents and to school.
More of their friends were involved in nondelinquent activities, and G.R.E.A.T. students were more committed to these friends.
Par ticipants in the program repor ted that they were less involved in delinquent activity and fighting, were less likely to engage in impulsive or r isk-taking behavior, were less likely to perceive blocks to their academic success, and expressed stronger antigang attitudes.
However, these results reveal the program's effects after only 1 year.
To measure long-ter m effects, the evaluation team implemented a quasi-experimental research design in which students were assigned to G.R.E.A.T. or non-G.R.E.A.T. classrooms.
As par t of this longitudinal study, students completed pre- and post-tests dur ing fall 1995 and annual followup surveys in 1996 and 1997.
Additional sur veys are scheduled for 1998 and 1999.

value each member in a way that parents and other relatives cannot, attract adolescents in the throes of self-doubt, uncertainty, and feelings of powerlessness.
Beginning with gang initiation, however, intimidation and a new kind of fear that feeds on violent exploitation of others lead youth away from the mainstream and into byways and back alleys where weapons, drugs, delinquency, and crime replace schooling and responsible citizenship.
Increasingly, gang activity occurs when ethnic groups within a community develop "turf" rivalries, both in the community and on school campuses.
Gang leaders usually command obedience from a loyal core of subordinates and from rank-and-file gang members.
The key person in a gang often maintains authority through personal physical force and that of subordinates or by sheer force of personality.
Some school administrators have found ways to defuse campus intercultural and gang conflicts by co-opting gang leaders and enlisting their considerable leadership talents in carr ying out peaceful, prosocial school programs.19 In any case, if educators are to deal effectively with gang members on campus, they must remain vigilant yet innovative in exploring ways to advance school purposes and policies.
The following list represents strategies that schools currently use to that end:
x Establishing ongoing professional development and inser v ice training programs for all school employees, including training techniques in classroom management and in dealing with cultural diversity, disruptive students and parents, and campus intruders. x Conducting leadership training classes to assist students in developing insight and skills that enable them to work harmoniously with diverse individuals and groups.
x Offering classes incorporating curriculums on life skills and resistance to peer pressure, values clarification, and cultural sensitivity.
x Implementing dress codes designed to eliminate gang colors and clothing, publicizing the codes at school, and distributing them to all students and parents.
x Adopting school unifor ms--par ticularly for elementary and middle school students--sometimes optional and sometimes mandated.
Financial assistance should be available to parents who cannot afford uniforms.
x Experiencing alarm due to escalating interracial/ethnic tensions between gangs at school and in the community.
Public opinion supports the belief that gangs on school campuses are a major problem in communities across America.
For example, in a survey of 700 communities nationwide, 40 percent of the suburban communities and nonmetropolitan towns and cities responding said gangs were a factor in the violence in their schools.15 In addition, the Gallup Organization, in conjunction with the Phi Delta Kappan, annually polls the public regarding its perception toward public schools.
In the 1997 sur vey of persons 18 years and older, respondents repor ted that the four biggest problems for the public schools in their communities were lack of discipline; lack of financial support; use of drugs; and fighting, violence, and gangs.16 The 1996 Twenty-Seventh Annual Survey of High Achievers sampled behavior trends, opinions, and attitudes of 16to 18-year-old high school students who had A or B averages.
Of the teenagers surveyed, 19 percent knew of the presence of gangs in their schools.17 Many teenagers are vulnerable to the lure of gangs.
Membership in a gang is seen to confer a kind of identity that suggests "power, fearlessness, and domination," according to Albert Cohen in the foreword of Gangs in America.18 Youth who perceive par ticular deficiencies in their lives often seek to compensate by joining gangs.

x Reducing the length of time between classes to discourage loitering. x Establishing partnership academies, schools-within-schools, alternative schools, beacon schools, in-school suspension programs, and school-towork programs in collaboration with colleges and businesses in order to relocate and continue educating students with histories of classroom disruption, lack of motivation, and gang membership.
x Implementing victim/offender programs requiring juvenile offenders to make restitution to victims for damage or loss incurred or to perform community ser vice.
x Creating a climate of ownership and school pride by including students, parents, teachers, and community leaders in the safe-school planning process.
x Staging regular campuswide graf fiti and vandalism cleanup campaigns and cleanup rallies in response to specific incidents of defacement and destruction.
x Organizing crisis inter vention teams to counsel students coping with troubling violence in and near school.
x Offering students, especially juvenile gang members, special outreach and afterschool programs as an alternative to gang membership.
Weapons Carrying weapons to school has become an acceptable risk for many students, both those who are fearful and those who intend to exploit others.
Underlying the reasons students bring weapons to school may be the societal attitude that violence is an effective way to deal with problems.
Television and movies depict violence as an effective problem-solving technique used by "good guys" and "bad guys" alike.
Regardless of whether weapons are used in an act of aggression or as a defense against another's aggression, the reason weapons are brought to school often is related to the proliferation of gangs and drug activity on or near many school campuses.
A weapon is any instrument used with intent to inflict physical or mental harm on another person.
Although school officials are concerned with all weapons, knives, guns, and explosive devices present the greatest threat to school safety.
Weapons have been found and used on school campuses nationwide.
Of the 3,370 high school students sur veyed in the 1996 Twenty-Seventh Annual Survey of High Achievers, 29 percent reported that they knew someone who had brought a weapon to school, and 17 percent claimed it was not very difficult to obtain weapons at school.20 When looking at the prevalence of gun possession in particular, the 1995 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey found that 12.7 percent of student respondents knew someone who brought a gun to school.21 According to the same study, the percentage of students reporting this increased as their age increased (see figure 1).
A periodic sur vey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nearly 12 per cent of the polled students in grades 9 through 12 carried a weapon on school property during the 30 days preceding the sur vey, and 7.3 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the sur vey.22 In a study measuring schoolassociated violent deaths from 19921994, 77 percent of the deaths were due to firearms (see table 1).23 Startlingly, the cost of a death due to a single 22-cent, 9-millimeter bullet has been documented as including the following expenses: juvenile hall and jail costs for 1 year for four suspects, $85,710; a 2-week trial, $61,000; crime scene investigation, $13,438; medical treatment, $4,950; autopsy, $2,804; and State incarceration costs if the four suspects are convicted and ser ve 20 years, $1,796,625--for a grand total of $1,964,527.24 Extrapolated costs in terms of lives cut short and loved ones' grief, lost potential and productivity, and resulting damage to the Nation's psyche and society are inestimable, but nonetheless real.
Examples of strategies being implemented to prevent or inter vene in the use of weapons in schools include: x Passage of State and local gun-free school zones legislation.
x Passage of the Gun-Free Schools Act in 1994, which states that students be expelled if found with a weapon at school.
x Public awareness campaigns, such as a Boston billboard nearly the length of a football field depicting the faces of children and other victims of gun violence, "the largest of 200 signs erected Gang Prevention Through Ta rg eted Outreach, a national program first implemented in 1991 by the Boys 
Local Boys 
The clubs also use direct outreach methods to approach youth in the community.
The program focuses on enhancing a youth's communication, problem-solving, and decisionmaking skills.
Noting progress monthly, club professional staff help youth focus on specific developmental goals.
These goals include staying in school and out of the cour t system, improving scholastically, bonding with positive adults, and more frequently par ticipating in club events and activities.
In fiscal year (FY) 1997, B
In FY 1998, B
More than 140 clubs have implemented Targeted Outreach since its inception.
A previous process evaluation of the program found that once enrolled, 90 percent of the youth came to the club once a week or more, and 26 percent began to come in daily.
Many youth who par ticipated in club and civic activities received recognition for the amount and/or quality of their par ticipation, and 48 percent improved their academic performance.
A process and outcome evaluation has been funded by OJJDP and is currently being designed by Public/Private Ventures (P/PV).

Some survey results are discussed in more detail below.33 x Seniors.
Of the approximately 16,000 seniors surveyed, 54 percent had used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes; more than one-four th had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding their completion of the survey; one-eighth smoked half a pack of cigarettes or more daily; and more than half had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey. x Sophomor es.
Of the approximately 16,000 sophomores surveyed, 47 percent had used an illicit drug at least once; 23 percent had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey; almost 9 percent smoked half a pack of ciga- rettes or more daily; and 40 percent had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding completion of the sur vey. x Eighth graders.
Of the approximately 19,000 eighth graders surveyed, 29 percent had used an illicit drug at least once; nearly 13 percent had used an illicit drug within the 30 days preceding the sur vey; 3.5 percent smoked half a pack of cigarettes or more daily; and 24.5 percent had used alcoholic beverages within the 30 days preceding the survey.
Not only are adults disturbed by this national epidemic, but students are also concerned.
Regarding factors that contribute to violence against teens, three in five teens blamed drugs, according to a study sponsored by the National Crime Substance Abuse A fourth problem area that concerns educators, parents, law enforcement officials, legislators, and the public at large is the use and trafficking of drugs and alcohol in America's schools.
Recent sur vey by the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Ser vices.
A recent, comprehensive national sur vey of dr ug abuse in America was released August 6, 1997, by the U.S. Depar tment of Health and Human Services.
Based on a 1996 representative sample of the U.S. population ages 12 and older, including people who live in households and group quar ters such as dormitories and homeless shelters, the report pictured "the bright and the dark side of drug use by adolescents."
For the first time since 1992, illicit drug use by U.S. adolescents declined.29 The sur vey includes information on drug use, specifically revealing information on use of heroin, hallucinogens, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cocaine and offering population breakdowns featuring youth ages 12 to 17 and 18 to 26.
While the rate of drug use among youth ages 12 to 17 fell from 10.9 percent in 1995 to 9.0 percent in 1996,30 the survey indicated that in this age bracket, there was more first-time heroin use, increased use of hallucinogens, fewer teens who believed cocaine is harmful, and little change in cigarette smoking.31 An estimated 62 million Americans were found to smoke, including 4.1 million adolescents ages 12 to 17.
Smokers in this age bracket were found to be about 9 times as likely to use illicit drugs and 16 times as likely to drink heavily as nonsmoking youth.32 Annual sur vey by the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research conducts an annual survey that tracks the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in public and private schools in the continental United States.
The Monitoring the Future Study, also known as the National High School Senior Survey, is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The 1997 sur vey results reveal a leveling off of most drug use following the steady rise in use since the National Youth Gang Center The proliferation of gang problems in large and small cities, suburbs, and even rural areas over the past two decades led to the development of a comprehensive, coordinated response to America's gang problem by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
The OJJDP response involves five major components: x Implementation and operation of the National Youth Gang Center.
x Demonstration of the Comprehensive Community-Wide Approach to Gang Prevention, Inter vention, and Suppression in selected communities.
x An independent evaluation of the demonstration program.
x Training and technical assistance regarding community-wide responses to gangs.
x Targeted acquisition and dissemination of gang mater ials via the Juvenile Justice Clearinghouse.
What's Its Purpose? The National Youth Gang Center assists State and local communities in the collection, analysis, and exchange of information on gang-related demographics, legislation, literature, research, and promising program strategies.
What Does the National Youth Gang Center Do? The National Youth Gang Center : x Identifies promising gang prevention and inter vention program strategies.
x Analyzes gang-related legislation.
x Collects and analyzes statistical data on gangs.
x Collects and reviews gang literature.
x Coordinates activities of the Youth Gang Consor tium, a collection of Federal, State, and local agency representatives who wish to ease gang program development, information exchange, and ser vice deliver y between agencies.

9 Safe Alternatives and Violence Education (SAVE) is a violence awareness education curr iculum designed for 10- to 17-year-old students (and the parents of such students) who are found carr ying a weapon on or near a school campus.
The program was designed in 1993 in conjunction with a countywide effor t to reduce weapon possession by youth, especially on school campuses.
When a student is found in possession of a weapon on or near a school campus, the student and a parent are required to attend the SAVE program classes.
Addressing the relationship between violence and the media, the realities of weapon possession, and the consequences of violence, the class is a one-time, 6-hour, interactive violence awareness curriculum offered year-round on Saturdays.
Referrals may be made by police agencies, juvenile cour t/probation officials, local schools, community agencies, or parents.
Each SAVE class is staffed as needed by three police officers and a language translator.
Program administration is handled by one full-time coordinator and a supervising sergeant.
Several San Jose school districts use the SAVE program, either as an alternative to school expulsion or as a condition of suspension/expulsion.
In Apr il 1997, the Center for Educational Planning, a division of the Santa Clara County Office of Education, published a program impact evaluation of SAVE.
The evaluation reveals that almost 91 percent of the 372 students included in the study have had no subsequent weapons offenses after par ticipating in the SAVE program.
In addition, approximately 69 percent of the study par ticipants have had no subsequent offenses of any type.

Violence in the Community While bullies, gangs, weapons, and substance abuse all contribute to the fear experienced by many of today's students, violence in America's neighborhoods and communities cannot be overlooked.
Notwithstanding the sometimes unfounded and overgeneralized fear and apprehension about violence among children and adults, often fueled by the media, violence in America is a legitimate concern for ever yone.
Likewise, research and statistics regarding juvenile victimization cannot be entirely discounted as mere media sensationalism.
For example, according to America's Children: Key National Indicators of WellBeing, a repor t released in 1997 by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics in Washington, D.C., almost 2.6 million youth ages 12 to 17 were victims of violent crimes in 1994.
For this study, violent crimes were defined as simple and aggravated assault, rape, and robber y.43 The Federal Interagency Forum fosters coordination and collaboration in the collection and repor ting of Federal data on children and families, drawing on numerous data sources.
In 1995, high school seniors reported the following types of victimization at school: having something stolen (more than 41 percent); having property deliberately damaged (26 percent); being Prevention Council (NCPC), the National Institute for Citizen Education in the Law (NICEL), and OJJDP.34 In the 1996 TwentySeventh Annual Survey of High Achievers, almost one-half of the responding students stated that drug dealing occurred at their schools and in American society, 20 percent blamed drugs for the level of violence in their schools, and one in three believed drugs and alcohol were the most serious problems facing their high schools, a percentage that had more than doubled since the previous year's sur vey.35 Perhaps one of the main reasons so many students repor t using alcohol and other drugs is their availability.
Researchers for NCPC and NICEL interviewed 2,023 students in public, private, and parochial schools in grades 7 through 12 during the fall of 1995.
Twenty-nine percent said that it was "ver y easy" to get illegal drugs in their neighborhoods and another 31 per cent said that it was "somewhat easy or not ver y hard."36 Why do students regard alcohol and other drug use as one of the leading causes of violence on their campuses, and why does substance abuse trigger fear? Many students fear for the lives of their friends who have turned to alcohol and other drugs to cope with the problems, stress, or bore- dom they experience in their daily lives.
Often it is violence--including extortion, theft, prostitution, or drug dealing--that supports their habitual substance abuse.
Gangs who fight over their territorial rights to sell drugs on the street or on campus also engender fear.
With the encroachment of the drug subculture onto school campuses, many young people fear that they may succumb to peer pressure and end up addicted to drugs, thereby subjecting themselves to physical, mental, and emotional harm; risking the loss of opportunities to succeed; and compromising their long-held goals.
Strategies used to counter the influence of drugs and drug users among students include the following: x Declaring specified areas surrounding schools to be Drug-Free School Zones.
x Instituting educational programs at all school levels that teach students to resist drugs, for example, the Life Skills Training Program,37 which teaches drug resistance, self-management, and general social skills; Project STAR,38 which includes the involvement of the entire community, mass media effor ts, and health policy change; and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.Ã¯Â¿Â½),39 which is currently taught in many elementar y and middle schools.
10 x Changed the way they went to or from school (13 percent). x Carried a weapon (e.g., bat, club, knife, gun) to protect themselves (12 percent). x Got lower grades in school than they think they other wise would have (12 percent). x Stayed home from school or cut class (11 percent). x Found someone to protect them (10 percent). x Stopped attending a particular activity or sport (10 percent).
Approximately 1 in 8 students changed the way they went to and from school and more than 1 in 10 stayed home from school or cut class because of concerns about crime and violence in their communities.
Such behavior reveals that many students fear for their personal safety while merely attempting to attend school.46 The roots of violence reach deep into society, tapping into such complex conditions as poverty, racism, joblessness, and hopelessness.
Each epidemic of violence triggers "knee-jerk" calls for legislation and quick fixes.
Often, however, little is done in the long run to change conditions that give rise to violent behaviors.
It should be apparent that educators by themselves cannot carr y out their mandate of educating children while trying to rid their schools and surrounding communities of violence.
The National Association of School Boards of Education has pointed out, "A community problem necessitates community-wide solutions.
What has been coined `school violence' is nothing more than societal violence that has penetrated the schoolhouse walls."47 Community violence gives rise to subsets of associated violence that impact schools.
The effects of campus violence can be devastating to both individual students and specific learning environments.
Schools that lack effective discipline, respect for academic standards, and basic humanitarian values falter in their mission to provide safe and effective learning environments.
Students who live in fear of violence, witness violent acts, or actually become victims of violence suffer an array of consequences ranging from personal injur y and debilitating anxiety that inter rupt the learning process to a pattern of absence and truancy that can lead to dropping out of school and delinquency.
Such disassociation restricts individual options and limits the development of academic and life skills.
Listed below are some of the types of legislation and collaborative programs under taken by national, State, and local threatened with a weapon (more than 15 percent); and being threatened without a weapon (more than 23 percent).
Of these seniors, 4.7 percent had been injured with a weapon and 11.4 percent had been injured without a weapon.44 Many young people, aware of the dangers that exist within their communities and schools, feel compelled to make changes in their lifestyles.
Louis Harris and Associates, Inc., conducted a sur vey for NCPC and NICEL, Between Hope and Fear: Teens Speak Out on Crime and the Community.
Sur vey results were obtained from inter views of a nationally representative sample of more than 2,000 students in grades 7 through 12.
The purpose of this 1995 sur vey was to focus on "the effect of the awareness and fear of violence and crime on young people and the loss of freedom that results."45 Of the students inter viewed, 29 per cent said that they worried about being victimized in a drive-by shooting, and 46 percent had made at least one change in daily routines because of concerns about personal safety and crime and violence in their communities.
Following is a list of changes made in daily routines: x Changed friends (22 percent). x Avoided particular parks or playgrounds (20 percent).
The Adolescent Social Action Program (ASAP) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) uses peer resistance and decisionmaking training to increase self-efficacy, social responsibility, and life skills.
Youth par ticipants engage in social action activities to address conditions that lead to high-risk behaviors, such as substance use and abuse, gangs, and violence.
Preliminar y research findings indicate a significant impact on the development of positive coping skills, the ability to influence others, and reduced rates in teen drinking behaviors.
For more than 14 years, ASAP has operated in more than 30 communities in New Mexico, including Native-American reser vations and small, rural Hispanic communities.
At the hear t of ASAP is the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, whose model emphasizes listening, dialog, and action.
Small groups of students are taken on super vised visits to a local or regional hospital (three visits), a detention center (one visit), and the Metro cour t (one visit).
The students inter view the patients and inmates and listen to their stories.
Then, using cr itical thinking strategies, they examine the consequences of the patients' and inmates' actions through dialogs led by trained graduate and undergraduate university facilitators and reflect on their own lives.
ASAP staff also conduct and develop local and national training for teachers, community groups, and health professionals on empower ment-based education, peer education, and working with youth.

11 x School districts, in response to local needs, have stepped up effor ts to improve school security by installing security aids or devices and providing ser vices such as: y Completing criminal background checks on teachers and school staff members before a work assignment is made.
y Establishing Neighborhood Watch programs in areas near schools.
y Recruiting parents to provide safe houses along school routes and to monitor "safe corridors" or walkways to and from school.
y Enlisting parent volunteers to monitor hallways, cafeterias, playgrounds, and school walkways in order to increase visibility of responsible adults.
y Creating block safety watch programs carried out by area residents at school bus stops as a crime deterrent for school children and area residents.
agencies working in partnership that are producing positive results in reestablishing schools as safe havens for learning: x Nearly all States have developed some sor t of crime-free, weapon-free, or safe-school zone statute.
Most States have defined the zones also to include school transportation and locations of school-sponsored functions.
x The above statutes have given rise to zero-tolerance policies for such things as weapons and drugs.
These policies are enforced by school districts and individual schools, often with support from local police forces or school-based resource officers.
x Federal regulations established in 1994 mandate that all school districts set up programs to test school bus drivers for drug and alcohol use.48 x Schools are forging partnerships with court officials, probation officers, and other youth-serving professionals to share information on and monitor students who have criminal records or who are in aftercare programs following their terms of incarceration in juvenile justice facilities.49 x School districts are formulating crisis prevention/inter vention policies and are directing individual schools to develop such policies and individual safeschool plans.
y Fencing school grounds to secure campus perimeters. y Replacing bathroom doors with zigzag entrances, to make it easier to monitor sounds, and installing rolldown doors to secure bathrooms after hours.
y Designating one main door entr y to school, equipping exits with push bars, and locking all other doors to outside entr y. y Installing bulletproof windows.
y Equipping the school with closedcircuit video surveillance systems to reduce property crime such as break-ins, theft, vandalism, and assaults.
y Designing landscaping to create an inviting appearance without offering a hiding place for trespassers or criminals.
y Installing motion-sensitive lights to illuminate dark corners in hallways or on campus.
y Mounting convex mirrors to monitor blind spots in school hallways.
y Equipping classrooms with intercom systems connected to the central school office.
y Issuing two-way radios to security patrols or campus staff members.
y Purchasing cellular phones for use in crises or emergency situations.

Parents and Schools Succeeding in Providing Organiz ed Routes to Tr avel (PASSPORT) is a joint effor t of the Visalia Unified School District, Visalia Police Depar tment, parents, and community-based organizations.
The Califor nia program provides super vised routes for students to use when traveling to and from school in high-crime or gang-or iented areas.
Parents receive a letter and map that indicate recommended travel routes.
Parent volunteers stand in front of their homes and "just watch" dur ing specified hours.
Fights, intimidating behaviors, or unsafe activities are immediately repor ted to the nearest school or to other appropriate agencies.
While on duty, parents wear badges bearing the school name and district logo; the back of the badge lists phone numbers for the school, the distr ict student ser vices office, confidential hotlines, and the gang suppression unit.
Par ticipating businesses along the route display bright yellow signs in their windows.
These businesses have agreed to allow students to use the phone if they are threatened or intimidated.
Students may remain at the business location until their parents pick them up.
School administrators and the safe school coordinator routinely monitor and walk the PASSPORT routes, and the police department regularly patrols the PASSPORT communities and routes.
Media publicity about PASSPORT encourages all citizens to watch over schoolchildren to ensure their safe passage to and from school.
The program depends on cooperative, volunteer effor ts; actual dollar costs are minimal.

12 Creating Safer Schools During the past decade in America, educational opportunity has gradually eroded in the Nation's schools.
That opportunity has been undermined by violence and the fear of violence.
Yet the Nation's basic precepts are intact: to provide educational opportunity, foster individual accomplishment in a diverse society, and preser ve guaranteed rights and freedoms for all citizens.
Numerous prevention and intervention strategies have been outlined here, each developed to ensure that the Nation's schools are able to educate children in safe environments and that all youth have the opportunity to learn, grow, and mature as socially responsible citizens.
Although these strategies are a good starting point, more such inter ventions are needed.
Through the efforts of educators, law enforcement officials, and parents-- working in concert to implement these strategies and continuing to test new ones--it is possible to reduce the violence found in today's schools and create safe schools in ever y community.

E. Lotke and V. Schiraldi, An Analysis of Juvenile Homicides: Where They Occur and Gang Resistence Is Paramount (G.R.I.P.)
In an attempt to curb gang membership and discourage future gang involvement, the city of Paramount, CA, initiated the G.R.I.P. program, former ly known as Alternatives to Gang Membership, which combines the resources of families, schools, and local gover n ment.
The program attempts to discourage future gang membership by teaching children the har mful consequences of this lifestyle and by pe rsuading them to choose positive alternatives.
Initiated in 1982, the program includes three major components.
The first involves neighborhood meetings that provide parents with suppor t, assistance, and resources as they tr y to prevent their children from joining gangs.
These meetings, conducted in both English and Spanish, often use audiovisual materials and focus on educating parents about gang activity, increasing family involvement, suppor ting spor ts and recreation programs, and increasing neighborhood unity to combat gang proliferation.
The second component comprises a 15-week course for fifth grade students and a 10-week course for second grade students.
The lessons deal with graffiti, peer pressure, tattoos, the impact of gang activity on family members, drug abuse, and alter native activities and oppor tunities.
Finally, a school-based followup program is implemented at the ninth grade level to reinforce what children lear ned in the elementar y grades.
The program builds self-esteem and also focuses on the consequences of a criminal lifestyle, the benefits of higher education, and future career oppor tunities.
This program has undergone five separate studies.
The first tested elementar y students before and after par ticipation in the program.
Pr ior to par ticipation, 50 percent were undecided about gang involvement, but after par ticipation, 90 percent responded negatively toward gangs.
The second study, also using a pre/post design, replicated the results of the first.
However, this study included a control group that was not exposed to the program; this group showed no change in their attitudes (50 percent undecided) over the same period of time.
The third and four th studies surveyed seventh and ninth graders, respectively, who had par ticipated in the fifth grade program; 90 percent (from both studies) indicated that they still had negative attitudes about gangs or stayed out of them.
The final study cross-checked the names of 3,612 former program par ticipants with local police records and found that 96 percent were not identified as gang members.
