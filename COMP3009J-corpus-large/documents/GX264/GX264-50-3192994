MDHS COMBINED MANUAL CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION STATUS
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03
Citizenship or immigration status affects eligibility.
United States citizens are always eligible if they meet other eligibility criteria.
Eligibility of non-citizens depends on their Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) classification and varies among programs.
See Â§0010.18.11 (Verifying Citizenship and Immigration Status), Â§0010.18.12 (Verifying Lawful Temporary Residence), Â§0010.18.15 (Verifying Lawful Permanent Residence), Â§0010.18.21 (Identify Undocumented/Non-Immigrant People) to determine citizenship or immigration classification of clients.
Immigration status can change.
Check with participants at appropriate intervals to see if their status has changed.
For example: 
<
<
<
A status change could possibly mean a change from state to federal benefits or from ineligibility to eligibility.
Non-citizens are people present in the United States who have not attained United States citizenship by birth or naturalization.
Non-citizens who are lawfully residing in the United States meet the technical requirement for immigration status, but their eligibility for the source of funding for cash and food assistance may be state or federal, depending on immigration status and date of entry.
Non-citizens fall into the following broad categories: 
<

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS
ML 128 01/2004 0011.03.12
Non-citizens who lawfully immigrated to the United States are called lawful permanent residents (LPRs).
LPRs have permission to live and work permanently in the United States.
They can travel abroad and return to the United States as long as they have not abandoned their United States residence.
Permission to enter as an LPR is usually granted to people living abroad, but under certain circumstances it may be granted to a person already present in the United States.
See Â§0011.03.12.03 (Non-Citizens - Adjustment of Status).
An LPR can apply for naturalization to United States citizenship after living in the United States for 5 years (3 years if married to a United States citizen).
Most LPRs obtain permission to enter the United States through a petition from a family member.
They may be immediate relatives (for example, spouses, minor children, or parents) of adult United States citizens, or receive family-sponsored preference.
The number of family-sponsored immigrants has an annual cap, and the waiting list may be several years long.
All petitions for family members must also include an affidavit of support.
See Â§0011.03.15 (Non-Citizens - LPR With Sponsors).
People who receive LPR status through marriage to a United States citizen will be granted conditional permanent residence if they have been married less than 2 years.
The purpose is so that Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) can determine that the reason for the marriage was not for the purpose of gaining entry to the United States.
At the end of 2 years, either the couple must file a joint petition with the BCIS to remove the condition, or, to keep his or her LPR status, the non-citizen spouse must qualify for a waiver of joint petition requirement.
Conditional permanent residents have the same documents and rights as other LPRs, EXCEPT their I-551 card expires after 2 years and is coded "CR".
There are also provisions for employment-based immigrants with special skills or abilities, or for jobs in which there is a shortage of workers.
Most require a petition from an employer.
If the employer is related to the immigrant, an affidavit of support (I-834) may also be required.
There are also 55,000 visas per year awarded to people from countries from which few people have been admitted over the previous 5 years.
These "diversity" visas are awarded on the basis of an annual lottery where names are submitted and randomly drawn.
The I-551, passport, or I-94 will identify these non-citizens as DV1, DV2, or DV3.
Some LPRs may also have held a previous immigration status, such as refugee or asylee, that may impact eligibility.
See Â§0011.03.12.03 (Non-Citizens - Adjustment of Status).
Consider North American Indians born in Canada who have at least 50% North American Indian blood to be LPRs when they enter the United States from Canada.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.12.03
Non-citizens already present in the United States who are not lawful permanent residents (LPRs) may apply for adjustment of status to LPR.
This process relates to program eligibility in several ways.
Only LPRs may become United States citizens.
Refugees normally adjust their status 1 year after arrival in the United States.
The process is currently completed through a mailed application.
If the person has no barrier to admission in the United States, the adjustment is automatic.
Asylees may also apply for adjustment 1 year after their asylee status is granted, but there is an annual limit of 10,000 people who may adjust to LPR.
Though refugees and asylees may have adjusted to LPR, their eligibility for cash and food assistance programs is still based on their original Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) status.
See Â§0011.03.18 (Non-Citizens - People Fleeing Persecution).
Battered spouses and/or children of United States citizens or LPRs who are non-citizens may be eligible to self-petition for adjustment of status.
They may be eligible for assistance while their application is pending.
See Â§0011.03.21 (Non-Citizens - Victims of Battery/Cruelty).
Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), non-citizens who had resided unlawfully in the United States since before 1-1-82 (general amnesty, or section 245A) and certain farmworkers (SAW, or section 210) were allowed to legalize their status through a 3-stage process.
Amnesty applicants whose applications were granted were then given lawful temporary resident (LTR) status.
The majority of people who legalized under IRCA have become LPRs.
However, general amnesty applicants were required to complete English language and United States civics requirements as a condition of adjustment.
A few people were unable to complete the requirements and remain LTRs.
See Â§0011.03.24 (NonCitizens - Lawfully Residing People).
There were originally program restrictions on those that adjusted under IRCA but those restrictions are no longer in effect.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - LPR WITH SPONSORS
ML 128 01/2004 0011.03.15
Non-citizens may immigrate to the United States through a petition by a sponsor who agreed to support the immigrant as a condition of the immigrant's entry to the United States.
Sponsors may be financially responsible for the immigrant.
There are 2 types of sponsorship agreements.
The rules governing how each of these 2 agreements affect the sponsor's income and assets differ depending on the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) classification of the non-citizen and/or the type of Affidavit of Support executed by the sponsor.
See Â§0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider), Â§0015.48.03 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsors W/ I-864), Â§0016.21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants), Â§0016.21.03 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I-864).
<
People sponsoring relatives after that date are required to file this form, which remains in effect until the immigrant attains citizenship or is credited with 40 quarters of work coverage under Social Security.
See Â§0010.18.15.06 (Verifying Social Security Credits).
<
Sponsors who executed this form are financially responsible for the immigrant for 3 years from the date the LPR enters the United States.
Also see SPONSOR in Â§0002.63 (Glossary: Special Diet...), Â§0010.18.15 (Verifying Lawful Permanent Residence), Â§0011.03.12 (Non-Citizens - Lawful Permanent Residents).
Receipt of public cash assistance or institutionalization for long term care at government expense may negatively affect a non-citizen's BCIS status.
See Â§0011.03.17 (Non-Citizens Public Charge).
MFIP: Determine if the sponsor is an individual or an agency or organization.
<

DHS can grant EXCEPTIONS only if the sponsoring agency no longer exists or has become unable to meet the immigrant's needs.
There must be a material change in
MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - LPR WITH SPONSORS
ML 128 01/2004 0011.03.15
the agency's resources since BCIS approved the application for sponsorship of the immigrant.
The non-profit or charitable status of a sponsoring agency is not enough by itself to waive responsibility to support the immigrant.
Submit requests to waive a sponsoring agency's financial responsibility, along with supporting documentation and authorization forms, to: Department of Human Services Transition to Economic Stability Division 444 Lafayette Road St. Paul, Minnesota 55155-3834 For information on how to treat income of LPRs who are ineligible due to agency or organization sponsorship, see Â§0016.33 (Income of Ineligible Non-Citizens).
FS: See Â§0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration Status), Â§0011.03.12 (Non-Citizens Lawful Permanent Residents) for additional eligibility requirements.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - PUBLIC CHARGE
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.17
A non-citizen may be denied admission to the United States, or adjustment of status, or under rare circumstances deported, if the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) determines that the non-citizen has become, or is likely to become, primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance or institutionalization for long term care at government expense.
This "public charge" determination has been part of immigration law for more than 100 years.
The public charge determination for non-citizens present in the United States is the responsibility of BCIS, and county workers must never make it part of the determination of eligibility for assistance.
Every determination by BCIS is made on a case-by-case basis and must include several factors besides the receipt of cash assistance.
There are several key factors that BCIS takes into account regarding public charge determinations: 
Other programs, such as WIC, school lunch programs, housing services, LIHEAP, child care, and job training programs are not cash assistance programs.
<
Non-citizens should not be encouraged to apply for cash assistance that they have not requested, because it may negatively affect their status with BCIS.
If non-citizens have questions regarding the impact of the receipt of cash assistance on the public charge determination, encourage them to seek legal advice.
Receipt of public cash assistance or institutionalization for long term care at government expense by sponsored non-citizens may negatively affect their BCIS status.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.18
Some non-citizens are allowed to enter or remain in the United States because they are unable or unwilling to return to their country of residence for fear of persecution.
There are several levels of immigration status that relate to this, most of which are temporary.
However, people may adjust their status to lawful permanent residents.
See Â§0011.03.12.03 (NonCitizens - Adjustment of Status).
<
The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) has interviewed them outside this country, and they have met the processing priorities established by the State Department.
The priorities have to do with need for protection or close ties to the United States through employment or relatives.
Prior to 1981, some refugees entered the country under other immigration categories, such as conditional entrant or paroled as a refugee.
<
The process for establishing a claim of asylum before an BCIS asylum officer or immigration judge may take some time, often a year or more.
Applicants may be granted employment authorization after their case has been pending for a sufficient time, or when preliminary approval of the claim is granted prior to a background check.
Some applicants who are not granted asylum may be given withholding of removal (or deportation) when it is decided that persecution is more likely than not.
<
Though they are admitted as lawful permanent residents (LPR), they are generally eligible for the same benefits as refugees.
See AMERASIAN in Â§0002.03 (Glossary: Agent Orange...).
<
The immigration status of Cuban-Haitian Entrant was created to accord them a legal status while their cases were pending.
Not all Cubans or Haitians would be considered Cuban-Haitian Entrants, as they may enter the United States under other circumstances.
Those who enter the country as LPRs under preference categories would be treated as any other LPRs. | |

A non-citizen who is a victim of battery and/or cruelty and who is either married to or is the child of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident may be able to "self-petition" for permanent residency if he or she does not already have this immigration status.
The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) will determine the battery and/or cruelty.
A self-petition may also help make the person eligible for some programs.

Under certain circumstances people are permitted to enter and/or remain in the United States on a limited basis.
Consider these people as lawfully residing non-citizens.
In most cases, people will depart the United States when their status expires, or have a petition filed to adjust their status to LPR.
Review their status to be sure it has not expired or changed.
<
Parole is usually granted for a specific time period, but in some instances it may be indefinite.
Humanitarian parole is usually for the purpose of medical treatment that is not available in a non-citizen's home country.
Parole may also be used while other applications are pending, such as asylum applications.
Parole is often used for people from refugee-producing countries, such as Vietnam or the former Soviet Union, when they do not qualify as refugees but have family members already in the United States.
<
However, there is no current provision to allow undocumented non-citizens to apply for legalization to LTR.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL PROTOCOLS FOR REPORTING UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.27.03
MFIP: (Also FS) Use the following protocols developed by the Department of Human Services (DHS) regarding the release of data to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS).
These protocols were developed to define the respective responsibilities for DHS and county agencies for gathering information about such non-citizens and sharing information with BCIS.
County agencies must report to DHS, information on any person "known" to be unlawfully present in the United States.
This means you will "know" that a noncitizen is not lawfully present in the United States ONLY when the unlawful presence is a finding of fact or conclusion of law that is made as part of a formal determination, subject to administrative review, on a non-citizen's claim for benefits under this program.
That finding of unlawful presence must be supported by a determination by BCIS or the Executive Office of Immigration Review, such as a Final Order of Deportation.
Do not consider a non-citizen to be "known" to be unlawfully present in the United States under any other circumstances.
A SAVE response showing no service record on a person or an immigration status making the person ineligible for benefits is NOT a finding of fact or conclusion of law that the person is not lawfully present.
Do not assume a non-citizen is unlawfully present in the United States if the unit indicates that a unit member is here unlawfully without BCIS verification.
DO NOT contact BCIS to verify immigration status unless you have determined that the applicant meets all other program requirements, and the client would be eligible for benefits if the immigration status requirement is met.
Client cooperation or authorization is not required for contacting BCIS in the context of SAVE verification.
See Â§0010.18.11.03 (Systematic Alien Verification (SAVE)).
In all other situations, the client must provide a written authorization to contact BCIS.
See Â§0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications), Â§0010.18.01 (Mandatory Verifications Cash Assistance), Â§0011.03.27 (Undocumented and Non-Immigrant People).
When you receive verification from BCIS that a non-citizen is known to be here unlawfully, submit the following information to DHS: 
Address.
Case number.
A copy of the BCIS verification of any person whom the BCIS has verified is here unlawfully.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - TRAFFICKING VICTIMS
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.30
A non-citizen who is forced into the international sex trade, prostitution, slavery and forced labor through coercion, threats of physical violence, psychological abuse, torture, and imprisonment, is a victim of severe forms of trafficking.
To deter these crimes, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.
The act aims to combat trafficking through increased law enforcement to ensure effective punishment of traffickers, to protect victims, and to provide federal and state assistance to victims.
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for determining and issuing certification letters for people who meet the requirements for certification.
ORR is also responsible for determining and issuing similar letters to children under age 18 who have been found to be victims of severe forms of trafficking.
Do not require proof of Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) documentation from trafficking victims.
Instead, accept ORR certification letters for adult victims and confirmation letters for victims under age 18 as proof of status for conferring eligibility for benefits.
The letter contains an initial eligibility date and an expiration date.
The expiration date is 8 months from the initial eligibility date.
Applicants must submit the original letter.
Retain a photo copy in the case file and return the original copy to the applicant.
Although INS documents are not required for benefit eligibility determination purposes, trafficking victims may have a variety of immigration documents, such as an I-94 card, an employment authorization document, or proof of deferred action, or an order of supervision.
These documents may be useful in providing identity for the applicant.
The ORR certification/confirmation letters contain a trafficking verification telephone number to call for verification.
You must call the trafficking verification line at 202-401-5510 to verify the validity of a claim before providing benefits to the applicant, and to notify ORR of the type of benefits for which the applicant is applying.
If you encounter a trafficking victim who does not have a letter from ORR to prove his or her claim, but appears to meet the condition of victim of severe forms of trafficking, seek consultation from 1 of the following numbers: For adult victims: For victims under age 18: 202-401-4561 202-401-5702 202-420-4732 |
You may also contact the DHS Refugee Services section at 651-282-9817.
MDHS COMBINED MANUAL NON-CITIZENS - TRAFFICKING VICTIMS
ML 126 07/2003 0011.03.30
Trafficking victims may not yet possess standard identity documents, such as driver's licenses.
If you have difficulty confirming a trafficking victim's identity, do not automatically deny the application.
Contact the trafficking verification line for assistance.
Also, you must assist trafficking victims who do not yet have or are unable to obtain Social Security numbers for work purposes to obtain non-work Social Security numbers.
The current Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) does not contain information about trafficking victims.
ORR is working with BCIS on this.
Until further notice, do not contact the SAVE system to confirm eligibility for benefits for trafficking victims.
Adult victims of a severe form of trafficking who have been certified by ORR and children under age 18 who have been confirmed by ORR as victims of a severe form of trafficking are eligible for benefits to the same extent as refugees.
See Â§0030.03 (Refugee Cash Assistance).
When eligibility is established, record the applicant's entry and expiration dates for refugee assistance benefit purposes.
Both these dates appear in the body of the ORR certification/confirmation letter.
At the end of the expiration date, you must redetermine eligibility for the client regardless of other program recertification schedules.
ORR will issue follow-up certification letters for trafficking victims who continue to meet the certification requirements.
For additional information on trafficking victims, see the trafficking victims questions and answers in TE02.05.88 (Trafficking Victims Q

FS: People cannot participate as a member of more than 1 Food Support unit or in more than 1 county in any month.
However, people living in battered women's shelters may receive Food Support twice in a month if the certified unit that included them contains the person who abused them.
The shelter residents may receive an additional allotment as a separate unit only once a month.
On Indian reservations where both Food Support and the Food Distribution Program (formerly called commodities distribution) are available, units may choose which program to participate in.
Units certified to get commodities on the 1st day of a month may not get Food Support in that month.
The 1st month they are eligible is the month after the month of termination from the Food Distribution Program.
The Mothers and Children (MAC) program also distributes food.
On the Red Lake Reservation MAC is called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, but it is not the same as the Food Distribution Program.
People who participate in MAC may also get Food Support.

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL RECEIPT OF OTHER ASSISTANCE
ML 126 07/2003 0011.21
When a unit applies in Minnesota, and another state issued Food Support for that month, but the unit says they did not get the original issuance: 
If an ATP has been transacted, but neither an ATP or coupons were returned to the previous state, issue Food Support IF: - The unit signs a written statement that they did not get the original Food Support issuance.
AND - The unit's written statement says that they understand the penalties for Food Support fraud.
If the case IS EXPEDITED, try to confirm non-receipt with the other state, but do not delay issuing Food Support pending receipt of information.
Issue Food Support based on the unit's written statement that they did not get their benefits and they understand the penalty for fraud.
If you find out later that a client actually did get Food Support in more than 1 state or county, the state or county which issued Food Support later must set up a claim.

Unless a person is exempt from FS eligibility time limits or is meeting monthly work requirements, able-bodied people are eligible for FS for only 3 months in any 36-month period.
The 36-month period begins the 1st month the person receives FS. Once started, the 36-month period continues to run uninterrupted, even during times the person does not receive FS or is exempt from the time limit.
The 3 entitled months do not have to be consecutive.
Do not count a month if for that month the person meets the 20-hour per week (80 hours per month) work requirement, is exempt from the 3-month time limit, or receives only prorated (partial month) benefits.
The 3-month entitlement limit applies only to adults receiving FS.

You must retroactively count (or un-count) an ABAWD's month of benefits as 1 of the 3 months of entitlement to FS benefits if you later learn that your determination of the ABAWD's exemption status, or whether or not the ABAWD met monthly work requirements, was incorrect.
You must make this change in MAXIS.
As long as the client meets an exemption for some part of the month, he or she is exempt for the entire month.
Able-bodied adults may "earn" ADDITIONAL MONTHS of eligibility, or avoid using 1 of their 3 entitled months, when they work or participate in work activities an average of 20 hours per week (80 per month).
These do not have to be consecutive months.
For each month that the person works or participates in work activities at this level, the person "earns" a month of FS benefits.
Countable work or work program activities are: 
This includes use of accrued sick or vacation time, if available.

NOTE: FSET job search and job search training do not count toward the 20 hour per week/80 hour per month requirement unless the person is co-enrolled in WIA.

See MINIMUM WAGE in Â§0002.41 (Glossary: Medically Necessary...).
Also see TEMP Manual TE12.05 (Minimum Wage).
An ABAWD who has used up the initial or subsequent 3 months of FS eligibility can "earn" an additional month of benefits by working or participating in approved work activities for 80 hours in a calendar month.
The ABAWD need not be a current FS participant to regain eligibility.
(NOTE: FSET is available only to current participants.)
The hours must be completed before eligibility can be granted.
Once the person has worked the required number of hours, eligibility can be granted back to the beginning of the month or the date of application, whichever is later.
Once eligibility is granted, eligibility will continue as long as you prospectively anticipate that the person will work the required number of hours for the next month.
Track work hours per month.
Your Employment Services Provider (ESP) will track hours of participation in work program activities.
A participant who has re-established FS eligibility by working or participating in work activities for 80 hours in a month as described above can qualify for 1 additional 3-month period of eligibility.
If the person's job or work activity ends, or if the hours are reduced below 80 hours per month, the person qualifies for the additional 3-month period of eligibility.
This provision does not apply if the person voluntarily quit the job without good cause.
The new 3-month period of eligibility starts the 1st day of the 1st month in which FS benefits are provided under this 2nd 3-month eligibility period.
It runs uninterrupted until the 3-month period is completed, regardless of whether the person received benefits all 3 of those months.
This 2nd 3-month period is only available once in any 36-month period.
You must explain these provisions to ABAWDs during the intake and eligibility determination process.
All ABAWDs are mandatory FSET participants, and must be referred to FSET when FS eligibility is determined or when the participant's exemption from ABAWD provisions ends.
You must inform the ESP of the participant's ABAWD status so that this can be taken into consideration when determining the FSET services needed.

See Â§0024.09 (Protective and Vendor Payments).
Issue the balance of the grant to the unit.
People convicted of a drug felony that was committed on or after 7-1-97 are also subject to random drug testing as a condition of eligibility.
The drug test may be conducted by the county agency, or the county agency may be informed of a test failure by a probation officer or other official entity.
Apply the following policies to an applicant or participant caregiver who fails a drug test: 
Reduce the remaining amount of the unit's Transitional Standard or Shared Household Standard, whichever applies, by 30%.
Issue the balance of the grant (cash and/or food portion) to the unit.
If a participant fails a drug test the 1st time and is under a sanction due to other MFIP program requirements, vendor pay from the cash portion of the grant for shelter, and at county option, the utilities.
Then reduce the remaining grant by 30% and issue the balance to the unit.
Before imposing the above sanction, the job counselor must attempt to meet faceto-face with the caregiver and explain the consequences of failing a subsequent drug test and the right to appeal the sanction.
If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, the county must send the adverse action notice and include the information that would have been provided in a face-to-face meeting.
Continue to apply the sanctions above until the month after the month the person documents that he or she has passed a drug test.

The 60-month limit is per caregiver receiving MFIP, and the months do not have to be consecutive.
Count or exclude months as noted below.
The counted and exempt months include months in which a caregiver received TANF benefits from another state, even if before 7-1-97 (states may have chosen earlier start dates and shorter limits for their TANF programs).

No later than 10-day cut-off of the 60th month, make a final decision whether to extend the family's eligibility beyond the 60th month, or close the case.
A participant who is in sanction for any reason during the 60th month is not eligible for a hardship extension.
In addition, to be eligible for a hardship extension under the "employed" hardship extension category, participants must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months.

If a participant has been in sanction and states that he or she has an illness, but has not provided documentation of the condition, offer to help the participant obtain the needed documentation to cure the sanction.
If the participant is still in sanction during the 60th month and a good cause reason does not apply, there is no eligibility for any type of extension.
If the participant is not in sanction in the 60th month and does not provide documentation to determine eligibility for an extension category, close the case and reopen it later if the participant provides adequate documentation.
Counties and Employment Services Providers should work with participants to clear any sanctions.
Notices should be sent by MAXIS, on or before the 10-day notice cut-off in the 60th month.
However, at the time of the face-to-face meeting, the county should tell the participant whether it appears that the participant would qualify for an extension based on current circumstances, what he or she must do to qualify, and when the final decision will be made.
Months continue to count toward the 60-month time limit while a participant is in the special medical criteria exemption category.
See Â§0011.36 (Special Medical Criteria).
The law requires that the face-to-face meeting be done 180-60 days before the participant reaches the end of the 60th counted month.
MAXIS will flag these cases for the face-to-face meeting.
At the face-to-face meeting, review the family situation to determine if the participant will be eligible for a hardship extension.
Also tell the participant how many banked months he or she has.
If information needed to determine if the participant is eligible for a hardship extension is not available before the 10-day cut-off date in the 60th month, make a decision based on the best information available at the time.
Depending on the degree of confidence the county has in the documentation it has received, choose either of the following 2 approaches for cases where some further documentation is pending.
Document the rationale for choosing a specific approach in case notes.

COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW: Prior to the face-to-face meeting, staff involved with the participant(s) should meet to review the family's situation.
DHS recommends using a team for the county administrative review and subsequent face-to-face meeting.
The team may include the financial worker, job counselor, supervisory staff, social worker, child care worker, psychologist, vocational specialist, family violence advocate, or anyone else involved with the participant, provided that the participant has signed the necessary consent forms.
Using the sample "MFIP 60-Month Planning Checklist" in Bulletin #02-11-01 (Attachment A) as a guide, consider the following:

APPOINTMENT LETTER: Send a letter to ask the participant to call for an appointment for the face-to-face meeting or to notify the participant that a meeting has been scheduled.
Counties may use the sample appointment letter in #02-11-01 (Attachment B) or develop their own letter.
If you do not hear from the participant, make AT LEAST 2 more attempts to reach the participant, using other approaches, such as phone calls or home visits.
Document these attempts in both case notes and person notes.

FACE-TO-FACE MEETING: Meet and discuss the items on the sample 60-Month Planning Checklist or your county's checklist.
The county is required to attempt to hold a face-to-face meeting for the benefit of the participant.
Although "attempting to meet face-toface" is a requirement for the county, it is not an eligibility requirement for MFIP participants.
The face-to-face meetings provide:

Stress the importance to the participant of attending the face-to-face meeting to the participant, but do not sanction the participant for not attending the meeting.
4.
IF NO FACE-TO-FACE MEETING: If a face-to-face meeting does not occur, send a letter advising the participant that MFIP will soon close.
Provide a list of the hardship extension categories and a copy of the extension request form.
Counties may use the sample letter and extension request form in Bulletin #02-11-01 (Attachments C and D) or develop their own letter and form.
Enclose a list of community resources that are available to the participant if MFIP ends and any other information that would have been covered at the face-to-face meeting.
If the participant responds to this letter, encourage the participant to come to a face-to-face meeting even if it is after the 58th month.
5.
SUPERVISORY OR TEAM REVIEW: Before MFIP closes due to the time limit, the job counselor's supervisor or the review team designated by the county must review the case to determine if the criteria for a hardship extension, if requested, were applied appropriately and an attempt was made to meet with the participant face-to-face.
If the review indicates that the criteria to close the case were met, send a 10-day notice of adverse action to terminate MFIP at the end of 60th month.
If you discover that a case was closed after the 60th month without the required case review, you must contact the participant and offer to do a case review to determine if the assistance unit was eligible for a hardship extension.
If the participant is determined to be eligible for a hardship extension and meets all other MFIP eligibility criteria, the county agency must issue retroactive benefits for all months of MFIP eligibility up to and including the current month.

MFIP: Participants who have reached their 60-month lifetime limit as outlined in Â§0011.30 (60-Month Lifetime Limit) may be eligible for an extension of MFIP if they meet 1 of the following hardship extension categories: 
See Â§0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category).
<
See Â§0011.33.03.03 (Limited Work Due to Illness/Disability).

See Â§0011.33.06.03 (MFIP Family Violence Extension Category).
<
See Â§0011.33.09 (MFIP Ill/Incapacitated Extension Category).
EXCEPT for the situations below, participants must request a hardship extension and provide documentation that the criteria for the extension are met.
The request may be verbal or written.
<
The participant may have to provide documentation that he or she is eligible under another category.
<
As part of the application process, the applicant will be required to provide documentation that he or she is eligible for a hardship extension.
You MUST document whether the participant requests an extension or indicate that he or she was not interested in applying for an extension.
You may use the sample extension request form in Bulletin #02-11-01 (Attachment D) or a form developed by the county to document the request.
The form should be completed at the faceto-face meeting, if possible.
If the participant does not attend the face-to-face meeting, you must send an extension request form to the participant and tell him or her to notify the county, orally or in writing, if he/she wants to be considered for a hardship extension.

ML 127 10/2003 0011.33
Participants may request a hardship extension in any month, but the participant, or both participants in a 2-parent household who reach the 60-month time limit at the same time, must be in compliance with ALL program requirements and NOT in sanction for any reason in the 60th month to be eligible for an extension.
Eligibility may begin any time after the 60th month, depending on when the application and verification are received.
NOTE: In 2-parent units, there are some instances when 1 parent may be removed from the grant and continue MFIP for the remainder of the unit.
See Â§0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions - Removing 1 Parent) for more information.
Work with each unit to determine if the unit is eligible for an extension.
For units potentially eligible for an extension as "ill/incapacitated" or "hard to employ", this may involve identifying potential barriers, referring for assessments, and obtaining documentation.
For units potentially eligible for the "employed" extension, it may mean helping them increase work hours or making subsidized work opportunities available to them.
For units who do not qualify for an extension, it means ensuring that eligible families continue to receive benefits such as food support and health care and directing them to other community resources.
In all cases, you must commit to reaching out, following through, and working with each family as intensively as needed.
Families also need to follow through on appointments, provide the documentation needed, go to the assessments, and attend scheduled meetings.
Be clear with families about your expectations of them.
If a participant who applies for an extension after the 60th month is able to document that a sanction was incorrectly applied or that the participant had good cause for the non-compliance, you must consider the participant compliant for the purpose of establishing eligibility for any hardship extension.
Considering the participant in compliance under this provision IS an adjustment of a previous sanction period.
However, DO NOT recalculate benefits or issue supplements unless the participant submitted a timely appeal.
Participants whose MFIP is extended beyond the 60-month limit may continue to receive MFIP as long as state law provides for MFIP extensions, the criteria for that extension category continue to be met, and all other MFIP requirements (including ES) continue to be met.
When the criteria or requirements are no longer met, either sanction the case or close the case the 1st of the month following the month the criteria no longer exists.
MDHS COMBINED MANUAL MFIP HARDSHIP EXTENSIONS
ML 127 10/2003 0011.33
To ensure that the hardship extension policy is consistently applied, DHS recommends that each county develop a written plan for determining eligibility for a hardship extension.
The plan should be available to the public upon request.
Counties, and Employment Services Providers under contract with the county, must follow the county's limited English proficiency (LEP) plan to communicate information about hardship extensions to participants with limited English proficiency.
County staff and Employment Services Providers should review their LEP plan to make sure they understand what language assistance resources are available to help participants with LEP understand necessary information about hardship extensions and what they need to do to request an extension.
For a person who has a mental illness or mental retardation, there are several categories that could be used, depending on the participant's circumstances.
To determine which category to use, consider the following: 
See Â§0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category).

MDHS COMBINED MANUAL MFIP HARDSHIP EXTENSIONS - REMOVING 1 PARENT
ML 128 01/2004 0011.33.02
MFIP: When 1 or both parents in a 2-parent family reach the 60-month limit, the unit has the option to remove a caregiver who DOES NOT meet the criteria for an extension from the grant and continue MFIP for the remainder of the unit.
See Â§0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions), Â§0028.30.04.03 (Post 60-Month Sanctions: 2-Parent Provisions).
The option to remove 1 parent must occur as part of a discussion and decisionmaking process between the county, the Employment Services Provider, and the participants.
The county MUST NOT automatically remove a parent.
A parent who is removed from the grant for non-compliance is eligible 1 additional time.
A subsequent removal of this parent from the grant for non-compliance will result in permanent disqualification of that parent from MFIP.
Only 1 parent may be removed at a time.
Removals are counted PER CAREGIVER for purposes of determining permanent disqualification of that caregiver from the MFIP unit.
Before removing a non-compliant participant under this policy, you must review the participant's case to determine if the Employment Plan is still appropriate and must make a good faith effort to meet with the participant face-to-face.
If the participant does not comply, you must send the participant a notice of adverse action.
REMOVING (DISQUALIFYING) 1 PARENT FROM THE GRANT WHEN BOTH PARENTS REACH MONTH 60 AT THE SAME TIME: When BOTH parents reach month 60 at the same time and are being evaluated for an extension, there are 2 instances when 1 parent may be removed from the grant and MFIP continued for the remainder of the unit: 
If both parents fail to meet the criteria for an extension, DO NOT extend the MFIP case.
If extended as employed, the remaining parent must meet the 30/25 hour Employment Services requirement.
The Shared Household Standard and deeming provisions apply.
Only 1 parent may be removed from the MFIP unit under this provision.

To be eligible for the "employed" extension category, the participant(s) must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months immediately preceding the participant's 61st month, and meet the ALL following conditions: 1-PARENT UNITS: 
Being in compliance means the participant is not in sanction for noncooperation with ANY MFIP program requirement, including non-cooperation with child support or 3rd party liability.
Only consider the months that the participant actually received MFIP (cash OR food portion).
AND 
Participants must meet minimum work requirements, and they are NOT exempt from ES requirements.
When the participant has accepted a job that begins during the 60th or 61st month, there must be a reasonable expectation that the participant will work an average of 30 hours per week (or 25 hours of work plus 5 hours of another work activity) in the upcoming month.
DHS recommends that the decision be based on the participant's current employment situation and/or employment offer.
2-PARENT UNITS: 
If BOTH parents reach month 60 at the same time, they both MUST be in compliance in the 60th month.
If 1 or both parent(s) are not in compliance in month 60, the unit is not eligible for an extension.
Being in compliance means the participant(s) is not in sanction for non-cooperation with ANY MFIP program |

requirement, including non-cooperation with child support or third party liability.
Only consider the months that the participant(s) actually received MFIP (cash OR food portion).
- When both parents reach month 60 at the same time, both parents must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months.
If 1 parent does not meet this requirement, the unit has the option to remove (disqualify) that caregiver and extend the remainder of the unit under the employed category.
Use the Shared Household Standard and deem the disqualified caregiver's income to the MFIP unit members.
The remaining caregiver in the unit must participate in at least 30 hours of work activities per week, of which an average of at least 25 each week must be employment.
See Â§0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions - Removing 1 Parent).
- When only 1 parent in a 2-parent unit has reached month 60, only that parent must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months.
If he/she does not meet this requirement, the unit has the option to remove (disqualify) him/her and extend the remainder of the unit under the employed category.
Use the Shared Household Standard and deem the disqualified caregiver's income to the MFIP unit members.
The remaining caregiver in the unit who has not reached month 60 does not need to meet extension criteria until he/she reaches month 60.
See Â§0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions - Removing 1 Parent).

Hours may be divided between the 2 parents in any way that works for that unit's particular situation and should be documented in the Employment Plan.
These participants must meet minimum work requirements, and they are NOT exempt from ES requirements.
When a participant in a 2-parent unit has accepted a job that begins during the 60th or 61st month, there must be a reasonable expectation that the participants will work an average of 55 hours per week (or 45 hours of work plus 10 hours of another work activity) in the upcoming month.
DHS recommends that the decision be based on the participant's current employment situation and /or employment offer.
In some instances 2-parent units failing to comply with Employment Services requirements, and thus facing a disqualification from MFIP, may have the option to remove the non-compliant caregiver from the grant and continue MFIP for the

remainder of the unit.
See Â§0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions - Removing 1 Parent) for more information.
LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT If the loss of employment is involuntary (for example, layoffs including seasonal work) the participant is not subject to the hourly employment requirement for 1 month (30 days), but must meet all remaining requirements in the participant's Employment Plan.
In cases where participants claim an involuntary loss of employment that is not documented, have them sign a statement that they are unemployed through no fault of their own.
Counties and ES providers have flexibility to do as much verification as they deem necessary.
Falsifying the statement will result in a sanction.
If the loss of employment is voluntary or if the participant fails to meet the hourly requirements for more than 30 days after the last date of employment, begin the post 60-month sanction process.
The 1-month exemption provision is available to a 1-parent assistance unit twice (separate incidents) in a 12-month period.
The 1-month exemption provision is available to a 2-parent assistance unit twice per parent in a 12-month period.
If a participant has been in sanction for 3 or more of the 12 months immediately preceding the 61st month and is able to document that the sanction was incorrectly applied or that he/she had good cause for the non-compliance, consider the participant in compliance for the purpose of establishing eligibility for an employed hardship extension.
Considering the participant in compliance under this item IS an adjustment of a previous sanction period.
However, DO NOT recalculate benefits or issue supplements unless the participant submitted a timely appeal.
If a participant is complying with a child protection plan, the number of hours required under that plan counts toward the number of hours of employment required in the employed extension category.
For purposes of the employed extension category, employment means: - Subsidized private sector or public sector employment, including Grant Diversion.
- Unsubsidized employment.
- On-the-job training.
- Apprenticeship.

This means that someone with a disability who is only able to work 20 hours a week, rather than the 25 hours that is required to qualify for the employed hardship extension, may be extended if they work an average of 20 hours per week.
This extension category is a subset of the "employed" extension category.
All of the criteria and other Employment Services requirements for the "employed" extension category apply to this category.
See Â§0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category).
Counties may develop a form for health care providers to use to document a participant's diagnosis and any functional limitations that limit work hours, or may use DHS-2114 (Request for Medical Opinion).
If using the DHS-2114 form, include a "Yes/No" question that asks whether the participant is following the treatment recommended by the health care provider.
The DHS-2114 form can be downloaded from the DHS web site at http://edocs.dhs.state.mn.us.
Participants who are extended under this subcategory are required to follow the treatment recommendations of the health care provider that provides this documentation.
When a participant is part of a 2-parent assistance unit, the other parent must be treated as a 1-parent assistance unit for purposes of meeting the "employed" category work requirements.

Before determining whether an MFIP participant is unemployable, assess whether he or she is eligible for an exemption from the time limit or a hardship extension under other criteria (for example: learning disabled, low IQ, ill or incapacitated).
Identify the problems as clearly as possible to determine what category and/or plan best meets the participant's needs.
If he or she does not meet the criteria for another extension category, but appears to have significant barriers to employment, a determination of the participant's unemployability must be done by a vocational specialist or other qualified professional designated by the county.
Counties may extend MFIP benefits for the hard-to-employ category after 60 months when documentation is not available by the 60th month.
Participants must cooperate with efforts to obtain the documentation, and they may be responsible for an overpayment if they are later determined to not qualify for an extension.
Also see Â§0011.30.03 (MFIP Transition Period).
If it appears that their condition would make them eligible for Social Security or other program benefits, require them to apply.
See Â§0012.12 (Applying for Other Benefits).
The following are the "hard to employ" extension categories: 
Unemployable for this purpose means that there are no positions of employment, whether currently open or not, in the local labor market that the person is capable of performing.
Verifications accepted for purposes of this extension must state why the person cannot achieve competitive employment and must give an estimate of how long it will last.
Participants in this category are expected to develop and comply with an employment plan and are subject to post 60-month Employment Services sanction policies.
The plan should include only activities and hourly requirements appropriate to the participant's abilities.
For some participants, the plan may be limited to periodic check-ins or referrals to social services.

Learning disabled means that the person has a disorder in 1 or more of the psychological processes involved in perceiving, understanding, or using language.
The county's determination must be based on a statement provided by a licensed professional who is qualified to assess learning disabilities.
Statements from qualified professionals submitted to the county for purposes of this extension must include all of the following verification: - That there is a pattern of intra-individual discrepancy when compared to similar language of peers.
- That the disability severely limits the person's ability to obtain, perform, or retain suitable employment.

See Â§0011.30 (60Month Lifetime Limit), Â§0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions), Â§0011.33.09 (MFIP Ill/Incapacitated Extension Category), Â§0011.36.03 (Special Medical Criteria Categories), Â§0011.39 (Qualified Professionals), Â§0028.06.09 (Who Is Exempt From Employment Services), Â§0028.18 (Good Cause for Non-Compliance--MFIP).
To qualify for the special medical criteria, the child or adult in the household only needs to meet the criteria; he or she does not need to be receiving services.
In a 2-parent household with a child or an adult who meets the special medical criteria, only 1 parent is presumed to be prevented from obtaining or retaining employment.
If the family provides documentation from their health care provider that a 2nd parent is also needed in the home to care for the child or adult who meets the special medical criteria, the 2nd parent may be exempt from Employment Services and eligible for a hardship extension under the category for participants whose presence is needed in the home because of the illness or incapacity of another member of the assistance unit.
Participants must be evaluated for extension on or before the 60th month.
SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA CATEGORIES Participants are considered to have a child or adult in the unit who meets special medical criteria in any of the following categories: 
<
- Community Alternatives for Disabled Individuals (CADI).
- Community Alternative Care (CAC).
- Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver (TBIW).
- Waiver for Persons with Mental Retardation or Related Conditions (MR/RC Waiver).
- Elderly Waiver (EW).

Each of the waivers serves both people moving from an institutional setting to the community and people who are determined to be "at risk of" the level of care provided in the respective institutional setting.
CADI, TBIW, and CAC recipients may remain on the waiver after age 65 if warranted by their needs and service plan.

For detailed description of the above Special Medical Criteria categories, see Â§0011.36.03 (Special Medical Criteria Categories).
BANKED MONTHS If a participant who has accrued time beginning 1-1-98 while exempt from Employment Services under the special medical criteria exemption reaches the time limit and is no longer eligible for the special medical criteria extension, the participant must use the banked months before applying for a different type of extension.
ES exemptions due to special medical criteria (SMC) were effective 7-1-00, but a caregiver may accrue months back to 1-1-98 if someone in the household met special medical criteria.
Review caregivers who might be retroactively eligible for this exemption so that accrued months can be allowed correctly.
See BANKED MONTHS in Â§0002.05 (Glossary: Assistance Standard...).
Participants are subject to regular Employment Services requirements and pre-60 month sanction policies while using banked months.
After the banked months have been exhausted, evaluate the caregiver to see if there is eligibility for an extension under another extension category.
MAXIS is unable to differentiate between extensions for the purpose of drawing on the banked months.
Therefore, to ensure the system pulls the banked months before the participant is extended under a different category, code the STAT/TIME panel "Extension" field "NO" (no extension identified) when the participant no longer qualifies for the special medical criteria extension, even if the participant meets the criteria for a different type of extension.
Banked months are accrued based on the special medical criteria of an adult or child in the household, NOT based on a caregiver's own special medical criteria.
If a caregiver meets any of the special medical criteria on his or her own, he/she may be
MDHS COMBINED MANUAL SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA
ML 125 04/2003 0011.36
exempt from ES or extended under the ill/incapacitated category, for example, but would not accrue banked months.
As long as the caregiver meets the special medical criteria exemption, he or she will accrue months to be used after reaching the 60-month time limit and no longer being eligible for a special medical criteria extension.
Participating in Employment Services or working does not affect the participant's eligibility for the exemption or extension.
Some participants who have been exempt from Employment Services (ES) because they were needed in the home due to the illness or incapacity of another assistance unit member, a relative, or foster child may be able to accrue time back to 1-1-98 if they met the special medical criteria for an ES exemption during that same period.
No later than the time of the face-to-face interview, explain to any participant with a code of "8" (member is required at home to care for an ill or incapacitated family member) on the "Exmpt Stat" field of the STAT/EMPS panel that time can be accrued if he or she can document that the special medical criteria were met for 1 or more months beginning January 1998.
If an ES exemption for a person needed in the home was not approved for the participant but it can be documented that he or she should have been exempt, this policy may also be applied.
The participant can authorize the county agency to help document the special medical criteria during this period.
To track these cases, enter a CASE/ NOTE when you discover months that a participant met the special medical criteria exemption between January 1998 and June 2000.
The CASE/NOTE should include the months accruing time under the special medical criteria exemption (mm/yy to mm/yy), the household member who met special medical criteria, and the type of documentation provided.
