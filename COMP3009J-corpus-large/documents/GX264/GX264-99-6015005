SAFE AT SCHOOL: AN INTRODUCTION TO SAFE SCHOOL PLANNING IN ILLINOIS
In December 1995, the State Board of Education adopted a "State Plan for Assuring Safety and Order in Illinois Schools."
This plan originated from concern about increasing evidence of violence in schools throughout Illinois.
Its provisions were based on the deliberations of educators, business and community representatives, parents, law enforcement officials and social service providers.
Although the State Plan assigned a significant number of responsibilities to the State Board of Education and other state-level entities, it recognized that the local community must be the primary focus of efforts to reduce violence in our schools.
In particular, the Illinois State Board Plan called on each local school to "conduct an audit of the school's safety and security and develop a school safety plan for addressing identified problems."
During the spring 1996 legislative session, the Illinois General Assembly reinforced this proposed initiative by including the following statement in the Quality First legislation: School boards, along with the parent-teacher advisory committee, are encouraged to annually review their pupil discipline policies, the implementation of those policies, and any other factors related to the safety of their schools, pupils and staff.
Although this was not a mandate, the General Assembly emphasized its concern about school safety with a new "School Safety and Educational Improvement Block Grant Program," as well as an increase in the state violence prevention/substance abuse program.
These funds could be used in conjunction with the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools funding to address issues related to school safety.
The tragic school shootings which occurred during school year 1997-98 in Pearl, Mississippi; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, Oregon; and Edinborough, Pennsylvania--and the corresponding rash of "copy cat" incidents which followed these shootings in schools throughout the nation--have elevated the issue of school safety to a top political and educational priority.
This manual has been developed to assist school districts and their community in planning how they will ensure a safe learning environment for their students.
The manual is not intended to be a blueprint.
Each school district must tailor its safe school planning activities to reflect the uniqueness of its own community and schools.
To this end, local district officials could use one or more of the resource publications listed below.
Each of these works takes a somewhat different approach reflecting the experience and knowledge base of its authors.
Blauvelt...on Crisis Management Peter D. Blauvelt, President, National Alliance for Safe Schools Blauvelt...on Making Your Schools Safe Peter D. Blauvelt, President, National Alliance for Safe Schools Safe Schools: A Handbook for Practitioners National Association of Secondary School Principals and DynCorp Safe Schools: A Handbook for Violence Prevention Ronald D. Stephens, Executive Director, National School Safety Center Safe Schools: A Planning Guide for Action (1995 Edition) California Department of Education and the Office of the California Attorney General Improving School Safety James K. Nighswander, National School Services
WHAT IS SAFE SCHOOL PLANNING? Safe school planning follows the same general steps as most commonly used planning processes--that is, problems are identified and analyzed; the desired areas of change are agreed upon; change strategies are identified, evaluated and selected; the chosen strategies are implemented; and the impact of these efforts is assessed.
The cycle then begins again.
The safe school planning process starts with a safe school study or assessment, which the National School Safety Center (NSSC) describes as follows: A school safety assessment is a strategic evaluation and planning tool used to determine the extent of... school safety problem(s).
An assessment could address gangs, weapons in school, drug or alcohol abuse, schoolyard bullying, site evaluation of facilities, including buildings and landscaping, policies and procedures, compliance with local and state laws, community support, parent attitudes, student attitudes and motivation, or other emerging school climate trends.
A school safety assessment, in broadest terms, is a comprehensive review and evaluation of the education program of a school or district.
Once the safety-related problems of a school or school district are identified, a plan is developed for their resolution.
However, since this process focuses on issues which are potentially dangerous, if not life-threatening, the planning cannot be a straight-line activity, with all problems identified before anything is done.
It is imperative that school district officials take action to appropriately address serious problems as soon as these are determined.
2
In addition to the elements discussed above, the safe school planning process should include a public information component, which assures that parents and local citizens are aware of the steps being taken to assure that children are safe at school.
WHO NEEDS TO ENGAGE IN SAFE SCHOOL PLANNING? Every school district should commit itself to safe school planning for each of its schools.
This includes districts which have not yet experienced such high-visibility problems as school shootings, gang presence, guns in the classroom, or an assault on students or teachers.
The fact is that every school, no matter how small or isolated, has its share of safety-related problems, such as bullying and disruptive students.
Moreover, those problems are likely to increase in number and severity, as evidenced by the following trends cited in Peter Blauvelt's book.
Â· Â· Â· Â· Increasing numbers of behaviorally disturbed children such as those suffering the effects of maternal substance abuse.
Increasing familial stress is producing children who are disruptive as they express anger and frustration at circumstances they cannot control.
Continuing expansion of gangs into all parts of the country.
Due to lack of space in juvenile detention centers, serious and habitual offenders are either being placed in neighborhood group homes or are controlled by electronic monitoring.
Often, as a condition for release, the juvenile must attend school, where his or her presence may lead to fear and/or actual violence.
There probably are no schools in Illinois which have not already engaged in some kind of safe school planning.
However, it is equally probable that many of these efforts have been fragmented, responsive to specific situations, and seldom revisited until another problem arises.
The purpose of safe school planning is to assure that each and every Illinois school is systematic, comprehensive and current in its approach to assuring that students are safe at school.
HOW SHOULD SAFE SCHOOL PLANNING BEGIN? Three key components are needed to begin the district's safe school planning process: 1) 2) 3) Board and administrative commitment; A study plan, which includes scope and procedures; and A study team or teams.
Deciding on the scope of the study is an important variable, because the range of topics and issues to be examined can be daunting.
Ultimately, each district's safe school assessment should be comprehensive, including a look at how its educational program, school climate, and other
3
similar factors are linked to safety issues.
For example, districts will want to look closely at their reading program given the research which suggests that: Children who read poorly are programmed for school failure and worse....
A 1993 U.S. Justice Department study concluded that reading failure triggers violence by making youngsters feel worthless.
Some schools may want to plan for a comprehensive assessment, preferring to look at the whole picture.
Other schools may prefer to focus first on safety concerns whose resolution could quickly improve problem management and violence prevention efforts.
The scope of each school's safety assessment and planning will also be impacted by the extent which the study becomes a community-wide effort which looks not just at the schools, but also circumstances in the community which promote or prevent school violence.
Again, comprehensive assessment which includes a focus on the community should be the goal, even the initial approach is more limited.
to at a if
These decisions should be made by each school, according to its own circumstances.
It is expected that some schools will have a one-step study process while others will divide the effort into two or more stages.
With respect to study procedures, the State Board's "Safe School Advisory Committee" has recommended that even though the study must look at each individual school, the process should be coordinated at the district level.
This will facilitate the assessment of district-wide policies and procedures and provide a foundation for coordinated problem-solving and priority-setting.
The number of study teams, their size and their composition is a school decision which should reflect the decisions described above.
Crucial potential players include students, educators, parents, law enforcement personnel, judges, recreation program directors, social services providers, business and community representatives and various youth-serving professionals.
In an article in the February 1996 School Administrator, NSSC Executive Director Ronald Stephens wrote: Safe school planning is all about the "art of the possible."
It is not limited by special constraints or a set of guidelines.
Each community has the opportunity to shape the school climate it wishes to create.
A safe school plan, more than anything else, is a function of community will, priorities and interests.
It requires partnerships and cooperation.
The components and the players are limited only by the creativity, energy and commitment of the local community.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE BOARD AND ADMINISTRATION? Clearly, safe school planning cannot be limited to school boards and administrators.
On the other hand, the commitment and leadership of the board and administration will be critical to the success of safe school planning.
4
With the increasing levels of crime and violence in our schools, school boards and school administrators must be prepared for more than the academic challenges of teaching students to meet increasingly higher standards.
They must also be prepared to create a learning environment which supports the educational process.
They must do everything possible to ensure that students and teachers are safe at school.

OVERVIEW
6
ORGANIZING TO DEVELOP, APPRAISE, OR REVISE A SAFE SCHOOL PLAN A preliminary step might be to appoint a steering committee such as the Safe School Committee with specific responsibilities such as: To follow all or parts of this manual, using self-assessment and discussion to determine problems and intervention alternatives.
Â· To receive input through staff meetings, surveys, and focus groups.
Â· To determine priorities among the needs and problems identified.
To review and evaluate the intervention/prevention alternatives identified in this manual, as well as surveys, incident analysis, training attended, consultant reports, and governmental agency requirements.
Â· To select a Safe School Plan format such as presented here, that specifies when, what, how, by whom the plan will be implemented.
Â· Â· Â· To communicate the approved plan, publish it, and when possible, pilot it.
To assess the plan's effectiveness through practice and continuous periodic review.
To revise it to meet new and existing needs.
A SAMPLE PLAN FOR ACTION Although the instrument is useful for assessing the perceptions of individuals or groups, it is perhaps most useful as a model for planning for school safety through dialogue-based assessments of problems, intervention alternatives, and decisions for implementation -- plans, policies, programs, and procedures.
Step 1: The school appoints a standing committee responsible for a safe school whose membership is comprised of law enforcement, school and community players, administrators, clergy, media, parents, students, etc.
Step 2: Each committee member individually completes all sections of the instrument.
(Note: In some instances it might be desirable to invite other individuals or groups complete parts of the instrument to be used as input for the group process.)
Step 3: The committee meets routinely to review and discuss responses to the instrument for the purposes of prioritizing needs and intervention activities and for recommending policies, programs, and resources (personnel and equipment) for a safe school from a collaborative, school/community perspective.
It should be noted that this pattern might be used with the assistance of visiting resource specialists or consultants.
7
SAFE SCHOOL COMMITTEE The Safe School Committee is comprised of relevant stakeholders: administrators, faculty, police, support staff, students, parents, civil authorities, etc.
Its primary function is to monitor school safety needs for the purpose of identifying problems, recommending programs/policies for school safety, and assisting in crisis management and post-crisis response.
It may serve as the steering committee for self-assessment and planning.
Indicate the extent to which each of the following is in place: 1--not at all; 2--somewhat; 3--effectively; NR--not relevant.
IN THIS SCHOOL _____ a functional Safe School Committee and its responsibilities are defined in policy manuals and handbooks.
_____ the committee is comprised of representatives from law enforcement, teachers, student, and emergency services, as well as secretarial, custodial, counseling, and transportation staff.

Upon reviewing the above, indicate the extent to which a Safe School Committee is a need in this school: 1 minimally 2 somewhat 3 4 extensively
Describe what you feel are this school's greatest needs (if any) in this area: _________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ For additional information see: Blauvelt, On Making Your School Safe Safe Schools: A Handbook for Practitioners Safe Schools: A Planning Guide for Action Stephens, Safe Schools: A Handbook for Violence Prevention 8
MODEL FOR A SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN Outlined below is one model for a plan.
School personnel are encouraged to use any model they deem most appropriate for their school.
ONE: PURPOSE This should be a concise statement of the major objectives of the plan.
Example This plan was created to achieve three main objectives: one, to anticipate problems in the interest of preventing them; two, to proactively prepare personnel for managing crises should they occur; and three, to outline means for responding to crises' aftermath's.
The plan is viewed as a viable one and is presented in a form to both encourage and accommodate continuous revision and updating.
TWO: BACKGROUND This should be a brief statement of the processes and personnel involved in the preparation of the plan.
Example This plan was tailored to meet local school district needs while meeting legal and educational agency mandates.
It is consistent with local school board policies and has been reviewed and approved by the board.
The plan was developed by the Safe School Committee comprised of staff, parents, students, and local law enforcement officers.
It was reviewed by the staff to ensure knowledge of contents and credibility.
THREE: FORMAT This should be a description of the organization and components of this school's plan.
Example The plan is comprised of ELEMENTS, each of which is described and typically followed by recommended PROCEDURES for implementing, including what's to be done, how it is to be done, and by whom? And even though the plan is detailed, it should always be leavened with the admonition "to do that which the reasonably prudent person should do."
Note: The elements of the plan may be organized in many ways.
Here are some examples: - preventing a crisis - security of school buildings - crisis interventions.
9
FOUR: ELEMENTS
This should be a description of each of the parts or components of the plan with responsibilities and/or procedural expectations identified.
Each school will define and organize the plan's elements to meet its own needs.
Example Safe School Committee Description (Review and revise the description in this manual and tailor it to fit local school needs.)
Procedures/Responsibilities (Review the descriptive criteria for this section of the manual for cues as to procedures and responsibilities in this school.)
Crisis Plan and Emergency Procedures Description (Revise the description in this manual as desired.)
Procedures/Responsibilities (Review the descriptive criteria for this section of the manual for cues as to procedures and responsibilities in this school.)
Access Control Description (Revise the description in this manual as desired.)
Procedures/Responsibilities (Review the descriptive criteria for this section of the manual for cues as to procedures and responsibilities in this school.)
At this point it should be noted that a comprehensive School Safety Plan should be based on a systematic assessment of needs and intervention means, and should involve staff and stakeholders so as to ensure understanding and enhance the credibility of the plan.
Finally, the plan should be coordinated with district level policies, disseminated through policy manuals, handbooks, etc., and complemented through training and practice drills.
10
INFORMATION BASES: STUDENT DICIPLINE INCIDENTS BY TYPE AND FREQUENCY Note: When completed by a Safe School Committee member with access to accurate information, this document can be a valuable resource/tool for the entire committee.

PREVENTING VIOLENCE THROUGH PROBLEM ANTICIPATION AND ASSESSMENT
13
SCHOOL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT School climate is defined as the social, psychological and behavioral atmosphere of the school as perceived by students, staff, parents, etc.
It can be assessed through interviews, dialogue, surveys, focus groups, and observations.
These views, when complemented by analysis of school discipline referrals, provide an information base that identifies feelings of fear, safety, needs, as well as the prevalence of drugs, bullying, harassment, assaults, gangs, weapons, etc., whether observed, experienced, or perceived.
Indicate the extent to which each of the following is in place: 1--not at all; 2--somewhat; 3--effectively; NR--not relevant.

PROBLEM ANTICIPATION The literature and authorities in the field suggest a number of indicators of students at risk for drugs, gang influence, and violence, any of which contribute to unsafe schools.
Obviously, no one indicator is highly predictive; however, combinations enhance at-risk predictability.
Note that anti-social behaviors at school can happen regardless of the socioeconomic status of the students, the parents, or the community, as well as the size or location of the school.
School personnel face quite a challenge: they are responsible for protecting students, staff, and the school from potential violence while ensuring the civil rights of individuals.
Additionally, the school has a responsibility to identify and assist students evidencing adjustment problems and anti-social behaviors.
In all instances, care should be taken to avoid labeling, stereotyping, or stigmatizing students.
Indicate the extent to which each of the following is in place: 1--not at all; 2--somewhat; 3--effectively; NR--not relevant.

CRISIS MANAGEMENT Crisis management plans are school-specific and comprehensive procedures for coping with emergencies, both during them and in the aftermath.
They are known by the entire school staff.
The roles and responsibilities of personnel during and after the crises are detailed, as are relations and roles of the central office staff.
Among the crises that this plan should cover are accidents, shootings, kidnapping, hostage situations, weapons, fires, bombs and bomb threats, natural disasters, death, suicide, gang activity, demonstrations/riots, intruders, etc.

POST-CRISIS MANAGEMENT The school's response in the aftermath of a crisis is particularly critical in the process of healing and the potential for politicalization.
Within this emotional context, speculation, second guessing, and sometimes villain identification may emerge as to "what might have been done?", "why didn't they ...?", and the like.
Any of these reactions may delay healing and/or induce division within the school community.
Unfortunately, in the aftermath individuals and groups all too frequently seek validation for their views and support for their interests.

THIS SCHOOL _____ prepares principal and administrators to take control and secure the school in the event of a crisis.

MEDIA COORDINATION Working with the media can be a most difficult task both during and in the aftermath of violent episodes.
The media have a responsibility to get the story out, sometimes at a high cost to organizations and personnel, while school officials have a responsibility to protect students, the learning environment, the school's image and its personnel, particularly the victims and the suspects.
If not handled properly, the result can be a mostly adversarial relationship with the press, reflected in negative coverage of the school.
Achieving an appropriate relationship with the media is mainly the responsibility of the school administrator or designee.
Indicate the extent to which each of the following is in place: 1--not at all; 2--somewhat; 3--effectively; NR--not relevant.

DeBecker, Gavin.
The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence, Little, Brown and Co., 1997.
The author starts with a premise that "violence is a part of America ... our species ... around us, and it is in us."
He proposes that our safety is enhanced by honoring the gift of fear, the highest order intuitive signal.
DeBecker discusses several messengers of intuition such as fear, apprehension, suspicion, and gut feelings and reminds us of the myth that violence comes out of nowhere.
He identifies several risk factors for predicting future criminality, e.g. child abuse, poverty, humiliation, neglect, violence witnessing, and drug abuse.
He offers a telling challenge for educators: "I have learned that the kindness of a teacher, a coach, a police officer, a neighbor, or the parent of a friend is never wasted."
