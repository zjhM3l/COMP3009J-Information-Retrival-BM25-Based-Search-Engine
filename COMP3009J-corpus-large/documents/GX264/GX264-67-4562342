PHARMACIST INVOLVEMENT IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS by Milton Jez, R.Ph.
Staff Compliance Officer As the events of 9-11 and the anthrax scare unfolded, the American people realized how vulnerable they were in the realm of terrorist activities in our country.
Homeland security has become a reality in everyone's life.
Activities such as chemoprophylaxis for anthrax, plague, etc., and vaccination against smallpox have become important at the local pharmacy level.
Patients know that drugs used to cure or prevent some of these diseases may be readily available from these pharmacies.
In emergency situations individuals realize there is quick access to life saving antibiotics at the local pharmacy and useful information on drug therapy may be obtained from the pharmacist at the local pharmacy.
Pharmacists are becoming more valuable as potential emergency response team members due to their training and public trust.
We have to remember the pharmacist is a very visible member of the healthcare community and the pharmacist is a logical participant in any drug distribution activity in an emergency situation.
Community pharmacies as well as healthcare institutions may be called upon to contribute personnel and/or inventory in an emergency.
Many pharmacists have shown interest in emergency preparedness roles and activities and have asked what their role may be or what they may do in preparation for a bioterrorism emergency or even natural disasters.
Involvement in emergency preparedness begins at the local community level.
The Texas Department of Health is developing a plan by which bioterrorism (BT) emergency activities would start at the local community see EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS on page 3
PATIENT SAFETY Patient safety! This phrase has been intimately associated with the health p rofessions since time immemorial.
The Board's Mission Statement reflects this concern for patient safety.
"To promote, preserve, and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by fostering the pr ovision of quality pharmaceutical care to the citizens of Texas, through the regulation of the practice of pharmacy; the operation of pharmacies; and the distribution of prescription drugs in the public interest."
It is clearly apparent this concern is shared by the profession of pharmacy as all professional associations continue to work collaboratively with the Board to ensure patient safety.
Certainly the practice of pharmacy is much more than just patient safety.
Achieving positive patient outcomes through the provision of pharmaceutical care is the ultimate goal.
However, for this article, the first of my columns as President of the Board, I would like to focus on the Board's role in patient safety.
Board Requirements The Board works hard to be sure the r equir ements the y adopt serv e to accomplish the Boar d' s statutory mission.
Patient safety concerns weave through the requirements to practice pharmacy.
For example, something as basic as licensing standards are established to be sure that all entry level pharmacists meet minimum competencies to practice pharmacy safely and accurately.
Even labeling requirements
for dispensed prescriptions promote patient safety by clearly stating what drug, for whom, and how to take, the medication.
Several years ago, the Board required pharmacists to keep patient profiles containing information needed to perform meaningful drug regimen reviews.
These reviews foster patient safety by identifying potential problems and resolving or minimizing them pg. pg. pg. pg. 2 4 5 6
before they occur.
Yo u may notice several disciplinary actions in this issue of the Newsletter which involved errors that would not have occurred if the pharmacist performed a comprehensive drug regimen review.
And, please do not forget or minimize patient counseling.
This is the critical see PRESIDENT'S COLUMN on page 3

point where the results of drug regimen reviews become real in the life of a patient.
The information imparted to, and more importantly understood by the patient, can protect the patient as well as improve therapeutic outcomes.
Counseling is also the last opportunity for a pharmacist to catch a potential error before the patient received the drug.
Patient counseling is a tremendous opportunity to affect a patient's safety.
Unfortunately, the Board receives many complaints that the patient was not counseled and all too often, have never been counseled by a pharmacist.
It appear s that man y of our fello w pharmacists are not taking counseling seriously.
I can assure you, the Board takes it seriously.
A more recent development is the Board's increased support for the work of peer review committees.
Peer review as part of a continuous quality improvement program can provide objective information which can be used to decrease the potential for errors which impact a patient's safety.
Although the use of peer review committees is not currently a requirement, the Board considers their use as a mitigating factor whenever disciplinary action involving a dispensing err or is consider ed. Although the proper use of peer review can improve patient outcomes, patient safety can also be a major outcome of the peer review process.
Through the use of a task force in 2001, the Board w orked with e xperts to developed guidelines for establishing peer review committees .
These guidelines ar e a v ailable on the Boar d' s w ebsite: www.tsbp.state.tx.us.
Board Resources The Board's website is a useful resource to impr ov e patient safety in y our practice.
Besides the guidelines for establishing peer review committees, pertinent Newsletter articles are maintained on the w ebsite for futur e reference.
Links to other organizations are available, some of them directly addressing patient safety issues.
For example, there is a link to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP). see PRESIDENT'S COLUMN on page 7
level.
Participation would escalate to the regional, state, and federal level if necessary.
The Federal Government has developed the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS) that can be mobilized and deliv er ed within 12 hour s to anywhere in the United States in the event of a massive emergency situation which would require its contents.
The NPS contains 5 0 tons of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment If the NPS is deployed, local pharmacists may be called on to perform important functions: involvement in pharmaceutical distribution, overseeing proper drug packaging, labeling, and provision of pr oper written information to patients.
In addition, screening patients, taking medical histories, and counseling would all be necessary to insure that patients would be treated properly and effectively.1 Pharmacists should get involved now if they are interested in becoming part of and providing input for the emergency preparedness planning effort.
Involvement at the local community level is the first step in developing a plan for emergency situations whether it be BT events or local disasters.
Some suggestions are: build close working relationships with clinical colleagues prior to actual threatened BT events; work with or form local health task forces in conjunction with regional State efforts; and provide ongoing communication with those involved with these efforts.2 Useful web sites providing information for pharmacists who desire to become involved locally as well as statewide in emergency preparedness activities are: www.bt.cdc.gov www.texashomelandsecurity.com www.texas3dmat.com

Review of FY2002 Disciplinary Orders Allison Benz, R.Ph. Assistant Director of Enforcement
During the past three fiscal years, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy has entered an average of 34 disciplinary orders alleging that at least one error had occurred.
Information regarding these types of disciplinary orders is depicted in the chart below:

PRESCRIPTION ISSUED FOR Toprol 100 mg tablets Claritin 10 mg tablets Acular eye drops Cardura 2 mg tablets Demadex 10 mg tablets Coumadin 2 mg tablets Prednisone 5 mg tablets Norvasc 10 mg tablets
INCORRECTLY DISPENSED AS Topamax 100 mg tablets Ambien 10 mg tablets Auroto ear drops Warfarin 2 mg tablets Demadex 20 mg tablets Coumadin 10 mg tablets Deltasone 50 mg tablets Norvasc 5 mg tablets
WRONG STRENGTH
WRONG DIRECTIONS Doxepin 10mg/ml solution Zantac liquid
5 - 10 mg at bedtime 0.5 ml twice daily
5 - 10 tsp at bedtime 5 ml twice daily
Approximately 56% of the 45 errors which resulted in disciplinary orders may have been detected (and thus prevented) if a pharmacist had verbally counseled a patient or patient's agent and/or conducted a drug utilization review.
In addition, approximately 33% of the 45 errors may have been detected if the dispensing or consulting pharmacist had looked inside the prescription container and compared the contents to the drug name on the prescription label, before giving the prescription container to the patient or patient's agent.
Accordingly, the Board encourages pharmacists to read the drug name on the label and look inside the prescription container, before giving the medication to the patient/patient's agent.
Pharmacists are also encouraged to review errors that may have occurred in the pharmacy, evaluate their practice setting, and then make any changes necessary to prevent errors from occurring in the future.

COMPLIANCE REMINDERS Pharmacists Lunch Breaks In Class A (Community) pharmacies with only one pharmacist on duty, the pharmacist is allowed to take breaks and leave the prescription department provided the pharmacist remains on-site at the pharmacy and is available for an emergency.
The breaks may be no more than 30 minutes at a time and may not exceed a total of one hour in a 12 hour period.
Technician Certification and Training Certified Pharmacy Technicians are defined as technicians who have completed the pharmacy's technician training program, taken and passed the National Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, and maintain current certification with the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB).
All technicians, including certified technicians, must complete the pharmacy's in-house technician training program.
This training must be documented and available for inspection.
Rules relating to this training can be found in the personnel section for each class of pharmacy.
New Lawbook The 2002 Edition of the Pharmacy Laws and Regulations is still available for purchase.
This new edition includes a searchable CDRom which makes locating information quick and easy.
Order your new lawbook today and when you receive it take a moment to explore the new CDRom.
Of particular interest is the section containing procedures, forms, and addresses.
Medical Gases (Oxygen) Any pharmacy involved in the manufacturing or filling of medical gases for patient use outside of that facility is required to be licensed with the Texas Department of Health (TDH) as a Drug Manufacturer, register and list with the Federal Food 
Pharmacies who only dispense prepackaged Oxygen U.S.P. pursuant to valid patient specific prescriptions and do not fill gas cylinders or liquid containers, do not have to license with TDH or register with FDA.
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AUGUST 2002 After the Board obtains evidence of alleged violations, a licensee is sent a preliminary notice letter of the Board's intent to institute disciplinary action.
The licensee then has an opportunity to show compliance with the law in an informal conference with the Board staff (Executive Director/Secretary, Board Legal Counsel, and other staff at the discretion of the Executive Director and Board Legal Counsel).
If the licensee cannot show compliance with the law and desires to dispose of any pending allegations, the licensee may consent to the entry of an "Agreed Board Order."
The licensee must agree to the terms of the order and the order must be approved by the Board.
It should be noted that while there is agreement on the part of the licensee to the entry of an "Agreed Board Order," there is neither admission nor denial of guilt with respect to any matters that have come to the attention of the Board.
If a licensee, or the Board does not agree to terms of the "Agreed Board Order" or if the licensee does not wish an informal conference, a disciplinary hearing is scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings.
The Administ rative Law Judge, after hearing all evidence in the matter will make a recommendation to the Board for action to be taken.
The Board then makes a decision in the case, which is documented by the entry of a "Board Order."
On the finding of the existence of grounds for discipline of a licensee, the
Board may suspend, revoke, restrict, fine, refuse to issue or r ene w, probate, reprimand, cancel, or retire a license.
The Board has directed that "Agreed Board Orders" and "Board Orders" be published in the NEWSLETTER.
Although every effort is made to assure that the following information is correct, you should contact the Board's office to confirm the accuracy of the listing before making any decision based upon this information.
Copies of specific orders may be obtained for a fee, upon written request.

Canadian Drug Imports to the United States Who w ould ha v e thought that upholding the la w w ould be so complicated? Yet, when it comes to the hot-button issue of importing drugs from Canada into the United States, enforcement authorities on both sides of the border are finding themselves struggling to correctly interpret and enforce the laws.
In essence, the situation as some consumer s e xplain stands thus: Prescription drug prices in the United States are higher than in any other country; high enough that some patients have trouble affording necessary drug regimens.
Drug prices are lower in Canada, where price controls and the country's health system mandate lower purchasing prices from manufacturers.
It is becoming increasingly popular and socially acceptable for US residents to purchase their medications either from Canadian pharmacies in person by crossing the border, or by ordering from an Internet pharmacy.
Companies touting the later alternativ e ar e springing up and advertising their services in national publications; and while they imply that such activities are completely legal, they are not.
In fact, importing or r eimporting medications from Canada and other jurisdictions outside the US is almost always illegal, for a variety of reasons: usually does not meet all of the requirements of the US approval."
Labels must comply with FDA requirements.
Drugs are often dispensed without a valid prescription, a problem with many Internet drug transactions.
It is illegal for a Canadian pharmacy to reimport prescription drugs originally manufactured in the United States.
At the state level, 42 states require non-resident pharmacies to be registered with or licensed by the state board of pharmacy in order to ship drugs to resident consumers.
With drug importation clearly illegal in most situations, why the confusion among law enforcement agencies? In large part, the political climate and mixed messages from lawmakers are responsible.
Popular opinion strongly favors legalizing importation of drugs as a solution to high prices in the United States, and politicians seem to agree.
They do not necessarily support current law.
As reported in a recent issue of Newsweek , for e x ample , Vermont Governor Howa rd Dean encourages Vermonters to buy drugs from Canada.
Moreover, Congress has voted on more than one occasion to legalize the importation of medications fr om Canada for personal use, a move that keeps both consumers and regulators uncertain about imminent changes in the law.
In July 2002, the Senate passed H.R. 5186 approving the legalization of such imports with the proviso that it becomes law only if Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson finds that such imports are safe.
Given the Bush administration's stated opposition to such a measure, it seems likely that the bill will meet the fate of its predecessors in past years and not be implemented.
In the meantime, the ambiguity of such an action causes more confusion among consumers and regulators alike, and fuels misleading advertisements.
"The US Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of allowing you and your doctor
to or der y our pr escription drugs directly from Canada," trumpets one advertise-ment for a "pharmacy guide" that assists US consumers in ordering medications from across the border.
Confusion also stems in part from enforcement decisions made in the past by the FDA.
The FDA has allowed individuals and their physicians to bring under strictly defined circumstances certain drugs that are otherwise illegal into the United States.
In its written guidance to compliance officers, the agency states, "FDA personnel may use their discretion to allow entry of shipments of violative FDA- regulated products when the quantity and purpose are clearly for personal use, and the product does not present an unreasonable risk to the user."
This Personal Importation Policy outlines the agency 's enforcement priorities, which may have been more relevant in a time when international commerce was less common, and certainly the Internet not so pervasive.
The language is broad enough that some Internet operations have apparently used it to help justify their promotion of current importations.
Enforcing the Law As a result of these mixed messages flying about, both US and Canadian pharmacists and regulatory authorities find themselves caught in the middle, and not always sure of the correct course of action.
But stripped of its popular and political trappings, the issue is fairly simple: Can a US pharmacy send a prescription to a Canadian pharmacy to have it filled and then returned to the US pharmacy? No.
Can a US consumer or der a prescription online from a Canadian pharmacy? Again, no.
Does the responsibility rest with the pharmacy or the consumer? Both.
But since pharmacies are fewer in number and are already professionally regulated, they are the ones sought out by enforcers.
In fact, re gulatory agencies ar e actively addressing the issue.
The FDA has sent warning "cyber-letters" to a
Drugs shipped to US consumers must be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); most imported drugs are not.
The FDA gr ants drug approvals specific to manufacturers and products, and takes into consideration a host of other requirements, including manufacturing location and processing methods, formulation, source of active ingredients , and mor e .
As Da vid J. Horowitz, acting director of the FDA's Office of Compliance for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, notes, "Frequently, drugs sold outside of the US are not from a manufacturer that has FDA approval for that drug.
Moreover, even if the manufacturer has FDA approval for a drug, the version produced for foreign markets

number of pharmacies that operate on the Internet, advising them that they may be violating the law.
The agency continues to monitor these sites.
Some US state boards of pharmacy ha ve also begun to advise those pharmacists under their jurisdiction of the illegality of such imports.
Enforcement naturally becomes more complicated when international bor der s ar e inv olv ed. Canadian boards of pharmacy may find themselves scrambling to research US federal and state laws on the topic, and how their own laws intersect with US law.
Like the US boards of pharmacy, the Canadian boards enforce existing rules.
If drug exportation to the US is not illegal under Canada's national or provincial law or regulations, the board has little ability to act.
Moreover, privacy issues can prevent boards from sharing information with other jurisdictions that could act.
Indeed, cooperation is the key to addressing the issue.
"If it's an issue that has to be addressed because of patient care and legalities, then we need to take a multi-party approach," says Ronald Guse, registrar of the Manitoba Pharmaceutical Association.
While Guse has been attempting to establish the legalities of the situation within both Canada and the United States, "Clear legal definitions have not been forthcoming," he says.
Establishing clear laws that are coordinated across provincial, state, and international boundaries would obviously help, even if politics make it unlikely.
And effective enforcement requires cooperation as well, particularly as drug importation becomes a multi-million dollar business and enforcement resources remain small.
Meanwhile, within the scope of their mandate, Canadian authorities are not ignoring the issue.
The Ontario College of Pharmacists r ecently brought charges against an Internet pharmacy, the Canadian Drug Store, Inc., and seve ral individuals and entities associated with the online pharmacy.
The company had unlawfully set up and operated an unaccredited pharmacy, filling prescrip-
tions written by US doctors for US residents.
Provincial boards, including the Manitoba Pharmaceutical Association, have been active in ascertaining US law so those pharmacies under its jurisdiction can be properly notified about the issue.
Nonetheless, clear national guidance on a policy level has been lacking from both countries.
A Role for VIPPS? One concern touted by opponents of legalizing drug imports from Canada is the possibility that companies could transport drugs that appear authentic, but are, in fact, counterfeit or of lower quality.
NABP launched the successful Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice SitesTM (VIPPSTM) program in 1999 to address similar concerns in regard to US-based Internet pharmacies.
The Association is now wo rking with Canada's National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities to establish a similar program there.
Such a move would help put to rest at least some public health concerns.
Ultimately, the fate of drug importation lies with politicians, who will need to weigh competing pressures for affor dable medications and drug company profits sufficient to support research and development of new drugs.
Until this complex issue is resolved, regulators must continue to uphold the laws as they stand, not as what they may someday become.

Editor's Note - The Board has received numerous complaints about organizations promoting Canadian drugs and assisting patients with obtaining those drugs.
Many of these organizations are merely assisting consumers in obtaining prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies.
These activities do not classify them as pharmacies.
Although their activities may be questionable and possibly illegal, they do not violate the Texas Pharmacy Act.
Therefore, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy does not have jurisdiction over their activities.
The Board is monitoring their activities and will act if they cross the line into the actual practice of pharmacy or operation of a pharmacy.

REHABILITATION ORDERS Section 564.002 and 564.003 of the Pharmacy Act exempts from the Open Records Act, the records of the Board concerning pharmacists who have or
have had an alcohol or drug dependenc y or who ha v e de veloped an incapacity of a nature that prevents a pharmacist fr om engaging in the practice of pharmacy with reasonable skill, competence, and safety to the public.
Thus, Board Orders entered as a result of such impairments are confidential.
Because of this confidentiality, only the number of rehabilitation orders, which have been entered by the Board, will be published; the names of the pharmacist (and any pharmac y that is involved) are not published.
Twenty-three such Orders have been entered by the Board since the last board meeting in August 2002.
This number includes the following types of orders: (1) n e w or der s entered on pharmacists who have or have had a chemical dependency, or mental or physical impairment; (2) subsequent orders on these individuals; and (3) orders entered on a pharmacy license as a result of violations or alleged violations by a pharmacist with an impairment.
As of August 31, 2002, the Board is now monitoring 97 individuals who have been the subject of a Rehabilitation Order.
