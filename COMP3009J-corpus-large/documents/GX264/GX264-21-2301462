09/13/01 Chapter 8 Field Trials and Hunting Dog Training Basis and Purpose Draft Basis and Purpose Statement: These regulations are necessary to manage field trials in Colorado, particularly field trials occurring on Division properties, the associated release of privately-owned game birds on all lands, and in understanding the demand for and role of field trials.
Field trials are a form of wildlife-related recreation which, through training and competition, result in highly trained hunting dogs which contribute to the overall improvement of hunting dog breeds and, from a hunting recreation standpoint, retrieval of game birds.
This adoption constitutes a five year review of field trial and hunting dog training regulations, and there are some significant changes.
The definition of a field trial is modified to specify that the activity involves hunting dogs and their associated hunting skills.
A new definition is added for privately-owned game birds, for use in releases for field trials.
The definition of training is modified to specify that it is a noncommercial activity for hunting dogs.
Dog trainers who charge their clients fees to train their dogs are commercial uses and must have a commercial use agreement to perform those services on Division properties.
However, clinics or group training seminars sponsored by hunting dog clubs on Division properties may have a nominal cost to participants intended to cover the costs to the club.
These types of activities require a field trial license and are not classified as a commercial use for the purpose of permitting.
The definition of training is also expanded to include group training of 10 or more people and their hunting dogs, with a further requirement later in the chapter that a field trial license be required on Division properties.
Field trial licensing requirements for all lands other than Division properties, including other public lands and all private lands have been eliminated, although all private or non-Division property access permission requirements remain in place according to applicable laws or regulations.
In place of licensing on non-Division properties, field trialers are required to notify the Division 30 days in advance of such trials, providing information on location and number and species of game birds to be released.
All releases must be in accordance with existing regulations on importation and release.
Releases which, in the past, were authorized by these licenses, remain legal, and a specific authorization for an unlimited number of birds to be released and taken is provided as long as compliance with the other regulations is maintained.
This is a significant streamlining of the licensing process which is intended to lessen the administrative burden for both field trial organizers and the Division when Division property is not involved.
Licensing necessary to manage field trials and group training on Division properties is maintained.
This is necessary due to the increasing demand for all types of special uses of Division properties and the potential for impacts to wildlife habitat from this type of group activity.
Licensing requirements are modified to provide adequate time for processing of applications and timely approval which meets the needs of applicants in scheduling their events, with the application period expanded to a minimum of 60 days but not more than 180 days prior to the trial or group training event.
The 180 day limitation is to ensure that annual access opportunity to field trial dates, especially on properties with limits on the number of trials allowed, is provided to all prospective applicants.
Criteria for approval, denial, and conditions for licenses and modification, suspension, or revocation of previously issued licenses are updated and clarified, and will be applied using clear and defensible information in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (Title 24, CRS).
Release and taking of wildlife provisions are updated to reflect the changes in this chapter and to avoid conflict with release provisions for game birds found in Chapter 11.
In the past, more than 25 birds could be released because it was approved as part of the field trial license.
Now that field trial licenses are not required except on Division properties, Chapter 11 would restrict releases to 25 birds, so these regulations authorize release of more than 25 birds for both field trials and training.
These regulations also ensure that the designation of official gunners can take place whether a field trial license is required or not.
The receipt for the birds is the authorization to take the birds and designate the official gunner, as it serves as documentation that the birds came from a private source.
The regulations are also modified to require reporting of the inadvertent taking of any wildlife not authorized in accordance with the chapter, rather than only marked migratory birds, in the event that a wild bird should be taken.
Finally, the period for training of hunting dogs on wild game birds using blank cartridges is expanded to end on April 15
rather than March 31.
This expansion will facilitate training without negatively impacting most nesting game bird species.
There are some Division properties which serves as significant production areas for waterfowl where such training could have such adverse impacts, however, those properties have site specific closures providing that protection, listed in Chapter 9.
There are also related changes in Chapter 9 which identify property specific field trial provisions and limitations.
Administrative procedures to be followed, including proactive and technologically updated notification of applicants to improve processing, procedures for ensuring timely review, and procedures designed to improve communication between applicants and the Division have been placed in a separate document to be used by Division employees in reviewing applicants and working with field trial interests.
This is intended to prevent problems and denial of applications due to poor understanding of expectations and/or criteria by both employees and applicants.
The Division will provide a copy of the administrative procedures to field trial license applicants along with all necessary application and notification forms and regulations so that applicants and the Division know what to expect and can address procedural problems if they should occur.
The primary statutory authority for these regulations is Â§Â§ 33-1-101 through 108 and -110, 33-4-102, Article 6 of Title 33, and 24-4-103, all CRS as amended.
EFFECTIVE DATE - THESE REGULATIONS SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2001 AND SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT UNTIL REPEALED, AMENDED OR SUPERSEDED.
APPROVED AND ADOPTED BY THE WILDLIFE COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF COLORADO THIS 13TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2001.
