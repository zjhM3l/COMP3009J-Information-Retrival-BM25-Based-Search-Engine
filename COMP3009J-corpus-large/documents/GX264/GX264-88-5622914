The first section of this chapter presents national data on school crime and youth violence.
Data on international school crime and youth violence follow.
The chapter concludes with information on hate crime and harassment.
Data used in this chapter are drawn from several different studies conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan.
A complete list of the studies is included in the References section of this report.
All the studies used nationally representative samples, except for the data source on school-associated violent deaths (which tracked all school-associated violent deaths in the country), and the data source for unintentional injuries (which used the school National Pediatric Trauma Registry to identify cases from 74 hospitals in 30 states).
Data sources for the other studies varied.
Some surveyed different populations of students, another surveyed teachers, and yet another surveyed other school staff.
Definitions of crime, age groups analyzed, and time periods can vary from indicator to indicator.
The reader should also note that definitions vary across studies.
For example,
"at school" and "away from school" may have different meanings, depending upon the study.
For a more complete understanding of most of the data in this report, see Indicators of School Crime and Safety, 1999, or the original studies listed in the References section.
A N AT I O N A L P E RS P E C T I V E
Building on data provided in the 1998 Annual Report on School Safety, this section provides a national picture of American schools and the amount of violence and crime experienced by those who work and learn there.
Where possible, data are presented that update the 1998 Annual Report, so that progress in combating school violence may be tracked and analyzed.
Several data sources have been added to this year's Annual Report.
Figures with the icon have been updated from last year's Annual Report.
This section attempts to address those questions at the heart of the school safety issue.
Are most injuries that occur at school the result of violence? How much crime is occurring in our Nation's schools? Are schools more or less safe than in the past? Do students feel safe at school? What kinds of crimes are occurring? How likely is it that students or teachers will become the victims of school crime? After a relatively quiet 1998-99 school year, we were subjected to a rude and tragic awakening after the shootings at Columbine High School.
We were reminded once again that while homicides at school are extremely rare events, they do occur and they affect the perspective of all Americans, especially school children.
H omic i de s a t s choo l r em ain e xt re me ly ra re ev ent s.
While multiple homicide events have captured headlines in recent years, there still exists a less than one in a million chance of suffering a school-associated violent death, but even that is too much.
Â· Preliminary data indicate that less than one percent of the more than 2,500 children nationwide who were murdered or committed suicide in the first half of the 1997-1998 school year (July 1, 1997 Â­ December 31, 1997) were at school (on school property, at a school sponsored event, or on the way to or from school or a school sponsored event).
Â· For the complete school year, July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998, there were 58 school-associated violent deaths (student and non-students) that resulted from 46 incidents.
Forty-six of these violent deaths were homicides, 11 were suicides, and one teenager was killed by a law enforcement officer in the course of duty.

Â· Among the homicide deaths, 29 were single homicides, 14 were homicides in events with multiple victims, and three were part of a combination homicide/suicide.
Among the homicide victims, 30 (65 percent) were male.
Also, 34 (74 percent) were school aged children, six (13 percent) were school staff, and six (13 percent) were not affiliated with any school.
Â· Thirty-two (70 percent) of the homicides at school occurred on school property, one (2 percent) occurred at a school sponsored event, and 13 (28 percent) occurred in transit to or from school or a school sponsored event.
Â· Of the suicide deaths, eight were single suicides, and three were part of a combination homicide/suicide.
Among the suicide victims, 10 (91 percent) were male, six (55 percent) were school aged children, one (9 percent) was school staff , and four (36 percent) were not affiliated with any school.
Â· Nine (82 percent) of the suicides occurred on school property.
Two (18 percent) occurred in transit to or from school or at a school sponsored event.

Although there were fewer school-associated violent death incidents in the 1997-98 school year (46 total) than in 1992-93 (55 total), the total number of multiple victim homicide events appears to have increased (see figure 1).
Multiple victim homicides include events where an offender fatally injured more than one victim.
Combination homicide/suicides and multiple suicides are excluded from this count.
Â· Since the 1992-93 school multiple victim homicide 1993-1994 school year). events in 1992-93 to five year, there has been at least one event each year (except for the The number increased from two events in 1997-98.

The nature of crime away from school is far more serious than at school.
Thankfully, serious violent crime rates (as well as theft rates) are down both at school and away from school as compared with the 1993 data presented in last year's Annual Report.
Â· Students ages 12 through 18 were more likely to be victims of serious violent crime away from school than at school.
In 1997, about 24 of every 1,000 students (ages 12 to 18) were victims of serious violent crimes away from school (a total of 635,900 serious violent crimes).
In contrast, only eight of every 1,000 students were victims of serious violent crimes at school or going to and from school (201,800 total) (see figure 2).

Among children (ages five through 18) who were admitted to a pediatric trauma unit or children's hospital for an injury sustained at school, 90 percent were injured unintentionally through falls, sports, and school equipment (for example, wood shop equipment).
Â· Falls were the most common type of school injury, accounting for 43 percent of all admissions.

Â· In 1997, there were 63 thefts for every 1,000 students (ages 12 to 18) at school (see figure 3).
Theft accounted for about 61 percent of all crime against students at school that year.

Since 1993, the overall school crime rate for students ages 12 to 18 has declined as have rates of crime outside of school for this group.
Â· The overall school crime rate between 1993 and 1997 declined, from about 155 school-related crimes for every 1,000 students ages 12 to 18 in 1993 to about 102 such crimes in 1997.
Crime victimization outside of school declined from about 139 crimes for every 1,000 students in this age group in 1993 to 117 such crimes in 1997 (see figure 4).

Â· In 1997, 5 percent of all 12th graders reported that they had been injured on purpose with a weapon such as a knife, gun, or club during the prior 12 months while they were at school, and 14 percent reported that they had been injured on purpose without a weapon.
These numbers have remained fairly stable over the past 20 years (see figures 5 and 6).

As with student crime, most crimes against teachers are thefts.
Teachers in urban schools are more vulnerable to crime at school than are suburban school teachers.
Â· On average, each year from 1993 to 1997 there were 131,400 violent crimes against teachers at school and 222,800 thefts from teachers at school, as reported by teachers from both public and private schools.
This translates into a rate of 31 violent crimes for every 1,000 teachers and a rate of 53 thefts for every 1,000 teachers.
Â· On average each year from 1993 to 1997, about 4 out of every 1,000 elementary, middle, and high school teachers were the victims of serious violent crime at school (see figure 7).
Â· Teachers in urban schools (39 for every 1,000 teachers) were more likely to be victims of violent crime than were teachers in suburban schools (22 for every 1,000 teachers) (see figure 8).

The presence of weapons and physical fights at school are dangerous and disruptive to the learning environment.
Contrary to public perception, however, student weapon carrying and physical fighting have declined steadily in recent years.
Â· Between 1993 and 1997, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of high school students who carried a weapon (for example, a club, knife, or gun) on school property, and in the percentage of students in a physical fight on school property, on at least one of the 30 days preceding the survey (see figure 9).
Â· These declines were similar across sex, grade, and race/ ethnic subgroups, but male students, younger students, and Black and Hispanic students were consistently more likely than their peers to engage in these behaviors.
Â· About 3 percent of 12th grade students reported carrying a gun to school at least one day during the previous 4week period.
This percentage remained fairly stable from 1994 to 1997 (see figure 10).
There ar e c o ns equ en ces for s tud en t s wh o c ar ry fi rearms to sc ho ol.
Â· For the 1997-98 school year, States and territories reported that they had expelled an estimated 3,930 students for bringing a firearm to school.
The number of expulsions declined from 6,093 for the 1996-1997 school year.
Â· In part, this decline is due to improvements in data collection and reporting.
Therefore, caution should be used when interpreting these data.

Â· Fewer than half of the students expelled during the 199798 school year were referred for alternative placements.
Students expelled for firearms often do not receive educational services through alternative programs or schools.
Currently, very little is known about the number or nature of alternative programs.
The U.S. Department of Education is conducting a survey of school districts to help provide better information about these programs and schools.
Information from this study will be available in 2001.

The U.S. is not the only country that confronts youth and school violence.
While it is difficult to compare the U.S. to other countries on school safety and youth violence issues, several studies have been conducted across countries that provide comparable data on feelings of safety, bullying, and student behavior.
The data from these studies are presented in this section.

Â· According to the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEAP), higher percentages of Black and Hispanic 4th grade students reported feeling "very unsafe" at school (9 percent and 6 percent, respectively) than did White students at that grade level (2 percent).
Â· According to the 1998 NAEP, compared to 4th and 8th grade students, fewer 12th grade students reported feeling "very unsafe" at school, regardless of race.

TIMSS, conducted in 1995, consists of data from half a million students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades in 41 countries.
The eight countries that had data at all three levels were used in this report.
Â· Across several countries, older students were more likely than younger students not to have been threatened by another student (see figure 11).
Â· While, overall, fewer 12th grade students (compared to 4th or 8th grade students) reported being threatened, U.S. 12th graders were more likely to have been threatened than 12th graders from other countries (see figure 11).

This school-based research study, performed for the first time in the United States in 1997-98, has been conducted every four years by European countries since 1982.
The research goal is to increase our understanding of health behaviors, lifestyles, and their context in young people, ages 11 to 15 years.
The study provides data on 120,000 students from 28 countries for the 1997-98 school year.
Fifteen countries included questions on injury and violence, six of which are used in this report.
These countries were selected because their study methods and questions were similar to the United States.
Data for 15year-old students are presented because they are more closely related to the national data presented in the first section of this chapter.
Â· During the past 12 months, the majority of 15-year-old students across several countries (including the U.S.) have not been in a physical fight (see figure 12).
Â· During the past 30 days, the majority of 15-year-old students across several countries (including the U.S.) did not carry a weapon for self-defense (see figure 13).
Â· A substantial majority of 15-year-old students across many countries were not bullied at school (see figure 14).

A study conducted by the Japanese government found that, in 1997, Japanese schools experienced violence including violence against teachers, violence among students, and property damage.
The most common type of violence occurred among students.
Examples of violent acts occurring among students include arguments among students that resulted in injuries and physical fights.
Acts of violence occurred in 2 percent of elementary schools, 30 percent of middle schools, and 37 percent of high schools.
Approximately 43,000 incidents of bullying occurred in public Japanese elementary, middle, and high schools.
The largest number of bullying incidents occurred among the first year middle school students.
After the first year of middle school, the incidents of bullying dropped progressively at each higher grade level.
Fostering and maintaining a safe learning environment means creating a climate of tolerance in which all students are comfortable, respected, and secure.
However, because of stereotypes, ignorance and intolerance, certain individuals and groups tend to be alienated from their fellow students.
A source of conflict in many schools is the perceived or real problem of bias and unfair treatment of students because of ethnicity, gender, race, social class, religion, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, physical appearance, or some other factor--both by staff and peers.
In this context, the topic of hate crime and harassment has been the subject of national concern, particularly with regard to young people.
This section presents the current status of hate crime and harassment legislation and related statistics.
Defi nit ion o f Ha te Cr i me
Hate crime, as defined in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note), is a term used to describe crimes against individuals where the victim was selected because of the race, skin color, ethnicity/national origin, sexual orientation, gender, religion or disability of any person.
A hate crime under this provision is not, in fact, a specific crime.
Rather, the provision refers to penalty enhancements for crimes motivated by biases against a victim.
If a Federal prosecutor can prove that one or more factors-- such as a

victim's race, religion, disability, or any of the other categories protected by law--motivated a criminal act, hate crime laws can increase the length of an offender's prison sentence by as much as 37 percent.
L aw s th a t P ro te c t Ag ai ns t Hat e Cr i me
A number of federal and state laws prohibit acts or threats of violence, as well as harassment and discrimination, based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender and/or disability.
Federal and state hate crime and civil rights laws may also apply in the school context.
As of July 1999, only eight states do not have any hate crime laws at all (see figure 16).
The applicable federal laws include the following: 18 U.S.C.
Section 245.
Section 245, the principal federal hate crime statute, prohibits intentional use of force against a person because of his or her race, color, religion, or national origin, and because he or she was engaged in a "federally protected activity," such as enrolling in or attending any public school or college.
Legislation has been introduced which would amend Section 245 to include crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability, and to eliminate the "federally protected activity" requirement.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI and regulations promulgated under Title VI prohibit discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of race, color, and national origin by institutions that receive federal funding.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
Title IX and regulations promulgated under Title IX prohibit discrimination, including harassment based on sex, by institutions that receive federal funding.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Section 504 and regulations promulgated under Section 504 prohibit discrimination, including harassment, based on disability by institutions that receive federal funding.
H at e Cr im e St at isti c s
The problem of hate crime in the United States may well be underreported.
Complicating matters further is the variation among state definitions of hate or bias-motivated crime.
While such crimes typically refer to criminal acts motivated by a victim's perceived sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disability, race, color, ethnic background or national origin, not all states define hate crime the same way nor do all local jurisdictions report hate crime to the FBI.
In addition, the age of the offender is rarely, if ever, reported, so it is not possible to determine whether a hate crime is committed by an adult or juvenile.

H ara ss me nt a nd H at e Cr i me St a tis ti cs Am o ng Youth
Currently, the Health Behavior of School Children Survey does provide some data on the prevalence of "bullying" or harassment among 11-, 13-, and 15-year-olds in the United States.
According to recent data, approximately 15 percent of these youth had been bullied because of their religion or race.
In addition, over 30 percent of these youth had been bullied by sexual jokes, comments, or gestures directed at them.
The U.S. Departments of Education and Justice are modifying several data collection surveys to help capture harassment and hate crime incidents at school and on college campuses.
In January 1999, the ongoing National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) included a hate crime item on its incident report for the first time.
At the same time, the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey also included items on hate language and graffiti at school.
If these items prove valid and reliable, they will be reported in the 2000 Annual Report on School Safety.
Hate crime items are also being tested for inclusion in the School Survey on Crime and Safety, a survey of elementary and secondary school principals sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and scheduled to be in the field in 2000.
Results from this survey will be available in 2001.
Hate crime items are being added to the National CORE Alcohol and Drug Survey, a survey of post-secondary institutions which gathers information about crime and violence on college campuses.
Finally, hate crime and harassment items will be included in the School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
SHPPS will collect data from state and local education agencies and elementary and secondary schools.
The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports: Hate Crime Statistics provides national data on hate crimes, but does not provide specific data for hate crimes at schools.

The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative draws on the best practices of the education, justice, social service, and mental health systems to promote a comprehensive, integrated problem-solving process for use by communities in addressing school violence.
This process, which was highlighted in the 1998 Annual Report, includes (1) establishing school-community partnerships; (2) identifying and measuring the problem; (3) setting measurable goals and objectives; (4) identifying appropriate research-based programs and strategies; (5) implementing programs and strategies in an integrated fashion; (6) evaluating the outcomes of programs and strategies; and (7) revising the plan on the basis of evaluation information.
The Initiative requires comprehensive, integrated communitywide plans to address at least the following six elements: (1) safe school environment; (2) prevention and early intervention programs that address violence, alcohol and other drugs; (3) school and community mental health preventive and treatment intervention services; (4) early childhood psychosocial and emotional development programs; (5) educational reform; and (6) safe school policies.
Plans must be developed in partnership with, at a minimum, the local educational agency, local public mental health authority, local law enforcement agency, family members, students, and juvenile justice officials.
The Agencies awarded 54 Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative grants to local educational agencies in partnership with local law enforcement and public mental health authorities.
Awards range from up to $3 million per year for urban school districts, up to $2 million per year for suburban school districts, and up to $1 million per year for rural school districts and tribal schools.
A national evaluation of the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative will be conducted to document the effectiveness of collaborative community efforts to promote safe schools and provide opportunities for healthy childhood development.
In subsequent Annual Reports, information from the evaluation will be reported to provide progress on the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative sites and document their lessons learned.
Following are descriptions of the 54 Safe Schools/Healthy Students grant recipients.

There is a high prevalence of drug use and arrests, and excessive rates of suicide, homicide, juvenile delinquency, and accidental death.
Existing early intervention programs do not adequately meet the needs of the youth.
The Indian Health Service is the only non-reservation provider of mental health services, and can only serve 40 percent of children and families in need.
The program will use the services of health care educators, practitioners, social workers, counselors, psychologists, grandparent advisors, and school resource officers.
They will work as a team out of the Intergenerational Family Resource Help Center to provide prevention and intervention programs focusing on the mental and emotional health of the preschool population.
These programs will seek to reduce gangs and violence, and incorporate anti-violence and anti-drug curricula throughout the school and community.
The Intergenerational Family Resource Help Center will also coordinate and increase the provision of mental health services.

The data presented in this chapter are drawn from three ongoing studies of school-based efforts to prevent and reduce poor youth outcomes.
The studies focus on programs designed to reduce substance use, anti-social and violent behavior, and problem behavior in general.
The programs have been formally evaluated using school-aged children in school settings, and a comparison group design.
They are among the most effective programs examined to date in attaining good outcomes for youth.
It should be noted that many more programs were analyzed than are included in the current rankings.
Supplemental information on the analyses that generated the programs included in this chapter is available from the Hamilton Fish National Institute on School and Community Violence (www.hamfish.org).
The programs presented in this chapter have been rigorously evaluated in the field.
Programs listed have been ranked among the top 50 percent in terms of strong program effects by at least one of three groups of researchers.
Some of the programs have been tested in multiple sites, while others have been implemented in only a single school.
In choosing an appropriate intervention for inclusion in a comprehensive school safety plan, it is important to recognize the need to adapt a program to specific school environments.
The conditions and populations in which programs have been tested can be quite different from those in which the program is to be adapted.
Additionally, schools serve ethnically and economically diverse student populations, populations that may differ from those tested.
While fidelity to a tested, theory-based program is important to maintaining program effect, research also shows that tailoring a program to address cultural differences in student populations, can increase its effectiveness.
Accordingly, selection and replication of demonstrated programs should be based on the goals, objectives, needs, and available resources identified in the comprehensive school safety plan, adapting the programs as necessary, while maintaining the integrity of their original design.
Assessing the effectiveness of these adapted strategies is essential.

Anger Coping Program The Anger Coping Program is designed to provide cognitive behavioral training to preadolescent and early adolescent youth (i.e., 8 to 14 years old), but is also appropriate in an adapted form for younger children and older adolescents.
The program is structured for use with groups of children in which two co-leaders administer modeling, role-playing, group problem-solving, and positive reinforcement activities, including a reward reinforcement system for goal achievement.
It is recommended that one of the two coleaders be a site-based school psychologist or school counselor.
In general, groups meet for 12 or, in the updated version, 18 weeks, once per week, for 60 to 90 minutes.
In the evaluated sample, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade boys, identified by their teachers as the most aggressive and disruptive at school, were selected as participants.
Students were involved with the program for a period of 12-18 weeks and exhibited 30% fewer antisocial and violent behaviors following participation in the program relative to a comparison group.
The sample included both White and African-American students.

BrainPower Program The BrainPower Program is a retraining intervention designed to reduce peer-directed aggression.
The treatment is a 12-lesson cognitive intervention with materials and activities appropriate for the late elementary grades.
The primary goal of the intervention is to train aggressive boys not to infer hostile peer intent in negative social encounters.
The program contains three components.
The first component strengthens aggressive boys' ability to detect with accuracy the intent of others.
The second component is designed to increase the likelihood that aggressive boys will assume nonhostile intent when negative social encounters are ambiguous.
The third component elaborates on the meaning of intentionality in the context of linking appropriate behavioral responses to ambiguously caused, negative outcomes.

In Abington, Pennsylvania, community members and school personnel have been concerned about students' after-school alcohol and drug use.
As a result, Abington developed a comprehensive, long-term prevention program to serve students from kindergarten through high school graduation.
Abington Senior High School's program is built around early prevention and includes programs that begin in the early elementar y years and continually build upon previous knowledge throughout future grade levels.
Prevention programming begins with building a strong social skill foundation among students through a series of lessons on decision-making skills, resistance, and refusal skills.
At higher grade levels, these skills are infused with prevention education in multiple areas including awareness of tobacco, drug, and violence issues.
A key prevention component of Abington Senior High School's prevention strategy is the infusion of anti-drug and violence messages in the curriculum and instruction program.
Science, health, physical education, and family and consumer science courses all include lessons about the significant consequences of tobacco, drug, and alcohol involvement.
Teachers utilize in-ser vice time to help identify and implement best practices in guiding students and giving them effective means for interacting with all members of the school community.
The drug and violence prevention program is supported with effective discipline policies.
Each year, students receive a Student Handbook outlining the standards of appropriate conduct and the sanctions for violation of the school code.
For student suspensions due to fighting, the principal conducts an informal hearing complete with due process rights.
Suspension hearings always include the student involved, their parents, the assistant principal, a guidance counselor, and the community-policing officer assigned to the school.
To help identify and respond to students who demonstrate drug and alcohol involvement, Abington High School has created a Student Assistance Program (SAP).
Members of the SAP team are thoroughly trained in appropriate inter vention strategies and in developing informed and stratified approaches that include parents, the school team, and mental health providers.
Abington Senior High School has reported a decrease in student suspensions from 14 drug/alcohol offenses, 38 fights, and two weapon offenses in 1993-94, to six drug/alcohol offenses, 14 fights, and zero weapon offenses in 1997-98.

The BrainPower Program is conducted as a school-based program of small group instruction.
Students are seen on a pull-out basis during the course of the regular school day.
Groups of six students meet twice weekly in 60-minute sessions for a total of 12 sessions.
Each group should consist of four excessively aggressive and two average, nonaggressive students.
Those involved in the program were in grades three through six and were primarily African-American and Latino students from an urban setting.
The participants received instruction one or two times per week for six weeks and exhibited from 12 to 20% fewer antisocial and violent behaviors relative to the comparison group after the program period ended.

Effects of the Good Behavior Game were measured by teacher ratings, peer nomination, and independent observations in the classrooms.
All three evaluation methods showed positive effects for both males and females by the end of first grade, compared to children in the control group.
During a nine-month followup, teacher ratings exhibited a 10-percent reduction while peer nominations exhibited a 19-percent reduction in aggressive behavior.
By middle school, evaluations found positive results for males who had displayed early aggressive behavior in first grade.
The Good Behavior Game also had measurable effects on the initiation of smoking among males.
The sixth grade program youth had a prevalence rate that was six percent lower for tobacco use than nonprogram youth.
The program was evaluated for African-American and White students in an urban setting.

Good Behavior Game The Good Behavior Game (GBG), for children in the first grade, aims at reducing early aggressive and shy behaviors.
The program improves the teacher's ability to define tasks, set rules, and discipline students.
At the beginning of the game, children are assigned to teams by their teacher who makes sure that teams contain equal numbers of aggressive/disruptive children and social isolates.
Students work in teams in such a way that the individual is responsible to the rest of the group.
The teacher then clearly defines a set of disruptive behaviors, which if displayed, will result in a team receiving a demerit.
At the end of the game, those teams that have not exceeded the maximum number of demerits are rewarded with tangible rewards or rewarding activities, whereas those teams that have exceeded the maximum are not rewarded.
Because the program seeks to modify the behavior of shy children without labeling them as such, shy children are often appointed Team Leader with the responsibility for handing out prizes.
After the students become used to the rules of the game, the teacher begins the game with no warning, so that students are always aware of their own behavior.
I Can Problem Solve: An Interpersonal Cognitive ProblemSolving Program I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) serves as an effective violence prevention program by helping children think of nonviolent ways to solve everyday problems.
It has proven to be extremely effective in helping children learn to resolve interpersonal problems and prevent antisocial behaviors.
ICPS is a cognitive approach that teaches children how to think, not what to think.
They learn that behavior has causes, that people have feelings, and that there is more than one way to solve a problem.
As they learn to associate how they think with what they do, children become more caring and better able to share, cooperate, and get along with others.
ICPS is available in separate volumes for three developmental levels: preschool, kindergarten and primary grades, and intermediate elementary grades.
The program can be easily incorporated into the classroom or adapted for use by counselors.
The curriculum involves formal lessons, interaction in the classroom, and integration into the curriculum.

Concerned with the amount of time spent responding to classroom disruptions and discipline problems, faculty at Linwood Elementar y School developed a comprehensive strategy to help improve student behavior.
The school's Discipline Committee identified a need to improve student courtesy and respect, as well as inter-personal relationships.
After researching and reviewing various discipline plans and strategies, the Committee implemented the Linwood Pride Discipline Plan: Making Responsible Choices to help students take responsibility for their own actions.
Developed by teachers, students, and parents, the Linwood Pride Discipline Plan aims to teach students responsible decision making.
Students are consistently reminded of the underlying theme of the Discipline Plan-- "We believe in you.
We trust you.
We know you can do it."
The program's philosophy is based on several premises: each person is a responsible decision maker; each person makes many choices every day; each person decides how to behave; no one else causes a person to do anything, and each person chooses success or failure.
If a student does not make responsible choices, they visit the Opportunity Room--a designated room for students to think about their decisions, discuss what occurred, and develop an action plan for the next time they are placed in a similar situation.
A trained school counselor works closely with each student to provide support and to determine when students need additional services, such as mentoring, counseling, or designing an individual behavior plan.
Linwood Elementar y School has created a school climate that is highly conducive to the learning process and academic achievement.
Students and staff members constantly reinforce the school's vision and mission statement, "Children should be accepting of and compassionate toward others."
A full-time nurse and guidance counselor supplement and complement the work of the classroom teacher in creating a nur turing and safe environment.
Parental involvement is encouraged through active recruiting in school newsletters, flyers, and invitations to eat lunch with their children at school.
A Parent Resource Center offers parents the opportunity to work on projects for teachers, read with children, and participate in small group discussions on student issues.
During the 1997-98 school year, parent volunteers logged in 5,180 hours of ser vice to the school, a 25% increase from the previous year.
Each year the school discipline plan is evaluated.
The percentage of students demonstrating acceptable behavior increased from 84% in the 1996-97 school year to 92% in 1997-98.
Furthermore, the percentage of students referred to the Opportunity Room fell from 29% to 16% during the same period.

Based on more than 20 years of research, researchers have observed a substantial improvement in behavioral adjustment attributable to the program.
Importantly, youngsters not showing behavior problems in preschool were less likely to begin showing them later.
Evaluators observed a 56 to 62% reduction (during the followup evaluations) in problem behaviors of the 113 trained prekindergarten and kindergarten, inner-city children, compared to the 106 children in the control group.

Each Kid Power Program is presented by a counselor who is experienced and trained in mental health and substance abuse and who brings a diversified background of experience working with children.
Each counselor serves approximately 20 children in grades one through five "full time" for the first program semester.
Each participant receives weekly individual and group counseling with maximum assistance provided to the family as needed and as their individual cooperation permits.
Second semester Kid Power enrollees are considered "part time" and each child receives group counseling, varying from weekly to monthly, depending on the needs of the individual student.
The majority of students in the program are white males.
The students received the program three or four times per week for 18 weeks.
After the program, participating students exhibited 40% fewer antisocial and violent behaviors relative to a comparison group.

Kid Power Program The Kid Power Program is a school-based prevention and intervention program for elementary schools, funded by the Florida Department of Children and Families.
The Kid Power model is designed to prevent multiple-risk students from becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs and from being violent.
Each Kid Power program provides individual and group preventive counseling, events, and activities for the students and their families.
Additionally, counselors serve as resource persons for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use prevention and intervention services within their schools.
Students who display risk factors that research has shown to be associated with substance abuse behavior are selected after a screening process involving the Kid Power counselor, students, parents, and school personnel.
Selected participants are those most likely to demonstrate academic and social gains through a program promoting healthy peer interaction, positive school experiences, and preventive counseling sessions.
Metropolitan Area Child Study The Metropolitan Area Child Study (MACS) is a multicomponent violence and substance use prevention program that also aims to enhance and support prosocial behavior and academic achievement.
This program seeks to affect the child's thinking and behavior, while also affecting the major influences on development (teachers, peers, and parents).
As presently configured, three levels of intervention can be implemented.
The most basic program combines teacher training in classroom behavior management and instructional techniques with a classroom-based social-skills, social problem-solving curriculum (20 weeks over two years).
A 20-session, small-group component for children with above average risk for aggression can also be added.
This component is delivered through weekly sessions with six to eight children.
A third component involves families in 22 weekly meetings.
The program has been designed to be implemented in elementary schools with one version focused on second and third grades and one on fifth and sixth grades.
Skills training in the general curriculum and the small group include social skills, perspective taking, conflict resolution, and managing media violence.
The family meetings focus on parenting practices, managing development, and aiding in

reducing individual, family, and community risk factors for drug abuse, school failure, and violence.
The strongest effects have been found when the three components are implemented as an integrated intervention.
The program was developed with a multiethnic, economically disadvantaged population.
It has been subjected to extensive and careful evaluation.
The full/integrated program has shown effectiveness in reducing aggression, improving academic functioning, and lessening rates of later delinquency.
African-American and Latino students in an urban setting received instruction continuously for two school years.
Those students in grades two through six who received instruction exhibited 40% fewer antisocial and violent behaviors than comparable students not receiving the program.

Positive Adolescent Choices Training The Positive Adolescent Choices Training (PACT) program is designed to reduce the chances that at-risk adolescents will become victims or perpetrators of violence.
It addresses the problem of expressive violence, which involves loss of control among family, friends, and acquaintances, and represents the greatest threat to adolescents.
Although developed especially for sensitivity to the needs of African-American youth, the techniques used in the program are applicable to, and are frequently used with, multiethnic groups.
PACT primarily targets high-risk youth between the ages of 12 and 16 who are selected by teachers on the basis of skill deficiencies in relating to peers, behavior problems (particularly aggression), and/or a history of violence, victimization, or exposure to violence.
PACT helps adolescents learn more appropriate and socially effective ways of interacting with others, how to recognize and control angry emotions that can interfere with verbal resolutions to conflict, and how to understand and avoid violence risk.
Training takes place in small groups of no more than 10, targeting skills that include giving constructive criticism (expressing criticism or displeasure calmly), receiving negative feedback (reacting appropriately to criticism and anger of others), and negotiating (identifying problems and potential solutions and learning to compromise).
Peer Mediation Program This program is one important component of a comprehensive school-based conflict resolution program.
In this program, students in grades 6-12 are selected based on nominations by faculty, staff, and students to receive peer mediation training, preparing them to serve as neutral mediators who assist other students in resolving conflict situations.
The suggested basic peer mediation training takes approximately 12 to 15 hours over two days and includes activities related to understanding conflict, responses to conflict, origins of conflict, communications skills, the role of the mediator, and the mediation process.
In addition, subsequent biweekly meetings incorporate more advanced activities, addressing bias awareness, social and cultural diversity, advanced communication, dealing with anger, caucusing, negotiating, and group problem solving.
Program materials include a program guide, a student manual, and an optional training video.
The program also includes training workshops and activities for staff, students, parents, and communities.

Students are taught what is and is not a conflict, how to negotiate integrative agreements, and how to mediate schoolmates' conflicts.
The peer mediation program is established and the role of mediator is rotated so that every student serves as mediator an equal amount of time.
Participants learn how to infuse the conflict resolution training into different subject areas.
Students are given a copy of My Mediation Notebook containing lessons from Teaching Students to be Peacemakers.
The program consists of cooperative learning procedures such as: procedural learning, role-playing, drill and review exercises, and small group discussion.
The students are taught a negotiation procedure consisting of six

In 1994, the Mayor of Lansing identified youth violence as a major problem and called for the formation of a coalition of local government, law enforcement, public schools, prevention agencies, and representatives from the community.
The coalition examined community sur vey data that suggested increases in school discipline problems and suspensions, particularly for fighting and dropouts.
According to risk assessment data, the greatest increase among the selected indicators was early initiation and persistent problem behaviors.
In response, the Youth Violence Prevention Coalition developed a comprehensive, multi-faceted strategy to address identified problems.
At Otto Middle School, the prevention strategy included creation of The Peace Center.
Peace Center activities include peer mediation, an afterschool community service and violence prevention club, a Parent Partner program offering support resources and classes for parents throughout the school year.
In addition, the Center provides transition activities for students preparing to enter middle school and those students preparing to leave for high school.
The creation of a school culture of nonviolence has been one of the most noticeable changes at Otto.
At Otto, "Power for Living" is a required course for all eighth graders.
The curriculum used for the course provides a systematic approach to substance abuse and violence prevention education and is taught by a curriculum-certified teacher.
Eighth graders also receive special instruction in social studies classes on law education and reporting weapon carr ying and crimes to appropriate officials.
Parents play an important role in Otto's drug and violence prevention strategy.
Parent classes are held periodically on topics such as "Conflict Resolution at Home" and "Asset Building."
Each parent of an incoming student also receives a welcome bag of school materials accompanied by alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse and violence prevention information.
A Parent Resource Librar y provides parents with books, pamphlets, and videos on a myriad of topics such as discipline, communication, and conflict resolution skills.
During the first six months of the program, there was a 14% decrease in suspensions at school.
Teachers and students also repor ted feeling safer since the program began.
Almost two-thirds of teachers sur veyed in 1997 felt safer in or near their school than they did the previous year; and 83% indicated that the program made a difference in maintaining or reducing conflicts at school.
Similarly, 70% of students who had used the peer mediation program said that school climate at Otto had improved.

Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents The Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents can be used individually or in conjunction with the Teenage Health Teaching Modules, a comprehensive health curriculum.
(See Substance Use Prevention Programs, below.)
Targeted to grades 9 and 10, students explore the nature of interpersonal violence and consider ways to prevent it.
The class discusses homicide statistics and characteristics, then considers the major risk factors for violence: alcohol and other drugs, weapons, and poverty.
Students examine the causes of anger and healthy and unhealthy ways to express it.
Next, they analyze the positive and negative results of fighting and role-play what happens before, during, and after a fight, learning that the longer they allow an altercation to develop, the harder it is to stop.
Finally, they discuss strategies for preventing fights and practice nonviolent alternatives to fighting.
The sample of students in both urban and rural settings received the curriculum one to four times per week.
After the program, they exhibited a reduction in antisocial and violent behaviors of 25%.

All Stars Program The All Stars Program targets factors believed to influence high-risk behaviors in early adolescence.
It is designed to promote positive character development, while deterring the onset of negative behaviors.
The core program involves 14, 45-minute classroom sessions, with supplemental homebased components.
An eight session booster program is also available.
Students are taught that high-risk behaviors interfere with their desired lifestyle.
The interactive curriculum uses games, debates, projects, taped performances, and active discussion to promote student commitment to avoiding high-risk behaviors, teaching ideals incompatible with high-risk behavior, and increasing students' awareness about the prevalence and acceptability of high-risk behavior among their peers.
The evaluated sample of All Stars included seventh grade students in a small, multiethnic North Carolina town consisting of mainly blue collar and midlevel-professional households.
The seventh grade program youth had a prevalence rate that was 8% lower for use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and hard drugs than nonprogram youth.

Adolescents Learning Positive Health Alternative Initiative The Adolescents Learning Positive Health Alternative (ALPHA) Initiative is a peer-led substance use prevention program that enlists socially prominent, drug-free 11th and 12th grade youth to introduce communication techniques, refusal skills, assertiveness skills, and decision making skills to 7th, 8th, and 9th grade youth.
Peer leaders are selected by the student body, faculty, and school administrators and are trained in methods of classroom management and group facilitation.
A team of two or three peer leaders implements the program in junior high or middle school classrooms without teachers present.
ALPHA teams are supervised by an inschool sponsor who oversees the program.
The curriculum consists of 12 sessions administered over the course of 12 weekly sessions.
Each session has clear learning objectives, training protocol, and classroom activities and incorporates both cognitive and affective experiences.

Southeast Alaska, where Juneau is the hub city, has the highest rate of binge drinking in the state and the highest alcoholism rate per capita in the nation.
In 1996, Alaskan educators and community members, Juneau representatives among them, were designated to develop "Healthy Life Skills Standards for all Alaskan Students."
They identified an epidemic of adolescent personal and social ir responsibility as the most pressing problem involving youth.
High rates of drug and alcohol use, teen pregnancy, and suicide were evident.
Results from the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted in Juneau indicated that 79% of high school students have consumed alcohol on one or more days in their lifetime.
In addition, 26% have consumed alcohol one or more days in during the past 20-39 days.
A 1995 Juneau Community Profile Risk Assessment also indicated high levels of youth alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use.
In response, Juneau-Douglas High School has adopted the "Students for Social Responsibility and Mediation" (SSRM) program.
The program's main focus is on peer empowerment and personal and social skills delivered through peer education and mentoring, experiential learning, retreats, and a "teacher as respectful coach" approach to instruction.
The SSRM program works in close cooperation with other prevention players, among them the Juneau-Douglas High School Student Assistance Program, the Police Officer in the Schools Program, the Mayor's Task Force on Youth, a local Inter-Agency team, the Juneau Career Center, the Teen Health Center, the Teen Court, and 11 other community agencies.
The overall goal of the SSRM program in the Juneau School District is to create dynamic school-based communities that challenge and support each student to demonstrate responsible behavior, both personally and socially.
Students are taught empowerment through assuming real life roles--roles of responsibility, caring, and authority.
As a result of these efforts, Juneau-Douglas has documented a significant decrease in student violence as well as an overall reduction in drug use.
Not only have suspensions decreased from 1997 to 1998, but there has also been a shift in the reasons for suspension.
Previously, the main reason cited for male suspension was possession of controlled substances.
In 1998, the primary reason for suspension was failure to serve detention.
Suspensions for female students changed similarly, with the main reason for suspension being assault in 1997.
In 1998, the primar y reason for suspension was failure to serve detention.

Growing Healthy Growing Healthy, a comprehensive, school health education curriculum for kindergarten through grade six, is designed to promote healthy behaviors through knowledge and skills building.
The program is built on the premise that children who understand how their bodies work, how certain behaviors impact health, and who are adequately equipped with specific decision making skills will be able to resist social pressures to engage in risk behaviors such as using alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.
Growing Healthy provides 50 hours of classroom instruction in a series of approximately 50 sequential lessons at each grade level.
Ten health content areas are addressed yearly and include growth and development, mental and emotional health, personal health, family life and health, nutrition, disease prevention and control, safety and first aid, consumer health, substance use and abuse, and community and environmental health management.
Materials are grade specific and include curriculum guides, peripheral materials (e.g., books, videos, models, games, and software), teacher materials (e.g., charts, posters, activity cards), and student handouts.
Complete implementation is necessary, as the curriculum builds upon previously learned knowledge and skills.
The evaluated sample included suburban students in grades four through six.
The fifth and sixth grade program youth had a prevalence rate that was 15% lower for use of alcohol and tobacco than nonprogram youth.

All student activities are aligned to one or more of the National Health Education Standards and the New Standards Primary Literacy Standards for the English Language Arts.
The program also includes performance assessments, workshops, brochures, and letters for families.
KYB can easily be integrated into the following programs in typical schools: science, math, social studies, language arts, and physical education.
In the majority of schools, KYB is taught by the classroom generalist.
It is recommended that KYB curriculum be preceded by a teacher training session.
The KYB teacher training is individually tailored to meet the specific needs of the school, district, and community.
The curriculum is multiethnic and has been translated into seven languages.
To complete the core lessons of the curriculum, approximately 35 hours of classroom instruction are required per year.
The program was evaluated for a sample of African-American and White students in an urban setting.
The fifth and sixth grade program youth had a prevalence rate for tobacco that was 23 percent lower than non program youth.

Preventive Alcohol Education Program To increase skills in resisting the persuasive efforts of their peers, youth view a film on the physiological effects of alcohol and the types of arguments people use to convince others that they can drink and drive safely.
Question and answer sessions follow with in-class role-plays.
Attempting to "inoculate" the students against driving drunk, the roleplays use scripts that focus on situations involving alcohol and provide familiarity with pro-drinking-and-driving arguments that encourage peers to engage in these risky behaviors.
The role-plays are followed by immediate feedback.
Finally, a slide show summarizes the knowledge component and argument portions of the previous sessions.
Ninth graders receive this program for two to three hours per week for five weeks.
The self-reports of the program youth compared to the nonprogram youth show a prevalence rate that was 16% lower for frequency of drinking alcohol in the last 30 days.
Importantly, program youth also report an impressive 22% reduction in actual refusals to drive with friends who had been drinking.

schools, and communities.
The curriculum combines classroom-based interventions with parent, peer, and community wide interventions to reduce underage drinking.
Parental involvement is an essential feature of the program, with the greatest emphasis occurring in the first two years.
The parent component focuses on building parent/child relationships and promoting communication on the subject of alcohol use.
The program includes both demand and supply reduction strategies at all levels of the intervention.
The curriculum is available for grades six through eight.
"Slick Tracy" is the grade six intervention and is conducted primarily with parents and adolescents in their homes.
This portion of the curriculum presents facts on underage drinking and health and discusses parental communication with teens about drinking, parents as role models, developing family guidelines against underage drinking, peer pressures and resistance strategies, and the consequences of underage drinking.
The seventh-grade program, "Amazing Alternatives!," maintains active parent components but works primarily with students in the classroom.
This school-based intervention aims to develop skills for dealing with peers and to build positive peer group influences.
"PowerLines," the eighth grade classroom intervention, emphasizes influences beyond peers and families and empowers students to create healthy changes in their broader communities to discourage underage drinking.
The program was implemented in a rural setting.
Students received instruction four hours per month for two to three months each of the three years.
The seventh and eighth grade program youth had a prevalence rate that was 10% lower for use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana than the nonprogram youth.

Project STAR Project STAR, also known as Project I-STAR or the Midwestern Prevention Project (MPP), is a comprehensive, community-based drug abuse prevention program that bridges the transition from early adolescence to middle through later adolescence.
Since early adolescence is the first risk period for gateway drug use (i.e., alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), programming is initiated with whole populations of middle school (sixth or seventh grade) students.
This multicomponent, comprehensive school-based program is available on a limited basis to communities that have collectively determined a need for the program and that have formed a community collaborative linked to the school, parents, business, civic leaders, local government or law enforcement, and the media.
Generally the community will have conducted a needs assessment of both the school and the community prior to pursuing adoption of Project STAR.
Seventh and eighth grade youth who participated in Project STAR had a prevalence rate that was 9% lower for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use compared to youth who did not participate.
Effects on gateway drugs were maintained through high school.
Toward the end of high school and into young adulthood, effects emerged on other drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamines, and LSD.

Teenage Health Teaching Modules The Teenage Health Teaching Modules (THTM), for students in grades 6-12, is a comprehensive health program that targets the secondary grades.
The curriculum contains materials on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and emphasizes resistance, personal, and social skills taught through cooperative and small group learning.
Many homework assignments involve families, and optional community service projects are presented.
The curriculum is published by the Education Development Center.
The program consists of a series of modules, each of which includes a teacher's guide with a detailed framework for conducting classroom activities.
Each module contains 6-15 class sessions, 45 minutes long.
Certain essential health skills are highlighted in each module including risk assessment, self-assessment, communication, decision making, goal setting, health advocacy, and healthy self-management.
The underlying philosophy of THTM is that everything we do or do not do is a statement of who we are; we express ourselves, our values, and our beliefs through behavior.
The program provides opportunities for students to recognize that many factors affect health and well-being.
Students from a mix of ethnic and racial groups received instruction seven hours per month for four months.
The 7th through 12th grade program youth had a prevalence rate that was 7% lower for the use of alcohol, tobacco, and hard drugs than nonprogram youth.

Gonzalo Garza Independence High School is a school of choice that is available to high school aged students throughout Austin who wish to earn their high school diploma.
It was designed to remove the traditional barriers of a typical high school, utilizing best practices and the most current research.
Garza exemplifies excellence and equity for all its students through an individualized, challenging, and accelerated education that reengages young people in learning and restores confidence in their talents and abilities.
Above all, Garza strives for a sense of community, collaboration, caring, and empowerment in a drug-free, safe environment.
A small school of 300 students, Garza is designed to be an alternative to the traditional high school for students who may not have had successful educational experiences in the past.
Students apply to Garza and are admitted based on their desire to succeed.
Four teen percent of students at Garza are recovered dropouts who were not in school immediately prior to enrolling at Garza.
The remaining students were previously enrolled in one of the ten other Austin high schools.
Garza's emphasis on individualizing instruction in an atmosphere of trust and respect has met with success.
In its first 23 weeks of operation, 49 students met graduation requirements.
During the 1998-99 school year, 119 students met graduation requirements, more than doubling the number of students from the previous semester.
Students benefit from an innovative interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates academic content with career development and project-based learning, allowing students to develop high-level skills in a real-world context.
Standards and expectations are high for all students as they master the curriculum and meet all local and state graduation requirements.
Indeed, many students graduate with honors in an advanced plan while others are currently dual-enrolled in college courses at Austin Community College.
Further, students learn the value of community and civic responsibility by completing community service projects in which they give at least 20 hours of service.
Garza's diverse ethnic and socio-economic population, however, is not immune to the effects of violence and drugs.
In February 1999, a student was lost to a drug overdose after a long battle in and out of rehabilitation.
And, just days before the school shootings in Colorado, two students died in particularly sad circumstances, one from suicide, the other murdered.
However, while Garza students encounter violence in a ver y real and frightening way outside of school, they have yet to experience it in school.
Since its opening in January 1998, Garza has not seen a single act of violence, any weapons, or incidents of graffiti.

Groups are rotated through the school schedule so that no student misses the same class more than once every eight weeks.
Most of the youth voluntarily choose to work with the SAP counselors.
Some are required to participate in the counseling because they have violated school policy The counselors hold graduate degrees and have at least two years of experience.
This program is one of the most promising approaches for high school youth (grades 9-12).

Fast Track Fast Track is a long-term program that targets chronic and severe conduct problems of children through interventions with the school, home, and individual student.
The program contains both universal and selective levels of intervention.
The universal intervention is a primary prevention strategy directed at all first- through fifth-grade children to strengthen the skills needed for successful adaptation to school and to prevent the emergence of school adjustment difficulties.
The goal of the universal intervention is to reduce the disruptiveness of the classroom and improve its manageability by the teacher.
These changes reduce the level of stimulation for inappropriate behavior on the part of the high risk children who receive the selective intervention.
Classroom teachers are trained by Fast Track staff in the use of the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum.
The high-risk children are identified in kindergarten by their disruptive behavior at school and at home.
They receive a program of services that extends from first grade through the end of middle school.
It is most intensive in first grade, consisting of parent and child skill building groups, home visits with families, a peer relations component at school, reading tutoring, and school-based case management.
The frequency of groups is reduced in successive grades but involves a more intense intervention again at the transition into middle school, where parenting and youth support services continue along with mentoring and support for identity and vocational development.
Problem Behavior Prevention Programs
Behavioral Monitoring and Reinforcement Program The program targets adolescents who demonstrate characteristics that have been associated with delinquency and substance abuse, including: low motivation for school, disregard for rules, and feelings of alienation from their parents.
Risk factors include academic failure, early behavior problems, alienation from family, and low level of commitment to school.
The intervention involves four components: weekly report cards, discussion of report cards, parental contact, and booster sessions in later years.
Program staff compile a weekly report card on the basis of teacher interviews regarding behavior in the classroom (i.e., bringing materials to class, tardiness, and completion of work.)
Students meet with program staff in small group sessions to discuss the report cards.
Positive reports elicit praise and approval from staff, while negative reports elicit discussions of how the student can improve their behavior.
Parents are kept informed of their children's progress through phone calls, letters, and home visits.
After two years of the intervention, students attend booster sessions given every two weeks that follow the same format.

On April 24, 1994, Margaret Lear y Elementary School was the site of a school shooting.
The shooter, a ten-yearold student, killed another student as the children lined up to enter the school for the day.
The tragedy ser ved as a wake-up call, not only to Butte, but to all Montana schools, and propelled the school community into action.
A site-based School Safety Team played a critical role in helping the school heal and return to teaching and learning activities.
The Safety Team instituted a comprehensive plan designed to support the school community that includes conflict resolution and after-school programs, mentorships, student assistance teams, school security checks, and crime victim assistance programs.
The school also developed a school-wide disaster prevention, intervention, and response plan.
Inter vention strategies utilized in the plan include: active collaboration among community/government agencies, after-school daycare, structured recreation, safe school team building, positive self-esteem building, training on early warning signs of violence, and development of classroom management and crisis planning procedures.
All School Safety Team members and classroom teachers are trained in student behavior modification and help develop action plans for students identified as at-risk by parents, teachers, or other students.
This team takes responsibility for ever y aspect of the student's needs by developing workable solutions for both academic and emotional issues.
Safety Team members also participate in conflict resolution training and in a Playground Facilitator program.
The school counselor is trained in the Second Step curriculum and has trained other district counselors in teaching violence prevention and response to post-traumatic stress.
The Safety Team also helps establish community partnerships and mentoring programs.
The Safety Team is currently creating a Parent Resource Center for parenting classes and adult educational programs.
Since the establishment of the School Safety Team, Margaret Leary Elementar y School has begun to heal its wounds.
The multiple, integrated prevention activities have resulted in a school environment that is cohesive, and includes community participation.

The program was evaluated for over 900 high-risk youth from four different U.S. communities, who received the program during their first, second, and third grade years.
Evaluators found that 11% fewer students in the program were diagnosed with an Individual Education Plan (students showing a need for special education attention), than students not participating in the program.

Gang Resistance Education and Training Program The Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.)
Program is a gang and violence prevention program for grades three through eight with a nine-lesson core curriculum.
It is designed to help children set goals for themselves, resist pressures, learn how to resolve conflict without violence, and understand how gangs and youth violence impact the quality of their lives.
G.R.E.A.T. students discover for themselves the ramifications of gang and youth violence through structured exercises and interactive approaches to learning.
The program brings together the combined efforts of law enforcement, schools, and the community to make a difference in the lives of children by providing them with the necessary skills and information to say "no" to gangs and acts of random violence.
The G.R.E.A.T. curriculum is taught by trained, certified, uniformed police officers/special agents to elementary, junior high, and middle school children.
The classroom sessions include material on laws, crime, victims, gangs, and drug use.
Both the police officer/special agent and the teacher work together to reduce gang involvement in the school and the community.

Despite high rates of drug use by high school students in surrounding areas, Merrill Road Elementar y School has successfully created a school environment with zero tolerance for drug use and violence.
Merrill Road Elementar y School has implemented a "NO USE/NON-VIOLENT" philosophy through the school's Zeroing in on Prevention (ZIP) program.
The ZIP team, comprised of faculty, staff, parents and community members, is responsible for developing the program's objectives and annual plan and super vises implementation.
Objectives are established for each of the five essential program components: prevention, intervention, support groups, parent/community invol-vement, and evaluation.
Because Merrill's goal is to maintain "zero" incidents, and because its absence rates were increasing, the ZIP Team has added truancy as a program goal.
Merrill's comprehensive intervention and prevention program includes activities designed to increase student resiliency and positive behavior.
All students are taught non-violence and conflict resolution skills, using the Peace Foundation curri-culum, which incorporates values of tolerance and respect for differences.
Health education classes, incorporating alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use prevention skills, are taught and reinforced at every grade level.
Other prevention efforts include: mentoring, peer mediation, after-school programs, tutoring, and parenting education.
Community resources are also made available and are utilized by staff and administration.
The Terr y Parker Full Service Center links the schools to youth development, family and child guidance ser vices, health and social services, juvenile justice, family literacy, case management, and family welfare services.
Since Merrill Elementar y's intensive focus on truancy prevention began, the number of students absent 21 or more days decreased from 14 students during the 199798 school year, to one student during the 1998-99 school year.
The total number of crime incidents has also decreased from three in 1996-97, to zero in 1998-99.

In 1992, Port Chester Middle School began collecting and organizing data on all referrals, failures, suspensions, weapon possessions, drug use attitudes, and community demographics.
Using data-driven policy-making, they restructured school policies and programs to reflect their commitment to meeting the needs of each student, improving student resiliency skills, addressing student antisocial behavior, and responding to the needs of at-risk students.
In order to increase student resiliency, the school adopted a comprehensive strategy that included: providing a safe and secure environment; focusing on each student's uniqueness through academic success and school culture; nurturing a sense of competency in students' ability to make positive decisions; and providing adult role models.
Port Chester's comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies consist of a "school within a school" support system, peer mediation and student assistance programs, before- and after-school violence prevention activities, and three different mentoring programs.
Once students are identified as at-risk or potentially at-risk, particular attention is placed on their needs through the Students Toward Education Progress (STEP) Program, as well as through community mentoring, social services, and counseling for students and their families.
To help address each student's individual needs, students are placed in small "school within a school" settings with enormous flexibility and no more than 25 students.
Such efforts have resulted in an improvement in academic performance and school culture, as well as a decrease in suspensions and discipline problems.
From 1995 to 1998, the number of suspensions dropped from 416 to 128, and discipline referrals dropped from over 1,000 to less than 300.

Results from a 1989 drug use survey of high school students at Shepherd Hill Regional High School revealed that 77% of students were involved with alcohol, 33% with marijuana, 43% with tobacco, and 19% with other drugs.
Similarly, junior high school students sur veyed revealed that 55% used alcohol, 11% used marijuana, 35% used tobacco products, and 17% used other drugs.
A follow-up study in 1992-93 indicated a substantial decrease in student-repor ted substance abuse.
However, while students were choosing to have little or no involvement with illegal substances, there were enough students still using drugs and alcohol to warrant concern.
In response to the sur vey results, Shepherd Hill established a set of objectives to be met by the year 2000.
The school's objectives included: creating an orderly and safe environment for students, reducing substance abuse, and improving parental knowledge of student drug use.
The school developed a comprehensive schoolwide program to help address the needs of all students and help develop strong resiliency skills.
The program includes a grade 1-12 health instruction component that works in cooperation with other academic disciplines, school health and counseling ser vices, and community based services.
Each of these facets works individually and cooperatively to provide students with a safe and orderly learning environment.
School counselors and psychologists also are available to provide student counseling, individual assessments, and referrals to appropriate ser vices both within and outside of the school.
Family ser vices and programs are also in place to promote social and emotional growth.
A parent support group, led by the school psychologist, meets regularly to discuss adolescent issues.
In addition to extensive student and family suppor t services, Shepherd Hill Regional High School provides students with academic assistance through tutoring, academic/behavioral tracking, and academic and wellness counseling.
Core curriculum instructors meet after school on a regular basis to assist students in developing organization skills and completing homework.
Since the implementation of these academic programs, the school has experienced a 65% improvement in core subject grades.
Since implementing the program in 1989 and administering annual student drug use surveys in 1992, Shepherd Hill has seen decreases in the number of students using tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana.
The percent of seventh and eighth grade students reporting ever having used cigarrettes decreased from 51% in 1992-93 to 44% in 1996-97.
In addition, the percent of students in grades nine and ten reported a decrease in alcohol use, from 19% in 1992-93 to less than 6% in 1997-98.

Blue p ri nts for V io lenc e P revention
www.Colorado.EDU/cspv/blueprints The Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, with funding from the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (and later from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency), initiated a project to identify ten violence prevention programs that met a very high scientific standard of program effectiveness, programs that could provide an initial nucleus for a national violence prevention initiative.
Blueprints were designed to be very practical descriptions of effective programs to allow States, communities, and individual agencies to: (1) determine the appropriateness of this intervention for their State or community; (2) provide a realistic cost estimate for this intervention; (3) provide an assessment of the organizational capacity needed to ensure its successful start-up and operation over time; and (4) give some indication of the potential barriers and obstacles that might be encountered when attempting to implement this type of intervention.

www.safetyzone.org The National Resource Center for Safe Schools works with schools, communities, state and local education agencies, and other concerned individuals and agencies to create safe learning environments and prevent school violence.
Creating a safe school requires the larger school community to embrace a variety of safety strategies, as no one measure, in itself, will offer a complete solution.
Rather, schools, families, communities, students, businesses, law enforcement agencies, and the media must work together to build and model an environment conducive to learning, to prevent, identify and respond to risks to school safety, and to intervene immediately and responsibly should incidents of violence occur.
Safe school strategies range from establishing youth courts and mentoring programs to incorporating conflict resolution education into school programming to enhancing building safety, hiring school resource officers, establishing or expanding before and after-school programming and adopting policies and procedures that are consistent, clear, and developed collaboratively by the school community.
The National Resource Center for Safe Schools is operated by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory and was established with funding from the U.S. Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

The Institute's goal is to determine what works and what can be replicated to reduce violence in America's schools and their immediate communities.
The Institute works with a consortium of seven universities whose key staff have expertise in adolescent violence, criminology, law enforcement, substance abuse, juvenile justice, gangs, public health, education, behavior disorders, social skills development and prevention programs.
The George Washington University develops and tests violence prevention strategies in collaboration with the following universities: Florida State University, Morehouse School of Medicine, Syracuse University, Eastern Kentucky University, University of Oregon, and University of WisconsinMilwaukee.

It has been designed to explore the causes of these behaviors, with an emphasis on the influence of social context.
Add Health postulates that families, friends, schools, and communities play roles in the lives of adolescents that may encourage healthy choices of activities or may lead to unhealthy, selfdestructive behaviors.

Although Putnam County has the lowest crime rate in New York State, the district's needs assessment indicated that student drug and alcohol use had increased in grades 68, with use primarily occurring on the weekends in the children's homes or homes of their friends.
With the assistance of a community/school Health Advisory Council, a set of program priorities and objectives were developed to respond quickly to this disturbing trend.
Putnam Valley Middle School has drawn upon evidence indicating that strong family/school learning and child development partnerships can reduce problem behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use.
Putnam's comprehensive social competence and health education approach is designed to promote student self-worth, positive health behaviors, social skill, and positive relationships, motivation to behave responsibly, and skills for work.
The cultivation of these values and behaviors is present in every aspect of school life--including core curriculum and counseling sessions.
For example, ever y day begins with lessons in conflict resolution, domestic violence, and harassment, with a group of 12-14 students across grade levels.
Peer mediation is also available at all grade levels.
Parental involvement is an integral part of the planning and services available to students at Putnam Valley.
Parents are involved in shared decision making on the School Improvement Team and the Steering Committee.
More important, parents serve an essential function as resource advisors, and planners on the Health Advisor y Council, which sponsors numerous parent and parent/child evening activities throughout the year.
Through the Parent Alert and Family Wellness, and "Straight Talk" programs, Putnam has created opportunities for families to network and learn more about creating healthy relationships and substance abuse prevention.
Since the implementation of these programs, parental involvement has increased substantially.
Since 1996, participation in the Parent Alert program has increased from 20 parents to approximately 150 parents, teachers, and students.
Evaluation data collected since implementing the comprehensive prevention program indicate that the number of principal referrals have decreased substantially, from 103 in the 1996-97 school year to 61 in 1997-98.
The number of incidents reported to police also decreased from three incidents in 1996-97 to zero incidents in the last two years.
According to clinical staff, the number of reports about drug and alcohol use and incidents in school have also decreased since 1993, with zero alcohol or drug incidents since 1996.

develop unique insights that promote social responsibility, reaffirm the fundamental values of right and wrong, and inspire a commitment to good citizenship.
LRE programs which have been demonstrated to be effective, can be integrated into existing courses (e.g., government, civics, and history), offered as electives (e.g., high school practical law course), used as the focus of a special event (e.g., mock trial competition, mock congressional hearings, mock mediations, etc.), and/or used as components of an after-school program.
Specialized LRE programs have been developed and tested with the highest at-risk groups of youth including gang members, teen parents, and youth already in the juvenile justice system.
LRE programs exist at the local (school), statewide, and national level.
These programs recognize the need for partnerships with law enforcement, the bar, the bench, and others.
