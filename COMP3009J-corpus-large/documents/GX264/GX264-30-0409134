IDENTITY THEFT VICTIM KIT Dear Illinois Consumer: When someone uses your personal information to obtain identification, credit or even a mortgage, you may be a victim of identity theft.
This crime can be devastating to a victim's checkbook, credit rating and peace of mind.
It also costs businesses millions of dollars each year.
Unfortunately, identity theft is increasing at an alarming rate.
Illinois ranked fifth among states in the number of identity theft complaints reported in 2002 to the Consumer Sentinel, a database developed and maintained by the Federal Trade Commission.
And according to recently released data, Illinoisans made 7,474 identity theft reports to the FTC in 2002, up from 3,784 reports in 2001 Â­ a more than 97 percent increase in reports.
If you believe you have been a victim of identity theft, it is critical that you act quickly to repair the damage.
The process is not complicated, but can be confusing when you don't know where to start.
You may have many questions, including: Will I be responsible for the debts incurred in my name by the thieves? How do I reclaim my good credit? How can I prevent this from happening in the future? My office has created this Identity Theft Victim Kit Â­ based on models by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other states Â­ to help you navigate the process.
It provides step- by-step instructions on what you should do if you are a victim of identity theft.
The kit also includes an Identity Theft Affidavit that will help you report information.
I hope that this information is helpful to you.
In addition, please do not hesitate to call my Consumer Protection Division at 800-386-5438; TTY 800-964-3013 (Chicago) or 800-243-0618; TTY 877-844-5461 (Springfield).
I also encourage you to report your claim of identity theft to the FTC by calling (877) ID THEFT or (877) 438-4338.
Very truly yours,
Lisa Madigan Illinois Attorney General
