THE RIGHTS STUff PUBLISHED QUARTERLY BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS MAY - JULY 2002 Pushed Aside When the economy goes down, age discrimination claims go up.
But is cutting higher-paid, older workers unlawful? Plus Immigrants with disabilities A confluence of challenges News Shorts Duluth names Meg Bye as top human rights enforcement officer The City of Duluth has named Meg Bye, a longtime human rights activist and former Duluth city council member, as the city's Human Rights Compliance Officer and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer.
Bye will work with the Duluth Human Rights Commission to ensure compliance with the city's recently enacted human rights ordinance.
Duluth is the third Minnesota city, in addition to Minneapolis and St. Paul, to obtain authority from the state legislature to investigate charges of discrimination and determine whether there is probable cause to believe its human rights ordinance has been violated.
"I have been active and involved in human rights Meg Bye since the beginning of my public career," commented Bye.
"This is an opportunity "This is an to actually put into place opportunity to and get paid for doing what I have been doing all my actually put into place and get paid life."
As the city's first for doing what I compliance officer, Bye faces have been doing the challenge of setting up all my life."
an investigative process "from scratch," she noted.
"We likely are going to be using as much of the state's process as possible so that we can share information back and forth."
In her role as EEO officer, Bye will help develop a new affirmative action plan for city government.
"The city's affirmative action plan is way out of date," she said.
"We have a new census.
And the city needs to develop some in-house statistics to find out more than our gut-level feeling that there is a lot to be done to increase the diversity within city hall."
Community education also is one of Bye's responsibilities, an area in which she anticipates the active involvement of the Duluth Human Rights 2 Commission in "recognizing and celebrating the diversity that we do have in the city of Duluth, and making that a positive thing in everybody's mind."
Bill Jackson, president of the Duluth Human Rights Commission, praised the selection of Bye.
"She knows the workings of city government, and she also is a trained mediator," commented Jackson.
"She also is a strong woman who stands up for what she believes in.
She doesn't bend with the wind."

Department of Human Rights awarded grant to produce CD-ROM The Department of Human Rights has received a $2,000 grant from ADA Minnesota to help fund the development of a CD-ROM on disability issues, to be produced in cooperation with the Minnesota State Council on Disability.
The CD-ROM will complement a workbook the council is producing for a July 26 ADA Minnesota Workshop based on the theme, "Know Your Rights and Responsibilities."
Material from the workbook will be showcased on the CD-ROM, along with feature articles on disability that have appeared in The Rights Stuff, and additional information on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Minnesota Human Rights Act.
Case histories of people with disabilities who have brought charges under the Human Rights Act and a list of community resources will round out the content.
To ensure accessibility, all material will be available in several different formats on the same CDROM, including a web browser format (HTML), text, and large text.
For those who may not have access to a computer, the CD-ROM will also include some audio material, playable on most CD players.
The disc will be produced during the summer and distributed in September, in cooperation with the Minnesota League of Human Rights Commissions.
Commissioner's Corner Minnesota, along with almost every other state and the District of Columbia, is grappling with a budget shortfall caused by an economic recession in the wake of September 11.
The Minnesota constitution prohibits the state from running a deficit at the end of a fiscal biennium.
Thus the legislature continues to debate what combination of spending cuts and/or taxes will be implemented to balance the budget.
But part of the solution will be reductions in state agency budgets, including that of the Human Rights Department.
In these tough economic times, we are more grateful than ever for the network of local human rights commissions throughout the state.
Some commissions provide mediation of human rights disputes in their communities.
Others have expressed interest in providing intake services, channeling charges to this department.
To this end, the League of Minnesota Human Rights Commissions has scheduled two training sessions this spring, one in Winona (April 28) and one in Hibbing ( June 23).
At these sessions, department staff will explain the intake process and provide forms.
There are many other ways local commissions can work more closely with the department.
For example, a commission could recruit a list of attorneys willing to represent charging parties in department mediations.
Or a local commission could organize a speaking opportunity for me or another department staff member.
Last year, the Owatonna commission invited us to speak about housing discrimination to a group of about 50 local realtors.
And I will be speaking to the Rochester Chamber of Commerce on June 5 at the request of the Olmsted County commission.
Economic hard times come and go; we will certainly recover from the current slowdown.
In the meantime, we are seeking to develop even more partnerships with local human rights commissions.
They can help us reach out to cities and towns throughout our state.
They can be our eyes and ears, ensuring that our vision of a state free from discrimination is not clouded by the current fiscal climate.

Commissioner Janeen Rosas testified on April 25 at the United States Commission on Civil Rights' hearing on the news media's coverage of minority communities, held in Minneapolis.
3 It's an age-old phenomenon: the economy crashes, older workers get laid off, and claims of discrimination soar.
A look at what's happening, what's legal, and what isn't Age Discrimination W hen the economy takes a dive, cases of alleged age discrimination predictably rise, as older workers find themselves among those bearing the brunt of layoffs and other reductions in force aimed at slashing salaries.
The current economic downturn is proving to be no exception: the number of charges of age discrimination filed with the Department of Human Rights in 2001 jumped 17 percent over 2000.
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which also investigates age discrimination and often shares jurisdiction with the department, has seen a nine percent increase in fiscal year 2001.
Things could be worse, knows Department of Human Rights supervisor Elaine Hanson, and if the economy gets worse, they still might be.
4 Hanson, a 20-year department veteran, remembers the recession of the 80s, when age bias charges skyrocketed from their typical 12 percent of the department's caseload to 37 percent, surpassing the other big three--race, sex and disability.
The effects of bad economic times don't show up in the department's statistics immediately: employers typically cut staff first through attrition.
Even when the ax falls and mass layoffs make the front page, those who believe they were let go because of age often wait a while before filing a charge.
(They must file within one year after the discrimination took place under the Human Rights Act; within 300 days if they choose to file with the EEOC.)
"If the economic downturn continues, we'll see cases of age discrimination going zing again," Hanson says.
What is age discrimination? Age discrimination essentially is treating someone less favorably than others because of their age.
In employment, such differential treatment might include refusal to hire, termination, lower pay, reduced benefits, or fewer opportunities for promotion or training, if the reason for these disparities is age.
Both the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA) and the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) make such activities illegal, but state law is in some ways broader.
The MHRA also outlaws age discrimination in education (for individuals above age 25), while the ADEA covers only employment.
The federal law protects only those over 40 and under 70, who work for employers with 20 or more employees; the MHRA covers all workers over the age of majority.
The MHRA also allows more time to file a charge (a year after the discrimination happened vs. the ADEA's 300 days).
The law may seem clear enough.
But in practice, when tough economic times coincide with the layoffs of thousands of older workers, whether the reason in any individual case was age discrimination can be difficult to determine.
Suppose, for example, that a company legitimately needs to slash its payroll, and in doing so, lays off a disproportionate share of older workers.
They were pink-slipped not because they were a certain age, the company argues, but because they were earning the highest salaries.
Can a worker bring a successful age discrimination lawsuit based on the "disparate impact" on older workers of such downsizing? Currently, these disparate impact claims are allowed under the ADEA in some federal circuits such as the 8th circuit, which includes Minnesota, but not in certain others, including the 3rd, 6th, 7th and 10th circuits.
Unlike the ADEA, the MHRA expressly recognizes disparate impact claims (Section 363.03, subd. 11) and stipulates what a complaining party and an employer must prove to prevail.
Someone bringing a charge must isolate and identify the specific employment practice that is responsible for a statistically significant adverse impact on a class of persons protected by the Human Rights Act.
To defend against such a claim, an employer must show that this practice is manifestly related to the job or that it significantly furthers an important business purpose.
If the employer can do that, the charging party still can prevail by showing that another, "comparably effective practice" would have had significantly less adverse impact.
Mandatory retirement how old is too old? A mandatory retirement age is illegal under the state Human Rights Act, with certain notable exceptions.
One exception cited in the MHRA is another Minnesota age discrimination law, Minn.
Stat.
Section 181.81.
That law prohibits age discrimination by private employers, but permits companies to enforce mandatory retirement at age 70, or 65 for certain executives or those in a "high policy-making position," if certain requirements are met.
One key requirement: there must be a published mandatory retirement policy.
There are other exceptions to age discrimination laws, carved out by other statutes, regulations and court cases.
For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is allowed to specify an earlier retirement age (currently 60) for airline pilots.
Law enforcement agencies also are given more leeway to set maximum hiring and mandatory retirement ages.
State Supreme Court justices who have served for at least one term and who have arrived at the age of 70 must retire (Section 490.025, subd. 1).
Similarly, District Court judges who have served for not less than 15 years and who have arrived at the age of 70 must retire (Section 490.101, subd. 1).
The exceptions that permit airlines and law enforcement agencies to set mandatory retirement ages don't allow them to practice other forms of discrimination against those who may be approaching the end of their careers.
"We've brought a number of lawsuits against airlines who refused to hire older pilots," comments Laurie Vasichek, a senior trial attorney for the EEOC.
The airlines apparently reasoned that since 60 was the mandatory retirment age, hiring and training pilots over 40 who would not be around as AGE DISCRIMINATION continued on page 6 5 "You can't refuse to pay for more training if it's being offered to other employees.

supervisor Lucy Johnson-Gaines.
The fact that 6 Case Studies Three cases of alleged age discrimination It wasn't just her boss's comments that were making Rooney's job increasingly unbearable.
If she made a mistake when ordering parts, she was reprimanded, while male coworkers who were guilty of the same infractions were not.
Although it was against company policy to stop for breaks or lunch when making deliveries to Minneapolis--a regular part of Rooney's job--male drivers were permitted to take such breaks.
One day when it had started to rain, Rooney asked her boss if she could leave the plant for a minute to roll up her car windows.
Her request was denied, even as male coworkers were dashing to their vehicles.
For nine months Rooney persevered at the plant, despite being the only employee who did not receive a customary, progressive raise.
Then one day in January 1999, she was given the bad news: sales were down, the company said, and as a result she was being laid off.
She was, she soon discovered, the only employee being laid off, while several men with less seniority were being retained.
Rooney filed a charge of discrimination based on age and sex with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.
The department found substantial evidence to support her allegations; witnesses corroborated the ageist and sexuallydemeaning language, as well as the double standard that seemed to apply to her mistakes vs. those of her male counterparts.
The department found probable cause to believe the company had violated the Human Rights Act.
Her boss's repeated references to "old bags" and similar comments had created a hostile work environment for Rooney based on her age and her sex, the department concluded.
In a settlement negotiated by the department in December 1999, the company agreed to pay Rooney $15,750.
It admitted no wrongdoing.
CASE STUDIES continued on page 8 7 CASE 1 AGE AND SEX She was "too old" and "women are good for only one thing," her supervisor allegedly said.
As the only female employee at a factory in a small town in central Minnesota, Mavis Rooney had two strikes against her in the view of the plant manager: her age and her sex.
Her manager, Mr. Simmons, allegedly referred to the 54-year-old woman as "an old bag" on a daily basis, to her face and in conversations with other workers.
He also described her as a "dumb old bitch," and in a conversation with another male employee, explained his belief that "women are only good for one thing--sex.
Anything more than that just costs me money.
And there's not going to be any of that with that old____(charging party)," he allegedly said.
His conversations were also laced with vulgar slang related to sexual acts and female anatomy, language which made Rooney uncomfortable.
But when she complained to the company's president about Simmons' terminology, no action was taken.
The incidents described in these case studies are based upon complaints filed with the Depar tment of Human Rights.
In each case the depar tment found probable cause to believe that there had been a violation of the state Human Rights Act.
We have chosen not to include the real names of the charging par ties or the respondents.

CASE STUDIES ontinued from page 7 CASE 2 "YOU DON'T FIT IN."
"You can't teach an old dog new tricks," his supervisor allegedly said.
Nate Lieberman, 50, worked for a high tech Twin Cities firm whose executives were in their 30s, and most employees with his job title, seminar specialist, were in their 20s.
Throughout his seven months of employment in 1999, he frequently was criticized by the company's district manger, Ms. Horton.
"You don't fit in," she allegedly told him, questioning his computer skills and his communication abilities.
Although by the company's own quantifiable measures of performance, Lieberman's work was average or above, he repeatedly was passed over for promotion.
Others were promoted in the company's typical informal style: "Here's your extra thousand bucks," a manager would announce at a meeting of all the seminar specialists.
Those promoted had comparable or lesser skills, according to other employees interviewed by the Department of Human Rights.
But they were half Lieberman's age.
One day in October 1999, Lieberman was summoned to a meeting with Horton and another company executive.
The district manager asked if he had decided to look for a new job.
He replied that he had not, but that he intended to file a charge of age discrimination.
Eight days later, Lieberman was fired.
After Lieberman filed his charge of age discrimination, an investigation by the Department of Human Rights substantiated his claim that he was not promoted and eventually fired because of age.
His computer skills, which the company cited as a reason for his termination, were comparable to those of other seminar specialists, witnesses said.
Like them, he had struggled with the company's new database.
But he sometimes could solve the problems it presented on his own, and then share the solution with others-- despite being the last to receive database training.
("You can't teach an old dog new tricks," Ms. Horton had allegedly said.)
One witness had been asked by the company to document Lieberman's computer performance prior to his termination.
She had refused to do so, she said, because she couldn't understand why he was being subjected to greater scrutiny than the other employees.
The Department of Human Rights found probable cause to believe that the high tech firm was 8 guilty of violating the Human Rights Act by firing Lieberman because of his age, and because he had raised the issue of age discrimination.
After the finding, Lieberman elected to hire his own attorney and pursue a private lawsuit against the company.
CASE 3 MIXED MOTIVES Sales were down.
But that wasn't the only reason he was replaced by a man 20 years younger.
Bob Johnson, 57, had worked in the service department of Wilkerson Motors for more than 30 years.
"You've been around here longer than dirt," the owner joked with him repeatedly, once suggesting that the employee should be paying him for the privilege of working there.
Your house and your cars must be paid off by now, the owner told him.
When are you going to retire? Would you consider a buy-out? Johnson told the owner he wasn't interested in a buy-out, and planned to work until he was 62.
He knew that soon he'd be eligible for increased pension benefits.
The owner knew that too, and that, according to Johnson, was one reason why on April 6, 1999 he was laid off--less than six months before he would have received that increased pension benefit.
After the layoff, Johnson learned that the car dealer had tried to get rid of him earlier, but a union steward, no longer with the firm, had raised objections.
Johnson was replaced, he alleged, by a man 20 years younger with only 18 months of seniority, who was given a different title but essentially the same job.
In August, Johnson filed a charge of age discrimination with the Department of Human Rights.
Denying that it had discriminated, the company argued that the layoff was necessary because sales had declined, requiring some reorganization.
That might be true and a legitimate reason for the layoff, the department agreed.
However, the department found plenty of evidence that the company also wanted to get rid of Johnson because of his age.
When an employee is fired for "mixed motives," if one of the reasons is unlawful and discriminatory, the employer can be held liable for violating the Human Rights Act.
The Department of Human Rights found that was the case here.
Although the company had a legitimate need to cut costs, there was probable cause to believe that Wilkerson Motors was guilty of age discrimination for firing Johnson.
Their disabilities are often hidden from public view.
But Minnesota's Hmong, Somali, Hispanic and other new immigrants have the same disability challenges as other Minnesotans -- and in some cases more Immigrants, On the University of Minnesota's West Bank campus, there are thousands of immigrants--eating in restaurants, shopping in stores, navigating the busy neighborhood streets.
Margot Imdieke Cross, who has lived on the West Bank for years, sees many of them every day.
But Imdieke Cross has noticed something that seems unusual: hardly any of the immigrants she sees on the West Bank or anywhere else appear to have a disability.
"I have yet to see a Somali in a wheelchair," says Imdieke Cross, who would likely 9 refugees and disability notice these things--she is, after all, an accessibility specialist with the Minnesota State Council on Disability.

"They're refugees, they're escaping from a war-torn country and some have been victims of torture."
