ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING FEBRUARY 13-14, 2003 PAGE 14 OF 23
On a motion duly made by Mr. Bohrer, seconded by Ms. Knasiak, and approved unanimously, it was RESOLVED to revise 12 AAC 52.020(a)(3) to read: An applicant for a facility license shall submit... (3) a completed self-inspection of the premises questionnaire on a form provided by the department within 14 days of commencement of business; and.
Revise 12 AAC 52.030(b) to read: The pharmacist-in-charge of a pharmacy that has changed its physical address shall complete a selfinspection questionnaire on a form provided by the department within 14 days of commencement of business under the new license.
The board noted that adopting these regulations would not result in any cost to private persons.
The Board also noted that the regulations are contradictory in requiring an existing facility to turn in its license with the application as required in 12 AAC 52.030 and 12 AAC 52.040 and to still comply with 12 AAC 52.990 requiring display of license certificate.
"Draft" regulation 12 AAC 52.030(a)(3) allowing for return within 30 days of the existing Pharmacy License for Change of Name or Change of Location Applications would remove the contradictory requirements.
Change of pharmacy ownership requirements 12 AAC 52.040 would also need to be changed.
On a motion duly made by Mr. Bohrer, seconded by Mr. Miller, and approved unanimously, it was RESOLVED to revise 12 AAC 52.040(a) to read: An owner of a pharmacy shall return the facility license to the department within 30 days of issuance of a new license when ownership of the pharmacy is transferred.

Agenda Item 18 Legislative Update Â· The Board discussed H.B. No. 41 ("An act relating to medical care and crimes relating to the medical assistance program").
Ms. Soden noted that the bill appears to give the Pharmacist authorization to refuse to dispense a controlled substance unless the substance is "reasonably necessary" based on the Sec. 17.30.080 amendments.
H.B. No. 51 ("An act requiring pharmacists to include generic drug information on containers in which brand-name drug orders are dispensed") was discussed by the Board.
Ms. Soden reported that the original bill has been changed to include the Board's recommendations for proposed legislation from the FY 2002 Annual Report.
Copies of the revised draft of H.B. No. 51 were distributed to Board members.
The revised H.B. No. 51 is entitled "An Act allowing the Board of Pharmacy to delegate duties to an executive administrator; allowing the Board of Pharmacy to refuse to issue a license for the same reasons that the board may discipline a licensee; and requiring pharmacists to include generic drug information on containers in which brand-name prescription drug orders are dispensed".
Ms. Soden pointed out that the labeling portion of H.B. No. 51 puts something in statute that should really be added to existing regulation 12 AAC 52.480 Labeling.
Â·
On a motion duly made by Ms. Bueler, seconded by Mr. Miller, it was RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.480 to add (12) the generic drug name(s) below the brand name.
On an amended motion duly made by Mr. Bohrer, seconded by Mr. Miller, and approved unanimously, it was RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.480 to add (12) the accepted generic drug name(s) and strength of the drug dispensed shall be placed directly on the container's label.

ALASKA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY MINUTES OF MEETING FEBRUARY 13-14, 2003 PAGE 21 OF 23 Chris Coursey, Director of Pharmacy at Alaska Regional Hospital, joined the discussion and noted that the current Collaborative Practice regulations are impractical for hospitals with large medical staffs.
Approval and oversight of protocols is currently under the hospital's Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P
Mr. Coursey emphasized that hospital's protocols are constantly changing and it is impractical for the hospital and the Board to go through the approval process every time there is a change.
The current regulations address a small or limited group of physicians and pharmacists and Mr. Coursey encouraged the board to consider clarifying the regulations to acknowledge institutional P
Ms. Soden stated that, in the interest of patient safety, the hospital's protocols should be in-writing and made available to the Board upon request.

Mr. Miller emphasized that "real time" computer, video, and audio monitoring, security checks, and overrides by the pharmacistin-charge must be in place to insure protection of the health, welfare and safety of the public.
The Board discussed how a remote facility would be licensed and whether the regulatory authority exists to determine a new license category.
