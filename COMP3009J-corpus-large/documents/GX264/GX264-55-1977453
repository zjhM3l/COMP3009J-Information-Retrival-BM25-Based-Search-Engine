A labama Folk life Vol. 7, No. 1 News and Information about Alabama's Traditional Culture Spring 2001
Traditional Musics of Alabama: A Millennium Series The Alabama Center for Traditional Culture has released the first in its millennium series of compact disc recordings documenting Alabama's music traditions.
Traditional Musics of Alabama: A Compilation, produced by Steve Grauberger, is the first in the series of recordings, and is available from the Center for $12.50 plus $2.50 postage and handling .
The following is from the introduction by Hank Willett: In 1936, folksong scholar John Lomax, then head of the archive of American Folksong at the Library of Congress, admired the vital abundance of Alabama's traditional music and referred to the state as "rich in folk music."
Sixty years later, Lomax' daughter, Bess Lomax Hawes, former director of the Folk Arts Program at the National Ken Reynolds
Anne Kimzey
Endowment for the Arts, wrote of "the remarkable flowering of song that characterizes Alabama."
And, over the years, scores of folk music collectors and scholars have been drawn to Alabama's abundant and diverse musical traditions--traditions which have, through history, served to define the state and inform our fundamental notions of where and who we are.
From work songs and blues to spirituals and gospel, from fiddle tunes and lullabies to mariachi and polka, the legacy of the Alabama experience has been engraved in the music made by the people who settled this state.
This album is the first of a comprehensive millennium series of recordings--an in-depth documentation of all the traditional musics of Alabama--a series which will fea-

Alabama Arts Documentary to Air in May "Coat of Many Colors: A Tapestry of Alabama Artists," a 90minute documentary funded by the Alabama State Council on the Arts, will premiere at 8 p.m., Wednesday, May 9, on Alabama Public Television (APT).
The program showcases musicians, painters, sculptors, writers, and others who combine the state's rich artistic traditions and their own unique vision to create fascinating , innovative, and memorable works of art.
A production of the University of Alabama Center for Public Television and Radio (CPT
HDTV programs feature a remarkably detailed and realistic picture in a wide screen format.
While APT is not yet broadcasting an HDTV signal--and very few viewers in the state have the new televisions needed to receive these superior images--many Alabamians will be able to view the documentary in HDTV at previews in galleries, museums, and theaters around the state before the broadcast.

Even with the life-like high definition pictures, however, the subject is still the heart of the documentary.
"The story of the arts and artists in Alabama is a colorful one, rich in tradition and dynamic in contemporary expressions," says Al Head, ASCA director.
"The arts contribute to the quality of life in Alabama and portray the state's positive personality perhaps better than any other of our resources.
The story of the arts in Alabama can be and needs to be told."
The May 9th broadcast can be viewed on any television that is tuned to APT, Among the artists featured in the documentary: Â· Frances de la Rosa, whose inventive paintings are influenced by her childhood at an antebellum plantation home, and by Alabama's natural environment.
Â· Jerry and Tammy Sullivan, bluegrass/gospel musicians, known for their distinctive interpretations of traditional forms.
Â· The Louvin Brothers, a North Alabama songwriting duo whose striking harmonies reinvigorated country music.
Â· Pinky Bass, who says living in Alabama is "essential" to her work as an experimental photographer.
Â· Mary Ward Brown, author of short stories including the collection "Tongues of Flame," and winner of the 1987 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award.
Â· Michael Gagliardo, director and conductor of the Etowah Youth Orchestra.
Â· Willie King , who plays the blues in elementary schools and uses that music in projects to revitalize his West Alabama community.
Â· Albert Murray, novelist and essayist, who writes about how mythological themes such as The Quest and The Lament can be found in both literature and musical forms such as jazz and blues.
Â· Yvonne Wells, a self-styled quilter who eschews pattern quilts and instead uses pictures and words to tell stories in her bold and colorful creations.
Â· Mark Childress, novelist and screenwriter, born in Monroeville and firmly connected to Alabama literary figures such as Harper Lee and Truman Capote.
Preview screening dates and locations for "Coat of Many Colors" are still being arranged.
The federal government has mandated that all television stations convert to digital transmission, which makes HDTV broadcasts possible, by May 1, 2002.
Then stations will be required to broadcast using both today 's standard, analog signal and a digital signal.
Under current plans, in 2007 the conventional, analog television stations will be turned off and all broadcasts will be made using a digital signal.
At that time consumers will either have to buy a new digital television set or a The Four Eagles gospel quartet are among the artists featured in the doc- converter for their standard TV.

Cinco de Mayo Celebrated at Horsepens 40 Last May the newly formed Mexican Cultural Center of Alabama presented a Cinco de Mayo festival at Horsepens 40 near Steel, Alabama.
Cinco De Mayo (Fifth of May) is a patriotic celebration commemorating the victory of the Mexican Army over the French at "Battalla de Puebla" (the Battle of Puebla) on May 5, 1862.
Many Mexican Americans observe the event in the United States with parades, music, dance and other festivities.
Juan Vargas, president of the Mexican Cultural Center of Alabama, worked with volunteers the night before the event making cut paper decorations and getting things ready for the next day.
On Saturday, May 6, the festival began around 11 a.m. with a performance by Mariachi Tequila, a Mexican band based in Birmingham.
They played instruments typical of a traditional mariachi band including the trumpet, violin, a guitar-like instrument called the vihuela and a larger bass guitar called the guitarron.
The group treated the audience to an enjoyable selection of Mexican songs sung in the group's spirited vocal style.
After the mariachi band played a set, the children in the audience were given a chance to crack open a piÃ±ata filled with candy.
The children stood in line to for their turns.
The older children were blindfolded, and then were spun around to disorient them.
Younger children went at it without the blindfolds.
As each swung the stick the piÃ±ata moved up, down, back and fourth on a rope from which it was tied.
Adults manipulated the rope to make a game of it.
Once the piÃ±ata was forced open, candy spilled and all the children scurried to retrieve their loot.

Performing next were the Ballet Folklorico Mexicano De Gainesville from Gainesville Georgia.
Directed by Lupita Sosa, an enthusiastic and energetic group of young people performed traditional folk dances from different districts around Mexico, such as, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Oaxaca.
Their handmade costumes were beautiful and elaborate, representing the regions of each dance.
In the evening , a disc jockey played music starting about 4 p.m. before a popular dance band from
Gainesville, Georgia performed beginning at 10 p.m. and ending late.
It was a beautiful day, and with the addition of the spectacular Horsepens 40 rock formations as a backdrop, the Cinco De Mayo Festival was an admirable event promoting traditional culture of the local growing Latino population.

Sloss Furnaces Presents "Spirit of Steel" Workshop Anne Kimzey
The music of the mines, railroads and mills of Birmingham's early steel industry was the featured topic of "The Spirit of Steel," a one day workshop targeted to school teachers.
An audience of approximately 85 educators took part in the October 3rd event, held outdoors at Sloss Furnaces National Historic Landmark in Birmingham.
The workshop promoted Spirit of Steel, a CD and book of essays, as a resource in teaching history and social studies, music and language arts.
It paired presentations by the essayists who contributed to the book with performances by musicians who represented the musical genres featured on the CD.
Maggie Holtzberg presented the work songs of gandy dancers, the black crews who once maintained the South's railroad tracks.
The men used rhythmic chants in order to coordinate their movements and to lift their spirits during grueling work.
She showed clips from her documentary film featuring interAnne Kimzey
views with retired railroad workers in Alabama.
Ray Funk spoke about the development of Birmingham's African-American gospel quartet singing tradition.
Laborers in the mines and steel mills formed many such gospel groups.
And the rich, deep harmonies of the Birmingham sound "had a major influence on this style of singing throughout the nation," he said.
Following Funk's presentation, the Four Eagles, a group that began 62 years ago in the Winona Mining Camp, performed in the a cappella style associated with the Birmingham quartets.
Joyce Cauthen spoke on old time fiddling in Alabama.
She and her husband Jim played tunes, such as "Coal Valley" and "Coal Mine Blues," that were popular in the mining camps.
The Cauthens then led the teachers in a square dance session.
Gayle Dean Wardlow discussed early commercial blues recordings
Ray Funk travelled from Alaska to discuss Birmingham's AfricanAmerican gospel quartet singing tradition.
by Alabama musicians and singers.
Then blues harmonica player Bo McGee entertained the workshop participants in the final performance of the day.
Pam Reid, who teaches fourth grade in Hanceville (Cullman County), said the workshop made the connection for her between the history of Alabama's coal and steel industry and the music of the workers.
The heritage of the mines and mills held a personal interest for her, since her maternal grandfather worked in a coal mine and her paternal grandfather worked for Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) and laying bricks to build the furnaces.
Reid said she plans to include the music when teaching her students Alabama history.
"I can use excerpts so they can hear the transition from the 1800s to today," she said.

Spirit of Steel Spirit of Steel: Music of the Mines, Railroads and Mills of the Birmingham District includes essays by Maggie Holtzberg , Joyce Cauthen, Gayle Dean Wardlow and Ray Funk, a forward by Archie Green and a 21 song CD exploring gandy-dancer tunes, fiddle music, blues, labor songs and gospel quartet singing in the context of industrial Birmingham in the early twentieth century.
Spirit of Steel records the music of the workers who came from the cotton fields of Alabama and the Appalachian hills to better their lives in an industrial city.
It reveals the pleasures of the workers as well as their work experience.
It speaks to the disruptive forces that accompanied industrialization and urbanization, from the anguish of a miner's wife at her husband's loss, to a black man's struggle for political rights, to the longing for families left behind.

From the Field:
Herbalist Buford Stitcher Preserves Knowledge of Healing Plants As a boy, when Stitcher had a sore throat, his father would light a pine splinter and collect the black tar that dripped off the end.
He then made a concoction combining three drops of pine tar, three drops of kerosene, three drops of castor oil and a spoonful of sugar.
When swallowed, "in two days your sore throat was gone.
Your head was as clear as a bell," he explained.
"And it still works.
You just have trouble finding good kerosene" these days.
When he returned to his family farm in later life, he said he began to have a lot of questions about the old herbal treatments.
"I got to thinking about it more and more-what I grew up with.
Who'd done this and who'd done that and how the ailments were healed just by simple, little herbs.
It could be bark, roots, leaves, or just weeds.
It's amazing how they work," he said.
"I would talk to elderly people about different remedies they had used."
In his quest for more knowledge, he met the late Tommie Bass of Leesburg , Alabama.
Bass, by then, had gained national recognition as a traditional herbalist.
Stitcher visited Bass frequently in order to learn from him.
"I spent eight years with him in the woods and the mountains and he taught me his ways.
A lot of them were like mine.
A lot of them Buford Stitcher of Wedowee (Randolph were different."
County) holds examples of some of the comAmong the medicinal mon plants his grandmother used to make lore that Bass passed on to herbal remedies.

When Buford Stitcher grew up in Randolph County, his family and others in the community of Swagg were accustomed to treating their ailments with home remedies made from plants that grew in the woods or gardens nearby.
"We had to go out and get boneset, which is for coughs and colds.
We had to go out and get yellow root for infections," he explained.
"We had to drink black walnut tea for worms."
His grandmother showed him how to locate and identify many of the plants she used for medicinal purposes.
He recalls helping his grandmother dig red sassafras root to be used as a "blood purifier."
his student, were his recipes for a skin salve and a liniment, both of which Stitcher makes and provides to customers.
His business, based in Wedowee, is called Little River Botanicals.
He advises people to consult a doctor first about a medical problem.
"That's one thing Tommie the old herb man taught me.
Said, `Don't you ever diagnose anybody.
You let the doctors do that.
That's what they 're for.'
" "We can't claim this to take the place of modern medicine.
I don't mean to do that," he said, explaining that he goes to doctors for his own medical care.
"This is what I like about herbs.
Anytime you give the body something to help heal itself, more than likely it will."
Stitcher enjoys educating others about the traditional uses of herbs and is invited all over the state to talk about plants and their medical lore.
He brings labeled samples of many of the plants he's collected and holds each one up for his audience's inspection, as he discusses its identifying features and medicinal properties.
He cautions against using a plant unless one is absolutely certain of its identity.
A mistake could be dangerous.
At a recent festival at Landmark Park in Dothan, Stitcher held up a sprig of peppermint and sniffed its distinctive scent.
"Anybody that has gas or heartburn, just chew a leaf of this thing and it's mighty good," he explained.
"If you can't sleep at night, make yourself a cup of peppermint tea and it will calm your nerves."
As another sedative, he recommended peach leaves.
"If you can't To Page 9

sleep at night and you're just hollering at everybody, strip you a handful of leaves and put them in a cup of hot water.
Put a saucer on `em and let `em steep for about ten minutes, and then strain it up and drink it.
Then you'll feel good to everybody.
It'll relax your nerves and settle you down," he said.
He recommended drinking a cup of peach leaf tea before bed.
"If you're there 20 minutes and you're not asleep, get up and make a second cup--but bring your pillow with you.
You're going to sleep."
He mentioned catnip as an oldtime remedy to soothe fussy babies.
"Growing up in the country, people would come up with a baby just ascreaming and crying .
And they
would get a leaf and crush it and rub the little baby 's gums and just instantly it would quit crying ."
It works for adults too, he claimed.
"It'll make us calm and sleep at night.
You can boil it and make a tea or rub it on your gums."
Buford Stitcher's "pharmacy" includes hundreds of native plants.
And he can recommend one for almost any health concern.
For gout he advocates eating collard greens twice a week.
Drinking a tea made from Queen Anne's lace will help you lose weight, he said.
Chickweed is another plant that will "take the weight right off of you," claimed Stitcher.
"You can eat it green in a salad, or you can boil it and make a tea."
According to Stitcher, a tea made from wild blueberry will treat high blood pressure.
Smoking rabbit tobacco, also known as "life everlasting ," is good for "sinus, head colds, and congestion."
Mullein is also useful for treating sinus problems and lung congestion.
"You may wonder why I talk about the same ailment and different herbs," he said.
"I have people come to me and they want one herb that does everything .
God didn't make it like that.
As a matter of fact he made several herbs for one ailment.
Well, why is that? I guess it's because everybody 's system is different.
What works for one may not work for the other one."

The Gary Waldrep Band: a Family That Plays Together by Stephen Grauberger On North Alabama's Sand Mountain, there is a strong tradition of family bands performing old-time country, southern gospel, and bluegrass music.
These groups include notables: The Johnson Family String Band, Charlie and Ira Louvin, and The Maddox Family and Rose.
A fairly new Sand Mountain, family, touring group is The Gary Waldrep Band.
Gary, and his sister Susan Waldrep, perform with their aunt, Donna Townsel, and Georgia native Bill Everett.
Gary sings vocals, plays banjo, fiddle and guitar.
Susan sings vocals and plays the guitar.
Donna Townsel plays stand-up acoustic bass.
Bill Everett sings baritone and adds his mandolin to the mix.
Gary Waldrep was raised on the musical traditions of Sand Mountain, including old-time clawhammer banjo playing , fiddling and close harmony singing .
Gary, his sister and aunt grew up on their 80acre family farm in Dekalb County in the town of Kilpatrick near Boaz, where they all still live.
He attributes much of his musicality to his mother, Carolyn Waldrep, and to her side of the family, the McCulloughs.
It was Gary 's uncle the late Wayne McCullough who inspired many family musical performances, and who first pushed Gary up on stage at the age of five years old using a silver dollar as incentive.
Gary traces his McCullough musical roots back to the Watsons of Gainesville, GA.
The Watsons, Gary 's grandmother's (the late Mrs. Maurice McCullough) grandparents, were music makers.
Mrs. McCullough's grandfather Watson was an old-time fiddler and her grandmother a five-string banjo player.
Gary 's great-grandfather Leonard Watson, Mrs. McCullough's father, played the organ in church.
Mrs. McCullough played the piano.
Gary 's mother, a fine singer in her own right, taught Gary and his sister Susan to sing gospel harmonies and traditional country music as children.
Gary has created a name for himself outside of Alabama as a purveyor of traditional "old-time" banjo styles.
He was nominated for a Grammy in 1989 for the recording , "Gary Waldrep Vintage Bluegrass."
He previously performed with the Warrior River Boys (1981-1989), Wendy Bagwell and the Sunliters (1985), and The Sand Mountain Boys (1990-1994).
Gary was the recipient of the Old Time Banjo Award from the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPGMA) in 1993 and 1994.
Waldrep teaches 15 students when the band is not touring .
Because of his dedication as a teacher of an important folk tra10

dition he has participated as a Master Artist in the Folk Art Apprenticeship Program of the Alabama State Council on the Arts.
Gary Waldrep is interested in the preservation of Sand Mountain musical traditions and is organizing an association to preserve and educate people about those traditions.
One way he seeks to accomplish his goal is by promoting an annual music festival, now its fifth year, called, the "Festival on the Farm."
Each year Gary 's house on his family 's farm in Kilpatrick is the backdrop for this bluegrass festival.
His front porch is the stage.
Cattle are moved from an adjoining field that is used as a parking lot.
The Gary Waldrep Band with the help of the town of Kilpatrick, the Kilpatrick Fire Department and a number of dedicated fans who volunteer their time to make the small festival an annual success, produce the "Festival on the Farm".
Last year the "Festival on the Farm" was held September 8 Â­ 9.
It began Friday night with a "Gospel Sing ," featuring the Keytones Quartet, The Fishermen, The Cash Family, Telina Wilson, Southern Comfort, Donna and the Harmineers, and Miller's Hollow Band.
On Saturday afternoon and evening , featured bands included: The Larkin Family (TN), Bill Grant

McFarland Mall Fiddle Contest by Stephen Grauberger Fiddling contests have a long history in Alabama and much of the South.
Many families prospered on prize money won by talented loved ones at local contests held at schools, courthouses or other public buildings.
Contests, in addition to adding to the winner's pocket would also help the organizations that staged the events.
A rural school might be able to buy a few books and supplies with money brought in from a dance or musical contest.
A fiddling contest and round dance could draw many people from surrounding areas becoming a grand social occasion.
As is still true today, musicians and friends had an opportunity to visit, make music together and, at the same time, perform for an appreciative audience.
Each February fiddlers and other traditional musicians gather in Tuscaloosa to compete for prizes at the McFarland Mall's "Fiddlin' and Bluegrass Contest."
At this event, fiddle, guitar, banjo, mandolin, harmonica, solo singing bluegrass bands, and buck dancing are judged in separate categories for prize money.
The 15-year old contest, held every 3rd weekend in February, has strong support in the local community and a solid following of musicians from all over Alabama.
Participants come from several other states as well.
Each year the McFarland Mall is filled to near capacity with contestants and listeners.
Over 1000 people typically attend.
The audience members carry in lawn chairs, a must, to fill the entire main mall wing .
The performance area contains a high sunlit ceiling and has the added convenience of a Food Court in close proximity.
The performance stage is set opposite the main entrance.
It is decked out with the typical array of speakers and microphones.
Throughout the other two wings of the mall, small groups of musicians gather and jam together.
This arrangement allows wandering shoppers and aficionados to listen to spontaneous gatherings of instrumentalists and singers.
One might listen to individual bands practicing songs for the upcoming contest or see new friends, and old, having an opportunity to play together for the fun of it.
