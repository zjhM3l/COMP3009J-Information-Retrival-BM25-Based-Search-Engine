Other uary Conference of in Waco The Treatment Research Council (TOWTRC) will meet February 13-14 2001 in Waco.
The conference will meet at the Waco Convention Center.
According to TOWTRC Executive Secretary Warren Samuelson, this year's conference will provide an excellent opportunity to learn more about the design, installation, and management of on-site wastewater treatment and disposal systems utilized throughout Texas.
A focus of this year's conference will center around the most recent revisions to Texas regulations about on-site wastewater treatment systems.
Staff from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) will present an overview of the rules changes.
There will also be opportunities for participants to ask TNRCC staff questions about the proposed rules.
"The conference will help clarify what the proposed rules changes will address and how that will affect people in this industry every day," Samuelson said.
"As a result, we hope this conference will provide a lot of practical information people can put to use."
Several presentations will describe projects recently funded by the Council.
Some of the technical issues that will be covered include the extent to which many on-site systems may be chronically malfunctioning; design parameters for systems that treat high-strength wastes; designs for low-pressure dosing systems and drip irrigation systems; the use of caliche soil as a filter medium to dispose of and treat wastewater; and the development of maps to evaluate areas with
talks will discuss how soil absorption and evaporation can be used in combination to size drainfields; common problems with surface application systems; and characterizing soil hydraulic properties in subsurface drip drainfields.
Attending the conference will be a benefit to professionals in the industry as well as regulators.
The conference provides 8 certified hours of continuing education credits for designated representatives and installers.
Individuals with a Class D wastewater operator license who perform maintenance on OSSF systems can qualify for 10 hours of continuing education credits.
The conference will also feature many exhibitors, including companies in the private sector as well as representatives from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and other agencies and organizations.

TNRCC Proposes Changes to OSSF Rules Affecting Maintenance, Planning, Certification The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has developed new draft regulations that, if adopted, will affect many aspects of on-site wastewater treatment.
The regulations are codified in Title 30, Chapter 285, of the Texas Administrative Code, The draft rules were published on December 8, 2000 in The Texas Register.
The public comment period ended January 12, 2001, and the regulations could be enacted by the TNRCC late this spring.
Because TNRCC staff must respond to all public comments before the rules are finalized, it is possible that some of the draft rules changes mentioned here may not be included in the final regulations.
The rules changes cover the following areas: requirements for maintenance companies; changes in planning materials and construction; procedures for authorized agents and permitting authorities; and changes in the certification process.
"In this rules revision process, we worked to make the new regulations more readable," said Warren Samuelson of the TNRCC on-site wastewater treatment (OSSF) section.
"We believe making the rules more easily understood should also make these regulations more enforceable."
Some of the highlights in each area are discussed below.
analysis as part of that site assessment.
The site evaluation will have to include an analysis of the gravel used in individual systems.
Class III soils can also be used as a backfill material for standard systems.
Surface application and distribution lines, valve boxes, and sprinklers will have to be colored purple.
Every seven years, manufacturers of approved proprietary systems will have to verify that these technologies can still meet the standards under which they were originally approved.
The proposed changes require that surface application systems with setbacks of less than 20 feet must spray at night.
They also require that residential septic tanks must be a minimum of 500 gallons.
The rules changes also address the proper sizing of leaching chambers and low-pressure dosing systems.
PROCEDURES FOR AUTHORIZED AGENTS PERMITTING AUTHORITIES
AND
REQUIREMENTS COMPANIES
FOR
M
AINTENANCE
The draft regulations clarify the process through which OSSF programs are delegated to local governments and other authorized agents.
They also emphasize that the permitting authority of municipal authorized agents is limited only to the incorporated area of those cities.
The proposed rules changes would allow the TNRCC to assess a "charge-back" fee to local governments for work the Commission performs on OSSFs when there is not a local authorized agent.
The draft changes remove the permitting of new cluster systems from the TNRCC OSSF regulations.
In general, the proposed rule changes clarify the frequency for required maintenance, testing, and repair of proprietary on-site wastewater treatment systems (OSSFs).
Under the draft rules, the Executive Director of the TNRCC would have to approve training courses presented by manufacturers of proprietary systems that are used to certify individuals who maintain these systems.
Manufacturers of proprietary systems will also be required to provide training to an adequate number of maintenance companies in each county where their systems are marketed and used.
When a maintenance company services a system, the rule changes would require that a tag be placed on the unit or marked at the site at the time of a service visit.
This would verify that required maintenance was performed.
CHANGES
IN THE
CERTIFICATION PR
OCESS
The rules changes that may affect the largest number of people deal with the certification process.
The draft rules remove the experience requirement to qualify as an Installer I, and modify the experience needed to become an Installer II.
The proposals also remove all language pertaining to the site evaluator license.
The rules changes would prohibit anyone from advertising or representing themselves to the public as an installer without possessing a current license.
The term of licenses would be increased from one year to two years.
Notes: The TNRCC has developed a World Wide Web page that contains much more information on the proposed rules changes.
It is located at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/enforcement/csd/ics/ ossf_changes.html.
The TNRCC will review all the public comments.
Samuelson says the agency is committed to incorporating these suggestions into the new rules, when appropriate.

The draft regulations will affect many aspects of site evaluation and construction.

Several stakeholder organizations are participating in this effort, including the Coalition of Alternative Wastewater Treatment (CAWT), the Consortium of Institutes for Decentralized Wastewater Treatment (CIDWT), the National Onsite Wastewater Recycling Association (NOWRA), the Water Environment Federation (WEF), the Water Environment Research Foundation (WERF), the National Rural Electrical Cooperative Association (NRECA), and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).
The NDCP was created to identify and fund projects that address research gaps, regulatory issues, and policy and management questions related to decentralized wastewater treatment.
So far, two education projects have been awarded to develop university curriculum related to on-site systems, and to create a model curriculum for practitioners.
In the regulatory arena, studies have been funded to create a model ordinance for California, and to compare state authorities and practices that govern onsite systems.
Other NDCP projects cover such topics as quantifying the impact of on-site systems on watersheds; development of a framework for risk assessment to evaluate onsite technologies; and the creation of guidance manuals for alternative systems.
In the future, this program will likely create additional opportunities to research issues related to on-site wastewater treatment.

BRA Works with Salado Downtown Businesses to Outline Wastewater Treatment Options A regional water management agency is cooperating with the business district of a small town to explore alternatives for on-site wastewater treatment systems that serve the central business district.
The study is being led by the Brazos River Authority (BRA), at the request of downtown businesses.
The study was initiated by the businesses in November 1999 and is expected to be concluded by the end of 2001.
The assessment is funded in part by a grant from the Texas Water Development Board.
but feel they are limited by having to reserve a large percentage of their property for a septic system and drainfield.
Obviously, you don't want to put a parking lot or a heavily-trafficked area on top of the drainfield.
Changing from septic systems to a community sewer may free up space now used by drainfields, thus potentially allowing businesses to grow.
Another challenge is cost.
One restaurant reported that the expense associated with replacing its on-site system with a unit that could properly treat its wastes was roughly $50,000.
According to Denis Qualls of the BRA, which manages a series of wastewater treatment systems throughout the region, this project is interesting for a variety of reasons.
First, while many projects are community-wide, this one focuses on the special needs of the downtown area.
As a result, he anticipates that the majority of homes in the small town will be able to stay on septic systems and will not be required to join a centralized system.
The only exception may be for homes located within the central business district.
Secondly, Qualls noted that the timing of this study parallels the decision by Salado voters to incorporate, but emphasized these are separate movements that are not related.

NTRODUCTION
According to Michael Jahns of the Bell County Health Department (BCHD), whose agency regulates on-site systems in Salado, the crux of the problem is that the size of current onsite systems may be inadequate for many businesses.
Currently, some businesses with inadequately sized systems have been grandfathered in by previous regulations.
These systems can continue to be used as long as they are still functioning properly.
Since many buildings have been converted from their original purpose (often a home), they now generate significantly more wastewater than their sepThe BRA study will explore wastewater tic systems can treat.
As a Salado business district result, Jahns said, his agency has detected problems in which effluents have surfaced, especially in low-lying areas.
There have also been complaints of foul odors coming from septic tanks and drainfields.
As a result of the failure of septic systems, the county health department has asked several restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts to curtail their water use, and hours of operation, in order to not overload their systems.
Some of these businesses resolved these problems in part by installing water-conserving toilets, faucets, and by adopting more water-efficient dishwashing methods.

DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS An associated problem is that many business owners have expressed a desire to expand the size and scope of their operations,
Although no preferred strategies or options have been identified so far, Qualls noted that there may be an opportunity to connect downtown Salado businesses with a BRA regional wastewater plant sited between Temple and Belton.
The main goal of this project, he said, is to fully explore the nature of how systems are currently functioning and what problems exist, and to identify potential alternative technologies and how much it will cost to implement them.
"Once this is done," Qualls says, "we will be able to go to the business owners and give them a price to solve these problems.
They can then decide if what we've outlined is something they want to participate in."

chlorination was used to reduce fecal coliform levels in one system, so that the effluents could safely be used for surface irrigation.
It appears that these systems may have been oversized, since they were developed to handle maximum flows.
The use of winter air temperatures appears to be too conservative a parameter to design these systems for Texas.
However, the use of soil temperatures proved to be a more accurate factor in the design of constructed wetlands.
Labeled-nitrogen was used to determine the fate of nitrogen as it moved through the system.
These studies suggest that the majority of nitrogen was lost through ammonia volatilization, not plant uptake.
As a result, the plants in these constructed wetlands did not contribute significantly to improved wastewater treatment, although they did remove a lot of water through evaporation and transpiration.
In addition, the plants made these systems more aesthetically pleasing.
