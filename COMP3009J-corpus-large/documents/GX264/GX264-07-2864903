Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida: Section 1.
read: Section 2 of chapter 97-194, Laws of Florida, is amended to
Section 2.
The Florida Criminal Punishment Code, consisting of sections 921.002-921.0026, Florida Statutes, is established effective October 1, 1998, and applies to any felony committed on or after that date, excluding any capital felony.
Section 2.
Section 921.002, Florida Statutes, as created by section 3 of chapter 97-194, Laws of Florida, is amended to read: 921.002 The Criminal Punishment Code.--The Criminal Punishment Code shall apply to all felony offenses, except capital felonies, committed on or after October 1, 1998.
(1) The provision of criminal penalties and of limitations upon the application of such penalties is a matter of predominantly substantive law and, as such, is a matter properly addressed by the Legislature.
The Legislature, in the exercise of its authority and responsibility to establish sentencing criteria, to provide for the imposition of criminal penalties, and to make the best use of state prisons so that violent criminal offenders are appropriately incarcerated, has determined that it is in the best interest of the state to develop, implement, and revise a sentencing policy.
The Criminal Punishment Code embodies the principles that: (a) Sentencing is neutral with respect to race, gender, and social and economic status.
2 CODING: Words striken are deletions; words underlined are additions.
Ch. 98-204
LAWS OF FLORIDA
Ch. 98-204
(b) The primary purpose of sentencing is to punish the offender.
Rehabilitation is a desired goal of the criminal justice system but is subordinate to the goal of punishment.
(c) The penalty imposed is commensurate with the severity of the primary offense and the circumstances surrounding the primary offense.
(d) The severity of the sentence increases with the length and nature of the offender's prior record.
(e) The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge reflects the length of actual time to be served, shortened only by the application of incentive and meritorious gain-time as provided by law, and may not be shortened if the defendant would consequently serve less than 85 percent of his or her term of imprisonment as provided in s. 944.275(4)(b)3.
The provisions of chapter 947, relating to parole, shall not apply to persons sentenced under the Criminal Punishment Code. (f) Departures below the lowest permissible sentence sentencing range established by in the code must be articulated in writing by the trial court judge and made only when circumstances or factors reasonably justify the aggravation or mitigation of the sentence.
The level of proof necessary to establish facts that support a departure from the lowest permissible sentence sentencing range is a preponderance of the evidence.
(g) The trial court judge may impose a sentence up to and including the statutory maximum for any offense, including an offense that is before the court due to a violation of probation or community control.
(h) A sentence may be appealed on the basis that it departs from the Criminal Punishment Code only if the sentence is below the lowest permissible sentence or as enumerated in s. 924.06(1) sentencing range.
(i) Use of incarcerative sanctions is prioritized toward offenders convicted of serious offenses and certain offenders who have long prior records, in order to maximize the finite capacities of state and local correctional facilities.
(2) When a defendant is before the court for sentencing for more than one felony and the felonies were committed under more than one version or revision of the former sentencing guidelines or the code, each felony shall be sentenced under the guidelines or the code in effect at the time the particular felony was committed.
This subsection does not apply to sentencing for any capital felony.
(3) A court may impose a departure below the lowest permissible sentence sentencing range based upon circumstances or factors that reasonably justify the mitigation of the sentence in accordance with s. 921.0026.
The level of proof necessary to establish facts supporting the mitigation of a sentence is a preponderance of the evidence.
When multiple reasons exist to support the mitigation, the mitigation shall be upheld when at least one circumstance or factor justifies the mitigation regardless of the presence of other circumstances or factors found not to justify mitigation.
Any sentence 3 CODING: Words striken are deletions; words underlined are additions.
Ch. 98-204
LAWS OF FLORIDA
Ch. 98-204
imposed below the lowest permissible sentence sentencing range must be explained in writing by the trial court judge.
(4)(a) The Department of Corrections shall report on trends in sentencing practices and sentencing score thresholds and provide an analysis on the sentencing factors considered by the courts and shall submit this information to the Legislature by October 1 of each year, beginning in 1999.
(b) The Criminal Justice Estimating Conference, with the assistance of the Department of Corrections, shall estimate the impact of any proposed change to the Criminal Punishment Code on future rates of incarceration and on the prison population.
The Criminal Justice Estimating Conference shall base its projections on historical data concerning sentencing practices which have been accumulated by the Department of Corrections and other relevant data from other state agencies and records of the Department of Corrections which disclose the average time served for offenses covered by any proposed changes to the Criminal Punishment Code. (c) In order to produce projects that are either required by law or requested by the Legislature to assist the Legislature in making modifications to the Criminal Punishment Code, the Department of Corrections is authorized to collect and evaluate Criminal Punishment Code scoresheets from each of the judicial circuits after sentencing.
Beginning in 1999, by October 1 of each year, the Department of Corrections shall provide an annual report to the Legislature that shows the rate of compliance of each judicial circuit in providing scoresheets to the department.
Section 3.
Section 921.0021, Florida Statutes, as created by section 4 of chapter 97-194, Laws of Florida, is amended to read: 921.0021 Definitions.--As used in this chapter, for any felony offense, except any capital felony, committed on or after October 1, 1998, the term: (1) "Additional offense" means any offense other than the primary offense for which an offender is convicted and which is pending before the court for sentencing at the time of the primary offense.

(5) "Prior record" means a conviction for a crime committed by the offender, as an adult or a juvenile, prior to the time of the primary offense.

Convictions for offenses committed by the offender more than 10 years before the primary offense are not included in the offender's prior record if the offender has not been convicted of any other crime for a period of 10 consecutive years from the most recent date of release from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, to the date of the primary offense.
Juvenile dispositions of offenses committed by the offender within 3 years before the primary offense are included in the offender's prior record when the offense would have been a crime had the offender been an adult rather than a juvenile.
Juvenile dispositions of sexual offenses committed by the offender which were committed 3 years or more before the primary offense are included in the offender's prior record if the offender has not maintained a conviction-free record, either as an adult or a juvenile, for a period of 3 consecutive years from the most recent date of release from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, to the date of the primary offense.

with the sentence points provided under s. 921.0024 for sexual contact, regardless of whether there is evidence of any physical injury.

(2) The offense severity ranking chart has 10 offense levels, ranked from least severe, which are level 1 offenses, to most severe, which are level 10 offenses, and each felony offense is assigned to a level according to the severity of the offense.
For purposes of determining which felony offenses are specifically listed in the offense severity ranking chart and which severity level has been assigned to each of these offenses, the numerical statutory references in the left column of the chart and the felony degree designations in the middle column of the chart are controlling; the language in the right column of the chart is provided solely for descriptive purposes.

Community sanction violation points are assessed when a community sanction violation is before the court for sentencing.
Six (6) sentence points are assessed for each community sanction violation, and each successive community sanction violation; however, if the community sanction violation includes a new felony conviction before the sentencing court, twelve (12) community sanction violation points are assessed for such violation, and for 26 CODING: Words striken are deletions; words underlined are additions.
Ch. 98-204
LAWS OF FLORIDA
Ch. 98-204
each successive community sanction violation involving a new felony conviction.
Multiple counts of community sanction violations before the sentencing court shall not be a basis for multiplying the assessment of community sanction violation points.
Prior serious felony points: If the offender has a primary offense or any additional offense ranked in level 8, level 9, or level 10, and one or more prior serious felonies, a single assessment of 30 points shall be added.
For purposes of this section, a prior serious felony is an offense in the offender's prior record that is ranked in level 8, level 9, or level 10 under s. 921.0022 or s. 921.0023 and for which the offender is serving a sentence of confinement, supervision, or other sanction or for which the offender's date of release from confinement, supervision, or other sanction, whichever is later, is within 3 years before the date the primary offense or any additional offense was committed.
Prior capital felony points: If the offender has one or more prior capital felonies in the offender's criminal record, points shall be added to the subtotal sentence points of the offender equal to twice the number of points the offender receives for the primary offense and any additional offense.
A prior capital felony in the offender's criminal record is a previous capital felony offense for which the offender has entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to or has been found guilty; or a felony in another jurisdiction which is a capital felony in that jurisdiction, or would be a capital felony if the offense were committed in this state.
Possession of a firearm, semiautomatic firearm, or machine gun: If the offender is convicted of committing or attempting to commit any felony other than those enumerated in s. 775.087(2) while having in his possession: a firearm as defined in s. 790.001(6), an additional 18 sentence points are assessed; or if the offender is convicted of committing or attempting to commit any felony other than those enumerated in s. 775.087(3) while having in his possession a semiautomatic firearm as defined in s. 775.087(3) or a machine gun as defined in s. 790.001(9), an additional 25 sentence points are assessed.
Sentencing multipliers: Drug trafficking: If the primary offense is drug trafficking under s. 893.135, the subtotal sentence points are multiplied, at the discretion of the court, for a level 7 or level 8 offense, by 1.5.
The state attorney may move the sentencing court to reduce or suspend the sentence of a person convicted of a level 7 or level 8 offense, if the offender provides substantial assistance as described in s. 893.135(4).
Law enforcement protection: If the primary offense is a violation of the Law Enforcement Protection Act under s. 775.0823(2), the subtotal sentence points are multiplied by 2.5.
If the primary offense is a violation of s. 775.0823(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8), the subtotal sentence points are multiplied by 2.0.
If the primary offense is a violation of s. 784.07(3) or s. 27 CODING: Words striken are deletions; words underlined are additions.
Ch. 98-204
LAWS OF FLORIDA
Ch. 98-204
775.0875(1), or of the Law Enforcement Protection Act under s. 775.0823(9) or (10), the subtotal sentence points are multiplied by 1.5.
Grand theft of a motor vehicle: If the primary offense is grand theft of the third degree involving a motor vehicle and in the offender's prior record, there are three or more grand thefts of the third degree involving a motor vehicle, the subtotal sentence points are multiplied by 1.5.
Criminal street gang member: If the offender is convicted of the primary offense and is found to have been a member of a criminal street gang at the time of the commission of the primary offense pursuant to s. 874.04, the subtotal sentence points are multiplied by 1.5.
Domestic violence in the presence of a child: If the offender is convicted of the primary offense and the primary offense is a crime of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28, which was committed in the presence of a child under 16 years of age who is a family household member as defined in s. 741.28(2) with the victim or perpetrator, the subtotal sentence points are multiplied, at the discretion of the court, by 1.5.
(2) The lowest permissible sentence is the minimum sentence that may be imposed by the trial court, absent a valid reason for departure in prison months that may be imposed by the court, absent a valid reason to depart, shall be calculated by subtracting 28 points from the total sentence points and decreasing the remaining total by 25 percent.
If The lowest permissible sentence is any in prison months is less than or equal to 12, a nonstate prison sanction in which the total sentence points equals or is less than 44 points, unless the court determines within its discretion that a prison sentence, which may be up to the statutory maximums for the offenses committed, is appropriate may be imposed.
When the total sentence points exceeds 44 points, the lowest permissible sentence in prison months shall be calculated by subtracting 28 points from the total sentence points and decreasing the remaining total by 25 percent.
The total sentence points shall be calculated only as a means of determining the lowest permissible sentence.
The permissible range for sentencing shall be the lowest permissible sentence up to and including the statutory maximum, as defined in s. 775.082, for the primary offense and any additional offenses before the court for sentencing.
The sentencing court may impose such sentences concurrently or consecutively.
However, any sentence to state prison must exceed 1 year.
If the lowest permissible sentence under the code exceeds the statutory maximum sentence as provided in s. 775.082, the sentence required by the code must be imposed.
If the total sentence points are greater than or equal to 363, the court may sentence the offender to life imprisonment.
An offender sentenced to life imprisonment under this section is not eligible for any form of discretionary early release, except executive clemency or conditional medical release under s. 947.149.
(3) A single scoresheet shall be prepared for each defendant to determine the permissible range for the sentence that the court may impose, except that if the defendant is before the court for sentencing for more than one felony and the felonies were committed under more than one version or 28 CODING: Words striken are deletions; words underlined are additions.
