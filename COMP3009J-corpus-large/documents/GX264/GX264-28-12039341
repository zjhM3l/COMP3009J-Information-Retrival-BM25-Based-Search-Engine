Roy Cooper Attorney General
WHAT DO I DO WHEN IDENT ITY THEFT HAPPENS TO ME? You are about to embark on a challenging process, but have hope.
You can successfully reclaim your good name, and North Carolina and the federal government have many resources to help you.
To minimize the damage to your credit hi story and reputation, it is important to act quickly, though.
In dealing with creditors and law enforcement, keep a log of all conversations, including dates, names, phone numbers, report numbers, if any, and additional comments.
Note the time spent and any expenses incurred in case you are able to obtain restitution in a later judgment or conviction against the thief.
Confirm conversations in writing.
Send correspondence by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Keep copies of all letters and docum ents.
Do not send originals; send only photocopies.
Finally, do not give in no matter how frustrated you are.
You do not owe the money.
There is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Your credit rating will be repaired, and no legal action should be taken against you.
Three basic steps should be taken in nearly all instances of identity theft.
Step 1: Promptly report the fraud to law enforcement.
North Carolina law provides that identity theft is a felony.
Report the fraud to your local police department, and get a copy of the police report.
This immediately alerts local law enforcement to the crime, and it establishes that you acted diligently.
Get a police report, complaint number or other similar record, which you may need when contacting your creditors.
Also, keep the phone number of your fraud investigator handy.
Also, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by contacting the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline by phone [1 (877) ID -THEFT (438-4338)] or online at www.consumer.gov/idtheft.
The FTC maintains a confidential, national Identity Theft database, and may also be able to assist in pursuing identity thieves through federal channels.
Step 2: Contact the fraud departments of the three major credit bureaus.
Ask each credit bureau to take a report and to place a "fraud alert" on your credit report.
Request a victim's statement asking that creditors call you before opening any new accounts or changing your existing accounts.
Also, ask each credit bureau to send you a copy of your credit report, so you can determine the extent of any unlawful credit activity that may have taken place using your identity.
Credit bureaus must give you a free copy if you have been a victim of fraud and you request it in writing.
Review the credit reports carefully.
If you already have a police report, file number or complaint number from your local law enforcement agency, give that information to the three major credit bureaus as well, to help them investigate any disputed accounts or other reports of fraud.
The three major credit bureaus may be contacted as follows: Equifax: (800) 525-6285 Experian: (888) 397-3742 TransUnion: (800) 680-7289
Step 3: Contact the fraud department of each of your creditors.
Collect all y our credit cards, bank account statements and other creditor information (such as utilitiy or cable bills) and make note of the phone number/address of their "fraud" departments.
Report the fraud to each creditor, even if that particular creditor has not been the subject of fraud, to ensure the creditor knows that an identity thief may have your account information.
Ask each creditor to place a "fraud alert" on your account.
Follow up in writing.
If there are charges on your accounts that are illegal, most creditors will also ask you to submit a written report of the fraud, along with a police report, complaint number or file number from law enforcement.
You may use the enclosed Identity Theft Affidavit as part of your written report, to make sure you inc lude all the necessary information.
Many creditors will ask you to submit such an Affidavit within two weeks of your report of fraud, so you need to act promptly.
Step 4: Your next steps.
Depending on the type of identity theft that happened to you, there are some additional things you can do to take control of the situation.
Stolen checks and fraudulent bank accounts.
If you have had checks stolen or bank accounts set up fraudulently in your name, notify the bank.
Put stop payments on any outstanding checks that you are unsure of.
Cancel your checking and savings accounts and obtain new account numbers.
Give the bank a secret password for your accounts.
If a store rejects one of your own checks, contact the check verification company the store uses.
The major check verification companies are: CheckRite: (800) 766-2748 ChexSystems: (800) 428-9623 Equifax: (800) 437-5120 International Check Services (formerly NPC): (800) 526-5380 SCAN: (800) 262-7771
TeleCheck: (800) 710-9898 ATM cards.
If your ATM or debit card has been stolen or compromised, report it immediately.
Get a new card, account number and password.
Do not use your old password.
When creating a password, don't use common numbers like the last four digits of your Social Security number or your birth date.
Fraudulent change of address.
Notify the U.S. Postal Inspection Service if you suspect an identity thief has filed a change of your address with the post office or has used the mail to commit credit or bank fraud.
Find out where fraudulent credit cards were sent.
Notify the local Postmaster for that address to forward all mail in your name to your own address.
You may also need to talk with the mail carrier.
Social Security number misuse.
Call the Social Security Administration's fraud hotline (1800-269-0271) to report fraudulent use of your Social Security number.
Order a copy of your Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) and check it for accuracyÂ­the thief might be using your Social Security number for employment purposes.
You can request a PEBES application at your local Social Security office or download one from the Social Security Administration's website: http://www.ssa.gov.
As a last resort, you might want to request a new number.
The SSA will only assign you a new number, however, if you fit its fraud victim criteria.
Passports.
If you have a passport, notify the passport office in writing to be on the lookout for anyone ordering a new passport in your name.
Washington Passport Agency, 1111 19th Street, N.W.,Washington DC 20524; (202) 647-0518.
Phone service.
If your long distance calling card has been stolen or you discover fraudulent charges on your bill, cancel the account and open a new one.
Provide a password that must be used any time the account is changed.
Legal help.
You may want to consult an attorney to determine legal action to take against creditors and/or credit bureaus if they are not cooperative in removing fraudulent entries from your credit report or if negligence is a factor.
