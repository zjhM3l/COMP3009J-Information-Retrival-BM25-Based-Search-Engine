INTRODUCTION This Policy Book is assembled in dictionary form and may be used in conjunction with the Meat and Poultry Inspection Regulations and the Meat and Poultry Inspection Manual, Directives and Notices.
It is a composite of policy and day-to-day labeling decision, many of which do not appear in the above publications.
They are subject to change and therefore a periodic updating of this book will take place.
Note: Red Meat Required percentages of meat required for red meat products are shown on the basis of fresh uncooked weight unless otherwise indicated.
For purposes of this Policy Book, whenever the terms beef, pork, lamb, mutton, or veal are used they indicate the use of skeletal muscle tissue from the named species (9 CFR 301.2).
Note: Poultry Required percentages for poultry products are based on a cooked deboned basis unless otherwise stated.
When the standards indicate "poultry", the skin and fat are not to exceed natural proportions per (9 CFR 381.117(d)).
Applications for label approval should be addressed as follows: USDA, FSIS, OPPD Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff (LCPS) 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Room 614 Â­ Annex Building Washington, DC 20250-3700 Product samples (only when requested by LCPS) should be packed with sufficient refrigerant to last until received.
Shipping should be coordinated with requestor to assure delivery before 4:00 p.m. Friday.

ADDED SOLUTIONS (WITH JUICES): Products with added solutions that are cooked in an impervious bag and as a result of the cooking contain free flowing juices that are not drained, should be labeled to reflect the solution and the juices, e.g., ("Roast Beef Contains up to 12 % solution with Juices").
ADDED SOLUTIONS (POULTRY) (BONELESS): Boneless poultry products containing solutions can be labeled similarly to the PFF language for cured pork products, that is "Cured Chicken and Water Product X % of Weight is Added Ingredients."
The terms "with natural juices" or "water added" are not permitted since both terms do not adequately convey the amount of solution added to the poultry products.
Additionally, the term "with natural juices" is misleading when a solution is introduced into poultry product by means of marinating, soaking, injecting, tumbling, etc.
"ALL", "PURE", AND "100 %" POULTRY: A labeling claim, such as, "meat used is 100% white meat", may only be used when the poultry meat contains no added ingredients.
A labeling claim, such as, "white meat only," is acceptable when white meat is used to the exclusion of dark meat.
In this situation, other ingredients may be present in the poultry portion of the product.
"ALL or 100 % BEEF (Patty Mix)": Beef patty mix may be labeled "all," "pure," or "100% beef," when the only added ingredients are partially defatted chopped beef or finely textured beef.
An ingredients statement would be required on bulk packed product but not retail packages.
"All," "Pure," or "100%," may not be used if partially defatted beef fatty tissue (PDBFT), is used or mechanically separated species (MSS), are used.
ALPHA CELLULOSE: When used as a carrier of flavoring ingredients, it need not be shown in the ingredients statement, unless it functions as a binder in the meat or poultry product.
AMENABILITY: USDA exempts from its inspection foods containing 3% or less raw (or less than 2% cooked) red meat or other edible portions of a carcass, or products which historically have not been considered by consumers as products of the meat industry.
For poultry products, see 9 CFR 381.15.
These basic guidelines are not intended to be all-inclusive.
See: Meat Base
6
ANDOUILLE (FR): Made with pork and/or pork byproducts stuffed into large intestines.
Product can be sold cooked or uncooked.
Andouille is a coined name and must be accompanied by a true product name, e.g., "sausage" or "pudding" depending on formulation.
If beef is used, it must be shown in the product name, e.g., "Beef Andouille Sausage" or "Beef Andouille Pudding."
ANTIOXIDANTS: BHA and BHT are permitted in spice mixtures at 0.02% of the essential oil content without declaration on meat or poultry food product labels.
Antioxidants are permitted in cooked fresh sausages and fresh sausage-like products (e.g., a pork, water soy protein product).
BHA and BHT are not permitted in non-specific meat or poultry products.
APPROXIMATE: The word "approximate" may be used to describe the thickness of bacon and the number of pieces in an institutional package when the actual net weight is declared (e.g., 18 - 21 pieces).
"Approximately" is acceptable in a containing statement for meat products (e.g., "Containing approximately 6% of a solution of..." or "Marinated with approximately 3% solution of...").
The word "approximate" cannot be used in conjunction with the serving size or the required declaration of net weight of contents.
ARROZ CON POLLO (SP): The product must contain at least 15% cooked chicken meat.
The label must show, the true product name, in English, i.e., "Rice with Chicken," except if the product is distributed solely in Puerto Rico.
ARTIFICIAL MARBLING - RED MEAT PRODUCTS: Fats and oils, e.g., butter, margarine, vegetable oils. etc., may be added to red meat products, e.g., roast beef and steaks.
However, the presence of such substances must be indicated as part of the product name, as a product name qualifier, or in a solution statement, e.g., "Roast Beef and Margarine Product," "Vegetable Oil Added," "Containing 10% of a solution of milk,..."
All requirements of other applicable policies should be followed for these products.
In addition, products that appear to be of a higher quality must include a statement to indicate this, e.g., "Injected with Beef Fat" or "Product may appear to be of a higher quality than the actual grade."
Samples may be necessary to determine if this requirement applies.

The pork shoulder blade Boston roast includes the porcine muscle, fat and bone, cut interior of the second or third thoracic vertebrae, and posterior of the atlas joint (first cervical vertebrae), and dorsal of the center of the humerus bone.
For Arkansas Bacon, the neck bones and rib bones are removed by cutting close to the underside of those bones.
The blade bone (scapula) and the dorsal fat covering, including the skin (clear plate), are removed, leaving no more than one-quarter inch of the fat covering the roast.
The meat is then dry cured with salt, sugar, nitrites, and spices, and smoked with natural smoke.
The meat may not be injected or soaked in curing brine, nor may any artificial or liquid smoke be applied to the meat.
Product that is prepared outside the state of Arkansas but in the manner prescribed may be identified as "Arkansas Style Bacon."
The true product name must be shown as "Boneless Cured Pork Shoulder Butt."

M/SP = Moisture/ (Salt x Protein) 2.
A Brine Ratio of 9.0 or less.
Brine Ratio = Moisture/Salt 3.
A Brine concentration of 10% or more.
Brine concentration = Salt/(Moisture + Salt) 4.

Beef bacon is a cured and smoked beef product sliced to simulate regular bacon.
It is prepared from various beef cuts and offered with a variety of coined names, including "Breakfast Beef," "Beef Bacon," etc.
A common or usual name is required, e.g., "Cured and Smoked Beef Plate," and should be shown contiguous to the coined name.
Poultry bacon products are acceptable and may be designated as (Kind) Bacon.
However, a true descriptive name must appear contiguous to (Kind) Bacon without intervening type or design, in letters at least one-half the size of the letters used in the (Kind) Bacon, and in the same style and color and on the same background.
An example of an acceptable designation is "Turkey Bacon-Cured Turkey Breast Meat-Chopped and Formed."
9
The descriptive name can serve alone as the product name.
See: Policy Memo 106A dated December 17, 1991 BACON PRODUCTS: The bacon products intended for further cooking before consumption, i.e., slab bacon for deli slicing, can be labeled "certified," "roasted" or "partially cooked" provided the product is cooked to 148Â° F and the labeling clearly indicated the product is intended to be further cooked before consumption.

BARBECUE (BBQ), PRODUCTS: Barbecue (BBQ), products that are composed of uncured red meat products that are injected, massaged, tumbled, etc., and which are cooked back to or below the weight of the raw meat product (green weight), must use the term "seasoned" or "flavored," in conjunction with the meat product in the product name, e.g., "BBQ Seasoned Pork," or "Sliced Seasoned Beef with Barbecue Sauce."
The labeling for uncured red meat products containing some solutions that are used to make BBQ products (9 CFR 319.312 or 319.80) which are not cooked back to green weight or are not in compliance with the cooking yield must have a containing statement on the label.
A containing statement is required in the product name when the cooking yield is not met, e.g., "BBQ Pork Containing up to 15% of a solution."
Similarly, a containing statement is required in the product name when the product does not have sufficient quantities of meat minus the solution to meet the minimum meat requirement.
However, in limited situations when the minimum meat requirement (minus the solution) is met and when cook yield is compensated for by adding additional meat, the containing statement can either be placed in the product name or attached to the meat component in the ingredients statement, e.g., "Ingredients: Beef Containing up to 25% ...sugar, spices."
Also, see Policy Memo 84A and Policy Memo 102.
Red meat components that contain binders and extenders and do not meet one of the barbecue standards (9 CFR 319.80, 319.312) shall be descriptively labeled to include the extender, nomenclature in the product name, e.g., "BBQ Seasoned Beef, Modified Food Starch and Gelatinized Wheat Starch", "Pork and Binder Product with Barbecue Sauce", or "BBQ Cooked Beef and Binder Product" followed by a parenthetical list of all of its ingredients.
Bone-in red meat products do not have to comply with Federal meat regulation, 9 CFR 319.312 or 319.80 with regard to cooking yield and must indicate the presence of bones in product name, e.g., "Seasoned Cooked Pork Ribs with Barbecue Sauce" or "Barbecue Beef Ribs." 10
When bone-in red meat products are injected, massaged, tumbled, etc., and do not return to green weight after cooking, the containing statement shall appear once on the label in (1) the ingredients statement as part of the red meat component (only if there is enough Beef Ribs without solution to meet the requirement for "Beef Ribs and BBQ Sauce"), or (2) in the product name, e.g., "Beef Ribs, containing 10% of a solution and BBQ Sauce."

These are flattened and knitted together in "cutlet" size products by means of "cubing" or "Frenching" machines, or by hand pounding with "cubing hammers."
The term "cutlet" relates to thin slices of meat.
They can be identified as sliced pork meat product when the designation clearly states the specific part of the carcass from which the meat in the product is derived (e.g., "Pork Loin Cutlets").
All of the terms should be conspicuously displayed on labels.
CUTLET, POULTRY: 38
Poultry cutlets may be fabricated as opposed to using whole pieces of poultry meat.
However, the term "cutlet" must be properly and distinctly qualified to describe the product, e.g.: "Turkey Cutlet From a Turkey Loaf" "Chicken Cutlet From Chicken Roll" "Turkey Cutlet, Chopped and Formed" Cooked poultry cutlets, which are solid pieces and contain added water, should not be labeled as patties.
A solution statement is not needed.
CUTLET VEAL: Must be a solid piece of meat from the round; slice thickness may vary.
However, combining several thin slices to represent a single cutlet is not permitted.
DEHYDRATED MEAT CALCULATION FACTOR: The fresh meat equivalent based on a given amount of dehydrated meat can be found by multiplying the weight of the dehydrated beef by the factor 2.8.
This factor was derived as follows: Assuming canners and cutters grade beef was used, the composition of meat would be approximately 12% fat, 18% protein, 69% water, and 1% ash.
Then 100 pounds of beef, when dehydrated to 5% moisture, would be 100 less 64 or 36 pounds dehydrated meat.
Thus, 100 divided by 36 equals 2.8.
Assuming that the amount of dehydrated beef equivalent of 100 pounds of fresh beef is that quantity containing 18 pounds of protein, then 18 divided by the percentage of protein found by analysis of dehydrated beef would be the amount of dehydrated beef equivalent to 100 pounds of fresh meat.
DEHYDRATED POULTRY CALCULATION FACTOR: The moist deboned cooked poultry or poultry meat equivalent based on a given amount of dehydrated poultry or poultry meat which can be found by multiplying the weight of the dehydrated poultry or poultry meat by the factor of 4.0.
DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS WHEN WATER IS ADDED: Three methods are acceptable for listing dehydrated products.
Listing (1) As "water, dehydrated potatoes" or "dehydrated potatoes, water," proper order, (2) As "reconstituted potatoes," or (3) As "rehydrated reference was to meat instead of potatoes, the word beef, pork, appropriate would be substituted for the word "potatoes."
DEVILED POULTRY: of the ingredients whichever is the potatoes."

If meat is featured in the product name, e.g., Beef Dinner, the requirement is 25% or 2.5 ounces cooked meat.
If a meat food product is featured in the product name, e.g., Beef Burgundy Dinner, then 25% or 2.5 ounces of meat food product is needed.
If poultry is featured in the name, e.g., Chicken Dinner, the standard is 18% or 2 ounces cooked deboned poultry meat, whichever is greater.
However, if a poultry food product is featured in the product name, e.g., Chicken a La King Dinner, the 25% or 2.5 ounces of poultry food product, whichever is greater, is needed.
The meat requirement for products with net weights greater than 10 ounces may be established exclusive of the appetizer, bread, and dessert, provided the remaining components weigh not less than 10 ounces.

There is a difference of opinion regarding the best cooler humidity.
Some prefer low humidity of from 70 to 75% so that exposed surfaces of meat remain dry.
Others use humidity's up to 85 to 90% in order to purposely develop a mold growth on the outside of the meat and reduce evaporation losses.

See: 9 CFR 317.8(b)(25) 9 CFR 318.7(a)(1) 9 CFR 381.120 EXOTIC/NON-AMENABLE PRODUCTS-USE OF CURE AGENTS: Only amenable meat/poultry products can contain curing agents (i.e., nitrites etc.), with the exception of ratites (ostrich, rhea, emu) and squab.
The prior function of nitrite and nitrate, according to FDA regulations, applies only to those species that were considered "meat" or "poultry" prior to September 1958.
Therefore, amenable species that can contain cure agents are identified as the following: 1.
Poultry Â­ (domesticated birds) chicken, turkey, duck, geese, and guineas.
2.
Meat Â­ cattle, sheep, swine, and goat.
Non-amenable products, such as buffalo, reindeer and pheasant, can not contain curing agents; such products are considered to be regulated under FDA regulations.
However, if non-amenable products are included in an amenable product, curing agents would be permitted.
The curing agents would be calculated based on both the amenable meat/poultry product and non-amenable meat/poultry product.
For example, the formula includes 3 lbs.
Cooked chicken and 97 lbs. buffalo.
The calculation for the curing agents would be based on 100 lbs. of meat.
In addition, in those situations where the meat block consists of an amenable product and a nonamenable product (refer to the example), the appropriate inspection legend should represent the amenable product.
Therefore, using the example above, the label would have a poultry legend.
Product derived from exotic/non-amenable species that contain over 3% raw meat (cattle, sheep, swine, goat, horses or other equine) are subject to inspection.
The game meat used in these products must be derived from carcasses slaughtered under the Food Safety and Inspection Service.
Products made with meat from exotic and non-amenable exotic species with 3% or less of meat or edible portion from cattle,
45
sheep, swine, goat, horses or other equine, or up to 30% fat from these species are non-amenable provided the only reference to meat or meat byproducts on the labeling is in the statement of ingredients and the product name includes the term "flavored with (amenable species)."
Custom prepared products composed of meat from exotic/nonamenable species and up to 30% animal fat are not amenable.
Labeling such products with the term applies (see: 303.1 (a) (2)).
Products made with meat from game animals with 3% or less of meat or edible portion from cattle, sheep, swine, goat, or up to 30% meat fats provided the only reference to meat or meat byproducts on the labeling is in the statement of ingredients or referred to as "flavored with."
Custom prepared products composed of meat from game animals and up to 30% animal fat.
Labeling "Not For Sale" applies.

All other meat from exotic/nonamenable species that is used in formulating amenable products must be derived from carcasses slaughtered under the Food Safety and Inspection Service.
EXTRA AND MORE THAN: The terms "extra" or "more (component) than" may be used provided the following guidelines are followed: (1) There is at least a 10% increase in the particular component of interest over the amount that is found in the usual or "regular" formulation.
(2) Information must be provided with the label application that compares the product formulation containing the "extra" amount of the component to the regular formulation of the same product to establish that at least a 10% increase in the component has occurred.
Therefore, the usual or "regular" component claims at the time of label review must be presented so that the necessary comparison of formulations can be made.
(3) In the situation where production of the "regular" product formulation ceases, the "extra" or "more (component) than" product labels would be given a 6-months temporary approval.
(4) A comparison to a similar product on the market may be made to support the "extra" or "more/than" type claim, provided suitable market basket data are submitted with the label application that establish the similarity of formulations and show the increased amount of the component over the "usual" amount.
46

2.
A truthful representation of geographical origin, e.g., "Virginia Ham" for a ham produced in the State of Virginia; or A trademark or trade name which: a. has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or distributor that it is generally understood by consumers to mean the product of the particular manufacturer or distributor, e.g., "Swiss Chalet;" or b. is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is generally understood by the consumer not to suggest geographical origin, e.g., "Moon Sausage;" or 3.
A part of the name required or allowed by an applicable Federal law, regulation or standard, e.g., "Frankfurter," "Vienna;" or 4.
A name whose market significance is generally understood by consumers to connote a particular class, kind, type or style of product, or preparation rather than to indicate geographical origin of the product, e.g., "Mexican Style Dinner," "Italian Style Pizza."
Such terms must be qualified with the word "style" or "type," unless specifically approved by the Administrator as a generic term, e.g., "Lebanon Bologna," "Genoa Salami," Milan Salami."
Any geographical representation that does not meet the aforementioned guidelines should be qualified by the word "brand," provided that the word "brand" is not used in such a way as to be false or misleading.
A qualifying statement identifying the place where the product was actually made is required in proximity to the brand name, e.g., "Milwaukee Brand Bacon, Made in Chicago, Illinois."
The word "Brand" must be in the same size and style of type as the geographical term.
If the product has a foreign brand name, it may be identified as having been made in this country, e.g., "Scandinavian Brand Bacon, Made in U.S.A.".

Country, Ranch, and Farm in Trade, Branch and Fanciful Names: Trade names, brand names, or fanciful names that include the words country, ranch, or farm, e.g., "Country Kitchen," "Ranch House," "Hickory Farms," or "Carabeef Ranch Brand" do not invoke section 9 CFR 317.8 of the regulations regarding the use of the term "Country" or "Farm".
However, if the terms are used alone in conjunction with the
53
product name, e.g., "Country Stew," then such products must be prepared in the country or on the ranch or farm and meet any other requirements prescribed.

Giblet packs are expected within the cavities of eviscerated whole birds or eviscerated whole rabbits or when packaged with cut-up whole birds or cut-up whole rabbits, therefore, qualifying the presence of giblets is not required on labeling.
However, when giblets are not expected, therefore, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., "Packed with Giblets."
In situations where parts of giblets are missing, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., "Parts of Giblets Missing" or "Parts of Giblets May Be Missing."
In situations where the giblets are missing entirely from an eviscerated carcass or a cut-up whole carcass, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., "Packed Without Giblets."
In addition, an excess of one of the giblet components can be added to make up for another missing giblet 54
component.
In this case, a proper qualifying statement is required, e.g., "Packed with 2 Gizzards, 1 Liver."
A neck, when not attached to the within the carcass or packed with qualifier is not required to flag missing, a product name qualifier carcass of a whole bird, is also expected to be present the cut-up whole carcass.
Accordingly, a product name the presence of the neck.
Rather, when the neck is is required, e.g., "Without Neck."

65
HYDROLYZED BEEF STOCK: A beef stock which has been treated with acid, alkali, or enzymes to digest the protein.
The protein molecules are broken down into amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, and peptones.
As the digestion is carried out for longer periods of time, more and more of the larger molecules are broken down into amino acids, with free alpha-amino groups.
By analyzing these alpha-amino nitrogens one can determine the degree of hydrolysis.
100% hydrolysis would mean that all the nitrogen (protein) is in the form of amino acids.
10% of hydrolysis would mean that only 10% of the nitrogen is in the form of free amino acids, while the rest is still present in polymeric form.
The label should indicate the degree of hydrolysis.
This is determined from the ratio of amino nitrogen to total nitrogen.
amino nitrogen = % hydrolysis total nitrogen A product labeled 50% Hydrolyzed Beef Stock must, therefore, have 50% of the total nitrogen present as amino nitrogen.
Adding % solids is optional.
The % solids would not necessarily be the same % as hydrolysis depending on the thickness (consistency) of product.
HYDROLYZED GELATIN: Hydrolyzed gelatin is permitted in frankfurters and similar products (9 CFR 319.180) at levels typically used for flavorings (less than 2%).

If gelatin is used in a product, make sure it is permitted for use in the product.
Hydrolyzed gelatin is acceptable in poultry franks 9 CFR 319.180 and like products at levels not to exceed 2% of total formula until otherwise notified.
Hydrolyzed gelatin is recognized as a binder rather than flavoring and may be used at levels of 2% or less in 9 CFR 319.180 type products.
HYDROLYZED OAT FLOUR: Hydrolyzed oat flour is safe and may be used in non-standardized meat/poultry products as a binder at below typical binder use levels, i.e., 3%.
It may be used in low fat hamburger, water, and hydrolyzed oat flour product as per Policy Memo 121.
HYDROLYZED PROTEIN: "Hydrolyzed Protein (milk, egg, soy)" is an acceptable common or usual name provided all components are hydrolyzed.
"Hydrolyzed Protein (potato, gelatin)" is an unacceptable ingredient declaration and must be declared as "hydrolyzed potato protein and hydrolyzed gelatin."

The water cannot be included as part of the net weight statement and the transmittal form should indicated this.
IMITATION FLAVORS: Imitation beef flavor, imitation mushroom flavor, flavor base for gravies and similar substances which enhance, fortify, or help to simulate a flavor are usually composed of food additives and, as such, are not "artificial flavors" for labeling purposes.
This class of imitation flavors can be composed of such ingredients as flour, fats, oils, salt, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, vegetable gums, thiamine hydrochloride, beta alanine, disodium inosinate, glutamic acid, and a host of other ingredients.
These flavorings must be identified on labels by showing each individual ingredient by its common name.
Class names, e.g., amino acids are not acceptable.
Each specific amino acid must be listed.
INCIDENTAL ADDITIVES: As defined in the Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR 101.100(a)(3)), incidental additives are substances present in foods at insignificant levels and that do not serve a technical or functional effect in that food.
In determining whether a substance is an incidental additive, the following criteria may be applied: 1.

Â° Comminuted Chicken and Comminuted Chicken With Kidney and Sex Glands Removed However, exceptions to this policy may be granted.
Exceptions would require that the establishment operators develop a procedure which the assigned inspector can readily monitor to ensure correct labeling.
Such procedures, accompanied by written comments from the assigned inspector and where possible, the circuit supervisor, must be forwarded to the area supervisor for review and approval.
Approved procedures must be attached to the label records accompanying new or modified labels submitted for approval.
See: Policy Memo 083A dated May 12, 1988 LABELING FOR SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS: If a product fails to comply with a standard only because the meat or poultry content is lower than required and the product has generic identity as a nonmeat product (e.g., pizza, stew, pies), then the product may be designated by the nonmeat terminology in the standardized name (e.g., "PIZZA," "STEW," "PIE"), provided the meat/poultry content of the product is conspicuously disclosed contiguous to the product name along with a statement of the amount of meat/poultry in the standardized product.
(For example, PIZZA (contains 5% sausage; SAUSAGE PIZZA contains 12% sausage.)
Such product
75
may not be nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles.
For this purpose, nutritional inferiority is defined, consistent with the requirement of 21 CFR 101.3(e)(4), as any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present at 2% or more of the U.S. RDA per serving of protein or any of the vitamins or minerals for which U.S. RDAs are established.
A quality control procedure must be approved for such products by the Processed Products Inspection Division before the label can be used.
If a product is nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles, it must be labeled "imitation" in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(j) and 9 CFR 381.1(b).
See: Policy Memo 069 dated March 23, 1984 LABELING OF MODIFIED BREAKFAST SAUSAGE, COOKED SAUSAGE, AND FERMENTED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY A NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIM: Modified breakfast sausage, cooked sausage, and fermented sausage products are substitute versions of the standardized or traditional products that have been formulated and processed to reduce the fat contents to qualify for use of nutrient content claims, but do not comply with the standard of identity or composition as described in the meat and poultry regulations or the Standards and Labeling Policy Book (Policy Book) because of the use of ingredients used for fat replacement which are precluded or restricted by these standards.
The deviation from the standard or the traditional, i.e., "regular product," is conveyed by associating an expressed nutrient content claim for the appropriate reduction in fat content and the standardized or traditional product name, e.g., "Reduced Fat Frankfurter" or "Low Fat Pepperoni."
The nutrient content claims that may be used are those related to a reduction in fat contents that are identified in the regulations for meat products in 9 CFR Part 317 and for poultry products in 9 CFR Part 381.
Maintaining Product Integrity: The following guidelines must be applied to assure that the modified versions of the subject meat and poultry sausage products do not violate the integrity of the standardized or traditional product for which they purport to be substitutes: (1) the product must be similar in shape, flavor, consistency, and general appearance to the product as prepared according to the regulatory or traditional standard, (2) the meat or poultry used to formulate the modified product must come from the same anatomical location when the standardized term is related to an anatomical region on an animal, e.g., "ham" is expected to be from the hind leg of the hog and cured; thus, "lean smoked ham sausage" would be comprised of meat from the hind leg of a hog that has been smoked and cured, (3) the modified sausage product must result from the same processing procedures as those specified for the subject sausage products described by regulatory or Policy Book standards, (4) there must not be deviations from product safety criteria (e.g., salt content, curing agents, pH, water activity and/or moisture/protein ratio) that are provided in the regulatory or Policy Book standards for sausages, and (5) the modified product must achieve the appropriate reduction in fat content to be eligible to use a nutrient content claim in conjunction with the standardized or traditional product name.
76
Performance Characteristics: In producing modified, substitute versions of sausages, the deviations from ingredient provisions of the regulatory and Policy Book standards should be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim while maintaining the performance characteristics similar to the standardized or traditional product, i.e., similar preparation, cooking, and handling characteristics.
If a modified version of the standardized or traditional sausage does not perform in substantially the same way as the standardized or traditional item, the label must include a prominent statement informing the consumer of such differences.
For example, a "low fat frankfurter" that essentially has all of the characteristics of a frankfurter, but cannot be grilled, would indicate "not recommended for grilling."
A "reduced fat pepperoni" that displays essentially all the characteristics of pepperoni, but cannot be cooked, would , for example, indicate "not recommended for cooking" or "do not cook."
Safe and Suitable Ingredients: A modified, substitute sausage product must be formulated with approved safe and suitable ingredients, e.g., those identified in 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4) and 9 CFR 381.147(f)(4), and those determined to be safe and suitable by the Food Standards and Ingredients Branch, Product Assessment Division.
Such ingredients are to be used at the lowest level necessary to achieve the intended effect of reducing fat as compared to the standardized or traditional product.
Safe and suitable ingredients are those used to replace fat, improve texture, and prevent syneresis.
An ingredient or component of an ingredient that is specifically required by the regulatory or Policy Book standard for characterizing purposes, e.g., cheese in a cheesefurter, fresh livers in liver sausage, cured ham in a ham sausage, and fennel or anise in an Italian sausage, shall be present in the required amount, if applicable, or otherwise in a significant amount to provide a characterizing identity to the product.
Moreover, an ingredient or component of an ingredient that is not permitted by regulations for use in any meat or poultry sausage product, e.g., sodium benzoate, shall not be added to a modified, substitute product.
Product Identity: The name of the modified version of the standardized or traditional product that complies with all parts of the policy prescribed herein is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim for the meat and/or poultry product with a reduction in fat content and the applicable standardized or traditional term, e.g., "Lean Sausage," "97% Fat-Free (or "Low Fat") Kielbasa," "Low-Fat Frankfurter Made with Beef, Pork and Turkey," "Reduced Fat Pepperoni," "Extra Lean Turkey Italian Sausage," and "Lite Genoa Salami."
The size and style of type must conform to the nutrition labeling regulations.
Ingredients Statement: To assist the consumer in differentiating between the standardized or traditional sausage product and the modified, substitute version, ingredients that are not provided for by regulatory or Policy Book standards, or used in excess of the allowable levels specified, must be appropriately identified with an asterisk in the ingredients statement.
The statement(s) defining the asterisk(s), e.g., "*Ingredient(s) not in regular " (fill in name of the standardized or traditional product), or " (fill in name of the "*Ingredients(s) in excess of amount permitted in regular
77
standardized or traditional product), or both as appropriate, must be legible and conspicuous, and shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same size and style of type.
See: Policy Memo 123 dated January 20, 1995 LABELING OF MEAT AND POULTRY STICK ITEMS: Stick items such as beef jerky, pepperoni sticks, and beef sticks must be labeled (i.e., contain the required label features as outlined in 9 CFR 317 and 9 CFR 381, Subpart N) according to the following guidelines: 1.
If sold in fully labeled bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers, stick items do not have to be fully labeled unless they are individually wrapped.
This type of container cannot be reused.
2.
If sold in bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers that are not fully labeled, stick items must be fully labeled.
Bulk containers such as these may only be refilled with fully labeled product.
3.
If sold in small, fully labeled cartons, boxes, or similar containers (e.g., 3 oz., net weight) that are only intended for retail sale intact, stick items may be individually wrapped and unlabeled.
See: Policy Memo 111 dated June 6, 1988 LABELING OF MODIFIED SUBSTITUTE VERSIONS OF FRESH (SPECIES) SAUSAGE, HAMBURGER OR GROUND BEEF PRODUCTS: This policy allows modified versions of fresh (species) sausages, ground beef, or hamburger to contain non-meat or poultry, "fat-replacing ingredients" (e.g., binders such as carrageenan, modified food starch) and to be identified by certain nutrient content claims in accordance with nutrition labeling regulations effective on August 8, 1994, in conjunction with descriptive labeling, e.g., "Lean Pork Sausage with a X% Solution of ...," or "Low Fat Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product."
This policy allows for the use of terms defined in regulations, e.g., "Lean," "Reduced Fat," "Low Fat," etc., to be used to describe fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger products with a reduction in fat content resulting from the use of added ingredients (i.e., "fat replacers" such as carrageenan and isolated soy protein).
These products must meet the criteria for use of the nutrient content claim associated with the fat reduction.
The nutrient content claim may be used in conjunction with the standardized name provided the consumer is informed of the actual components of the product through labeling, i.e., descriptive product name, ingredients statement, and Nutrition Facts.
78
Meat products, including those that meet the criteria established for claims, such as "Lean," "Low Fat," "Lower Fat," "Reduced Fat," etc., that combine fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger, and other safe and suitable ingredients, for the principal purpose of replacing fat, may be descriptively labeled.
Examples of such products are "Lean Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product," "Low Fat Ground Beef With a X% Solution of ...," "Lean Beef Sausage, Water, and Carrageenan Product," or "Reduced Fat Pork Sausage, Water, and Binders Product," provided conditions prescribed in the regulations, viz., 9 CFR 317, for use of the nutrient content claim are satisfied.
In contrast, modified versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef or hamburger product containing added ingredients that do not qualify for use of a nutrient content claim prescribed in the nutrition labeling regulations must be labeled as Imitation Pork Sausage, Imitation Beef Sausage, Imitation Ground Beef, Imitation Hamburger, Beef Patty or Beef Patty Mix in accordance with 9 CFR Section 317.2(j)(1) and Sections 9 CFR 319.141 (Fresh pork sausage), 319.142 (Fresh beef sausage), and 319.15 (Miscellaneous beef products), respectively.
Descriptively labeled, modified, substitute versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger product with a reduction in fat content must comply with the following guidelines: 1.
The descriptive name of a modified, substitute product with a reduction in fat content is the applicable nutrient content claim used in conjunction with the appropriate standardized name and fat-replacing ingredients, e.g., "Low Fat Ground Beef, Water and Carrageenan Product," or "Lean Pork Sausage With a X% Solution of Water, Modified Food Starch, Spices, and Salt."
Words in the descriptive name may be of a different size, style, color, or type but, in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible.
Moreover, no word in the descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one-third the size of the largest letter used in any other word in the descriptive name.
The solution statement, when used, is considered to be part of the descriptive product name and must comply with descriptive name sizing requirements.
2.
Fat-replacing ingredients (e.g., binders and water) and fat in the finished product may not exceed 30 % of the product as formulated for the modified, substitute ground beef, hamburger, or fresh beef sausage product, and no more than 40 % of the product formulation for the substitute fresh pork sausage.
The fat content must be in accordance with requirements for use of the applicable nutrient content claim.
3.
The product includes mandatory nutrition labeling prescribed in the meat inspection regulations, viz., 9 CFR 317.
4.
The product is formulated with approved safe and suitable ingredients, e.g., those identified in 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4), and which are determined to be safe and suitable by the Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff, that are used at the lowest level necessary to achieve the intended effect as a fat-replacing ingredient (i.e., binder).
See: Policy Memo 121B dated January 20, 1995
79
LABELING OF PRODUCT NAMES, FANCIFUL NAMES, WORD SIZE: Words in product names or fanciful names may be a different size, style, color, or type, but in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible.
Moreover, no word in a product name, i.e., a common or usual name, a standardized name, or a descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one-third the size of the largest letter used in any other words of the product name.
The same guidelines apply to letters of words in fanciful names that may accompany the product name.
For example, for a product labeled Chili Mac--Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce, "Chili Mac" is the fanciful name and "Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce" is the product name.
No letter in "Chili Mac" may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in "Chili Mac."
Similarly, no letter in the descriptive name may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in the descriptive name.
This policy is not intended to address the relative size of words in fanciful names versus product names.
The size of words in qualifying statements, e.g., "Water Added," "Contains up to ...," "Smoke Flavoring Added," etc., are not affected by this policy memo.
See: Policy Memo 087A dated September 16, 1985 LABELING OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING MEAT WITH ADDED SOLUTIONS OR OTHER NONMEAT INGREDIENTS IN SECONDARY PRODUCTS: In those situations where meat containing an added solution or other nonmeat ingredients, e.g., Ham-Water Added, Corned Beef and Water Products, Beef-Containing up to 10% of a solution, are used in secondary products in sufficient quantities to meet the minimum meat requirement without including the added solution, or nonmeat ingredients, the product name need not include any reference to the added solution or nonmeat ingredients; e.g., Corned Beef and Cabbage would be an acceptable name for a product if the corned beef portion of the corned beef and water product was present in a sufficient quantity to satisfy the 25% cooked corned beef requirement.
The ingredients statement, however, must include nomenclature as required by the regulations or policy (see also Policy Memos 066C and 084A).
In this example, the ingredients statement would list "Corned Beef and Water Product-X % of added ingredients are . . . ."
For products in which the added solution ingredient as a whole is used to meet the minimum meat requirement, the product name must include nomenclature required for the component, e.g., Beef (containing up to 10 % of a flavoring solution) Burgundy.
The ingredients statement must also include the same nomenclature for the meat ingredient.
See: Policy Memo 102 dated January 6, 1987 LABELING OF PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIALLY COLORED: Labels of products which are artificially colored either by artificial colors or natural colors must bear a statement to indicate the presence of the coloring, e.g., "artificially 80
colored" or "colored with annatto."
Products whose true color is disguised by packing media, e.g., colored pickling solutions, must also have labels that include a statement that indicates the presence of the color.
The statement must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner contiguous to the product name.
When a component within a product is artificially colored, e.g., breading, sauce, and sausage, a qualifying statement is necessary.
However, in all cases, the presence of the coloring must appear in the ingredients statement.
Whenever FD
Some products, e.g., chorizos and some of the sausages of the longaniza variety, are expected to be characterized by coloring.
In these situations, the presence of the coloring need only be indicated in the ingredients statement.
See: Policy Memo 112 on caramel coloring Policy Memo 095 on colored casings Policy Memo 113 dated June 24, 1988 LABELING OF COMPONENTS: PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE PACKETS OF OTHER
Wording indicating that the product contains, in addition to the meat or poultry product, another component, e.g., a gravy, sauce, or seasoning packet must appear in conjunction with the name of the product in such a manner that it is obvious to the purchaser that he or she is also purchasing that packet along with the meat and/or poultry product.
The wording must be shown in print no smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in the rest of the product name, of such color that will insure it not being overlooked at point of purchase, and positioned contiguous to the rest of the product name, so as not to appear in whole or part on any panel except the main display panel.
The net weight individual components may be shown but are not required.
See: Policy Memo 099 dated September 2, 1986 LABELING OF SAFE THAWING INSTRUCTIONS ON CONSUMER PACKAGES: Thawing instructions which appear on the label of a frozen meat or poultry product must be given in accordance with FSIS' recommendations for safe thawing procedures.
These procedures are as follows: 1.
2.
3.
Thawing product in the refrigerator.
Thawing product in cold water, changing water every 30 minutes until product is thawed.
Thawing product in a microwave oven for less than 2 hours.
Cook immediately.
Upon request, alternative thawing procedures may be considered.

Acceptable for use as a coating on sausage casings.
Sausages coated with Myvacet shall show, adjacent to the product name, a qualifying statement disclosing the presence of the compound, e.g., "Summer Sausage Coated with a Solution of Distilled Acetylated Monoglycerides."
NACHO STYLE, NACHO FLAVOR, AND SIMILAR TERMS: Acceptable terminology for products possessing the characteristics associated with "Nachos," a Mexican hors flavor components generally include, but are not limited to, Jack), tomato (tomato solids, tomato powder), spices, or flavorings (usually garlic and onion), and chili peppers Parmesan cheese are also often present.
However, these satisfy the above cheese requirement.
NATURAL CLAIMS: The term "natural" may be used on labeling for meat products and poultry products, provided the applicant for such labeling demonstrates that: 100
commonly expected flavor d'oeurve.
The characterizing cheese (Cheddar or Monterey other natural seasonings and (mild or hot).
Romano and cheeses may not be used to
(1) the product does not contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, or chemical preservative (as defined in 21 CFR 101.22), or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and (2) the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed.
Minimal processing may include: (a) those traditional processes used to make food edible or to preserve it or to make it safe for human consumption, e.g., smoking, roasting, freezing, drying, and fermenting, or (b) those physical processes which do not fundamentally alter the raw product and/or which only separate a whole, intact food into component parts, e.g., grinding meat, separating eggs into albumen and yolk, and pressing fruits to produce juices.
Relatively severe processes, e.g., solvent extraction, acid hydrolysis, and chemical bleaching would clearly be considered more than minimal processing.
Thus, the use of a natural flavor or flavoring in compliance with 21 CFR 101.22 which has undergone more than minimal processing would place a product in which it is used outside the scope of these guidelines.
However, the presence of an ingredient which has been more than minimally processed would not necessarily preclude the product from being promoted as natural.
Exceptions of this type may be granted on a case-by-case basis if it can be demonstrated that the use of such an ingredient would not significantly change the character of the product to the point that it could no longer be considered a natural product.
In such cases, the natural claim must be qualified to clearly and conspicuously identify the ingredient, e.g., contains refined sugar.
All products claiming to be natural or a natural food should be accompanied by a brief statement which explains what is meant by the term natural, i.e., that the product is a natural food because it contains no artificial ingredients and is only minimally processed.
This statement should appear directly beneath or beside all natural claims or, if elsewhere on the principal display panel, an asterisk should be used to tie the explanation to the claim.
The decision to approve or deny the use of a natural claim may be affected by the specific context in which the claim is made.
For example, claims indicating that a product is natural food, e.g., "Natural chili" or "chili - a natural product" would be unacceptable for a product containing beet powder which artificially colors the finished product.
However, "all natural ingredients" might be an acceptable claim for such a product.
See: Policy Memo 055 dated November 22, 1982 NATURAL SMOKED COLOR: Approval can be properly granted to labels with this statement when the products involved are "Smoked" and not artificially colored.
The results of the use of artificial smoke materials can, by means of a number of processing operations, result in a color characteristic being acquired by the frankfurters, bologna, and the like.
The term "Natural Smoked Color" can be used to properly identify this point.
NAVARIN:
101
Navarin is a stew containing lamb or mutton and vegetables and considered a national dish of France.
It must meet the meat stew standard of 25% meat.
Show true product name, e.g., "Navarin-Lamb Stew."
NEGATIVE LABELING: (1) Negative labeling is allowed if it is unclear from the product name that the ingredient is not present.
For example, the use of the term "no beef" on the label of "turkey pastrami" would further clarify that the product does not contain beef.
Negative labeling is allowed if the statement is beneficial for health, religious preference, or other similar reasons.
For example, highlighting the absence of salt in a product would be helpful to those persons on sodium-restricted diets.
Negative labeling is allowed if the claims are directly linked to the product packaging, as opposed to the product itself.
For example, flexible retortable pouches could bear the statement "no preservatives, refrigeration or freezing needed with this new packaging method."
Negative labeling is allowed if such claims call attention to the absence of ingredients because they are prohibited in a product by regulation or policy.
The statement must clearly and prominently indicate this fact, so as not to mislead or create false impressions.
For example, "USDA regulations prohibit the use of preservatives in this product" would be an acceptable statement for ground beef.
Negative labeling is allowed to indicate that absence of an ingredient when that ingredient is expected or permitted by regulation or policy.
This could also apply to ingredients which are not expected or permitted by regulation or policy if the ingredients could find their way into the product through a component.
For example, the use of "no preservatives" on the label of "spaghetti with meat and sauce" (where regulations do not permit the direct addition of preservatives) would be acceptable if the product contained an ingredient, such as cooking oil, which could contain antioxidants but do not.

(5)
These guidelines do not preempt the requirements of the nutrition labeling regulation.
Therefore, negative claims such as "unsalted" would have to comply with the provisions stated in the nutrition labeling regulations.
See Policy Memo 019B dated August 18, 1994 NET QUANTITY OF CONTENTS ON COMBINATION PACKAGES: The guidelines for stating the net quantity of contents on combination packages containing both liquid and solid products are as follows:
102
1.
The declaration of net quantity of contents for a combination package shall be expressed in terms of fluid measure for individual products that are liquid and in terms of avoirdupois weight for individual products that are solid, semisolid, or viscous, provided the quantity statements for identical packages or units are combined.
For example, the fruit drink would be expressed in fluid measure and the meat, cheese, crackers, and cookies would be expressed in the combined avoirdupois weight.
2.
The declaration of quantity shall be preceded by one of the following terms, as appropriate: "Net Weight," "Net Wt.," or "Net Contents."
The net quantity of contents declaration may appear in more than one line.
Therefore, both stacked and side-by-side declarations would be considered appropriate.
- Descriptive terms may be used to identify the liquid and solid components of the package, e.g., entree, meal, or drink; however, such terms shall not include brand names.
Connecting words such as "and" or "plus" are permitted to be used as part of the declaration of contents.
-
Examples of acceptable net content declarations are as follows: (1) Entree Net Wt. 8 oz., Drink 4 fl. oz. (120ml) (2) Net Contents: lunch 8 oz. plus fruit drink 4 fl. oz. (3) Net Wt. 8 oz. Drink 4 fl. oz. (120ml) (4) Net Weight 8 oz. and 4 fl. oz. Federally inspected meat and poultry products are exempt from the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), including the mandatory metric labeling provisions that went into effect February 14, 1994.
However, if metric labeling is included voluntarily, such labeling should comply with the FPLA.
The guidelines contained in this policy memo will be subject to the provisions prescribed in 9 CFR 317.2(h) and 9 CFR 381.121 of the Federal regulations.
See: Policy Memo 124 dated January 17, 1995 NET WEIGHT STATEMENT: Divider Pak: On a product where two cans are taped together, one of which contains the meat or poultry item and the other a vegetable, e.g., "Chicken Chow Mein," the meat or poultry label may include the net weight on the 20% panel.
The vegetable can bears the true name of the product with the total net weight of the other can and the drained weight of the vegetable can.
103
Double Packing: When a poultry product and a non-poultry product are separately wrapped and placed in a single immediate container bearing the name of both products, the net weight shown on the immediate container may be the total net weight of the two products or the net weight of the poultry product and the non-poultry product separately.
Additional Net Weight Information: Nonregulatory information of a net weight nature, e.g., 4-3 oz. packages, accompanying a net weight statement is acceptable and need not adhere to the size and spacing restrictions.
Open Net Weights: Open net weights may be presented in pounds and ounces, decimals, decimal fractions, or fractions, e.g., 1 1/2 lbs., 1.6 lbs.
Net Weight Requirements: The statement of net quantity of contents is required on all products intended for sale at retail intact.
In addition, shipping containers must bear a net quantity of contents statement if product inside is not uniform in weight (i.e., random weight).
Piece counts may not be used in lieu of a required net quantity of contents statement on a shipping container but may be used as additional information.
Multi-Unit Retail Packages: Fully labeled packages of more than one of the same meat or poultry product packages in an open (i.e., clear) overwrap do not have to include a net weight statement.
See: 9 CFR 317.2(h), and 9 CFR 381.121(b) MPI Bulletin 211 NET WEIGHT STATEMENTS ON PACKAGES WITH HEADER LABELS: The guidelines for determining the size and location of net weight statements on meat food product packages with header labels are as follows: 1.
The entire front of the package is considered the principal display panel of the package and its area is used to determine the size of the net weight statement.
Print size specifications for the net weight statement specified by the regulations must be followed.
2.
The net weight statement should be placed within the lower 30% area label if no other mandatory labeling features are printed on the rest of display panel of the package.
If mandatory features do appear below the net weight statement must be placed within the lower 30 % of the containing any mandatory information.
of the header the principal the header label, total area
A "Header Label" is a small label applied across the top of a package usually bearing all of the mandatory labeling information.
The rest of the package is most often a clear film containing a meat or poultry product, e.g., luncheon meat.
This type of packaging is designed to be used on pegboard type displays.
104
See: Policy Memo 047 dated May 3, 1982 "NEW" AND SIMILAR TERMS: Terms like "new," "now," "improved," and similar terms may be used within the following guidelines: 1.
The terms may only be used for a period of 6 months from the date of the initial approval, except as noted in 2., 3., and 4.
below.
2.
Extensions to the 6-month period may be granted if: a.
Processors can demonstrate that production or distribution delays precluded the use of the approved labeling as scheduled.
In such situations, the lost time can be restored.
b. Processors can demonstrate that labeling inventory needs for the 6-month period were over estimated due to poor sales.
The processors must maintain records which indicate the amount and the date the labeling was originally purchased.
In this situation, up to an additional 6 months can be granted.
No further extension will be considered.
3.
In those situations where it is customary to distribute "new" products to various geographical regions, each geographic area may receive a sketch approval for 6 months if the processor can assure adequate controls over the segregation and distribution of the products.
4.
In situations where it is customary to test market product in no more than approximately 15% of the intended total marketing area before total begins, labeling for the test market area can receive a sketch approval included in the 6-month sketch approval given to the labeling of distributed to the total marketing area.
Processors must be able to assure % of the total market is involved in test marketing.
See: Policy Memo 107 dated August 18, 1987 NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER: Product must contain at least 25% cooked "Corned Beef."
NEW ORLEANS STYLE: Acceptable for products that contain any five of the following ingredients: Roux base, rice, onion, green onions garlic, celery, bell peppers, cayenne pepper, white pepper, parsley, or tomato.
distribution and also be the product that only 15
105
The product may contain various protein sources including seafood and game.
NITRITE: Calculations should be based on the total meat block including the muscle tissue, fat and blood (e.g., "Blood Pudding").
If the product is cured, the blood would be included and considered part of the meat.
NON-AMENABLE PRODUCT/VOLUNTARY INSPECTION: [Examples of non-amenable products are sandwiches containing meat or poultry, clam chowder which has less than 1% bacon for export to Japan, and natural casings for export].
Any non-amenable product can be produced under voluntary inspection when requested (9 CFR 318.13 and Subchapter B, Part 350.3(c)).
However, most FSIS requirements have to be met concerning labeling, i.e., mandatory labeling features, an accurate ingredients statement, handling statement, etc.
Safe Handling Instructions are not required even for raw non-amenable products.
FDA nutrition labeling rules apply to such products.
NON-DAIRY WHITE SAUCE OR NON-DAIRY SAUCE: A sauce made with a non-dairy creamer.
If this type of a sauce is proposed for use with "Chipped Beef," a suitable name would be "Non-Dairy White Sauce with Chipped Beef" or "Non-Dairy Sauce with Chipped Beef."
The reference to "Cream" or any of its derivations should not appear in the product name.
NONSPECIFIC MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS: Red meat items of this type do not have specific requirements, i.e., they do not possess a standard of identity or composition.
Consequently, these products shall be identified by one of two ways: (1) A descriptive name that identifies characterizing components and/or ingredients, or (2) a fanciful or coined name that is accompanied by an ingredients statement.
The latter approach should be used when the use of a descriptive name is not practical, e.g., when the descriptive name would read like an ingredients statement.
When a fanciful name or coined name is used, the ingredients statement should appear contiguous to the product name on the principal display panel of an immediate container.
NONSTANDARDIZED COOKED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS CONTAINING BOTH LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY INGREDIENTS: The labeling of nonstandardized cooked sausage products must comply with 9 CFR 319.180.
Meat food products are those in which more than 50% of the livestock and poultry product portion consists of livestock ingredients.
Such cooked sausage products which 106
contain poultry ingredients at more than 15% of the total ingredients (excluding water) must have product names that indicate the species of livestock and kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g., "Beef and Turkey Frankfurter" or "Frankfurter Made From Beef and Turkey.
" Poultry food products are those in which more than 50% of the livestock and poultry products portion consists of poultry.
Livestock ingredients at more than 20% of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that indicate the kind(s) of poultry and species of livestock ingredients, e.g., "Turkey and Beef Frankfurter" or "Frankfurter Made From Turkey and Beef."
Such cooked sausage products which contain livestock ingredients at 20% or less of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that are appropriately qualified to indicate the inclusion of livestock ingredients, e.g., "Turkey Frankfurter - Pork Added or Turkey Frankfurter With Pork.
" (The product names of cooked sausage products which contain no livestock ingredients designate the kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g., "Turkey Frankfurter.")
Cooked sausage products containing over 50% meat ingredients would carry the red meat legend while those containing over 50% poultry ingredients would carry the poultry legend.
See: Policy Memo 087A regarding word size in the labeling of product names.
See: Policy Memo 005A dated November 25, 1987 NOODLE CHICKEN VEGETABLE DINNER OR NOODLE CHICKEN DINNER WITH VEGETABLES: (Canned or in glass jars).
Product must contain at least 6% cooked chicken.
NUGGET LABELING: Nuggets are irregularly shaped, usually bite-sized meat and/or poultry products which are usually breaded and deep fat fried and intended to be used as finger foods.
There are a number of different types of nuggets, the labeling for which is: (1) Products made from a solid piece of meat or poultry may use the term "Nugget" as part of the product name without further qualification (e.g., "Chicken Nugget," "Beef Nugget").
(2) Products made from chopped and formed meat or poultry may use the term "Nugget" as part of the product name, provided a qualifying statement describing such process is shown contiguous to the product name (e.g., "Chicken Nugget, Chopped and Formed" or "Beef Nugget, Chopped and Formed").
(3) Products made from chopped meat or poultry and containing binders, extenders and/or water may use the term "Nugget" as a fanciful name, provided a descriptive name immediately follows "Species" or "Kind" nugget (e.g., "Breaded Nugget-Shaped Chicken Patties").
107
(4) Products described in (1), (2), and (3) above which are breaded shall be labeled as "breaded" and shall be limited to 30% breading.
See: Policy Memo 088 dated May 23, 1985 OAT FIBER: "Oat fiber," should be identified in the ingredients statement as "isolated oat product."
It may be used in non-standardized products and in products, such as, "taco fillings."
OLEOMARGARINE: The Establishment Number may be omitted from the outer container, provided that articles are completely labeled including Establishment Number inside.
See: 9 CFR 317.2(i) OMELET, DENVER OR WESTERN STYLE: Product must contain at least 18% ham with onions and green and/or red peppers.
OMELET, FLORENTINE: Product must contain at least 9% cooked meat and must contain spinach.

Some local authorities require that packaged foods heated and sold hot from industrial catering vehicles be dated with the day the foods were placed in the warming units (e.g., Tuesday, Friday, etc.).
When assured by the local authorities that the foods are under a rigid local inspection program, the designations may be approved without an explanatory statement as required by the regulations.
To date, only the county of Los Angeles, California, has provided this assurance.
The packing date should be shown on immediate or shipping containers of poultry food products as required by regulations (9 CFR 381.126 and 381.129(c)).
When meat or poultry products are packed and held in freezer storage for later repacking, the explanatory phrase on repacked product should be in terms of "sell by" or "use before."
However, if a "packed on" phrase is desired, the date shown shall be that of the original packing of the product.

See: 9 CFR 317.8(b) (25) 9 CFR 381.120 Enzymes-Proteolytic PAPRIKA: Generally, paprika and/or oleoresin of paprika are not permitted in or on fresh red meat products, fresh ground poultry, or fresh poultry sausage.
They are permitted under the following conditions:
109
1.
In both red meat and poultry products where such ingredients are acceptable and expected, including Italian Sausage, Salisica, Chorizo, Longaniza, and Hungarian Style products.
All requests for additional products should be referred to the Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff to determine their acceptability.
2.
On red meat products where their use does not misrepresent the leanness or freshness, e.g., application to a surface layer of fat and not to the muscle tissue.
However, the name must be appropriately qualified, e.g., "coated with paprika" or "artificially colored."
3.
In or on products where they are expected and the product name discloses this fact, or the product name refers to a component expected to contain the ingredients.
Examples include: "Beef with Barbecue Sauce," "Beef - Barbecue Flavor," "Chicken Paprikash," "Chicken with Orange Sauce," or similar type products.

Water 
The ingredients statement of the pizza topping can be arranged in different ways: a.
Composite e.g., cooked pizza topping [port, water, TVP (...), Seasonings (...)] b. Component, e.g., cooked pizza topping [sausage (pork, water, seasonings (...), TVP (...), water (...)]
119
These parameters do not apply when specific sausage products are governed by other regulations, e.g., Italian Sausage.
In these situations, the specific regulation (i.e., Italian Sausage) dictates the requirements, such as, the amount of water permitted and binders are permitted.

If on the label the manufacturer also elects to display elsewhere the word "Pizza" in exaggerated fashion, the word "Pizza" is not considered in the determination of the size of the letters within the true product name.
See: Policy Memo 087A dated September 16, 1985 PFF (PROTEIN FAT FREE) ADJUSTING FOR USE: Protein Fat Free (PFF) controlled cured pork products with qualifying statements, e.g., "Ham-Water Added," may be used in place of PFF controlled cured pork products without qualifying statements, e.g., Ham, to meet the minimum meat requirements of various products.
However, the amounts of the PFF controlled cured pork products with qualifying statements used will need to be increased.
For example, if a standard requires a certain amount of Ham and a processor wishes to use "Ham-Water Added," a greater amount of the "Ham-Water Added" will be needed to meet the standard.
The magnitude of the additional amount is directly related to the relationship between the respective PFF values.
See: Policy Memo 093 dated December 16, 1985 Example: Ham Salad requires 35% Cooked Ham.
"Ham Water Added" will be used in the product formula.
Calculation: Multiply the PFF value for Ham (20.5) by the amount of required Ham (35%).
Divide this answer by the PFF value of the product being used to formulate the product.
(In this example, PFF value for "Ham-Water Added" is 17.0.)
Answer: [(0.35 x 20.5) / 17.0] x 100 = 42.21% "Ham-Water Added" needed in the formula.
120
Example: Ham Pie requires 25% Ham based on green weight.
"Ham with Natural Juices" will be used in the product formula.
Calculation: Multiply the PFF value for Ham (20.5) by the amount of required ham (25%).
Divide this answer by the PFF value of the product being used to formulate the product.
(In this example, PFF value for "Ham with Natural Juices" is 18.5.)
Answer: [(0.25 x 20.5) / 18.5] x 100 = 27.70% "Ham with Natural Juices" needed in the formula.
ADJUSTING FOR "HAM AND WATER PRODUCT X% OF THE WEIGHT IS ADDED INGREDIENTS."
Consider a formulated product which is required to contain at least 50% Cooked Ham.
If the processor chooses to use a "Ham and Water Product (HWP)" in which 20% of the weight is added ingredients as the source of the Ham in the formulation, this product contains 80% Ham and 20% added ingredients.
Clearly, the processor must use more than 50% HWP in the process.
Using 50% HWP would result in only 40% Ham in the finished product, i.e., the added ingredients in the HWP represents 25% of the ham content.
(If it were a 10 lb. HWP, there would be 8 lbs. of Ham and 2 lbs. of added ingredients.
(2 / 8 x 100 = 25%).
Consequently, an additional 25% of HWP is required in the formulation.
The following example may be used to determine the percentage HWP needed to equal Ham: Ham and Gravy requires 50% Cooked Ham.
"Ham and Water Product 20% of Weight is Added Ingredients" will be used in the formulation.
Step 1: Step 2: Step 3: Subtract the % added ingredients from 100%.
In this example: 1.00 - 0.20 = 0.80) Determine the amount of Ham needed in the formula.
(In this example: 50%) Divide the amount of Ham required.
Determined in Step 2) by the answer in Step 1 (In this example: (0.50 / 0.80 = 0.625) Multiply the answer in Step 3 by 100.
Answer for this example is 62.50% "Ham and 20% Water Product" is needed as the equivalent of 50% Ham.
Step 4: PLANTATION:
The regulations and policies applicable to "Farm" also apply to plantation.
121
POINT OF PURCHASE MATERIALS: Point of purchase materials which refer to specific meat or poultry products are considered labeling under certain circumstances.
When printed and/or graphic informational materials (e.g., pamphlets, brochures, posters, etc.) accompany or are applied to products or any of their containers or wrappers at the point of purchase, such materials and the claims that they bear are deemed labeling and they are subject to the provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.
Although the Food Labeling Division (FLD) does not exercise its authority to subject point of purchase materials to specific prior approval (materials shipped with the products from the federally inspected establishment are an exception), we do expect point of purchase materials to be in accordance with the Federal regulations and all current labeling policies.
Upon request, FLD will review and comment on the point of purchase materials submitted to our office.
During the review process, promotional materials will be scrutinized for special claims, particularly those related to nutrition, diet, and animal husbandry practices.
Claims related to nutrition and diet must be made in accordance with all current nutrition labeling regulations.
Continuing compliance with stated claims will be assured through periodic sampling, as necessary.
Claims are expected to be within the compliance parameters identified in the nutrition labeling regulations.
Animal husbandry claims (e.g., the nonuse of antibiotics or growth stimulants) may be made only for products shipped in containers or wrappers labeled with the same animal production claims.
See: Policy Memo 114A dated August 18, 1994 POLISH SAUSAGE: A sausage that is cured, cooked, and usually smoked.

PORK AND DRESSING WITH GRAVY: Product must contain at least 30% pork.
PORK CRACKLINGS: Product eligible to be labeled as "Pork Cracklings" must be prepared from fatty tissues from which the skin has been detached.
If the skin is not removed from the product before rendering, a descriptive name, e.g., "Pork Cracklings, Fried-Out Pork Fat with Attached Skin," must be used.
PORK FAT: Pork fat shall be declared as such in the ingredients statement.
Clear fatbacks and clear shoulder plates must be declared as "Pork Fat."
Pork fat may be declared as pork in the ingredients statement if it contains visible lean and it is used in a standardized product which has a fat limitation.
PORK JOWLS: Product may be declared as pork if skinned.
See: Pork Skins PORK SAUSAGE:
123
Product identified as pork sausage does not include the use of pork cheeks.
When such an item is offered as "Whole Hog," tongues, hearts, and cheeks may be used in the natural proportion as found in the hog carcass.
"Fresh" shall be used in the name when the product is not cured, cooked and/or smoked.
PORK SKIN RESIDUE AFTER GELATIN EXTRACTION: This material consists of back fat skins from which the gelatin has been extracted by means of soaking the skin in acid and subsequent low temperature cooking for the extraction of gelatin.
It is not permitted in sausage but may be used in imitation sausage, potted meat food product, loaves (other than meat loaves), and other nonspecific products.
PORK SKINS: Not permitted in salami, bologna, frankfurters, Vienna sausage, and braunschweiger.
When packed in vinegar pickle, they are not permitted to be artificially colored.
When pork skin, either attached to fat and/or muscle tissue or detached from fat and/or muscle tissue, is used to manufacture meat or poultry products, it must be specifically listed in the formulation on the label approval application form and in the ingredients statement on the label, e.g., "Pork Skins," Unskinned Pork Jowls," "Unskinned Pork Shoulder Trimming," "Unskinned Pork Fat," and "Unskinned Pork Bellies."
"Detached skin" refers to the portion of skin from which most of the underlying fat is removed, e.g., skin from bacon intended for slicing, skin from closely skinned hams, shoulder cuts, fat backs, etc.
If removal of skin portions is incidental to removal of a considerable proportion of underlying fat from ham, shoulder, back, etc., preparatory to rendering such fat, portions of skin so removed should not be regarded as detached skin and may be included with fats and rendered into lard.
Ham facings are not regarded as detached skin.
PORK SKINS, FRIED: When prepared from the skin of smoked pork bellies, it may be labeled as "Fried Bacon Skins," "Fried Bacon Rinds," or "Fried Pork Skins."
The kind of skin used must be stated on the labeling records when submitted for label approvals.
PORK SPARE RIBS, CENTER CUT: Center cut pork spare ribs (brisket must be removed cartilages), the tail and two may be further portioned or refers to pork spare ribs with the loin portion, the brisket at a point which is dorsal to the curvature of the costal ribs from the shoulder removed, this remaining center section left in one piece.

Product labeled "Boneless Breast" without further qualification may not contain scapula or rib meat.
POULTRY FRANKFURTERS (SIMILAR COOKED SAUSAGES): Products which contain pork fat must be labeled with pork fat added in the product name.
POULTRY GRADING: (LABELING) Indicates the quality grades of poultry (U.S. grade A, B, or C).
The shield design contains the letters "USDA," the U.S. grade of the product, and if not shown elsewhere, the class of poultry.
Any letter grade on a consumer package or individual carcass indicates the product was graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State 128
grading service, and may not be applied otherwise.
Letter grades on bulk packaging or shipping containers only indicate that the product is equal to that particular U.S. Grade.
A. APPLYING GRADEMARKS TO SHIPPING CONTAINERS
All poultry classes and kinds listed in 9 CFR 381.170, except necks, giblets, detached tails, wing tips, skin and stripped backs (below Grade C) are eligible for grading.
In addition, the following poultry parts may be officially graded: Boneless, Skinless Breast and Thigh Tenderloin or Boneless Breast without Tenderloin Boneless Breast Quarters Breast Quarters with Bone in Boneless Thigh Halves Wing Portion or Section Breast Halves Broiler Turkey or Duck Halves Split Breast Split Fryers Skinless, bone-in Thighs, Drums and Breasts Boneless Breast, Thigh Bone-in products marinated in a colorless solution Poultry cuts other than those identified above may not be eligible for grading; therefore, particular attention should be given to the product name when approving labels for various poultry products which include grade marks (e.g., "Thin Breast Fillets, Thigh Strips").
Grade marks on raw poultry parts processed with solutions that may impart color (e.g., injected with a solution of water, salt, butter) or cooked poultry products must include a statement, e.g., "Prepared from Grade A Poultry."
The USDA grader in the plant makes the final determination concerning the necessity of the "Prepared from" statement in situations where it is not apparent at the time of label approval that the added solutions have the ability to impart color to the finished poultry product.
Products which may not be grade marked: Detached Necks Giblets Packed Separately Detached Tails Wings Tips Stripped Backs Below C Quality Diced or Shredded Meat B. WING DESCRIPTION
129
The wing is made up of three sections.
The section attached to the carcass is the first section.
The wing tip is the third section.
C. GRADING BACKS WITH NECKS In applying grade standards, when necks are packed with backs following these steps: 1.
When backs are graded as provided for in the standards, the name of the product shall read as follows: a.
Grade A Backs "with necks," or "and necks." b. Grade B Backs "with necks," or "and necks." c. Grade C Backs "with necks," "Graded backs and necks," or "backs and necks."
2.
3.
Necks are to be packed with backs in natural proportions.
Necks may or may not be attached to backs.
Necks for all officially graded backs are to be free from serious discolorations, feathers, pin feathers, and accumulations of blood and/or excess water.
4.
A neck, front, or hind portion of back, when removed from birds which meet the stated quality, may be used to achieve exact weights.
Only one of these portions may be used per package.
Scraps of backs or necks may not be used.
5.
Labels for packages with portions must indicate which portions, e.g., first (1st) portion, 2nd portion, 1st and 2nd portions, 2nd and 3rd portions, etc.
D. PRESSURE SENSITIVE STICKERS AND TAPE: 1.
Inserts or pressure sensitive stickers with the grademark must have plant number.
2.
Grademarks on pressure sensitive tape should not be used on consumer packages.
3.
Insert with the grademarks are not to be used inside opaque bags.
POULTRY HINDQUARTERS: The term "hindquarters" on labels for single cut poultry items is an acceptable alternative to the recognized terminology "Leg Quarter" specified in the regulations.
The use of the term "Hindquarters" requires only a specified class of poultry to be considered a true product name, e.g., "Chicken Hindquarters."
Either term refers to a poultry thigh and drumstick, with a portion of the back attached.
POULTRY HINDSADDLES:
130
Poultry hindsaddles are connected poultry leg quarters (the rear of the bird).
The product name "Poultry Hindsaddles" may be used alone on the product's label if the product is not intended for retail sale.
In contrast, the name "poultry hindsaddles" on the label of a product intended for retail sale must be accompanied by a fully descriptive name (e.g., "Poultry Hindsaddles, Connected Leg Quarters").
POULTRY PARTS: Specific net weight packages for poultry parts, usually those containing legs or wings, include a single part, e.g., a drumstick or thigh, to make the stated weight.
The name on the label must reflect this practice, e.g. "Chicken Legs - Chicken Thigh added to make weight."
The single part must be cut at the joint.
Wing tips are not permitted as added parts.
POULTRY PRODUCTS: In poultry products where "meat" appears in the product name, e.g., "White Meat Chicken Roll," and "Dark Meat Turkey Loaf," skin and attached fat are permitted in greater than natural proporti
