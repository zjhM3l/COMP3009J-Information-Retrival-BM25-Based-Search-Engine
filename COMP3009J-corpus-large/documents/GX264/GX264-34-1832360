CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES BOARD Notice of Intended Regulatory Action Notice is hereby given in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 of the Code of Virginia that the Criminal Justice Services Board intends to consider amending regulations entitled: 6 VAC 20171.
Regulations Relating to Private Security Services.
While all areas of the regulations will be subject to review, the substance of this review will focus on improving the licensing, registration, certification, and training requirements and procedures.
It will also identify possible areas of confusion or weakness that currently may not protect the health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth.
The department will have specific recommendations in the area of the fee schedule and the compulsory minimum training requirements.
The agency intends to hold a public hearing on the proposed regulation after publication in the Virginia Register.
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9.1-141 of the Code of Virginia.
Public comments may be submitted until July 17, 2002, to Lisa Hahn, Department of Criminal Justice Services, 805 East Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23219.

No. R02-182; Filed May 16, 2002, 8:50 a.m.
Commonwealth.
The purpose of this action is to study, in collaboration with the regulated community and the public, appropriate changes to modernize the fee system and the financial assurance requirements.
Any general improvements to the regulations, such as further incorporation of federal regulatory text and replacement of analogous Virginia regulations, and any changes to conform to statutory amendments will also be considered during the process.
In addition, this action will replace emergency regulations authorized by the 2002 General Assembly.
Need: The Virginia Hazardous Waste Management Regulations protect the public health, safety and welfare from harmful results of the mismanagement of hazardous waste by establishing requirements for the effective monitoring of the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste in the Commonwealth.
The current regulations require a study of the fee system each year and revisions to correct for economic inflation of costs.
However, the fees are unchanged since established in 1984.
The structure of the fee system should be made clearer and easier to use to determine the appropriate fees.
In addition, requirements for financial assurance may not properly address corrective action or provide sufficient regulatory structure for consistent application.
While considering these issues, it is also appropriate to consider the clarity of the regulations as a whole, statutory changes, and appropriate improvements wherever possible.
Substance: The concept of this amendment is to study improvements to the regulations in collaboration with the regulated community and the public, focusing on a few important areas.
Using the expertise of a technical advisory committee, several alternate approaches will be reviewed and the solutions that are chosen will be the subject of a public comment period and hearing.
Key issues will be highlighted for which the public's opinion is specifically requested.
This action will consider if the fee system in the current regulations continues to be appropriate in its structure and amounts.
Fees were last adjusted in 1984.
Another area to be studied is the provision for providing financial assurance for closure and post-closure care costs, including provision of such assurance for corrective action units.
Statutory changes adopted before the promulgation of proposed regulations will be studied, and, if needed, appropriate regulatory changes will be considered to coordinate with the amended statutes.
Any other general improvements or clarifications of the regulatory text will be considered.
Alternatives: A technical advisory committee will advise the Department of Environmental Quality on what amended regulatory text to recommend to the board as proposed regulations.
This panel will advise the department on less intrusive and less burdensome alternatives, where such exists, and during the public participation process, the public will be asked to suggest less intrusive and burdensome w w TITLE 9.

No. R02-206; Filed June 10, 2002, 10:38 a.m.
The percentage of the permit program supported by fees has steadily decreased since the program's inception.
Modification of the fee schedule is needed to restore consistency in the percentage of funds from permit fees supporting the solid waste program thereby ensuring appropriate funding for the program.
While considering these issues it is appropriate to also consider the clarity of the regulations as a whole, statutory changes, and appropriate improvements wherever possible.
Substance: The concept of the amendment is to study appropriate changes to provide clarification to the regulation, to consolidate the regulations and to update the permit fee system.
Developing the amendment in collaboration with the regulated community and the public through a technical advisory committee will provide the opportunity to draw on the expertise of these groups.
Alternative approaches will be discussed during the development of the regulation, and the alternative chosen will be subject to public comment during the public comment period and public hearings.
Key issues will be highlighted and the public's opinion is specifically requested.
This action will consider if the fee system in the regulations continues to be appropriate in its structure and amounts.
Fees were last adjusted in 1992.
Alternatives: A technical advisory committee will advise the Department of Environmental Quality on what amended regulatory text to recommend to the board as proposed regulations.
This panel will advise the department on less intrusive and less burdensome alternatives, where such exists, and during the public participation process the public will be asked to suggest less intrusive and burdensome alternatives.
No action alternatives have been considered or rejected.
Public Participation: The board is seeking comments on the intended regulatory action, including (i) ideas to assist in the development of a proposal, (ii) the costs and benefits of the alternatives stated in this notice or other alternatives, and (iii) impacts of the regulation on farm or forest lands.
Anyone wishing to submit written comments for the public comment file may do so at the public meeting, by mail, or by email to Michael J. Dieter, Department of Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 10009, Richmond, Virginia 23240, mjdieter@deq.state.va.us.
Written comments must include the name and address of the commenter.
In order to be considered, comments must be received by the close of the comment period.

Notice of Intended Regulatory Action Notice is hereby given in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 of the Code of Virginia that the Virginia Waste Management Board intends to consider amending regulations entitled: 9 VAC 2090.
Solid Waste Management Facility Permit Application Fees.
The purpose of the proposed action is to increase fees for solid waste management facilities.
Purpose: The Virginia Waste Management Board's Solid Waste Management Facility Permit Application Fee Regulation, 9 VAC 20-90, establishes procedures pertaining to the payment and collection of and the amount of fees from any applicant seeking a new permit or seeking a modification to an exiting permit for the construction and operation of a solid or regulated medical waste management facility.
The purpose of this action is to study, in collaboration with the regulated community and the public, appropriate changes to provide clarification to the regulations, to consolidate the regulations and to update the permit fee system.
In addition, this action will replace emergency regulations authorized by the 2002 General Assembly.
Need: The current permit fee schedule has not been updated since June 8, 1992.
In accordance with the requirements of the regulations, the fee schedule is to be evaluated annually (9 VAC 20-90-70 B) and results of the evaluations provided to the Waste Management Board, with recommendations for adjustments to the fee.

STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD Notice of Intended Regulatory Action Notice is hereby given in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 of the Code of Virginia that the State Water Control Board intends to consider amending regulations entitled: 9 VAC 25-20.
Fees for Permits and Certificates.
The purpose of the proposed action is to increase the fees charged for processing applications for permits and certificates issued by the State Water Control Board.
Purpose: Section 62.1-44.15:6 of the Code of Virginia requires the promulgation of regulations establishing a fee assessment and collection system to recover a portion of the direct and indirect costs incurred by the State Water Control Board, Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and Department of Conservation and Recreation that are associated with the processing of an application to issue, reissue, or modify any permit or certificate that the State Water Control Board has the authority to issue from the applicant for such permit or certificate.
These regulations establish the required fee assessment and collection system.
The General Assembly of Virginia amended and enacted revisions to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15:6 of the Code of Virginia increasing the maximum allowable amounts for processing each type of permit/certificate category.
The proposed amendment will revise the fee schedules in 9 VAC 25-20 to reflect the revisions in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15:6 of the Code of Virginia.
Need: Fees for permits and certificates are authorized to recover, up to the maximums specified in statute, the direct and indirect costs associated with application review and permit or certificate issuance.
The required January 2002 Permit Fee Program Evaluation Report to the General Assembly indicates that in fiscal year 2001 actual water permit program costs exceeded $10.6 million, whereas permit fee revenues were only slightly above $1 million.
One issue that will need to be addressed as the regulation is developed is that the Acts of Assembly include a clause that the provisions of the act shall expire on July 1, 2004.
Substance: The regulation would be revised to reflect the changes in maximum amounts as specified in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15:6 of the Code of Virginia.
In addition, changes may be considered based on public comment in response to this NOIRA.
Alternatives: The fee structure recovers a portion of the agencies' costs associated with the permit programs.
The board has not identified alternative regulations that would accomplish the mandate.
Because the legislation specified only the maximum allowable fees, alternatives that the agency will consider in developing the regulation will focus on the specific amount that existing fees should be increased.
Public Participation: The board is seeking comments on the intended regulatory action, including ideas to assist in the development of a proposal and the costs and benefits of the alternatives stated in this notice or other alternatives.
A public meeting will be held and notice of the meeting can be found in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations.
Participatory Approach: The board is using the participatory approach to develop the proposed amendments to the regulation.
Anyone interested in assisting the board during development of a proposal should notify the contact person.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS TITLE 8.
EDUCATION STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Title of Regulation: 8 VAC 20-440.
Regulations the Employment of Professional Personnel 8 VAC 20-440-10, 8 VAC 20-440-90, 8 VAC 8 VAC 20-440-120, 8 VAC 20-440-140, 8 VAC and 8 VAC 20-440-160).
Governing (amending 20-440-110, 20-440-150, will have the information it needs to make a fair decision on the disposition of the license and thereby protects the board from any appearance of giving unequal treatment.
Substance: The proposed amendments incorporate language to reflect amendments to the Code of Virginia, amend the language to assist school boards in establishing consequences for breach of contract, and add language allowing the Board of Education to require a written report or an appearance of an appropriate representative when a petition for breach is filed.
Issues: Recruiting and retaining a high quality teaching force is essential to high student achievement.
Department of Education surveys during the past few years have shown that the majority of teachers leaving a school division (turnover rate) do so to accept employment in another school division in the state.
While the majority of the moving teachers do not break their contracts in order to accept employment in another division, local officials are experiencing increasing problems with breach of contract.
Appropriate and quick action on the part of the school division is in the best interest of the community and in the stability of the educational program.
The advantage of the proposed amendments is to provide flexibility to local divisions in handling breach of contract matters.
In instances where teachers break their contracts, the division will be able to issue a sanction (or reprimand, as deemed appropriate) at the local level, if that is the way the division wishes to handle the matter.
However, the proposed provisions do not prohibit a division from appealing to the Board of Education for a suspension of the teacher's license.
There are no advantages or disadvantages to the general public or to the agency.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98).
Section 2.2-4007 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
The Board of Education (state board) proposes several amendments for clarification and to conform these regulations with changes to the Code of Virginia.
In addition, the state board proposes to allow itself to require a written report and/or request a representative from the hiring school board to appear when the state board Monday, July 1, 2002 2717 Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-16 and 22.1-302 of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: July 25, 2002 - 2 p.m.
Public comments may be submitted until September 2, 2002.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Agency Contact: Dr. Thomas Elliott, Assistant Superintendent, Department of Education, P.O. Box 2120, Richmond, VA 23218, telephone (804) 225-2924, FAX (804) 225-2524 or email telliott@mail.vak12ed.edu.
Basis: Section 22.1-16 of the Code of Virginia authorizes the Board of Education to promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out its powers and duties and the provisions of Title 22.1 of the Code of Virginia.
Section 22.1-302 of the Code of Virginia authorizes the board to prescribe forms for written contracts with teachers.
Purpose: The primary purpose of the proposed amendments is to ensure that the provisions of the regulation are consistent with Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-302 through 22.1-305 of the Code of Virginia and to provide clarifying language that will assist local school divisions in establishing consequences for breach of contract.
Therefore, the proposed amendments will have a positive impact on the welfare of teachers and on the local divisions that employ them.
Under current regulations, the primary action that a school board may take against a teacher for breach of contract is to appeal to the Board of Education for a suspension of the teacher's license, which in effect denies the teacher the ability to teach in a public school anywhere in Virginia - a serious impact on the teacher's welfare (e.g., employment status).
The proposed amendments, in giving more flexibility to local boards in handling personnel matters, provide protections to the local board that wishes to develop and implement such policies that do not involve the serious action of suspending the teacher's license.
The proposed revisions do not eliminate the local board's ability to appeal to the Board of Education for a suspension (as provided in the current regulation).
In addition, the proposed revision gives the Board of Education the important option, in its view, of requiring a written report and/or a representative when that division is requesting action on the teacher's license.
This option ensures that the board Volume 18, Issue 21 Proposed Regulations receives a petition from a local school board for action on the license of a teacher who has breached his present contract by accepting a contract with another school board.
Estimated economic impact.
Pursuant to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-304 of the Code of Virginia and these regulations, the state board may choose to suspend a teacher's license if that teacher has breached his contract without good cause.
According to the Department of Education, this is a relatively rare occurrence; in a typical year the state board suspends no licenses due to breach of contract.
If the state board receives a petition from a local school board for action on the license of a teacher who has breached his present contract by accepting a contract with another school board within the Commonwealth, under the proposed language the state board may require a written report and/or request an appropriate representative from the hiring school board to appear before the state board to explain the circumstances that led to the hiring decision before the state board considers any petition action on the license of such teacher.
Since the board may already request information from local school boards, the proposed language will not likely significantly affect the rare occurrences when a teacher's license is suspended due to breach of contract.
Businesses and entities affected.
The proposed amendments potentially affect the approximately 175,0001 classroom teachers, guidance counselors, principals, assistant principals, school psychologists, and central office staff in Virginia's public school divisions.
Localities particularly affected.
The proposed amendments affect all localities in the Commonwealth.
Projected impact on employment.
The proposed amendments are unlikely to have a significant impact on employment.
Effects on the use and value of private property.
The proposed amendments are unlikely to significantly affect the use and value of private property.
Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The agency concurs with the economic impact analysis issued by the Department of Planning and Budget.
Summary: The proposed amendments (i) conform the regulation with provisions in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-302 that require school boards to provide separate written contracts for teachers responsible for an extracurricular activity sponsorships; (ii) conform the regulation with amendments to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-303 that require teachers hired after July 1, 2001, to successfully complete training in instructional strategies and techniques for intervention for or remediation of students who fail or are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments; (iii) clarify beginning and ending dates for each phase of the three-phase employment process for any school division permitted by Ã¯Â¿Â½ 22.1-304 of the Code of Virginia to extend the written notice of noncontinuation of contract to May 15; (iv) allow school boards to take actions for breach of contract other than requesting a suspension of license; and (v) provide that the board may require a written report or an appearance of an appropriate representative when a petition for breach is filed, or both.

Public comments may be submitted until 5 p.m. on August 30, 2002.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Agency Contact: Michael Gregory, Department of Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 10009, Richmond, VA 23240, telephone (804) 698-4065, FAX (804) 698-4032 or email mbgregory@deq.state.va.us.
Basis: Section 62.1-44.15(5) of the Code of Virginia authorizes the board to issue permits for the discharge of treated sewage, industrial wastes or other waste into or adjacent to state waters and Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15(7) authorizes the board to adopt rules governing the procedures of the board with respect to the issuance of permits.
Further, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15(10) authorizes the board to adopt such regulations as it deems necessary to enforce the general water quality management program, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15(14) authorizes the board to establish requirements for the treatment of sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.16 specifies the board's authority to regulate discharges of industrial wastes, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.20 provides that agents of the board may have the right of entry to public or private property for the purpose of obtaining information or conducting necessary surveys or investigations, and Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.21 authorizes the board to require owners to furnish information necessary to determine the effect of the wastes from a discharge on the quality of state waters.
Section 402 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) authorizes states to administer the NPDES permit program under state law.
The Commonwealth of Virginia received such authorization in 1975 under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. EPA.
This Memorandum of Understanding was modified on May 20, 1991, to authorize the Commonwealth to administer a General VPDES Permit Program.
The Office of the Attorney General has certified that the agency has the statutory authority to promulgate the proposed regulation and that it comports with applicable state and/or federal law.
Purpose: This regulatory action is proposed in order to reissue the existing general permit, which expires on March 5, 2003.
Substance: The general permit will establish limitations and monitoring requirements for point source discharges from fish farms and other aquatic animal production facilities.
As with an individual VPDES permit, the effluent limits in the general permit will be set to protect the quality of the waters receiving the discharges.
No significant changes to the existing general permit have been identified at this time.
Issues: The primary advantage of this regulatory action to the public and to the agency is the continuation of a general permit, which provides a simpler option for obtaining VPDES permit coverage where appropriate.
There are no disadvantages to the public or to the Commonwealth.
Summary: The purpose of the proposed amendments is to reissue the general permit for another five-year term.
The reissued general permit will replace current General Permit VAG13, which will expire on March 5, 2003.
The existing regulation sets forth guidelines for the permitting of wastewater discharges from fish farms and hatcheries and establishes limitations and monitoring requirements for flow, total suspended solids and settleable solids.
The regulation also sets forth the minimum information requirements for all requests for coverage under the general permit.
No significant changes to the existing regulation are proposed in this regulatory action.

Basis: Section 54.1-113 of the Code of Virginia authorizes the board to revise fees for certification or licensure and renewal so that the fees are sufficient but not excessive to cover expenses.
Section 54.1-201 of the Code of Virginia describes each regulatory board's power and duty to "levy and collect fees for the certification or licensure and renewal that are sufficient to cover all expenses for the administration and operation of the regulatory board and a proportionate share of the expenses of the Department..."
Purpose: The purpose of the proposed changes is to increase licensing fees for regulants of the Board for Contractors.
The board must establish fees adequate to support the costs of board operations and a proportionate share of the department's operations.
By the close of the current biennium, fees will not provide adequate revenue for those costs.
The Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation receives no general fund money, but instead is funded almost entirely from revenue collected for license applications, renewals, examination fees, and other licensing fees.
The department is self-supporting and must collect adequate revenue to support its mandated and approved activities and operations.
Fees must be established at amounts that will provide that revenue.
Fee revenues collected on behalf of the boards fund the department's authorized special revenue appropriation.
The proposed increase in fees is necessary in order to maintain the level of protection currently provided by the Board for Contractors.
The enforcement of the statutes and regulations increases the level of public safety and welfare by ensuring that fraudulent and unscrupulous contractors are disciplined quickly and efficiently.
The ability of the board to continue to process applications in a timely and accurate manner increases the level of public safety and welfare by ensuring that only those applicants that meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the statutes and regulations are granted licenses.
Substance: The existing regulations are amended to increase fees associated with the licensing and certification of regulants of the Board of Contractors.
Issues: The Callahan Act requires DPOR to review each board's expenditures at the close of each biennium and to Volume 18, Issue 21 2747 adjust fees if necessary.
The Board for Contractors closed the 1998-00 biennium with a Callahan Act percentage of 18.2% and a cash balance of $1,096,718.
However, by the close of the 2000-02 biennium, the board is expected to incur a deficit of $571,582 and a Callahan Act percentage of 8%.
Once the board exhausts its cash balance and begins fully using its current revenues, there will be no additional source of revenue to pay its ongoing operating expenses other than to borrow from the cash balances of other boards.
Because the Board for Contractors is the department's largest board, those cash balances could not support its operations for more than a few months, and would only delay the need for fee increases briefly.
Any amounts borrowed from other boards would have to be repaid and would result in even larger increases in proposed fees in order to repay the deficit.
The regulatory review process generally takes a minimum of 18 months, and so it is essential to consider fee increases now, before the deficit is actually incurred.
To avoid the upcoming deficit and the need to increase fees to more than needed for ongoing operations, the new fees will need to become effective by the beginning of the 2002-04 biennium.
Otherwise, the board's deficit will increase and the new fees may be inadequate to provide sufficient revenue for upcoming operating cycles, which could result in the board having to consider additional fee increases in the near future.
The advantage of these changes is that the regulatory program will be able to continue to function in order to protect the public.
The disadvantage is that these changes will increase the cost of the license to the regulated population; however, the impact of these changes on the income of the regulated population should not be of a great significance compared to level of income.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98).
Section 2.2-4007 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
The Board of Contractors proposes to raise licensing fees.
Estimated economic impact.
The Board of Contractors (board) attempts to approximately match revenues from fee collection with expenses.
The Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR) expects that the board's revenues for the 2000-02 biennium will finish at 8.0 percent less than expenses.
The board proposes to raise fees for licenses under the Board for Contractors Rules and Regulations and the Board for Contractors Tradesman Rules and Regulations in order to approximately match their Monday, July 1, 2002 Proposed Regulations expenses.
The board proposes to raise fees by the following amounts: Contractors Class C Initial License: increase from $65 to $125 Class C License Renewal: increase from $50 to $100 Class C License Reinstatement: increase from $140 to $225 Class B Initial License: increase from $85 to $150 Class B License Renewal: increase from $70 to $135 Class B License Reinstatement: increase from $170 to $285 Class A Initial License: increase from $100 to $175 Class A License Renewal: increase from $90 to $150 Class A License Reinstatement: increase from $190 to $325 Change a Designated Employee or Qualified Individual: increase from $25 to $30 Additional Classification or Specialty Designation: increase from $25 to $30 Tradesmen Tradesman Initial License: increase from $40 to $75 Tradesman License Renewal: increase from $25 to $35 Tradesman License Reinstatement: $50 to $75 Tradesman Card Exchange Application and Processing: increase from $10 to $20 Backflow Prevention Device Worker Certification Card Exchange Application and Processing: increase from $10 to $20 Backflow Prevention Device Worker Certification Card Renewal: increase from $25 to $35 Backflow Prevention Device Worker Certification Card Reinstatement: increase from $50 to $75 Duplicate Card, First Request: increase from $10 to $30 Duplicate Card, Second Request: increase from $20 to $30 Duplicate Card, First Request: increase from $40 to $45 Additional Trade Designation: increase from $25 to $30 A major factor in the increase in expenses relative to fees collected is a projected 31% increase in enforcement costs from the 1998-00 biennium to the 2000-02 biennium.
DPOR attributes much of this increase to improved public awareness of the agency's enforcement role, leading to increased reporting of unscrupulous behavior by contractors and tradesmen.
Increased enforcement can increase public welfare by reducing the incidence of fraud and substandard workmanship encountered by the public.
Unscrupulous contractors and tradesmen may lose their licenses and as the increase in enforcement becomes better known, some potentially unscrupulous contractors or tradesmen may refrain from unscrupulous behavior because of increased fear of being caught.
If customers of contractors and tradesmen become significantly less likely to encounter substandard work or fraudulent financial practices due to the increased enforcement, then perhaps the benefit of increased enforcement will exceed the cost of higher licensing fees for contractors and tradesmen.
Businesses and entities affected.
The proposed regulations affect the 47,4751 contractors and 29,9002 tradesmen licensed in Virginia.
Localities particularly affected.
The proposed increase licensing fees affect contractors and tradesmen throughout the Commonwealth.
Projected impact on employment.
The proposed rise in licensing fees increases the cost of doing business.
The increased cost of doing business may make a small number of potential projects no longer profitable.
Thus, the increase in fees may have a small negative impact on employment.
Effects on the use and value of private property.
The proposed fee increases will slightly decrease the value of contractors and tradesmen's businesses.
Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: Concur.
Summary: The proposed amendments increase licensing and certification fees for regulants of the Board for Contractors.

Basis: Section 54.1-2400 of the Code of Virginia establishes the general powers and duties of health regulatory boards including the responsibility to promulgate regulations, levy fees, administer a licensure and renewal program, and discipline regulated professionals.
Monday, July 1, 2002 Proposed Regulations Section 54.1-103 of the Code of Virginia authorizes health regulatory boards to impose additional requirements on certificate holders seeking renewal.
Chapter 30 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.1-3000 et seq.) of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia authorizes the Board of Nursing to regulate massage therapists.
Purpose: The purpose of the amended regulation is to clearly state in regulation the qualifications necessary for a person to become certified as a massage therapist and the requirements necessary to demonstrate continuing competency.
The qualifications for initial certification are set forth in the Code of Virginia, but the board determined that persons practicing massage therapy are still uncertain or unaware of the need to be certified.
Therefore, it is proposed that the requirements be specified in regulation and that the provisions for "grandfathering" be deleted since those avenues to certification expired in June of 1998.
It has not been required for certification by endorsement that applicants have credentials substantially equivalent to those required in Virginia.
Without such a regulation, the board had no criteria on which to base a decision on endorsement, so it was possible for less qualified individuals to become certified in Virginia.
To assure the public that massage therapy is being delivered ethically and competently by persons certified by the board, regulations must consistently provide minimal education and examination standards.
As an emerging profession, massage therapy is being utilized more and more for therapeutic purposes to alleviate the symptoms of disease or injury.
Patients are seeking relief from symptoms of fibromyalgia, cancer, arthritis and other conditions.
It is essential for public safety for massage therapists to remain current in their knowledge and technique to appropriately treat consumers and to be able to recognize the indications that a person should be referred to a health care practitioner.
Virginia requires only 500 hours of education for certification whereas some states have adopted 1,000 hours as the minimum requirement.
In addition, many massage therapists were initially certified under a "grandfather" provision that required only 200 hours of training and practice or 20 hours of training and at least 10 years of practice prior to July 1, 1997.
Since the initial education of a certified massage therapist may have been minimal, the Massage Therapy Advisory Committee with the board's concurrence recommended some evidence of continuing competency for renewal of certification as means of protecting the public health and safety.
Substance: Amendments specify in regulation the qualifications for certification that are currently in the Code of Virginia and delete the provisions for "grandfathering" that are no longer applicable.
The amendments clarify that to be certified by endorsement, a massage therapist must have met requirements substantially equivalent to those in Virginia.
An unnecessary section on provisional certification is repealed.
If a person practices massage therapy without using the designation of "massage therapist" or "certified massage therapist, " he may do so without certification by the board; so there is no need for provisional certification.
The board proposes as a condition of renewal that massage therapists demonstrate evidence of continuing competency by holding current certification from the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, the credentialing body for the profession, or complete at least 25 hours of continuing education or learning activities within the biennium.
Finally, the Standards of Practice and the Code of Ethics of the NCBTMB are incorporated by reference into this chapter.
Issues: Issues in the regulation of massage therapists and the alternatives to dealing with those issues were addressed by the Massage Therapy Advisory Committee and the board as follows: 1.
Limitations of certification.
The major issue for massage therapy in Virginia involves the potential risk to the public of massage therapy services being delivered by persons with little or no training and no regulatory oversight.
Legislation passed in 1997 instituted a certification program with title protection for "massage therapist" or "certified massage therapist."
Certification does not ensure that an insufficiently trained person cannot perform the service; it only protects the use of certain titles.
Therefore, experience has shown that persons with considerably less training have adopted other titles, such as "massage therapy practitioner" and are engaged in practicing massage therapy on the public.
There were a number of alternatives discussed by the committee, none of which involve a change in regulations since this is primarily a statutory issue.
Without a change in the Code, the board has no authority to restrict the practice of massage therapy to only those persons it certifies.
The Code would need to be amended to provide for licensure or mandatory certification for the practice of massage therapy, as it is currently defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.1-3000 of the Code of Virginia.
A legislative initiative is not being recommended by the Board of Nursing at this time, but may be undertaken by other interested parties.
In addition, massage therapists are working with the localities to restrict the practice of massage therapy to those persons who hold certification from the Board of Nursing.
That has already occurred in the City of Richmond, and the effort to expand those restrictions is underway.
2.
Continuing competency requirements.
Comments received on the periodic review raised the issue of continuing competency for practitioners.
Massage therapists, as with other health care practitioners, need to learn new information and techniques in order to remain minimally competent to treat the public.
Massage therapists benefit from learning experiences that improve their skills, further their knowledge about the clinical indicators that suggest a referral to a physician, and remind them of ethical dilemmas.
In the opinion of the advisory committee and others in the profession, the basic 500-hour course required for certification is not adequate to ensure that a practitioner continues to be competent throughout his profession.
Alternatives discussed include: a.
Continued certification or recertification by the national certifying body, the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork.
Continued certification requires 50 hours of continuing education, Virginia Register of Regulations 2752 Proposed Regulations both approved and nonapproved courses, over a fouryear period.
b. Hours of continuing education similar to that required by the certifying agency or 25 hours for each biennial renewal cycle.
A further issue with this alternative would be the determination of approved courses.
To avoid having the board become the accrediting body for all continuing education in massage therapy, regulations would need drafted to recognize the NCBTMB or other credentialing bodies.
c.
Other types of learning experiences or requirements that would provide some assurance that certified massage therapists continue to be minimally competent.
That could include practical experience, re-examination, or self-directed learning.
It was suggested that NCBMTB recertification be the standard for demonstrating continuing competency, but the board determined that other alternatives must be available for those who had allowed their national certification to lapse or had been initially certified by the board without NCBMTB certification.
Based on review of the requirements of NCBMTB, the board determined that a combination of the alternatives was the most reasonable and least burdensome approach.
Regulations offer the massage therapist a variety of options including recertification by either retesting or acquiring continuing education or participation in approved and nonapproved CE courses or activities.
3.
Type and amount of continuing competency requirements.
It was suggested during comment on the regulations that the board adopt one standard for demonstrating continuing competency for those who held NCBMTB certification and another standard for those who were certified with lesser credentials during the "grandfathering" period prior to 1998.
Such a differential standard would be impossible to enforce without tagging the records of all certified therapists with some indication of their credentials for certification.
That methodology has never been adopted by the board and would discriminate against those who are legitimately certified, albeit by a less stringent standard.
Therefore, the board chose to offer options for recertification or CE, based on what the practitioner determines is the most advantageous method for maintaining his skills and competencies.
The massage therapist who holds national certification by NCBTMB may choose to maintain that certification that would suffice to demonstrate continued competency for renewal of a Virginia certificate.
He may do so by acquiring 50 hours of CE over a four-year period - half in Category A from approved sponsors and half in Category B from nonapproved sponsors.
He also has the option of being recertified by NCBTMB by retesting to determine currency in massage technique and knowledge.
For those who do not want to recertify with NCBTMB, the board requires 25 hours divided into two types: (i) in Category A continuing learning activities, the 12.5 hours required biennially must be offered by a sponsor or organization that is sanctioned by the NCBTMB and that Volume 18, Issue 21 2753 provides documentation of hours to the practitioner; and (ii) in Category B continuing learning activities, a maximum of 12.5 hours earned biennially may or may not be offered by an approved sponsor or organization but must be activities that expand the skills and knowledge related to the clinical practice of massage therapy; certificate holders document and record their own participation.
Examples of Category A activities would be conferences, workshops, home study, video or computer programs with a required examination.
Category B activities may include formal programs by nonapproved sponsors, teaching or authoring an article.
The NCBTMB requires two hours of professional ethics during each four-year certification period.
The board believes that ethical principles are essential for public health and safety in the practice of massage therapy.
Topics such as boundary issues, client confidentiality, and legal guidelines are accepted for hours in ethics and may be incorporated into other courses, provided there is documentation from the provider stating the amount of time that was devoted to the topic.
Advantages to massage therapists.
The proposed continuing competency requirements are intended to provide some assurance to the public that certified massage therapists are maintaining current knowledge and skills, while providing the maximum amount of flexibility and availability to certificate holders.
Massage therapists believe that many of their colleagues are currently certified by NCBTMB or already engage in enough learning activities to meet the requirements and should only have to maintain documentation of those activities and hours.
Half of the 25 hours may be earned by the practitioner on his own time and schedule and may be hours that are useful to the therapist but not accredited or documented by an organization.
The resources for earning the hours and engaging in the required learning are numerous and readily available in all parts of Virginia.
Disadvantages to massage therapists.
For those practitioners who do not currently engage in any continuing learning in their profession, these requirements will represent an additional burden.
While opportunities for obtaining continued competencies exist that are at a minimal cost, there will be some additional expense associated with renewal of a certificate.
However, it was determined by enactment of the statute and by the board's concurrence that those practitioners and their patients would greatly benefit from continuing learning requirements, and that the public is better protected if there is some assurance of that effort.
Advantages or disadvantages to the public.
There are definite advantages of the proposed amended regulations to the public, who will have greater assurance that the massage therapists certified by the board are engaged in activities to maintain and improve their knowledge and skills in providing care to their patients.
There are also definite advantages to the public that at least one hour in ethics is required as a part of the continuing education.
That requirement coupled with the Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics incorporated by reference will give the public assurance that persons who hold the title of certified massage therapist have a high standard by which they should conduct their practice.
Monday, July 1, 2002 Proposed Regulations Advantages or disadvantages to the agency.
As with the regulation of other health professions, there is some additional burden for the department in administering a continuing education requirement.
After each renewal cycle, there may be an audit of a percentage of the certificate holders, who will be required to submit documentation of compliance.
Those documents (NCBTMB certification, certificate of completion from a provider, or transcript from a massage therapy education program) must be reviewed to determine hours of completion in each category.
For those who are found out of compliance or who have not indicated compliance on their renewal form, some remedial action will be required.
If the practitioner fails to comply with requirements within a given time frame, a disciplinary action will begin.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-4007 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98).
Section 2.2-4007 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
The Board of Nursing is proposing to (i) incorporate in the regulation the statutory requirements on initial certification for massage therapists and delete the obsolete "grandfathering" rule currently included in the regulations, (ii) establish continuing education requirements for certification renewal, (iii) change requirements for licensure by endorsement, and (iv) delete the provisional certification requirements.
Estimated economic impact.
The qualifications for initial certification for massage therapy are established in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.13029 of the Code of Virginia.
The code specifies two ways for certification.
The first way is obtaining at least 500 hours of training from an approved program and passing the national certification exam.
In addition to that, the Board of Nursing (the board) may have certified an applicant before July 1998, (a) who had completed 200 hours of training and had been practicing massage therapy prior to July 1, 1997, (b) who had completed 20 hours of training and had had at least 10 years of practice prior to July 1, 1997.
The second way, known as the "grandfathering" rule, expired in June 1998.
Although expired, the current regulations still contain a list of the requirements in the regulation for certification through this rule.
Also, the current regulations do not list the original qualifications for certification, but only reference the Code of Virginia.
According to the Department of Health Professions (the agency), this has been creating some confusion among the applicants.
Although the qualifications for certification are included in the Code of Virginia, some of the applicants have been falsely assuming that the current certification requirements were those listed in the regulations for certification under the obsolete grandfathering rule.
The proposed amendments will add in the regulations the qualifications for certification that are in the Code of Virginia and delete the provisions for the grandfathering rule that are no longer valid.
Also, new language is added to clarify that those persons who had fulfilled the criteria for certification under the grandfathering rule must have submitted an application to the board prior to June 30, 1998.
These proposed changes will likely improve the clarity of the regulation and reduce the confusion on the eligibility criteria.
Another proposal will establish continuing education requirements for certification renewal.
According to the agency, massage therapy is an emerging profession and being utilized more and more for therapeutic purposes to alleviate the symptoms of disease or injury.
Massage therapy is known to provide relief from symptoms of fibromyalgia, cancer, arthritis, and other health conditions.1 Because of its widespread use and the potential effects on customer's health, the board believes that it is important for massage therapists to remain current in their knowledge and techniques to appropriately treat consumers and to be able to recognize the indications that a person should be referred to a health care practitioner.
Additionally, current initial certification requirements and the requirements for certification under the grandfathering rule are believed to be significantly less than what may be appropriate.
For example, the agency indicates that Virginia requires only 500 hours of education for certification whereas some states have adopted 1,000 hours as the minimum requirement.
The requirements for certification under the grandfathering rule were even lower.
The advisory committee that suggested the proposed changes determined that qualifications for initial certification are not adequate to ensure continuous competency throughout a therapist's practice.
Since the initial education of a certified massage therapist is believed to have been minimal, the board is proposing to establish new continuing education requirements to keep the massage therapists updated in their professional knowledge.
The proposed amendments will offer two options to satisfy the continuing education requirements, which will allow the practitioner to choose the preferred method for maintaining his skills and competencies.
The board is proposing as a condition of renewal that massage therapists demonstrate evidence of continuing competency by holding a current certification from the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB), the credentialing body for the profession, or complete at least 25 hours of continuing education or learning activities within the biennium.
According to the agency, the combination of these two alternatives was the most reasonable alternative.
As mentioned, one way to satisfy the proposed continuing education requirements is to hold a current certification from NCBTMB.
This certification is maintained current if a therapist obtains 50 hours of continuing education over a four-year period, which means 25 credit hours for each biennium on average.
Maintaining NCBTMB certification does not require an overall exam, but there may be a post-test following a continuing education course on the material covered in the 1 Source: The agency.

This option is likely to be used by those who already hold
