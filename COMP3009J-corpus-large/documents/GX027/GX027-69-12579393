J.D. Crowe J.D. Crowe has been interested in music since he was old enough to recognize what music was.
At age 4, Crowe recalled, he toted a guitar and listened attentively to the radio, especially the banjo playing of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs.
By the time he was 13, Crowe was playing the banjo, unaware of the influence he would have on a generation of musicians.
The Lexington, Ky., native eventually started a band called the Kentucky Mountain Boys, which, by 1971, had become J.D. Crowe and the New South.
The band was a training ground for such talented artists as Keith Whitley, Ricky Skaggs, Doyle Lawson, Bobby Slone, Red Allen, Jerry Douglas, Glenn Lawson, Jimmy Gaudreau, Bobby Slone and Tony Rice.
The band, when not recording, built a following performing at festivals.
From 1968-74, whenever they werent on the road, they played at Lexingtons the Holiday Inn North.
J.D. Crowe and the New South was already well on its way to legendary status, attracting bluegrass fans and musiciansas well as musicians working in other types of music.
After a brief try at retirement, Crowe returned in the 1990s with an updated version of the New South and the band headed back out onto the road.
J.D. is one of the most influential banjo players in history, said bluegrass great Don Rigsby, a former New South band member who is today director of the Kentucky Center for Traditional Music.
He has taken his instrument to new heights and played in every genre he ever wanted to just because he can, Rigsby explained.
I would in no way be the same musician that I am today without his firm yet caring guidance throughout the yearseven after I left the band.
J.D. is an icon, added Dale Ann Bradley, celebrated headliner of the Coon Creek band.
His music is one major reason my heart was led to bluegrass.
His playing and recordings today are still as exciting as the first one I heard.
Crowe and his band have produced six albums, including Flashback, which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album of 1994 and for the 1995 International Bluegrass Music Associations Album of the Year.
In 1994, Crowe was named Instrumental Performer of the Year for his five-string banjo playing by the International Bluegrass Music Association.
In 2001, Crowe received the Kentucky Governors Award in the Arts Folk Heritage Award.
Back to top Basketmakers to be highlighted at the Kentucky Folklife Festival The Old Capitol Grounds in Frankfort will once again come alive on Sept. 25-27 with the Kentucky Folklife Festival, the greatest sampling of the states folklife found anywhere.
Each year the festival highlights the unique cultural heritage of everyday Kentucky life.
Featured this year are the communities along Dixie Highway (U.S. 31W) and a celebration of the areas basket making traditions.
Visitors will see some of the finest of the states folk artists up close through demonstrations by members of the Mammoth Cave Basketmakers Guild.
The guild, formed in 2002 is a group of central Kentucky folk artists who organized to better promote, through education and marketing, the time-honored tradition of basket making unique to south central Kentucky.
Basket making has been an important part of the folklife along Dixie Highway for different reasons at different times.
The traditional white oak egg basket familiar to many was, of course, originally made for egg gathering.
But as U.S. 31W became a major route for tourists headed to and through the Mammoth Cave region, the baskets became a source of financial support for families who carried on the tradition.
Today these handmade baskets are a source of pride for Kentucky basket makers, as folk art enthusiasts from around the world seek them out and they become highly collectable.
Basket makers present at the festival will include Charlene and Charles Long, who will demonstrate weaving techniques used in the construction of their willow and honeysuckle creations, Leona Waddell and members of the family of early basket makers Lestel and Ollie Childress.
The festival is a program of the Kentucky Historical Society and Kentucky Arts Council, agencies of Kentucky State Governments Education, Arts and Humanities Cabinet and showcases the continuing efforts of the Kentucky Folklife Program to document, conserve, and promote the states folk traditions.
There is no general admission charge, but there are fees for some festival activities such as boat rides.

Back to top Folklife Festival Highlights States Diverse Communities Kentucky boasts a surprising number of communities, cultures and traditions in its 120 counties.
The Kentucky Folklife FestivalSept.
25-27 in historic downtown Frankfortwill highlight four.
The festivals Community Crossroads area on the grounds of the Old State Capitol will feature the states Latino, East Indian, Appalachian and Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities, along with their traditions and customs.
Community Crossroads will allow visitors to see the folk groups side-by-side and learn about both their similarities and differences.
Members of the four communities will share elements of their identities, such as dance, music, and storytelling and the artistic expression of everyday life.
Demonstrators will present a re-creation of a typical room in a traditional household and provide a chance for visitors to further explore that particular cultures recreation, visual arts, and family traditions.
Latino art forms in the Community Crossroads area will include Central American alfombras (sawdust carpets) created by residents of Shelbyville, dominoes as a form of recreation among Cuban communities, and Mexican Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) traditions.
There will also be dance demonstrations and instruction in the Salsa, Merengue, and Cha-Cha styles.
Members of Louisvilles East Indian community will demonstrate mehendi (painting complex patterns on the skin with henna) and rangoli (the traditional art of decorating floors with patterns using colored powder), in addition to examples of North and South Indian dances.
Again this year, Louisville Hindu Temple yoga club members will guide visitors through a series of yoga poses and movements.
While we most often associate community with ethnicity, race, and religion, community is also defined in large part by language and culture.
Kentuckians who are deaf or hard of hearing provide a good example of how a community can be created among people with shared language, culture and life experience that is not based on such things as ethnicity.
This section of Community Crossroads will spotlight the history of deaf communities and schools in Kentucky.
It will feature American Sign Language activities, technological innovations used in deaf households and deaf storytellers and artists.
Members of Letcher Countys Carcassonne Community Center were included in the Smithsonian Institutions American Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., in 2003.
They will also appear at the Kentucky Folklife Festival, demonstrating square dancing, quilting and other aspects of Appalachian life.
Make plans now to visit this year's Kentucky Folklife Festival, where visitors will explore questions like: What makes a community? What do these groups have in common and what sets them apart? How is my community similar or different? Can one person belong to more than one community? The festival is a program of the Kentucky Historical Society and Kentucky Arts Council, agencies of Kentucky State Governments Education, Arts and Humanities Cabinet and showcases the continuing efforts of the Kentucky Folklife Program to document, conserve, and promote the states folk traditions.
There is no general admission charge, but there are fees for some festival activities such as boat rides.
