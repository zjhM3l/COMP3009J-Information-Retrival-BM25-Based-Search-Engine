THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP REVISITED: BUILDING A NEW CONSENSUS I WANT TO THANK THE NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM AND THE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AT THE JOHN F. KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT FOR INVITING ME AS YOUR GUEST SPEAKER AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE UNITED STATES-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP.
AS WE CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THIS UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP.
ITS ALSO GREAT TO BE BACK IN CAMBRIDGE.
YESTERDAY, ON MY WAY TO BOSTON, I REALIZED THAT IT HAS BEEN 16 YEARS SINCE I CAME TO CAMBRIDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS A STUDENT IN THE MASTERS IN LAWS PROGRAM AT HARVARD.
ITS GREAT TO BE BACK.
BACKGROUND
PUERTO RICO IS A FASCINATING PLACE WITH A FASCINATING HISTORY.
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT HISTORY; A HISTORY THAT ILLUSTRATES, FOR EXAMPLE, WHY PUERTO RICO HAS REPEATEDLY VOTED AGAINST STATEHOOD, AND YET THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS TREASURE OUR US CITIZENSHIP
.
AND WHY SO MANY PUERTO RICANS HAVE FOUGHT WITH COURAGE AND DIED, AS PART OF THE U.S. MILITARY, IN ALL MAJOR WARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY AND ARE FIGHTING THE PRESENT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM AND YET AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF CULTURAL IDENTITY AND NATIONHOOD.
THE KEYS TO UNDERSTAND THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION ARE FOUND IN OUR HISTORY.
ALTHOUGH PUERTO RICO WAS UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SPAIN AT THE OUTBURST OF THE SPANISH WAR OF 1898, PUERTO RICO WAS BY THEN A COMMUNITY WITH A STRONG SENSE OF NATIONHOOD.
THE BIRTH OF THAT NATION, IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL SENSE OF THE CONCEPT, CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE LATE 18TH OR EARLY 19TH CENTURY.
BY 1898, ABOUT A MILLION PUERTO RICANS LIVED ON THE ISLAND AND SHARED THAT SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY, A LANGUAGE, A RELIGION AND A COMMON ASPIRATION OF DEMOCRACY AND SELF-GOVERNMENT.
LESS THAN A YEAR BEFORE THE SPANISH WAR, PUERTO RICO HAD FINALLY ACHIEVED FROM SPAIN THE AUTONOMOUS STATUS THAT THEY HAD SOUGHT FOR MANY YEARS.
INDEPENDENCE WAS NEVER THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY UNDER SPANISH RULE NOR WAS TOTAL INTEGRATION TO SPAIN.
AUTONOMY WAS THE ROUTE CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.
UNDER THE AUTONOMIC CHARTER OF 1897, PUERTO RICO OBTAINED BROAD CIVIL LIBERTIES, A HIGH LEVEL OF AUTONOMY AND SELF-RULE, AND FULL VOTING REPRESENTATION IN SPAIN.
PUERTO RICANS NEVER DREAMED THAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE UNITED STATES, THE NATION OF DEMOCRACY AND LIBERTY, WOULD PLACE THEM IN A POLITICAL POSITION LESSER THAN THAT ACHIEVED UNDER SPAIN.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE UNTHINKABLE BECAME A REALITY.
AFTER THE HISPANIC AMERICAN WAR, THE FIRST 40 YEARS OF COLONIAL RULE UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG WERE A POLITICAL FAILURE AND AN ECONOMIC DISASTER.
PUERTO RICO WAS GOVERNED FROM WASHINGTON AND PUERTO RICANS HAD A VERY LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
REPORTS TALKED ABOUT THE RAGGED, HUNGRY, DISEASED PORTO RICO.
PUERTO RICO CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE POORHOUSE OF THE CARIBBEAN.
DURING THOSE FIRST 40 YEARS THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THE US GOVERNMENT TO AMERICANIZE OR TO CULTURALLY ASSIMILATE PUERTO RICO, THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THROUGH LOCAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
FOR YEARS, ENGLISH WAS THE LANGUAGE OF EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND OUR NATIONAL SYMBOLS, LIKE THE PUERTO RICAN FLAG, WERE FORBIDDEN.
BUT AS COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED THESE POLICIES WORKED TO STRENGTHEN, RATHER THAN WEAKEN, THE IDENTITY AND PERSONALITY OF THE ISLAND.
CULTURE WAS THE ONLY REALM IN WHICH WE COULD PROUDLY DEFEND OUR DIGNITY.
THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO, APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1940, ADMIRAL WILLIAM LEAHY, MADE A FAIR AND ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE REALITY OF THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE AT THAT TIME AND I QUOTE: THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS BY LAW, LATINS BY TRADITION, RELIGION AND CUSTOM, AND PUERTO RICANS BY PRIDE AND DEVOTION.
ASSIMILATION HAD, INDEED, FAILED.
IN THAT SAME YEAR, 1940, OUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED.
A NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENT, THE POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY, CAME TO POWER, WITH A FORCEFUL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA THAT JUMPSTARTED THE RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ISLAND.
INDEED, 12 YEARS LATER, IN 1952, THE COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION WAS PROCLAIMED BY THE LEADER OF THAT MOVEMENT, GOVERNOR LUIS MUÃ¯Â¿Â½OZ MARÃ¯Â¿Â½N.
WITH PUBLIC LAW 600 OF 1950, CONGRESS BEGAN A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WOULD EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION BY DRAFTING THEIR OWN CONSTITUTION.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ACT WAS NOT IMPOSED BY CONGRESS UPON THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO, BUT IT REPRESENTED AN OFFER THAT COULD BE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED.
SECTION 2 OF THE ACT PROVIDES: THIS ACT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE QUALIFIED VOTERS OF PUERTO RICO FOR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION THROUGH AN ISLAND-WIDE REFERENDUM TO BE HELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF PUERTO RICO.
UPON THE APPROVAL OF THIS ACT BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS PARTICIPATING IN SUCH REFERENDUM, THE LEGISLATURE OF PUERTO RICO IS AUTHORIZED TO CALL A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION TO DRAFT A CONSTITUTION FOR THE SAID ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO.
PUBLIC LAW 600 WAS ADOPTED IN THE NATURE OF A COMPACT.
AT THAT MOMENT, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A FORMALIZED COMPACT BECAUSE BY THE TERMS OF THE ACT THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WAS PENDING.
PUERTO RICOS CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION DRAFTED THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND IN MARCH 1952, THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO RATIFIED IT.
MONTHS LATER, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED PUBLIC LAW 447, APPROVING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
IN THAT JOINT RESOLUTION, CONGRESS EXPRESSED THAT PUBLIC LAW 600 HAD BEEN APPROVED AS A COMPACT WITH THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
THE COMPACT HAD BEEN FORMALIZED BECAUSE THE OFFER MADE BY CONGRESS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
FINALLY, IN JULY 25, 1952, GOVERNOR LUIS MUÃ¯Â¿Â½OZ MARÃ¯Â¿Â½N PROCLAIMED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
AFTER 1952, UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH STATUS, PUERTO RICAN CULTURE FLOURISHED, AND A STRONGER SENSE OF IDENTITY GREW.
OUR SYMBOLS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO OUR PUBLIC LANDSCAPE, OUR FLAG, OUR ANTHEM, ETC.
THE COMMONWEALTH ALLOWED PUERTO RICANS TO FULLY AND FREELY EXPRESS THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR PRIDE.
NOW, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF CULTURAL IDENTITY, BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A MINORITY TO PRESERVE THEIR CULTURAL VALUES WITHIN A LARGER NATION, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE WILL OF A PEOPLE, TO COLLECTIVELY AFFIRM ITS IDENTITY AND EXISTENCE AMONG THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.
IT IS A SUBTLE, BUT KEY DISTINCTION TO UNDERSTAND PUERTO RICOS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
THE FORMER DESCRIBES MINORITIES IN THE US SUCH AS ITALIAN-AMERICANS, IRISH-AMERICANS, HISPANIC-AMERICANS IN THE MAINLAND.
THESE MINORITIES PRESERVE CERTAIN CULTURAL TRAITS, BUT FEEL PART AND ENRICH THE AMERICAN MELTING POT.
THE LATTER IS THE CASE OF PUERTO RICO.
PUERTO RICANS IN PUERTO RICO ARE NOT A MINORITY.
UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH OUR CULTURE AND SOCIOLOGICAL IDENTITY IS NOT THREATENED.
OUR COLLECTIVE SENSE-OF-SELF IS MORE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEOPLE OF A NATION THAN THAT OF A CULTURAL MINORITY WITHIN THE AMERICAN NATION.
LET ME CLARIFY SOMETHING.
FOR A VAST MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS THIS STRONG CULTURAL IDENTITY HAS NOT MEANT SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE.
IT HAS, HOWEVER, SIGNIFIED A WILL TO BE SOMETHING ELSE, OTHER THAN A STATE OF THE UNION, WITH A LARGER DEGREE OF AUTONOMY.
THIS HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO THE COMMONWEALTH.
THIS POLITICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL REALITY POSES AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE FOR STATEHOOD, BECAUSE STATEHOOD WOULD MEAN, EITHER THAT THE US WOULD BE WILLING TO TRANSFORM ITSELF FROM A ONE-NATION-STATE INTO A MULTI-NATIONAL-STATE, WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, OR THAT PUERTO RICO WOULD BE WILLING TO BE CULTURALLY ABSORBED INTO THE UNION AND ITS IDENTITY VANISHED, WHICH IS ALSO UNLIKELY.
IN SHORT, PUERTO RICO IS A DISTINCT SOCIETY WITH ALL THE TRAITS OF A NATION IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL SENSE OF THE WORD; A PEOPLE WITH A WILL TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE ITS IDENTITY.
ANOTHER CENTRAL ASPECT TO UNDERSTAND COMMONWEALTH IS THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE PROUD TO BE US CITIZENS.
US CITIZENSHIP WAS GRANTED TO PUERTO RICANS IN 1917 AS PART OF THE JONES ACT.
HOWEVER, THIS ACT WAS NOT PART OF A PLAN TO INCORPORATE PUERTO RICO TO THE US OR TO FACILITATE EVENTUAL INTEGRATION TO THE FEDERATION AS A STATE.
THIS PRINCIPLE WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED BY PRESIDENT TAFT IN HIS 1912 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, ADVOCATING IN FAVOR OF A BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS TO GRANT AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP TO ALL PUERTO RICANS, WHERE HE STATED:
I BELIEVE THAT THE DEMAND FOR CITIZENSHIP IS JUST, AND THAT IT IS AMPLY EARNED BY SUSTAINED LOYALTY ON THE PART OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND.
BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE DEMAND MUST BE, AND IN THE MINDS OF MOST PUERTO RICANS IS, ENTIRELY DISASSOCIATED FROM ANY THOUGHT OF STATEHOOD...
I BELIEVE THAT THE AIM TO BE STRIVEN FOR IS THE FULLEST POSSIBLE ALLOWANCE OF LEGAL AND FISCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, WITH AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP AS THE BOND BETWEEN US; IN OTHER WORDS, A RELATION ANALOGOUS TO THE PRESENT RELATION BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND SUCH SELF-GOVERNING COLONIES AS CANADA AND AUSTRALIA.
THIS WOULD CONDUCE TO THE FULLEST AND MOST SELF-SUSTAINING DEVELOPMENT OF PUERTO RICO, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD GRANT HER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BENEFITS OF BEING UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG.
AS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT CONCEIVABLY COULD ARISE, BY GRANTING AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP, FELIX FRANKFURTER, WHEN HE WAS SERVING AT THE WAR DEPARTMENT, WROTE IN 1914 AND IS CITED IN THE CASE OF MORA V. TORRES, WAIVING ASIDE SHAM CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS: THE PRESENT DAY DEMANDS UPON INVENTIVE STATESMANSHIP TO HELP EVOLVE NEW KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS SO AS TO COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT WITH THOSE OF A CONFEDERATED UNION.
LUCKILY, OUR CONSTITUTION HAS LEFT THIS FIELD OF INVENTION OPEN.
PUERTO RICANS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR US CITIZENSHIP WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO INCORPORATE THEM, BUT A FUNDAMENTAL VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS AS A SOCIETY.
THAT CITIZENSHIP REPRESENTS A POWERFUL BOND WITH THE UNITED STATES THAT PUERTO RICANS CHERISH AND AS SUCH IS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION.
THE COMMONWEALTH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT HAS ALLOWED PUERTO RICANS TO ACHIEVE THEIR MOST BASIC ASPIRATIONS AS A PEOPLE.
AND THAT FREEDOM TO BE OURSELVES HAS ALLOWED US TO ACHIEVE A MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH.
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY USING A POWERFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL: FISCAL AUTONOMY.
THIS TOOL ALLOWS US TO COLLECT OUR OWN TAXES AND SET OUR OWN FISCAL PRIORITIES, WHICH ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES.
OUR ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS HAVE GROWN STRONGER AND THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED STATES.
PUERTO RICO IS TODAY THE #1 PER CAPITA CONSUMER OF US PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD; AND THE 9TH LARGEST MARKET FOR US GOODS IN THE WORLD.
IN 1999, PUERTO RICO PURCHASED $16 BILLION WORTH OF US PRODUCTS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO OVER 320,000 JOBS IN THE MAINLAND U.S. PUERTO RICO PURCHASES MORE FROM THE REST OF THE U.S., THAN MUCH LARGER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA, ITALY, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL.
THE COMMONWEALTH THIS BRIEF REVIEW IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS THE PARADOX OF PUERTO RICO.
ON THE ONE HAND OUR WILL TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE OUR CULTURAL AND DISTINCT IDENTITY, AND ON THE OTHER, OUR DESIRE TO PRESERVE OUR US CITIZENSHIP IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNITED STATES.
COMMONWEALTH IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE OF STATUS THAT HARMONIZES THESE TWO CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF MY PEOPLES WILL.
AS WE REVISIT THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP, WE MUST BE WARY OF LABELS AND ABSTRACTIONS, AND FOCUS ON THE POLITICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF THE RELATIONSHIP.
TODAY WE LIVE IN A NEW WORLD, THE COLD WAR IS OVER AND WE FACE NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.
TWO PARALLEL TRENDS CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER.
ON THE ONE HAND, THE RESURGENCE OF NATIONALISMS; ETHNIC GROUPS AND PEOPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE REAFFIRMING THEIR IDENTITY AND AUTONOMY: FROM CHECHNYA, TO BOSNIA, TO IRELAND TO PALESTINE AND ISRAEL.
THIS NATIONAL FORCE COULD BE A CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE AND SOMETIMES IT COULD BECOME DESTRUCTIVE, BUT IT IS AN UNDENIABLE SOCIOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL PHENOMENON.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A CLEAR WORLD TREND OF OPENNESS OF TRADITIONAL FRONTIERS, FIRST ECONOMICALLY, AND THEN POLITICALLY.
ONCE THE NATIONS FEEL SECURE IN THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY AND AFFIRMATION, THEY ARE WILLING TO INTEGRATE WITH OTHER NATION-STATES.
TAKE THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
THIS OPENNESS HAS BROUGHT A DEEP REVISION OF TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND CITIZENSHIP.
THESE CONCEPTS HAVE BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE TO THE NEW REALITIES OF THE GLOBAL WORLD.
IN THIS CONTEXT, I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME.
THE COMMONWEALTH MODEL IS ONE OF VARIOUS AUTONOMOUS MODELS THAT HAVE PROVED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
PROFESSOR RUTH LAPIDOTH, IN HER BOOK AUTONOMY, DEDICATES A CHAPTER TO DISCUSS THE CASE OF PUERTO RICO.
OTHER SCHOLARS, LIKE PROFESSOR HURST HANNUM, HAVE RECOGNIZED THE BENEFITS OF AN AUTONOMOUS ARRANGEMENT SUCH AS THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, AND DESCRIBES IT AS A PARADIGM FOR RESOLVING SOME ETHNIC CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD.
THE CURRENT DEADLOCK
THE VIEW THAT COMMONWEALTH IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR THE ISLAND IS SHARED BY THE MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS.
STATEHOOD HAS NEVER BEEN FAVORED IN ANY PLEBISCITE ON STATUS.
INDEPENDENCE TODAY HAS LESS THAN 5% OF SUPPORT.
THE COMMONWEALTH WAS CHOSEN BY THE VOTERS IN 1952, AND IT HAS BEEN FAVORED IN EVERY PLEBISCITE SINCE, IN 1967, 1993 AND 199
.
THAT BEING SAID, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT SETTLED AND PUERTO RICANS ARE STILL DIVIDED.IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE 1950-52 PROCESS, PUERTO RICO EXERCISED, BUT DID NOT EXHAUST ITS RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
IN OTHER WORDS, PUERTO RICO STILL PRESERVES ITS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON STATUS IS NOT THE PROBLEMTHAT IS PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY NEVERTHELESS, ALL ATTEMPTS TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION INITIATED IN 1952 HAVE FAILED IN CONGRESS.
AND THERE IS A LESSON FROM OUR DEALINGS IN WASHINGTON.
OUR DIVISIONS IN THE ISLAND ARE TAKEN TO WASHINGTON WITH UNSURPRISING RESULTSNOTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED.
ALL PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICS OF BACKSTABBING AND MUTUAL SABOTAGE IN WASHINGTON.
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS THE INFAMOUS STATEHOOD BILL OF 1997.
THIS BILL WAS PROMOTED BY THE STATEHOOD PARTY AND WAS NEGOTIATED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO EXCLUDE COMMONWEALTH AS A DEMOCRATIC OPTION.
THEY INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOBBYISTS AND IN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT PUERTO RICANS WANTED STATEHOOD AND THAT THE BILL WAS ABOUT SELF-DETERMINATION, WHEN IN REALITY IT WAS AN UNDEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT EXCLUDED THE CHOICE PREFERRED BY THE MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICO: THE COMMONWEALTH OPTION.
OF COURSE, THE EFFORT FAILED.
THERE IS A LESSON THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED BY NOW: THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP IS TO WORK TOGETHER, WITH OPEN DIALOGUE AND CONSENSUS.
ALL PARTIES AND ALL SECTORS MUST BE INCLUDED AND HAVE A VOICE IN ANY STATUS REVISION EFFORT.
PRINCIPLES FOR A NEW CONSENSUS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST, I BELIEVE THERE ARE A SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR A NEW CONSENSUS THAT PUERTO RICANS FROM ALL IDEOLOGIES SHOULD EMBRACE.
1---FAIR TREATMENT FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE AND OPEN PARTICIPATION TO ALL PARTIES AND SECTORS OF SOCIETY.
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE FOR A NEW CONSENSUS IS THAT NO SERIOUS DISCUSSION OF STATUS CAN BE MADE WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL SECTORS OF THE PUERTO RICAN SOCIETY.
I MEAN NOT ONLY THE POLITICAL PARTIES, BUT ALSO THE CIVIL SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNOR SILA CALDERÃ¯Â¿Â½N IS COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING THE BASIS FOR THIS NEW CONSENSUS BY CREATING THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY.
THIS COMMISSION WILL HAVE REPRESENTATION OF EACH ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR PARTIES, THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER, 3 CITIZENS NOT MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF ANY OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND OF 2 RENOWNED PUERTO RICAN JURISTS.
ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMMISSION MUST ACCEPT TWO PREMISES: (1) THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO TO FREELY CHOSE THEIR FUTURE STATUS; AND (2) THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE FOR ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY CHOSEN: COMMONWEALTH, STATEHOOD AND INDEPENDENCE.
2PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT.
THIS COMMISSION MUST WORK TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
THIS AGREEMENT WOULD SET THE PROCEDURE THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE WILL OPENLY AND DEMOCRATICALLY EXPRESS THEIR WILL.
AMONG THE PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES TO BE CONSIDERED ARE, ANOTHER PLEBISCITE, AN AMERICAN-PUERTO RICAN COMMISSION ON STATUS AND A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION ON STATUS.
3- WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE IN WASHINGTON ONCE THERE IS A PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT IN PUERTO RICO WE SHOULD COME TO WASHINGTON WITH ONE VOICE.
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET A RESPONSE FROM CONGRESS.
THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TRULY REMARKABLE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PUERTO RICAN HISTORY, THE PARTY IN POWER IS WILLING TO SHARE ITS POWER AND OPEN THE PROCESS, INSTEAD OF USING POWER TO ADVANCE JUST ONE STATUS ALTERNATIVE.
TODAY, I INVITE ALL POLITICAL PARTIES IN PUERTO RICO AND ALL SECTORS OF OUR SOCIETY TO JOIN THIS PROCESS WHEN GOVERNOR CALDERON OFFICIALLY CALLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY.
LETS ALL COME TO THE TABLE.
LETS WORK OPENLYNOT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS--SO THAT OUR PEOPLE CAN SEE, AND SO THE US CAN SEE, WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT.
IT IS TIME TO LEARN FROM HISTORY.
ONLY THE UNITED VOICE OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WILL FORCE THE RESPONSE WE NEED FROM CONGRESS.
4- THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE FUTURE GOVERNOR CALDERON IN HER SPEECH AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY RECENTLY EXPRESSED, AND I QUOTE: FOR COMMONWEALTH TO CONTINUE TO PLAY ITS ROLE AS THE COMMON GROUND SOLUTION FAVORED BY THE MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS, HOWEVER, IT MUST STRENGTHEN AND EVOLVE.
IT MUST DO SO BY FULFILLING THOSE ASPIRATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL TENDENCIES I HAVE JUST MENTIONED TO YOU.
FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE ENTERED INTO THE COMPACT WITH CONGRESS, IT FARED QUITE WELL WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PREVAILING COLONIAL ARRANGEMENTS THEN EXISTING IN THE CARIBBEAN.
HALF A CENTURY LATER THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE.
THIS IS THE UNFULFILLED AGENDA OF THE 1952 GENERATION AND THE GENERATION AFTER THAT.
MY GENERATION HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLETE THAT AGENDA.
I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TWO OF THE AREAS IN THE CURRENT COMMONWEALTH ARRANGEMENT THAT SHOULD BE REVISITED AS PART OF THE AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE.
(1) THE APPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL LAWS WITHOUT A FORMAL MECHANISM OF PARTICIPATION BY PUERTO RICO; AND (2) THE UNDUE LIMITATIONS ON PUERTO RICOS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
ARTICLE 9 OF THE FEDERAL RELATIONS ACT OF 1952, PROVIDES THAT THE STATUTORY LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES NOT LOCALLY INAPPLICABLE, SHALL HAVE THE SAME FORCE AND EFFECT IN PUERTO RICO AS IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE PHRASE NOT LOCALLY INAPPLICABLE HAS BEEN INTERPRETED BY LEGAL SCHOLARS AND BY SOME COURTS AS EXPRESSING THE WILL OF CONGRESS THAT SOME FEDERAL LAWS WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR UNIQUENESS AS A DISTINCT SOCIETY.
HOWEVER, THE ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A MECHANISM TO DECIDE UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES AND THROUGH WHAT MECHANISM A FEDERAL LAW WOULD BE DEEMED NOT APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO.
TO ACHIEVE THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF COMMONWEALTH, IN PERMANENT UNION WITH THE US, CONGRESS MUST ESTABLISH A FORMAL MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH PUERTO RICO MAY EXPRESS ITS DESIRE THAT CERTAIN FEDERAL LAWS WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO.
IN MY VIEW, THIS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC ASYMMETRY IN THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP.
FIRST, THIS AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL RELATIONS ACT OF 1952 WOULD ESTABLISH THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH FEDERAL LAWS CAN BE DECLARED LOCALLY INAPPLICABLE.
SECOND, IT WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE LAW.
THIS MECHANISM IS COMPATIBLE WITH US CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
MOREOVER, THIS KIND OF CONDITIONAL APPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL LAWS HAS AT LEAST ONE PRECEDENT IN THE HISTORY OF US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONS.
AS I EXPLAINED BEFORE, THE LAW 600 ACT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO FOR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION.
THE FEDERAL ACTS APPLICABILITY WAS SUBJECT TO PUERTO RICOS APPROVAL.
A SIMILAR PROCEDURE WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF GENERIC CONSENT AND DEMOCRATIC ASYMMETRY.
THE SECOND AREA OF ENHANCEMENTINCREASED PARTICIPATION OF PUERTO RICO IN LIMITED FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ITS CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS--- I BELIEVE DOES NOT REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT OF THE CURRENT LEGAL ORDER.
IT IS A MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL.
I BELIEVE THAT PUERTO RICOS PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, SPECIALLY IN THE CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA, WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR PUERTO RICO AND FOR THE UNITED STATES.
HOWEVER, HISTORICALLY THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO INCREASE THE INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF PUERTO RICO.
SINCE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS PER-SE IN THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS, THIS PRACTICE CAN BE CHANGED IN AGREEMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT IT IS FEASIBLE UNDER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK.
ITS A MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL, NOT LEGAL RULES.
WE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE AMERICAS BEST ALLY IN REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN PARTICIPATE AND SHOULD PARTICIPATE TO MAKE SURE THAT PUERTO RICOS INTERESTS, TO THE EXTEND THAT ARE DIFFERENT BUT CONSISTENT WITH U.S. INTERESTS, ARE WELL REPRESENTED.
THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE.
IT RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL PUERTO RICANS ARE IN FAVOR OF COMMONWEALTH.
I RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS, TO ADVOCATE AND TO WORK TOWARDS THEIR GOAL, BUT I URGE THEM TO DO IT WITHOUT OBSTRUCTING OUR EFFORTS TO USE OUR CURRENT TOOLS TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PEOPLE.
WE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE THE BEST SYSTEM WE CAN HAVE UNDER OUR POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE STRATEGY OF THE PARTIES AND GROUPS THAT OPPOSE THE COMMONWEALTH HAS BEEN TO TRY TO CRIPPLE THE COMMONWEALTH, TO DEMOLISH IT, TO ELIMINATE IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE, EVEN AT THE COST OF THE FREE WILL AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR PEOPLE.
I SAY THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH.
MY MESSAGE TO THEM IS THAT FOR ANY ALTERNATIVE OF STATUS TO WORK IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE BEST EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN TODAY, WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR OUR PEOPLE, TO BUILD THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN HAVE, WE NEED A HEALTHY PEOPLE, WE NEED A PEOPLE WITH AN ACCEPTABLE QUALITY OF LIFE.
AND ABOVE ALL, FOR ANY ALTERNATIVE TO WORK IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO RESPECT OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE FREE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TODAY.
MY INVITATION TO ALL WHO LOVE PUERTO RICO IS THIS: LETS WORK TOGETHER TOWARD A NEW CONSENSUS.
WE OWE IT TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF OUR BELOVED PUERTO RICO.
THANK YOU.
