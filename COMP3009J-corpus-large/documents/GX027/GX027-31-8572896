FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

October 17, 2002 The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the Enron Task Force announced today that Timothy N. Belden, who was Enron's Chief Energy Trader, has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a scheme with others at Enron Corp. to manipulate California's energy market, a scheme that was designed in part to alter the price of electricity in the state.
In the first criminal charges to be filed in an investigation of the manipulation of the California energy markets during the power crisis of 2000 to 2001, Enron's chief energy trader was charged in San Francisco federal court with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The defendant has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the United States in its investigation.
A hearing for the defendant to plead guilty is scheduled for noon Pacific time in San Francisco federal court before Judge Martin J. Jenkins.
The charges are based on Enron's intentional manipulation of the California energy markets, which was done in part to affect the price of electricity in California.
In pleading guilty, the defendant will admit that Enron's manipulation of the California energy markets was illegal.
The defendant, Timothy N. Belden, also agreed to cooperate with the United States in its continuing investigation into the manipulation of the California energy markets.
The charges were announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C. today by Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Kevin V. Ryan, United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, Leslie Caldwell, Director of the Enron Task Force, and Bruce Gebhardt, the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, the Enron Task Force, the Antitrust and Fraud Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the San Francisco division of the FBI.
Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, the head of the Justice Department's Corporate Fraud Task Force, said, "During the period of the charged conspiracy, Enron's revenues from Belden's trading unit rose from $50 million in 1999 to $500 million in 2000 to $800 million in 2001.
While Enron benefitted from the overall rise in electricity prices, the information charges that a portion of these increased revenues was due to the execution of these schemes.
The conspiracy charged in this information allowed Enron to exploit and intensify the California energy crisis and prey on energy consumers at their most vulnerable moment."
U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan, a member of the Corporate Fraud Task Force, said in announcing the guilty plea, "These charges answer the question that has long troubled California consumers: whether the energy crisis was spurred in part by criminal activity.
The answer is a resounding yes.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice those who served their own selfish purposes by intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers in California and on the West Coast."
Mr. Belden, age 35 of Houston, Texas, was charged in a Criminal Information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 371.
The Criminal Information was filed on October 9, 2002 but was under seal until this morning, when the defendant made his initial appearance in federal court.
Mr. Belden was arraigned on the charges this morning in San Francisco federal court.
A change of plea hearing is set for noon today.
According to the charges, Mr. Belden was employed by Enron Corp. in its West Power Trading Division ("West Power") in Portland, Oregon.
West Power bought and sold wholesale electricity in the Western United States, including California.
From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Belden is alleged to have conspired with others to manipulate the California energy markets and to defraud California electricity customers and other participants in the wholesale electricity markets.
The Information alleges that in 1999, Enron's West Power generated approximately $50 million in revenues.
By 2001, West Power's revenues increased to approximately $800 million as the price of electricity skyrocketed.
Prices during the height of the energy crisis rose from $25 per megawatt hour to, in some cases, $1,500 per megawatt hour.
It is alleged that the price increase is attributable in part to the schemes charged in the Information.
In pleading guilty, Mr. Belden will admit that beginning in approximately 1998, and continuing through 2001, he and other individuals at Enron conspired to manipulate the energy markets in California by:
! misrepresenting the nature and amount of electricity Enron proposed to supply in the California market, as well as the load it intended to serve; ! creating false congestion and falsely relieving that congestion on California transmission lines, and otherwise manipulating fees it would receive for relieving congestion; ! misrepresenting that energy was from out-of-state to avoid federally approved price caps, when in fact, the energy it was selling was from the State of California and had been exported and re-imported; ! falsely represented that Enron intended to supply energy and ancillary services it did not in fact have and did not intend to supply.
As a result of these false schedules, Mr. Belden will admit that he and his co-conspirators were able to manipulate prices in certain markets, arbitrage price differences between the markets, obtain "congestion management" payments in excess of what they would have received with accurate schedules, and receive prices for electricity above price caps set by the California Independent System Operator ("ISO") and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Mr. Belden admitted that he and others received part of the revenues from the schemes through the ISO, which on a monthly basis billed all customers for wholesale electricity in California, and paid all suppliers, like Enron.
The ISO made these payments during the course of the conspiracy to Enron by interstate wire transmission through the Bank of America in San Francisco.
No sentencing date has yet been set before Judge Jenkins.
The maximum statutory penalty for violating 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 371 is five years and a fine amount of $250,000, plus restitution.
However, the actual sentence is dictated by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of factors, and will be imposed in the discretion of the Court.
According to the plea agreement, the defendant could be eligible for a lower sentence based on the extent of his cooperation with the United States in its investigation.
In addition, the plea agreement requires the defendant to forfeit $2.1 million to the United States, which represents the portion of his salary and bonuses tied to the fraud.
The prosecution is the result of an ongoing investigation begun four months ago by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco.
The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick D. Robbins and Matthew J. Jacobs, as well as Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey, a trial attorney with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice based in San Francisco, along with the assistance of Paralegal Deborah Young.
