Neuroinformatics Grants Line under title Demonstration of an Atlas-Based Spatial Database Amarnath Gupta, Bertram Ludaescher, Ilya Zaslavsky, Desiree El-Chabier, Maryann Martone, Mark Ellisman As part of the Human Brain Project, we are developing a web-accessible 3D Cell Centered Database containing high resolution 3D volume data on cellular and subcellular structures along with information on the distribution of key proteins involved in signal transduction.
Such datasets will provide valuable information in the spatial domain of 1 nm3 to 10 Âµm3, a realm that includes structures such as spiny dendrites, synaptic complexes, and organelles.
The promise of neuroinformatics is that such structures will be linked with data being accrued at the organ, tissue, and molecular level, to form an integrated view of the nervous system.
To help accomplish this, we are creating tools to allow the federation of brain data across multiple scales of resolution and experimental disciplines as part of the "Federation of Brain Data" project under the auspices of the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI).
A key step in this process will be to map the data accumulated at different scales into a common coordinate system using a digital brain atlas.
A number of brain atlases are produced by neuroscientists.
However they are not "live" because, there is nothing else you can do except look at them.
How can we make these atlases more powerful such that they can be used to connect multiple information based on the locations of identified structures? We can bridge this gap only if we can convert a biologist's atlas into a spatial database that can then be used to index into other experimental data based on a combination of their name and atlas location.
Further, such an atlas can support topological queries that use spatial relationships between objects.
In the current implementation, we convert the well-known Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas into such a spatial database using "Spatial Markup and Rendering Tool" developed at UCSD/SDSC.
This tool organizes a collection of rat brain slices into a spatial database by establishing a common coordinate space and adding topological information about relationships between various graphical elements.
The input data represent unstructured vector drawings that lack uniform coordinate system, with no relationship between graphic representations of anatomical structures, and their labels.
The drawings are converted into SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), the emerging XML format for vector graphics, and accessed via a web interface that (1) establishes the common Paxinos 3D coordinate space "on the fly" by examining slice metadata and interrelationships between shapes on each slice, and (2) allows the user to associate labels with graphic representations of anatomical structures, as well as encode topological relationships between anatomical structres (such as "inside", "adjacent", "contains", "intersects" etc.) by filling in a form.
The annotations (markups) defined in this fashion are organized by an F-logic-based mediator and can be queried from the same interface, with both spatial (by pointing or defining an area of interest) and attribute (by specifying an anatomic structure and a relationship) queries.
Once in the database, these relationships can be used to find structures from the atlas and consequently can be related to observational data accessible through the mediator.
Thus the atlas serves as visual representation of the semantic link between heterogeneous distributed data.
