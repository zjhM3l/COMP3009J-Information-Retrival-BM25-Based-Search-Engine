Country Commercial Guides FY 1999: Hong Kong __________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER IV.
MARKETING U.S. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
For many American products and services, initial market penetration in Hong Kong does not require an investment of millions of dollars of company funds.
Given that Hong Kong is a "free port" with virtually no duties or tariffs and that it has a wide ranging network of agents and distributors, a well-managed market penetration program with a moderate invest- ment in market development is generally all that is required initially.
The market for U.S. service firms is also quite open.
Due to its open nature, however, Hong Kong is among the most competitive and price sensitive markets in the world.
Companies considering the market should also be aware that the Hong Kong business climate is extremely fast-paced.
Decisions are made quickly and companies need to be able to respond to inquiries immediately or they risk losing the market to faster moving suppliers.
Many American products and services do have a market in Hong Kong, and in many cases through Hong Kong to China.
The best agents and distributors for China are often located in Hong Kong, although given China's size and diversity, it is usually necessary to work with different agents for different regions of China.
Hong Kong companies are eager to talk to potential exporters and have a strong interest in representing good quality, competitively priced U.S. products from companies committed to the market.
Commitment to the market is demonstrated in various ways but should include: quoting in metric, providing Chinese language material, responding quickly to inquiries, meeting relevant standards, and visiting the market for first hand understanding and building of relationships.
A. Distribution and Sales Channels
One of the best ways to sell products in the Hong Kong market is through the use of agents or distributors.
It is also an excellent way of minimizing the initial investment in the market.
As outlined below, there is a wide range of companies which can serve as agents or distributors for U.S. firms.
Other options for pursuing Hong Kong's market are establishing an office or partnering.
Companies looking to sell equipment needing long term maintenance or technical support or installation or who are seeking to become involved in infrastructure projects frequently seek to partner with local companies.
B. Use of Agent/Distributors; Finding a Partner
Working with agents and distributors in Hong Kong is very much like working with an agent in the United States.
An agent takes orders in the supplier's name.
Distributors act in their own name and may stock products purchased from the manufacturer for resale.
The choice depends on the relationship with which the manufacturer/supplier is most comfortable and the nature of the business.
Hong Kong has no special legislation regarding agents and dis- tributors.
Virtually anything which both sides can agree to and put into a written contract is acceptable and enforceable, including restrictions on territory and a grace period for termi- nation of the agreement.
While not required by Hong Kong law, the more complex the contract, the more helpful legal counsel can be in drafting the text.
Items that are often in the contract include:
-- Discussion of exclusivity and sales territories (always a sensitive issue; business people should be careful about granting an exclusive agency too soon or in too large a territory if the agent is to cover beyond Hong Kong.)
-- Discussion of proprietary information (theft of intellectual property is prohibited by local law, but prevention of piracy is always less expensive and more effective than post-facto legal action.)
-- Levels of sales activity -- set specific targets and goals to qualify for maintaining or renewing the agreement -- Time duration -- Payment terms -- Quality control -- inspection -- verification -- Rule of law -- jurisdiction in the USA vs. Hong Kong (It is generally Hong Kong, but another location may be specified -- for arbitration, for example.)
--Covenants restricting activity following cancellation of the contract.
There are many types of agents and distributors in Hong Kong, ranging from those who simply stock retail stores with standard items to agents who provide sales, engineering and technical support for complex systems.
It is common for a single company to deal in a wide variety of products in a particular sector.
Agents and trading companies may be less specialized than companies in a large economy like the US, but the best ones are focused and have contacts in a general line of business.
C. Franchising
During the past decade, Hong Kong and the region have been catching on to the concept of franchising.
With the rise in household income over the years, there has been growing demand for goods and services of a better quality.
In addition, the high cost of space and labor supports the use of known business formats such as franchises for entrepreneurs.
The number of franchise operations in Hong Kong increased from 52 in 1992 to about 100 in 1997, the majority of which are U.S. franchises.
In addition to foreign franchises, there are also a number of home grown franchises in fast food, frozen yogurt, herbal tea, etc.
The competition that foreign franchises have to face is not minimal.
However, market demand continues to grow.
D. Direct Marketing
Over the years, Hong Kong has developed an efficient wholesale and retail network to cater to the growing consumption needs of a more affluent population.
Supermarkets, large department stores, convenience stores and modern shopping centers have become increasing- ly popular.
Shopping is a popular pastime, creating a need for a much wider selection of value for money merchandise.
From the consumer standpoint, because of the convenience of having a wide selection of merchandise available in the retail market, direct marketing is not yet a well-accepted sales channel in Hong Kong.
Recently there has been some growth in direct marketing through television, but mail-order and other forms of direct marketing are still very limited.
E. Joint-Ventures/Licensing
Joint-ventures or strategic alliances can be very helpful in entering the market, and are particularly important in competing for major projects.
(For additional information on joint ventures, see Section VII below, Investment Climate.)
Licensing is increasingly common in the field of brand name product manufacturing and marketing.
F. Steps to Establishing an Office
Foreign companies are allowed to incorporate their operations freely in Hong Kong, to register branches, or to set up representative offices.
There is no restriction on the owner- ship of such operations.
Company directors are not required to be citizens of, or resident in Hong Kong.
Reporting requirements are straightforward and not onerous.
There is no distinction in law or practice between investment by foreign controlled companies and those controlled by local interests.
There are no disincentives to foreign investment such as limitations on the use or transfer of foreign currency, or any system of quotas, performance requirements, bonds, deposits, or other similar regulations.
The high cost of labor and rents are the major disincentives to establishing a presence in Hong Kong but as of mid-1998, rents were declining.
To incorporate or register an overseas company, the company should first file statutory declarations with the Registrar of Companies.
It should then submit necessary documents to the Administration Section of the Companies Registry.
Specific information on the documents needed to be submitted can be found on the Companies Registry's web site (http://www.info.gov.hk/cr/handouts/index.htm).

G. Selling Factors/Techniques
The major selling factors are the same as in the U.S.: price, quality, timeliness in delivery and service.
Initial sales require more face-to-face contact as Asians generally place a premium on developing personal connections.
H. Advertising and Trade Promotion (including listing of Major Newspapers and Business Journals)
Many promotional vehicles are open to suppliers to introduce and develop their services in the Hong Kong market.
These include:
-- special trade fairs and exhibitions -- advertising in the media and other public relations activities -- holding seminars -- in-store promotions -- joint promotions with wholesale and retail outlets
Hong Kong is a major conference and exhibition center.
Hundreds of international exhibitions are held annually.
The Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition Center (operated by the quasi govern- mental Hong Kong Trade Development Council), has approximately 500,000 square feet of exhibition space, including 300,000 square feet added in a major expansion completed in the summer of 1997.
A privately built facility, the International Trademart, opened in Kowloon Bay in early 1996 with 158,000 square feet of exhibition space.

Television is a widely used medium with an estimated daily audience of 5.3 million out of a population of 6.5 million.
Hong Kong Television also reaches much of neighboring Guangdong Province in China, where it is very popular.
As one of the largest centers in the world for Chinese language publications, the territory produces almost 700 publications, including some 60 Chinese newspapers, approximately 625 periodi- cals, and 2 English daily newspapers.
Advertising agencies, including many of international standing, offer a full range of services.
Suppliers should provide technical catalogs in English, and desirably in Chinese, for distribution to agents and firms.
Company brochures are particularly useful when visiting Hong Kong for the first time.
English-Chinese business cards are also helpful.

I. Pricing Product
If possible, quote in metric, on a deliverable basis to Hong Kong i.e. CIF or C
Hong Kong companies have lots of options; American companies must make it as easy as possible to deal with them.
J. Sales Service/Customer Support
Some sort of local presence, whether it is a branch office or an agent or distributor, is very important in getting established in the market.
Business in Hong Kong (and elsewhere in Asia) requires relationships which can only be developed with some sort of full- time presence.
Prompt after-sales service is also crucial to succeeding in this very competitive market.
K. Selling to the Hong Kong Government
The Government Supplies Department (GSD) is the central purchasing, storage and supply organization for the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, serving over 80 government departments and certain non-government organizations.
The GSD normally purchases by open tender, with decisions based on compliance with tender specifications, competitiveness in price, back-up service and delivery.
The GSD gives no preference to any particular source of supply from any country or organization.
GSD spent US$549 million in 1997, with American products winning around 26% of the total procurement contracts (about US$141 million).
Hong Kong joined the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement in June 1997.
As of May 1998, the Government of the Hong Kong S pecial Administrative Region was in the process of establishing a Bid Challenge System consistent with the WTO's Government Procurement guidelines.
Invitations to open tender are published in the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Gazette and in selected Hong Kong newspapers.
Tender notices are also published on the Internet in the GSD Home Page (http://www.info.gov.hk/gsd).
Tenderers usually have about six weeks to prepare their offers.
Tenders normally have a 90-day validity period unless otherwise indicated.
Payment is usually effected by check or telegraphic transfer within 30 days upon acceptance of the goods.
Contract awards with the names of successful tenderers and contract sums are published monthly in the Government Gazette and on the Internet.
For information about a subscription to the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Gazette contact:
Information Officer Publications Sales Section Information Services Department 28th Floor, Siu On Centre 188 Lockhart Road Wanchai, Hong Kong Tel: (852) 2598-8197 Fax: (852) 2598-7482.
The GSD maintains lists of registered suppliers for issuing tender invitations.
Any company not currently registered with the GSD wishing to be considered for inclusion in these lists may apply in writing to the Director of Government Supplies.
Companies are required to provide basic information about their organi- zations and the goods they offer, such as the business registration certificate, company profile, annual report and product catalogues.
The GSD evaluates this information and those companies that are found acceptable will be included on the lists.

L. Protecting your product from IPR Infringement
The best protection for an American company is to aggressively market in Hong Kong.
By using a good local agent, American manu- facturers or suppliers can make their product legally available.
Dealers have a strong incentive to stop any piracy, and with good local connections, have a better chance of making that happen than an American company which is not actively partici- pating in the market.
The chief law enforcement body for Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.
However, protecting copyrights or trademarks takes vigilance, and even with the U.S. Government vigorously pressing Hong Kong on this issue, enforcement is still dependent on reporting incidents of product piracy to the authorities and, in some cases, providing evidence in court.
For more information on intellectual property legislation and registration, see Section VII.
G, below.
M. Need for a Local Attorney
Hong Kong follows the Common Law System and disputes which cannot be resolved between the interested parties are commonly pursued through the court system.
Attorneys are needed for most court processes and are extremely expensive.
N. Performing due diligence, checking Bona Fides of Banks, Agents and Customers
To research potential customers and business partners, U.S. businesses can check with the Hong Kong Government's Companies Registry or consult with banks and credit agencies both in the U.S. and Hong Kong.
All businesses must register with the Hong Kong Government's Companies Registry.
Information available to the public is limited to: date of registration, names of major shareholders/ directors and investment capital.
