Abstract: This proposal represents a novel, yet practical, integrated approach to managing three of the most damaging diseases on peanut-root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne arenaria), southern stem rot (caused by Sclerotium rolfsii), and tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV).
There is currently no integrated system for minimizing damage to all three of these diseases.
Our system will use multiple tactics, including biocontrol, cultural practices, host resistance, and interactions of these tactics.
Specific tactics for specific targets will include rotation with cotton for nematodes, genetically-based host resistance for TSWV, and PGPR (plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria) for control of S. rolfsii and for plant growth promotion with the accompanying effect of reduced TSWV damage due to an early onset of mature plant resistance.
Incorporation of this integrated system in production system management programs will decrease use of pesticides and may allow use of a wider selection of cultivars.
Specific objectives during the 2-yr project include the following:
1) Select rhizobacteria with biocontrol capacity against S. rolfsii; select rhizobacteria which enhance vegetative plant growth of peanut and test relation to TSWV severity.
2) Integrate bacteria selected in objective I with crop rotations and host resistance and test this integrated system for effects on the three target pathogens in field trials.
3) Evaluate the economic feasibility of incorporating the integrated system into peanut production systems.
The project will include some greenhouse testing to select specific rhizobacteria, from among an existing collection of beneficial strains already at Auburn University, with the desired effects of biocontrol and growth promotion.
The remainder of the work to evaluate the integrated system will be field trials conducted in both Alabama and Georgia during both years of the project.
At the completion of the project, we will have sufficient data on how the integrated system and some of the individual tactics affect disease incidence, disease severity, and yield to determine the economic feasibility of the system.

University of Arkansas Fayetteville, AR 72704 Phone: (501) 671-2000 Fax: (501) 671-2251 Email: djohnson@uaex.edu
Project Start Date: 9/1/99 Expected Completion Date: 8/31/01 Grant Award: $215,357
Abstract: Annually, the south central states, including AL, AR, FL, GA, OK and SC, raise 43,000 acres of fresh and processed peaches worth $70 million.
The main diseases and insect pests include: bacterial spot, peach scab, brown rot, plum curculio (PC), stink bugs (SB), tarnished plant bugs and oriental fruit moth (OFM), peach tree borer (PTB) and lesser peachtree borer (LPTB).
The problem is that growers follow a spray program that results in 16 or more full- orchard applications of pesticide per season to sustain 
Johnson (AR), Gorsuch and Miller (SC) reported that implementing a peach IPM program improved timing of pesticide applications and realized a reduction of four or more sprays per season.
Researchers could further reduce use of pesticides by developing better spray timing protocols and alternative to insecticides.
These protocols should incorporate pest monitoring methods for OFM, PC, SB, spot and scab.
Each method must be made practical for use across the southeastern states.
The opportunity exists in the southeastern peach growing states for extension personnel to train orchard scouts, implement the peach IPM program in grower demonstration orchards, evaluate the program impact and provide regional peach production manuals.
OBJECTIVES - 1) To collect and compare weekly data on pest incidence and peach damage so as to establish economic thresholds and improve weather-driven models for applicability in southeastern states; 2) To improve pest monitoring and develop alternative controls for pests of peaches; 3) To quantify and compare the economic impact of implementing a peach IPM program and identify the constraints to adoption of these practices; 4) To set up orchards to demonstrate the peach IPM program where scouts will report findings and recommendations to grower's and to the regional peach web site; 5) To coordinate and revise the "Teach Growers Handbook" into a "Southeastern Region Peach Production Manual," and broaden the "Southeastern Peach IPM and cultural guide."
EFFORT: 1) Each state will forward daily air weather data to Linvill (SC) and weekly counts from PC traps and estimates of fruit damage by bacterial spot and peach scab will also be sent to Scherm (GA).- Both will collaborate in establishing treatment thresholds and improving weather-driven models that forecast PC fruit feeding, and damage from bacterial spot and peach scab. 2) Cooperators in AL (Boozer, Foshee and McVay), AR (Johnson), FL (Mizell), GA (Horton), OK (Mulder and McCraw) and SC (Gorsuch) will compare weekly counts of each combination of yellow SB traps with/without pheromone bait and pyramid and screen-trunk PC traps with/without bait (plum essence + PC pheromone) for monitoring of PC and SB all season.
Trap counts will be compared to counts of PC and SB limb jarred from adjacent trees.
Horton (GA) will modify, test and demonstrate an airblast sprayer applying Lorsban for PTB and LPTB control.
This will be a safer alternative to hand-gun sprays.
Johnson (AR) will evaluate fungi and nematodes from Mycotech Corporation in the lab and field for efficacy against PC. 3) Popp (AR) and Scherm (GA) will assess the impact of the peach IPM program by composing a survey, mailing it to 100+ growers and interpreting responses.
They will also note changes in grower orchard management practices over the two year life of the IPM orchard demonstrations below.
Extension: 4) Each state, except FL, will train a scout to monitor weekly in EPM demonstration orchard(s).
The scout will estimate the incidence of pests, summarize daily weather, and provide pest control recommendations to each grower and to the regional peach web page.
5) Horton (chair, GA), Johnson (AR), Gorsuch, Layne (SC) will coordinate the revision and broadening of the University of Georgia handbook into the "Southeastern Regional Peach Production and IPM Handbook."
This manual will be published by 2001.

Project Start Date: 9/1/99 Expected Completion Date: 8/31/01 Grant Award: $77,881
Abstract: Weed growth and survival, and the extent of damage to crop plants, are determined by competition for available resources.
Attempts to enhance herbicide use efficiency depend, in large part, upon changing the competitive balance in favor of crop plants.
Up to this time, little has been known about the physiological mechanisms controlling competition between crop and weed species.
The absence of knowledge has limited the development of new, alternative strategies for weed control.
In this project, first funded by the USDA-CSREES IPM Program in August 1997, we are evaluating a novel approach for weed control in soybean and peanut cropping systems.
The approach involves altering the competitive balance between the N2-fixing crop plants and problem weed species.
During the initial phase of the project, we have assembled direct evidence with soybean and peanut indicating that much of the nitrogen driving weed growth comes from the N2- fixing plants themselves.
Importantly, it is clear with soybean that the amount of nitrogen transferred and the degree of growth stimulation or suppression of accompanying plants are genotype dependent.
Thus, there are positive indications that weed competitiveness, and the damage associated with it, can be controlled by genotype selection.
In the second phase of the project, we will begin implementation of a weed management strategy.
A number of the major soybean and peanut cultivars grown in the southeastern U.S. will be screened in the field to determine their capacity for N transfer and weed growth suppression.
Also, herbicide treatments will be evaluated with specific soybean genotypes previously identified as having different weed suppression potentials to determine the extent that herbicide inputs can be decreased or eliminated.
And lastly, we will begin to develop a screening technique that would allow assessment of nitrogen transfer potential and weed growth suppression in the greenhouse.
This is a necessity for long term success of the project with crops like soybean, because of the large number of varieties being released each year and the difficulty in screening large plant populations in the field.

Project Title: Grazing Winter Wheat for Aphid, Disease and Weed Management
Principal Investigator: Kristopher Giles, Ph.D. Entomology 
Project Start Date: 9/15/99 Expected Completion Date: 9/14/01 Grant Award: $127,536
Abstract: With over 15 million acres planted annually in Oklahoma and Texas, winter wheat is one of the most important agronomic crops produced in the Southwestern U.S. Winter wheat is grown as forage for cattle during the fall and winter and for grain (dual use) on approximately 50% of the wheat acreage in Oklahoma.
Economic returns from forage utilization often equal the value of harvested grain.
Incorporating grazing into wheat production systems requires early fall planting (September) and early spring grazing termination.
Early planting optimizes forage and weight gain for cattle, and timely termination of grazing in the early spring is essential for producing grain.
However, planting wheat early frequently leads to increased populations of greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and bird-cherry oat aphid (BCOA, Rhopolosiphum padi L.), and subsequent Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) infections.
In Oklahoma alone, annual losses attributed to aphid pests range from $0.5 to $135 million.
Additionally, early planted wheat fields are often invaded by grassy weed species (especially Cheat, Bromus) that can reduce yields and increase dockage.
In many grazed systems, tillage occurs too early to destroy annual weed seedling emergence in wheat.
The combined impact of aphids, BYDV, and weed pressure on early plantings can result in reduced forage, lower yields, and less profit per acre in winter wheat.
Most Oklahoma and Texas wheat producers use insecticides to manage aphid populations because viable alternative management strategies do not exist.
Integrating grazing with insecticides is logistically challenging because of label restrictions.
Additionally, applications may kill wildlife and beneficial insects, increase human and animal exposure to toxic compounds, and further select for aphid insecticide resistance.
Grazing can significantly reduce aphid populations in winter wheat, however, the optimal initiation date (for economic aphid suppression), and the impact of aphid reductions on BYDV transmission and yields have not been quantified.
Grazing may increase the levels of grassy weeds resulting in reduced yields and profits in early planted wheat.
Recently, newly registered herbicides have become available for cheat control; these compounds will allow producers to more effectively control cheat in winter wheat.
However, the economic benefits of managing cheat may be of little value when aphids and BYDV can be the most important causes of forage and yield reductions.
The economic importance of grazing wheat in the Southwestern U.S. justifies a detailed examination of its impact on other important limiting factors such as aphid pests, the diseases they vector, and important weeds.
The objectives of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the effect of grazing wheat on aphid populations; BYDV severity, weed populations, and the subsequent impact on yields; (2) Evaluate the effect of grazing initiation date on aphid populations, BYDV severity, weed populations, and the subsequent impact on yields; and (3) Communicate the results of these studies at local grower and Certified Crop Advisor meetings, in regional newsletters, and in a regional publication.
The use of winter wheat as forage and grain integrates two important commodities in southwest agroecosystems, and can help to maximize per acre profits for producers if pests are managed.
Wheat grazing systems are unique but offer the flexibility needed to integrate whole-farm management decision.
Utilizing grazing as an aphid and BYDV management strategy in these systems will reduce insecticide inputs, lower production costs, and increase the profitability of cattle and wheat production in the Southwestern U.S.

Project Start Date: 9/15/99 Expected Completion Date: 9/30/01 Grant Award: $113,431
Abstract: Cover crop mulches are in widespread use in sustainable vegetable production in northern regions of the U.S., but are not widely used in the Southeast due to the greater pest pressure found in the warm, humid climate.
The use of killed cover crop mulches offers several advantages over the conventional production practices of bare soil or fumigation with plastic mulch.
Cover crop mulches: 1) suppress weeds, 2) control soil erosion, 3) prevent pollution of surface and ground water by slowing erosion and percolation, 4) provide habitats for beneficial insects, and 5) fix N. Legume cover crops can provide up to 200 lb/acre N, which saves the energy needed to produce and apply synthetic N and reduces N pollution by providing slowly- released N. However, there are potential disadvantages associated with the use of cover crops.
Cover crops may: 1) serve as hosts for insects and plant pathogens and exacerbate these problems in the following crops, 2) make weed control more difficult because mulched soils cannot be cultivated and some herbicides are not effective when residue is present, and 3) make planting and establishing the crop more difficult due to residue on the soil surface and slower soil warming in the spring.

Project Title: Biological Control of Fire Ants in the U.S. Southern Region
Principal Investigator: Karen Vail, Ph.D. Entomology 
Project Start Date: 9/1/99 Expected Completion Date: 8/31/01 Grant Award: $146,032
Abstract:
Imported fire ants are significant pests in the southern U.S., and consist of the following species: the black imported fire ant, the red imported fire ant, and their hybrid.
In addition, there are multiple-queen colonies which are not territorial, and colonies that have only one queen and are territorial.
Areas infested with multiple-queen fire ants have populations and nest densities that are 2-3 times that of single-queen infested areas.
Because of their high reproductive capacity, aggressive foraging behavior, and lack of effective natural enemies in the U.S., imported fire ants have become a dominant arthropod species.
They reduce the biological diversity of ecosystems, damage crops, and are a medical and veterinary concern because of their painful, venomous sting.
The economic impact of fire ants in seven southern states has been reported to be over half a billion dollars per year.
With the discovery of fire ant infestations in California, their impact will be even greater in the future.
Currently, the main control option for fire ants is the use of chemical insecticides.
Untreated fire ant-infested areas that are adjacent to treated areas serve as reservoirs for reinfestations.
Due to these reinfestations, the reapplication of insecticides is often needed.
Livestock operations are a good example of this scenario, where fire ant treatments are concentrated around inhabited areas, but it is not economically feasible to treat surrounding pastures.
Biological controls would be ideal for areas where insecticide treatments for fire ant control cannot be justified.
Unfortunately, early attempts at biological control for fire ants have not been successful because they required manual applications to individual fire ant colonies, did not spread naturally to new colonies, and were not self-sustaining.
Recently, a pathogen of fire ants from South America, Thelohania solenopsae, was found in limited locations in the U.S.
In contrast to the previous fire ant biological control agents, T. solenopsae is self-sustaining, and directly debilitates the fire ant queen by infecting her ovaries.
The infection results in reduced egg production, and eventually causes premature death of the queen
.Recently, in a preliminary study, we artificially infected field colonies of fire-ants with T. solenopsae.
With this capability, we propose the following objectives: (1) establish T. solenopsae infections among the different fire ant species; (2) establish T. solenopsae infections among the different queen types (i.e., single and multiple queen colonies); (3) evaluate T. solenopsae impact on fire ant populations; (4) document changes in the diversity of native ant species; and (5) correlate temperature and precipitation with prevalence of T. solenopsae infections and its effect on fire ant populations.
To include all fire ant species and queen types and a variety of environmental conditions, study sites will be established in ten southern states with in-state cooperators from universities, state departments of agriculture, and the USDA.
Results generated from this project would provide critical baseline and logistical information needed for the implementation of the National Fire Ant Management Plan currently being developed by the USDA-ARS and the Fire Ant Task Force of the Southern Legislative Council.
T. solenopsae is an integral component of this national plan where the use of biological control is emphasized.
In addition, the regional and inter institutional cooperation will support efforts to garner further interest for an IPM approach toward solving the fire ant problem.

Project Title: IPM Strategies for Livestock Poisoning Plants
Principal Investigator: Charles Hart, Ph.D. Rangeland Ecology 
Project Start Date: 9/1/99 Expected Completion Date: 8/31/01 Grant Award: $54,643
Abstract: A 1997 USDA Southern Region IPM grant was obtained to support a program that stresses applying IPM principles to toxic plant management on a regional level in West Texas.
Educational materials were developed and workshops conducted.
The program has protected beneficial plants from being inadvertently killed and protected ground water resources through reduced reliance on pesticides for toxic plant control.
The proposed project will expand the scope of the application of IPM principles to toxic plant management on a statewide level.
The program will continue to emphasize Integrated Toxic Plant Management (ITPM) rather than Toxic Plant Control.
The program combines expertise from Veterinary Diagnostic Toxicology, Veterinary Medicine, Weed Science, Range Science, and Animal Science.
A basic four-step approach is applied: identify toxic plants, learn animal poisoning symptoms, recognize problem areas, and formulate a management strategies.
Goals of the project are 1) create an awareness of plants that are toxic to grazing animals, 2) educate stakeholders on management practices that can reduce toxic plant problems and to integrate these practices into management strategies, and 3) reduce the reliance on pesticide use for toxic plant problems.

Project Title: Use of Soybean Leaf Area to Redefine Insect and Weed Pest Management Strategies

Research 
Project Start Date: 9/1/99 Expected Completion Date: 8/31/01 Grant Award: $102,461
Abstract: Soybean is a major cash crop grown in all 13 southern states.
Although Southern soybean growers are at a yield disadvantage compared to their Mid-Western counterparts, innovative crop production systems such as double-crop soybean and 'Early Soybean Production Systems' (ESPS) have enabled Southern U.S. growers to compete and maintain profitability.
The double-crop system allows the grower to produce two crops in a single season, increasing profitability and lowering production costs.
ESPS rely on early planting of early-maturing cultivars to allow for earlier soybean harvest which facilitates a more timely planting of small grain.
However, ESPS and double-crop soybeans often do not achieve the same leaf areas as traditional full-season soybeans.
With reduced leaf areas, current insect management thresholds may be invalid.
They are based on full-season soybean grown in the Midwest and deep South and may be allowing unacceptable levels of leaf feeding by insects and yield losses to occur.
Weeds continue to infest soybean annually at levels justifying their control.
New herbicide technologies have enabled broad- spectrum control, however, these herbicides sometimes cause minor injury to the crop.
A soybean crop that develops adequate leaf area can easily compensate for herbicide injury.
However, ESPS or doublecrop systems, with reduced leaf areas, may not be able to compensate and minor herbicide damage may be causing larger yield reductions than realized.
Research is needed to gain a more complete understanding of what leaf area levels are critical for maximum yields in ESPS and double-crop soybean.
This information can be used to determine at what point insect controls should be implemented to stop further leaf area loss, and how weed management aids should be modified to prevent yield-reducing herbicide injury.
Still, another possibility exists for improving pest management in ESPS and double-crop soybean systems.
The advent of the global positioning systems (GPS) and graphical information systems (GIS) has created detailed soil maps that pinpoint variations across fields.
If leaf area can be predicted based upon soil type, then site- specific insecticide and herbicide applications could become part of a larger effort to improve fanning efficiency and profits.
Site-specific research is needed to evaluate the potential of GPS/GIS technologies for aiding in the management of soybean pests.
Our objectives are to 1) redefine management strategies for insects in ESPS and double-crop soybean systems, 2) to determine crop injury potential of various herbicide-based weed control systems in ESPS and double-crop soybean systems, and 3) to determine if soil type is an indicator of soybean leaf area and the feasibility of using GIS/GPS technology for precision application of insecticides and herbicides.
To validate findings, a series of experiments will be conducted on as many growers' fields as practical, with fields selected to include a range of cropping systems, cultivars and farm environments common to the participating states of Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina.
The GPS/GIS soil type-leaf area research will take place in conjunction with an ongoing large farm experiment where fields are soil mapped and GPS/GIS equipment and expertise is in place.
