It is adjacent to an island called Sapwitik, which is formed on the same fringing reef.
Lenger holds a community with an approximate population of 50.
Lenger Island has a long and varied history of helping to improve the environment.
It was once a sea turtle hatchery during the Japanese occupation of Pohnpei.
Now the abandon World War II sea plane air strip is home to a Giant Clam Hatchery that is helping to reseed the reefs of Pohnpei and the FSM. Lenger Island is helping to safeguard the waters of Pohnpei by becoming the first Community-based Marine Protected Area in the FSM, and it is also a state legislated MPA..
The 1.5 square mile MPA contains a variety of diverse habitats from mangrove forest and sea grass beds to fringing and patch reefs.
This is home to a diverse population of marine organisms but due to heavy fishing and anchor damage these numbers are rapidly declining.
Therefore, a designated Restricted Area has been set aside as a safe haven for all marine organisms to thrive and proliferate.

Nearest major city: Kolonia
Region: Tropical Goals and Accomplishments Goals and objectives of MPA: lenger divers Protecting the marine biodiversity and to help improve the livelihood of Lenger Island community.
Site accomplishments to date: Marine Protected Areas (MPA): 1.
Boundary markers and buoys Monitoring: 1.
Fish count 2.
Coral monitoring 3.
Sedimentation Mariculture: 1.
Sponge farm Site Management Management objective: No-take
Type of management structure: Community-based
Challenges of site management: * People value and are genuinely concerned about their natural heritage, but have lost management skills * When assisted and have the feeling of ownership, they are willing to manage resources * Without community blessing and participation, resource management will never be sustainable and/or successful * Community conservation efforts will not be successful without government support and legislation * Providing alternate sources of income makes conservation much more appealing * "Bottom up" approach is more attractive than "top down"
Does a management plan exist? No
Summary of main aspects of management plan: N/A
Main stakeholders involved: * Division of Marine Conservation; * Marine Development; * Nett District Government; * Lenger Island Community; * Conservation Society of Pohnpei; and, * Funders
Other Site Evaluations and Research Description of any other site evaluations to date: A marine resource survey was undertaken in 1999
