I watched a discovery program on repairing the Hubble telescope and notice how difficult and dangerious it was in repairing it.
I think that they should build an equipment bay that could be pressurized from the shuttle's enviromental systems that the astronauts could access with out ever having to go an an EVA.
A platform could be built to fit inside the shuttle bay that the telescope could be joined to conecting the pressure compartment of the telescope to the shuttle cabin.
12/16/2002 well I think you are doing great in keeping us up to date with the info.
I wish you good luuk on your mission.
BYE P.S: hope you can send it further andlearn more about the universe 12/16/2002 what space shuttle was sent to repair the hst? 12/11/2002 I think that you guys are doing a great job and I want to know more about the Hubble Space Telescope and I would also would like to meet you guys and talk to you.
12/5/2002 Great site, fellas! My first site I went to when looking for hubble was www.hubble.org! You guys really should have that site...don't you fellas own a trademark on Hubble or something.
Lucky I remembered you were part of NASA! (hubble.nasa.gov).
12/2/2002 Excellent Website!!! So full that i couln't find the info!!! 11/25/2002 hello, I am a college student and I am doing a paper on the financial part of astronomical projects, such as the Hubble.
I was wondering if you could give me a little bit of information on the financial part of the Hubble Telescope.
How much does it cost? How do you raise the money? Who works on the financial part? It would be really helpful Thank You Rima Shulmanovitch 11/24/2002 Great site, lots of information.
Thanks 11/22/2002 Great work, but when are you going to take a look at the central star of M-27, the dumbell nebula? 11/20/2002 ihglhk j 11/19/2002 What problem needed fixing with hubble when it was first launched? Was is that the vision was blurred? Did it have a broken radio or a noisy muffler? 11/18/2002 You have all these amazing pictures but the only wallpaper I can find is on a site you have a link ot on your page.
I was surprised you don't have your own PC wallpaper and Hubble shop.
Keep up the good work with the telescope and the web site though.
11/18/2002 I like your site.
THANKS 11/14/2002 trovo le vostre pagine web una cosa utilissima per lo studio grazie danilo 11/14/2002 based on the information recieved from the hubble, do you thimk that one day humans will be able to live in space? have you found any other life froms besides the ones on earth? 11/13/2002 Is it true that mermaids live on Saturn? 11/8/2002 Hello I`m koral from Turkey (istanbul) 18 years old My only aim is to work in NASA. i know you choose the best.
and i`m trying to be the best.
i`m interested in phiysics, astronomy, philosophy.
I have many books about them.
Im going camps an observations here.
and i have a telescope (it is a small one one but it is working well.
and i`m the head of an astronomy club in istanbul. next summer i`ll enter the university this year a problem happened an i didn`t entered ( my grade was enough for industry engineering but i didn`t want to educate in this dept. brcause of i have a certain aim. i`ll be glad if you read and answer me..
11/6/2002 I would like to know what will hapen when the hubble telescope dies in three years 11/6/2002 Hi I need to know what the authors first name and last name for my bibliography for my project ok.
I also think that you should post that up on your web page.
Thanks! 10/31/2002 This HST site is pretty awesome.
I'm a sophomore in high school and in the CSLP program.
We are working on HST project and this site helps a lot with the info we need! We recently visited Goddard and saw the facilty where they work and a huge Hubble model.
thanx for all the info! 10/30/2002 What are the goals of the hubble space telescope? 10/28/2002 Hubble is like reaching out to the stars,its earths eiffel tower in the universe.
10/23/2002 This page has alot of good and exciting educational facts.
Also the pictures are alittle dull.
but i enjoyed viewing this page.
10/22/2002 I wanted to know why does Nasa put satalites in space instead of on earth? 10/22/2002 Hello, my name is Antonio Williams I was just wondering how did you all come about doing this mission.
I know it must have been very hard adding parts to the Hubble Satelite.
I just wanted to know how can a person like me can become a great astronaut like you all? 10/22/2002 Hello, my name is Jeremy Williams and I was just wondering how did you guys come up with the whole thing about the Hubble Space Telescope? 10/21/2002 I heard about the web site through NPR.
Probably on science Friday.
I keep the site on my favorite places and visit occasionally to view the magnificent images from space.
They put our lives on Earth in perspective.
Thank you for the website.
10/16/2002 Thanks again forgaot to say last message left by Hannah (KRT, FTS), England Fraternally clear skies 10/15/2002 An honour to link to your site in my quest for video footage of Shoemaker Levy 9 collision with Jupiter.
I wonder if any of the millions who viewed the footage of two shots SEEMINGLY being fired from Jupiter, pre-impact, have ever logged on to this site? Fraternally clear skies 10/14/2002 Outstanding Website! Keep up the great work Thanks, Alain Montreal,Canada 10/9/2002 Great website, very informative and educational.
Keep up the great work.
10/7/2002 On October 6th, 60 Minutes (CBS) ran a segment on the Hubble.
Among the discoveries credited to the Hubble is the fact that the rate at which the universe is receeding is increasing.
The NASA spokesman postulated that there must be some property of gravity that we do not understand yet.
He went so far as to say that some form of "anti gravity" might be responsible.
Couldn't this be explained by ordinary centrifugal force? If the entire cosmos were rotating around some unseen center, as the objects moved away from that center, the rate at which they receed would increase.
Meanwhile, we would see the recession but not the rotation because we have no reference point: relative to each other, all the objects in the cosmos are receeding but not rotating.
Is anyone looking for a faint but unexplained Coriolis effect.
From it, you might be able to infer the location of the center of the universe, and the location of the big bang.
Mike Bechler 10/7/2002 Last night on 60 minutes I saw your piece.
They discussed with one scientist, Alan R., I did not catch his full last name, but he was involved in the discovery and understanding of the acceleration of the universe.
There is an emotional phenomenon related to this expanding energy affecting the earth we live on.
The acceleration of energy is also affecting the acceleration of emotional issues of people on the planet we live.
Have you noticed how the aggression has gotten worse over the past few years? This is related to the acceleration of the energy in the universe.
More drive bys, more alzheimers, more road rage, more dysfunctional behavior, more drug use.
etc...
All these are related to this energy acceleration in the universe.
Be well.
Brian 10/7/2002 I think you should have more pictures of the hubble telescopebecause I am doin the hubble telescope in school as a project and i didn't find that many pictures.
10/7/2002 I have valuable information I want to share with someone there who knows about the gravity changes and changes of speed / acceleration out in the UNiverse.
I will be back on my computer at 5:00pm pacific time tommorrow to see if there is any reply from you.
I need to let someone know about this asap. 10/6/2002 I wants know how oprate Hubble Mail me as possible 9/30/2002 Just researching Electromagnetic Radiation Detection / Analysis / Display methods.
Nasa seems like a good place to start because of the graphical representations of the electromagnetic radiation detections such as x-ray, infrared...
Can't wait until the cpability is reached to detect all electromagnetic frequencies simutaneously an the intensity of each and be able to manipulate the data graphically where the graphics are spacially related and proportional to the actual Electromagnetic Radiation Reading......
9/28/2002 Hello My name Erkan, In Turkei, I, Star tecnology is amateurs to be interested.
Me, you help to be worth..
Gut Night 9/22/2002 Was searching for 'NUTS
Could you 'point' me in the right direction? 9/21/2002 I think the hubble is so cool.
my 12yr old son is doing a tech-ed paper on the hubble. i've got him looking at the stars.
9/20/2002 griffen is so hot!!!!!!! 9/20/2002 when is the next space shuttle? 9/8/2002 Hi.
I'm a sciencefiction filmwriter, can you please inform me of any live or newest views of hubble pictures? How can I find the end of the universe pictures updates? Any websites of real time live cams for space? Thanks, Bob Szanyi (Sunny) 9/5/2002 There's nothing on earth that's like Hubble!! 9/5/2002 great job!!!, cool website... 8/31/2002 many thanks hubble project for the excellent deep space wallpaper itesdownloads and for sharing all of the important scientific information with me and the rest of the world your sites including nasa sites are a must for all space enthusiasts like me! thanks again rick 8/26/2002 Your site is good but I couldn't find where the Hubble Space Telescope got it's name.
8/7/2002 trevor h is the coolest person you will ever meet hes just that cool. tyler is the dummest person you will ever meet and he is so non cool 8/7/2002 trevor h is so cool 8/7/2002 keep up the good work with the hubble. dont brake it.
8/7/2002 the hubble thing is really cool.
there is so many things i know now from this websit.there are so many cool things in space.the pictures are incredible.there are so many different stars and planets.i love this website.
8/1/2002 Still the best site on the web !!I have followed hubble for some years now, and i still get a buzz from the pictures.When you look at a deep space picture with thousands of galaxies in it knowing that you are looking back in time circa 13billion years(give or take a few billion years!) old it kind of puts things in perspective and if it does not make you wonder what lies beyond....get out more !.
8/1/2002 your telescope project is in operation and feel benetifitial to eart and universe imaging pl send me printed reports if posible for education and research pramod deshpande senior scientific officer computer R
7/31/2002 Incredible site! Impressive pictures! Truely one of the best sites available on the net! We will come back and refer this wonderful site to all our friends.
Greetings from Paul Bloemen 
Much information and good design! Sam Phentermine 7/30/2002 Bonjour Hubble Project team! Votre site est formidable, et vos photos fantastiques! Un grand bravo et merci a vous tous pour votre site merveilleux! 7/30/2002 Excellent site, you guys at NASA rock! 7/29/2002 Great pictures and site! Greetings and congratulations! 7/26/2002 Great site, lots of awsome pics and info. bookmarked it too! John Phentermine 7/26/2002 Cool site.
I have came accross other good sites.
7/25/2002 IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EARTH`S AXIS TO BECOME OFF BALLENCE DUE TO TO MUCH WEIGHT FROM LET`S SAY CONCRETE FROM ROADES AIRPORT RUNWAYS ETC. 7/25/2002 T can demonstrate in practice that there is a perpetuum motion.
I can also substantiate this phenomenon theoretically- however I do not undertake it as far as these explanations may not be taken as they contradict to the existing wording concerning physical phenomena.
However, as I see it, this is not a contradiction, but continuation and addition to the incomplete theory that now already exists... 7/24/2002 I have been very Interested in our solar system for many years! are there any sites that a normal person can observe the planets? If so i want to be able to study our planets with the precision of the BEST Telescopes.
If that is not possible, then were and when, Do you feel that it may be possible! 7/24/2002 Your website was very informative for my science assignment.
Bravo 7/18/2002 WunderschÃ¶ne Bilder! Bravo! Danke fÃ¼r 'The hubble project'! 7/18/2002 Impressive and frightening at the same time! Great space pictures and great site! Thank you for sharing this with us! 7/13/2002 WHAT is the value of a greater escalation of our numeral and zeroistic structure.
7/12/2002 Very nice and usefull site.
Found you on Yahoo dir. 7/11/2002 Hi, the hubble is one of the greatest project on earth! Thank you for sharing it! 7/6/2002 **OK** Jag har sett allting nu! Hej 7/1/2002 This Site is really great.
It was a honor to visit your website. [shim.gif] [icon_bullet_2tr9pxb.gif]
