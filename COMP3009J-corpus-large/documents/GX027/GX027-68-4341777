Come and talk to him about his other passion creating banjos! Back to top Indian Bottom Old Regular Baptists: In the coal-mining region of the southern Appalachian Mountains, Old Regular Baptists sing lined-out hymns.
The roots of the high, lonesome sound found in the music of this region emerged from this tradition of congregational hymnody.
This way of making music, once common in the American colonies, continues in the worship and singing of the Indian Bottom Association of Old Regular Baptists in Blackey.
Members from over thirty different congregations from Letcher and surrounding counties comprise the Kentucky Indian Bottom Association, which remains faithful in keeping alive the lined-out older hymns.

Back to top Homer Ledford and Cabin Creek: Homer Ledford seems to have made more instruments than any other individual luthier in the southeastern U.S.
Some 5,600 of these are lap dulcimers, but Homer has a good output of other instruments: over 500 banjos, ranging from fretless models to bluegrass instruments; 25 guitars; 13 mandolins; and more.
Homers first instrument was a fiddle, made at age 12 from a discarded dynamite box and matchsticks.
Before making his second, he noticed that the Sears-Roebuck catalogue described violin tops as being made from spruce and violin backs and sides from maple.
As a result, he found some spruce, cut a maple tree that grew in the hog lot, and dried a piece behind his mamas stove.
Homer still plays his hog lot fiddle.
