What are CD4 cells? Cd4 cells, also known as helper T-cells, are a type of lymphocyte.
Lymphocytes are a kind of white blood cell that play an important role in the immune system, which controls the body's ability to recognize and fight infections and cancers.
CD4 lymphocytes help to identify, attack, and destroy bacteria, fungi, and other germs that infect the body.
In addition, they regulate the production of antibodies (proteins that fight infections) and cytokines (chemicals that regulate other immune functions).
CD4 cells are produced in the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus gland, and they circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream.
HIV binds to the surface of CD4 cells, enters them, and either reproduces immediately killing them in the process, or remains in a resting state, reproducing when the cell becomes active.
Although the body attempts to produce new lymphocytes in order to replace the ones that have been destroyed, the number of CD4 cells in the blood gradually declines as HIV disease progresses.
What is the CD4 count? The CD4 or helper T-cell count is a test in which the laboratory measures the number of Cd4 cells in a blood sample.
Normal CD4 counts in adults range from 500 to 1500 cells per cubic millimeter of volume.
Usually doctors leave off the "cells per cubic millimeter" when discussing your CD4 count.
Why is the CD4 count important? The CD4 cell count is a laboratory marker of the strength of your immune system and helps you to understand the stage of your HIV disease.
The CD4 count is a "quantitative" test--meaning the result is a number that can be compared with the number obtained from an earlier test.
Other laboratory studies, including CD4 percentage, and beta-2-microglobulin and neopterin levels, are used by some doctors in conjunction with the CD4 count for disease staging.
Medical conditions, such as thrush, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, also determine the stage of HIV disease.
The CD4 count is used to identify which problems you may be at risk for (see Table 1) and what medications might be helpful.
Table 1 outlines the ways in which CD4 count results may guide your care.
If your CD4 count declines over a period of several months, you may want to consider depending on its value: 1) beginning or changing antiviral treatment; 2) starting preventive treatment (prophylaxis) for opportunistic infections like PCP. ______________________________________________________________

Does the CD4 count ever go up? The CD4 count often varies over time.
After a decline, the count may stabilize for a period.
The CD4 count generally, but not always, increases after a person starts to take an antiviral medication such as AZT.
However, after a few months, the count will usually drop back to the level before treatment.
Despite these fluctuations, in most people the CD4 count will decrease gradually over many years.
It is not known why CD4 cell counts drop more quickly or slowly in different people.
What are limitations of the CD4 count? Because of variations in procedure, the CD4 count is not a precise test.
Results may vary between laboratories, so your test should always be performed at the same site.
In addition, other situations may have an impact on your CD4 results.
In general, the CD4 count tends to be a little lower in the morning and higher in the evening.
Your CD4 count may also be affected by acute illness, such as herpes simplex virus infection, which could cause the count to decline temporarily.
In general, the CD4 count goes down as HIV disease progresses.
Any single CD4 count value may be different from the last one even tough your health status has not changed.
You should not place too much importance on any one CD4 count; what is more important than any single result is the trend of CD4 counts over time.
The CD4 count does not always reflect how someone with HIV disease feels and functions.
For example, some people with higher CD4 counts are ill and have frequent complications, and some people with low CD4 counts have few medical complications and function well.
You can improve the likelihood of staying well by taking care of yourself physically and through regular medical appointments.
HIV-infected persons with CD4 counts below 200 are considered to have AIDS, regardless of whether they are sick or well, according to criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
How often should I have a CD4 count performed? There is no one correct schedule for how frequently you should have a CD4 count performed.
Your doctor will generally monitor the CD4 count more closely if it is anticipated that changes in the value are likely to affect your medical care.
One approach for how often to have CD4 counts performed is presented in Table 2.

T-Cell Counts and What They Mean
[This patient education material was prepared for AIDS Clinical Care (1995 April;7(4):31-2) by Paul Sax, M.D. of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP), and by Wendy Langlosi, R.N., of HCHP's AIDS Resource Team.]
The blood contains red cells and white cells.
Red cells carry oxygen from the lungs.
White cells protect us from infections.
Several different kinds of white cells fight infections in different ways.
One kind of white cell is the lymphocyte.
Some lymphocytes, the ones called T lymphocytes, tell cells how to work properly.
The "T-cell count" is actually a combination of three different measurements:
1.
the total number of white blood cells 2.
the percentage of white blood cells that are lymphocytes, and 3.
the percentage of lymphocytes that are T-helper cells.
The T-cell count is determined by multiplying these three numbers.
All three of these measurements can be obtained from the same blood sample.
T Cells and HIV
HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, directly infects and damages T cells.
Because of this, in most people infected with HIV the number of T cells decreases as time passes.
Since the T cells control many parts of the immune system, people with lower numbers of T cells are more likely to get certain infections, since their immune systems can't fight off invading germs as well as normal immune systems.
Measuring T cells is important.
Knowing the T-cell count indicates the strength of the immune system.
As the T-cell count goes down, the person with HIV becomes at risk for certain opportunistic infections.
("Opportunistic" means the germs use the opportunity of a weakened immune system to cause infections in the patient).
However, special medicines (called "prophylaxis") can prevent these opportunistic infections from happening.
For example, people with T-cell counts of less than 200 should take medicine to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or PCP.
Putting Single Tests into Perspective
The T-cell count can vary, depending on such differences as the time of day and the test was done, what laboratory did the test, and whether certain health problems were present the day the blood was drawn.
For example, if blood for a T-cell count is drawn while the patient is in the hospital because of an illness, the count might be lower than it would be at a time after the patient has left the hospital and is feeling well.
Some medicines, such as steroids prescribed for asthma or PCP, may also cause the T-cell count to be lower than it would be otherwise.
Although the T-cell count can help guide the choice of medicines, it is important to remember that it is only one measure of a person's health.
T cells do not directly affect how well or ill a person feels.
Many people with HIV feel fine even though they have very low numbers of T cells.
Common Questions About T-Cell Counts
Question: How often should I get my T cells measured? Answer: Many recommend every four to six months.
This information about the patient's immune status helps guide decisions about whether and when to start medicines to prevent opportunistic infections.
Comparing new T-cell counts with past ones tells whether T cells are increasing or decreasing, and how fast.
Question: How much does a T-cell count cost? Answer: Typically $60 to $150, depending where it is done.
How much is charged to you depend on your insurance.
Question: I am in a study for a new HIV drug.
My T cells are much lower at the study than at my doctor's office.
Which count is correct? Answer: T-cell measurements can differ depending on what time of day the blood is drawn, whether you have an active medical problem, and what lab did the test.
So it is best to compare T-cell counts done at one lab only with those done at a different time at the same lab.
It is also best to avoid checking T cells when you are sick with a bad cold, flu, or intestinal illness.
These can lower T-cell counts temporarily.
Also, if a T-cell count is much lower than expected, it makes sense to repeat it, to make sure there has not been an error.
Question: I feel great! I've never been ill at all.
But my most recent t-cell count was 196 (down from 240) and my doctor says I now have AIDS.
How can this be? Answer: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now classifies anyone as having AIDS who is HIV positive and has one or more opportunistic illnesses or has a T-cell count less than 200.
This new way of diagnosing AIDS helps the CDC know more accurately how many people in the U.S. have an immune system weakened by HIV.
However, this new AIDS diagnosis also includes many people who feel fine and have not had any opportunistic infections.
Question: How can my T-cell count be improved? Answer: Therapy with antiviral drugs (such as AZT, ddI, ddC, or d4T) may improve the T-cell count, but how much and for how long varies from person to person and depends on how long the person has used the drugs.
Research is being done on new treatments to restore T-cell counts for longer.
Question: I know two people who have the same T-count.
One has many health problems, but the other feels and looks entirely well.
How can this happen? Answer: The T-cell count gives only the approximate state of the immune system.
It is an accurate report of the number of T cells, but does not tell how well they work.
The amount of HIV in the blood, the patient's nutritional and physical condition, and many other factors are also important in determining health.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Prevention CDC National AIDS Hotline Training Bulletin
April 4, 1995 #135 These are answers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a question submitted by the CDC National AIDS Hotline concerning CD4+ counts.
The 1993 revision of the AIDS case definition includes HIV-infected persons with a CD4+ percent less than 14.
What does a CD4+ percent less than 14 mean? CD4+ as a percent of what? What is the range of normal CD4+ percents? The most commonly used measure of immune function in HIV-infected persons is the enumeration of CD4+ cells.
Currently, the enumeration of these cells is the best assessment that can be made easily and economically.
Active research continues in the area of development of better measures of immune function.
CD4 is the name given to a specific molecule found only on the surface of T-helper lymphocytes and a very few other human cells.
White blood cells are routinely enumerated on the blood test commonly called "CBC" (complete blood count).
The various types of white blood cells are routinely reported as well (neutrophils, lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, eosinophils, and basophils).
CD4+ cells are T-helper lymphocytes.
CD8+ cells are T-suppressor lymphocytes.
Enumeration of subsets of lymphocytes requires a higher degree of laboratory sophistication and expense than that needed for a CBC (one machine used for such enumeration is the fluorescent activated cell sorter or FACS).
CD4+ T lymphocytes are the cells primarily responsible for initiating the body's immune response to various microbes.
This cell is also the primary cell in the body that HIV attaches to and infects.
Decreases in percentages and absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells are an indication that the immune system has been compromised and can no longer protect the body from bacteria, viruses, and other microbes that can cause infections.
The percentage of CD4+ cells is the proportion of lymphocytes that are CD4+ cells versus CD8, CD56, etc.
The absolute number of CD4+ cells is derived by multiplying the percentage of CD4+ cells by the number of circulating lymphocytes in the blood.
The expected normal range for the percentage of CD4+ cells in whole blood ranges from 33% to 60%, and the normal range for the absolute number of CD4+ cells is usually between 500 and 1600 cells per microliter of blood.
These ranges may differ from laboratory to laboratory performing the tests.
Compared with the absolute CD4+ cell count, CD4+ percentages are less subject to variation on repeated measurements.
However, data correlating the natural history of HIV infection with CD4+ percentages have not been as consistently available as data on absolute cell counts.
Therefore, CDC emphasizes the use of absolute numbers but allows for the use of CD4 percentages.
The percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes in a whole blood sample is measured by using a method called flow cytometric immunophenotyping.
Guidelines for laboratories conducting this test were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report(March 4, 1994, Vol. 43, RR-3).
