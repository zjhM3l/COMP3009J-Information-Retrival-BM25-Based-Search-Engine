Intracoastal Waterway I Chapter 5 I 185 Intracoastal Waterway (1) (2) (3) The Intracoastal Waterway is a toll-free passage which roughly parallels the Atlantic Coast and extends 118 statute miles through bays, lagoons, thorofares, and land cuts from Manasquan Inlet to Delaware Bay at a point 2 miles north of Cape May Light.
In addition to the Intracoastal Waterway and the waters through which it passes, this chapter also describes the several rivers and tributaries that empty into these waters, as well as some of the more important towns and landings along these waterways.
The Intracoastal Waterway is used mainly by pleasure craft, and commercial and sport fishing vessels.
The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia Engineer District, has supervision of the waterway's construction, maintenance, and operation.
(See appendix for address.)
(10) (11) 37.4.
A vertical-lift bridge at Mile 3.9 has clearances of 30 feet down and 65 feet up.
From Absecon Inlet to Delaware Bay: vertical clearance, 35 feet at fixed bridges, Miles 68.9, 84.3, 93.6, and 97.4; clearance of overhead cables, 55 feet, Mile 84.3; horizontal clearance, 49 feet at bascule bridge, Mile 78.0.
General drawbridge regulations and opening signals for bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway are given in 117.1 through 117.49, chapter 2.
Special drawbridge regulations for certain bridges that supplement the general regulations are referenced with the area description of the waterway.
(12) (4) (5) Mileage The Intracoastal Waterway mileage is zeroed in 40Â°06'03"N., 74Â°01'55"W., off the outer ends of the Manasquan Inlet jetties, which are 40 nautical miles by outside run from The Battery, N.Y.
Distances along the Intracoastal Waterway are in statute miles to facilitate reference to the small-craft charts 12324, 12316; all other distances are nautical miles.
Mileage conversion tables are on page T28.
Channels The channel of the Intracoastal Waterway is generally 100 feet wide and has dredged depths of 6 feet from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May Harbor, thence 12 feet through Cape May Canal to Delaware Bay.
Effort is made to maintain a 6-foot controlling depth for the waterway, but due to continuous shoaling, 3 feet or less may be found in places, particularly inside the ocean inlets.
(See Local Notice to Mariners and latest editions of charts for controlling depths.)
Bridges and cables Minimum clearances of bridges and cables crossing the Intracoastal Waterway are as follows: From Manasquan Inlet to Absecon Inlet: clearance of overhead cables, 72 feet, Mile 3.0; horizontal clearance, 47 feet at bascule bridge, Mile 3.0; vertical clearance, 60 feet at fixed bridge, Mile 14.1 and Mile (13) (14) (6) (7) (15) Aids to navigation The U.S. Coast Guard maintains the standard aids that mark the inlets and the special aids that mark the Intracoastal Waterway.
The special aids have characteristic yellow markings which distinguish them from aids to navigation marking other waters.
(See U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists or Chart 1 (Nautical Chart Symbols and Abbreviations) for illustrations of special markings.)
The Department of Environmental Protection, State of New Jersey, maintains the aids to navigation on the rivers and creeks that empty into the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway.
Lights and daybeacons should not be passed close aboard because those marking dredged channels are usually placed back from the bottom edge of the channel and others may have riprap mounds around them to protect the structures.
The buoys marking the waterways are frequently shifted with changing channel conditions.
Charts Navigation of the Intracoastal Waterway can be made easier by the use of the special small-craft series which the National Ocean Service publishes especially for that purpose.
Tides In the inland waters, the tides are greatly affected by the winds both in time and height, westerly winds producing low water and easterly winds high water.
In Barnegat Bay, northerly and southerly winds drive the (16) (8) (9) (17) Ver. 1.0 This information is not certified for navigation purposes.

Intracoastal Waterway I Chapter 5 I 187 water to the ends of the bay.
While the normal range of tide is only about 0.5 foot in sections of the waterway removed from the inlets, strong winds of long duration may cause variations in level of as much as 3 feet below mean low water or 3 feet above mean high water.
Near the inlets, the wind has less effect and the normal range of tide is 3 to 4 feet.
waterway passes.
Boat-repair and storage yards with marine railways are also scattered along the waterway.
Facilities for icing, storing, and shipping seafood are available at most of the larger communities.
(See the small-craft facilities tabulation on charts 12324 and 12316 for services and supplies available.)
(18) Currents Current velocities may reach 3 knots in the inlets and in the narrow channels that connect the inlets with the inside waters.
Ice (23) COLREGS Demarcation Lines The lines established for New York Harbor, the inlets of the New Jersey coast and Delaware Bay are described in 80.165, 80.170, 80.501 and 80.503, chapter 2.
(19) The inside waters are completely closed to navigation by ice during extreme winters.
In ordinary winters, some of the channels, especially near the inlets where the currents are strong, remain open most of the time, though ice always forms on the flats.
The inlets themselves are rarely closed, but passage is often difficult because of running ice.
All the principal inlets and adjacent channels are used in winter by local fishing boats, but through navigation is usually blocked.
Charts 12316, 12324 (24) (20) (21) Weather While the waterway is more protected than the open waters weather is critical since navigation is more confined.
Winds diminish over land due to surface friction.
However, winds and currents may be intensified in restricted channels and inlets.
November through April is the windiest time of the year.
Gales are encountered about 1 to 2 percent of the time while speeds greater than 16 knots occur about 10 to 17 percent of the time.
Fog is also a problem particularly in restricted waterways.
Visibilities drop below 0.5 mile (0.8 km) on about 2 to 5 days per month; they are best from mid to late summer.
During the fall and early winter radiation fog often reduces morning visibilities but usually burns off by afternoon.
At times in spring, advection fog from the open water may be carried ashore by winds with an easterly component.
Smoke and precipitation also add to the problem in all seasons.
Seas can be a problem at ocean entrances such as Manasquan Inlet, Barnegat Inlet, and Little Egg Inlet.
This is true with strong winds between northeast and south, particularly on an ebb tide.
Facilities At communities along or adjacent to the waterway are numerous piers, wharves, and docks, many of which are open to general public use.
Fuel, water, and other supplies are readily available.
Public and privately owned boat basins are located in many streams entering the bays and thorofares through which the (25) Manasquan Inlet, 22 miles southward of Sandy Hook Light, is the northern terminus of the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway, and the Atlantic entrance to shallow Manasquan River, which flows into the inlet from the westward.
The inlet is used by many commercial fishing craft and pleasure craft.
Mariners should exercise caution when entering Manasquan Inlet when the wind and tide are opposed; local knowledge is advised.
Manasquan Inlet Coast Guard Station is on the south side of the inlet.
Traffic conditions in Manasquan Inlet can be hazardous due to the large volume of commercial and pleasure boat traffic.
Mariners are advised to exercise caution and control speed and wake while transiting the inlet.
The Coast Guard monitors traffic in the inlet and safe boating is enforced.
(26) Pilotage, Manasquan Inlet Pilotage is compulsory for foreign vessels and U.S. vessels under register.
Pilotage is available from the Sandy Hook Pilot Association, 201 Edgewater Street, Staten Island, NY 10305, telephone 718-448-3900, FAX 718-876-8055, e-mail: pilotoffice@sandyhookpilots.com.
Arrangements for pilotage may be made through ship's agents or directly.
A 24-hour advance notice is required.
A marked dredged channel, protected at the inlet entrance by two jetties, leads through Manasquan Inlet to the first bridge.
In May 2002, the controlling depth was 9.0 feet in the inlet through the jetties; thence in May 2000, 2.8 feet (8.6 feet at midchannel) to the first bridge.
The north jetty is marked by a light on its outer end.
The south jetty is marked by a light near the outer end; a fog signal is at the south jetty light.
Give the jetties a good berth to avoid any loose rocks.

188 I Chapter 5 I Intracoastal Waterway (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) The mean range of tide is 4 feet in Manasquan Inlet and 3.5 feet at the railroad bridge (Mile 1.0).
The current velocity is about 1.8 knots in the inlet.
The resort towns of Manasquan and Point Pleasant Beach are on the north and south sides of Manasquan Inlet, respectively, while the towns of Brielle (Mile 1.3), Point Pleasant (Mile 2.6), and Riviera Beach (3.5 miles above the inlet jetties) are on Manasquan River.
Cooks Creek, Mile 0.4, is an outlet for Lake Louise on the south side of Manasquan River.
The fixed highway bridge over the creek has a 28-foot channel span with a clearance of 8 feet.
Depths are about 6 feet below the bridge decreasing to 2 feet above it.
In November 1993, shoaling to an unknown depth was reported in the entrance to the creek and the deepest water was available only near the center of the channel.
Crabtown Creek, Mile 0.9, enters Manasquan River on the north side.
The staked channel has a controlling depth of about 5 feet for 0.7 mile into the northwest fork.

(See 117.1 through 117.59 and 117.733, chapter 2, for drawbridge regulations.)
The overhead power cable on the west side has a clearance of 107 feet.
The current velocity is about 2.2 knots at the highway bridge.
The State Route 70 highway bridge over Manasquan River at Riviera Beach has a bascule span with a clearance of 15 feet.
(See 117.1 through 117.59 and 117.727, chapter 2, for drawbridge regulations.)
Small-craft facilities are along Cooks Creek, Crabtown Creek, and tributaries, and up Manasquan River near the two bridges a mile inside Manasquan Inlet, and near Point Pleasant and Riviera Beach.
Commercial fishing wharves, a 300-ton railway, and other small-craft facilities are along Wills Hole Thoroughfare, westward of Cooks Creek.
In November 1993, depths of 2 to 12 feet were available.
Mariners should favor the south side of the waterway for deepest water.
(See the small-craft facilities tabulation on chart 12324 for services and supplies available.)
From Manasquan Inlet, the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway follows the dredged channel in Manasquan River to Mile 2.7 where it turns south into the Point Pleasant Canal.
The 1.9-mile narrow land cut has bulkheaded sides; vessels are required to pass (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) through at a safe speed to avoid damage to structures and boats.
Local sources, including both bridge tenders and the Marine Police, verified present data which indicate that the tides are greatly affected by winds, therefore, diminishing any regularity in the tidal cycle.
Mariners should consider the following precautionary measures before transiting the canal: 1.
The time differential of the tidal cycle between the Mansaquan reference station, located at the railroad bridge crossing the Manasquan River, and Point Pleasant Canal is reported to be about 3 hours.
2.
The safest time to transit the canal is at slack high water.
3.
Existing wind conditions, in relation to tides, are extremely important factors to be considered when picking the time to transit.
4.
Navigators should be especially precautious of two-way traffic and of following too close, particularly at the bridges.
At Mile 3.0, State Route 88 highway bridge crosses the canal to the town of Point Pleasant, on the east side of the canal; the bridge has a vertical lift span with clearances of 31 feet down and 66 feet up.

Mullica River, which empties into the northwestern part of Great Bay, is navigable to a milldam 20 miles above the bay.
In June 1998, it was reported a depth of about 5 feet can be carried across the Great Bay flats to the mouth of the river.
Once inside the river, the water is deep and the midchannel is clear for a long distance.
In June 1998, it was reported that depths of 8 to 4 feet can be carried from the mouth of Mullica River to the bridge 16 miles above the entrance, and thence 2Â½ feet to within a mile of the milldam.
A lighted cutoff, 3 miles above the mouth, has ample depth and reduces distances to points on the upper river by about 2 miles.
The navigation of Mullica River is fairly easy in the lower reaches, but the chart should be followed closely to avoid the unmarked 3-foot shoals in the entrance.
The last few miles to the milldam are shallow, difficult, and full of stumps.
The river is marked by lights and stake daybeacons as far as the first bridge; stake daybeacons mark the reaches above the bridge.
The fixed highway bridge, 6.5 miles above the mouth of Mullica River, has a clearance of 30 feet; overhead power cables, 500 feet above the bridge, have a clearance of 50 feet.
