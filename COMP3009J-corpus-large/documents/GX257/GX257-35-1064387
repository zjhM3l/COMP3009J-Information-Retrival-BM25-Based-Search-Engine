Chapter 24 Psychosocial Aspects of Diabetes in Adult Populations Patrick J. Lustman, PhD, and Jeffrey A. Gavard, PhD SUMMARY
A
number of studies during the past decade have investigated the comorbidity of mental illness and diabetes.
Studies that used structured diagnostic interviews found that the mean prevalence of current depression in diabetic subjects was 14.0% in controlled studies and 15.4% in uncontrolled studies.
These rates are at least three times the 3%-4% prevalence of major depressive disorder found in the general adult population of the Unit ed St ates.
Investigations that used depression symptom scales found that the range of clinically significant depression symptomatology in diabetic subjects was 21.8%-60.0% (mean, 31.6%) in controlled studies and 10.0%-28.0% (mean, 19.6%) in uncon t ro lled s t u d ies. Thes e findings s upport an increased prevalence of depression in diabetes relative to the general adult population.
Whether depression is more common in diabetes than in other chronic diseases, however, is far less supported by the literature.
It is a prevalent clinical belief that depression in diabetes is secondary to psychosocial hardship brought on by increasing severity of the diabetes.
Studies that have examined this relationship, however, did not find statistically significant associations between depression and severity of diabetes in 25 of 32 measurements.
If a positive relationship does exist between depression and diabetes severity, it is not obvious and has defied convincing documentation.
The presence of diabetes complications alone may not result in depression unless severe functional limitations such as blindness, impotence, and cognitive impairment are present.
The nature of depression in diabetes is complex, and adverse life events, severity of the medical illness, genetic and personality factors, and psychiatric history are all likely contributors to its occurrence.
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders other than depression in diabetes has not been extensively studied.
There is evidence that anxiety disorders are significantly more common in this group, particularly generalized anxiety disorder and simple phobia.
The 507
prevalence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in diabetes is unknown, but interest in these disorders remains high because of their potential for adverse effects on glycemic control.
Prevalence studies involving these eating disorders have examined very small numbers of subjects, were uncontrolled, or varied greatly in their case definition.
The relationship between stress and glucose regulation in diabetes has been the subject of considerable study, but findings have been inconsistent.
Stress has been reported to increase, decrease, or have no significant effect on diabetic glycemic control.
Identifying diabetic subgroups whose disease is influenced by stress will require consideration of differences among groups from both a physiologic and psychologic perspective.
The threshold for the reporting of diabetes symptoms may be lowered by psychological factors, particularly depression and anxiety, and both psychological and physiolog ical factors may contribute to d i a b etes symptoms.
Depression, but not glycosylated hemoglobin level, was found to be highly correlated with reported diabetes symptoms.
Similar degrees of nocturnal penile tumescence irregularities were reported in diabetic patients with and without impotence, implying that organic factors do not account for all cases of diabetic erectile failure.
The efficacy of psychotropic medication for psychiatric disorders in diabetic populations is largely unknown.
In one study, tricyclic antidepressant treatment resulted in complete remission of lower extremity pain in diabetic neuropathy patients, with concomitant relief of depression.
In another study, 8 weeks of treatment with nortriptyline resulted in a significant reduction in depression symptoms.
These and other conventional antidepressant agents, however, have side effects that may limit their use in persons with diabetes.
Thus, psychotherapy may have a prominent place in the diabetes treatment armamentarium.
PREVALENCE OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN ADULT DIABETIC POPULATIONS
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER A proliferation of studies investigating the comorbidity of mental illness and diabetes has occurred during the past decade1.
Depression may have special clinical relevancy in diabetes through its purported association with poor glycemic control and decreased adherence to treatment modalities.
Ten controlled studies211 (Tables 24.1 and 24.2)1 and 11 uncontrolled studies12-22 (Table 24.3)1 have been performed to investigate the prevalence of depression in adult diabetic populations.
These studies addressed two issues: 1) whether diabetes was associated with an increased prevalence of depression, and 2) whether diabetes could be differentiated from other somatic illnesses in the risk of depression.
The range of the prevalence of current depression obtained from st ructured diagnostic interviews in samples of diabetic subjects was 8.5%-27.3% (mean, 14.0%) in controlled studies (Table 24.2)1 and 11.0%19.9% (mean, 15.4%) in uncontrolled studies (Table 24.3)1.
These rates are at least three times the 3%-4% prevalence of major depressive disorder found in the general adult population of the United States.
InvestiTable 24.1
gations using depression symptom scales corroborated these findings, as the range of clinically significant depression symptomatology in diabetic samples was 21.8%-60.0% (mean, 31.6%) in controlled studies (Table 24.2)1 and 10.0%-28.0% (mean, 19.6%) in uncontrolled studies (Table 24.3)1.
An increased prevalence of depression in diabetes relative to the general adult population is highly suggested by these studies 1.
Whether depression is more common in diabetes than in other chronic diseases is far less supported by the literature.
A controlled community interview study in Lo s Angele s,CA2 f o u n d a s i g n ificantly incr eased pr e v a l en ce of lifetime depr es sion for diabetes (14.4%), as well as for arthritis (14.3%), heart disease (18.6%), hypertension (16.4%), and chronic lung disea se (17.9 %) re la tive to he a lthy c o n t ro l subje c t s (6.9%).
This study, however, suffered from numerous biases and methodological problems (Table 24.4)1.
The controlled community interview study in Germany3, which was the strongest investigation from a bias adjustment and methodological standpoint (Table 24.4)1, found an increased, although nonsignificant, prevalence of current depression in diabetic individuals (27.3%) compared with individuals with another somatic illness (20.3%; Table 24.2)1.
An increased prevalence of depression in diabetes relative to other somatic illnesses remains unproven until further research is performed1.

Spurious depression prevalence estimates could have resulted if diabetic and control nondiabetic individuals differed significantly on variables known to be associated with an increased risk of depression1.
Such factors include age 30-44 years, female, low socioeconomic status, obesity, assortative mating, concomitant medical illness in the diabetic or control nondiabetic sample, and disease severity (Table 24.4)1.
Methodological issues, such as a lack of physician verification of self-reported diabetes, variability in the time frame of depression being assessed, small sample sizes, and low participation rates could have also hindered the validity of findings1.
Although all 10 controlled studies accounted for some factors through either sample selection or analyses, many potential biases were not addressed (Table 24.4) 1.
Despite the potential biases and methodological difficulties, the increased prevalence of depression in diabetes relative to the general adult population likely signifies a true association1.
The relationship was found for three of four interview studies and all six 509
corroborating depression symptom scale studies, despite the variety of diabetic and nondiabetic samples used and the different depression assessment methods employed.
Future studies are needed that will address the potential biases and methodological issues outlined above to identify the absolute strength of this association.
Studies are also needed that investigate depression according to sex, emphasize lifetime depression, and further discriminate between nonspecific effects of chronic illness and depression specifically related to diabetes1.
EATING DISORDERS Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia have been poorly studied in persons with diabetes.
The former is characterized by extreme aversion to food, resulting in radical weight loss.
Self-induced vomiting, vigorous exercise, and diuretic abuse may also help to accomplish that end.
The latter is identified by frequent binge eating with accompany ing

purging, usually by self-induced vomiting.
Fasting between binges and laxatives also may be used to maintain weight at normal or below normal levels.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in diabetes predominantly occur in young women, and the onset of diabetes generally precedes the onset of the eating disorder23,24.
Both eating disorders are aided through specific use of the diabetic condition, with accompanying harmful sequelae25.
For example, diabetic individuals with anorexia nervosa may fail to eat after taking insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia.
Diabetic patients with bulimia may intentionally lower their insulin dosage during binging to avoid weight gain, resulting in acute hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketoacidosis.
Such binging and purging frequently results in wildly varying blood glucose levels and poor glycemic control.
An increased risk of diabetic complications may result26,27.
The prevalence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia in diabetes is currently unknown.
Diabetic women with eating disorders may be reluctant to talk about them and physicians may not ask about aberrant eating patterns unless severe emaciation is present or glycemic control is poor with no apparent cause.
The few prevalence studies that have been performed have varied greatly in their estimates, due mainly to differences in case definition.
Controlled studies that used psychiatric diagnostic interviews with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Assoc i a ti o n (D SM-I II-R ) c r i t e r i a found no difference in the prevalence of bulimia between diabetic and nondiabetic groups (5.6% versus 3.0%28 and 1.8% versus 0.0%29).
These differences Table 24.5
were based on very small case numbers of 3 versus 228 and 1 versus 029.
Another controlled study examined anorexia nervosa and bulimia symptomatology on a single continuum30.
Diabetic women were found to have a greater prevalence of clinically significant anor e xic- bu l i m i c sy mptomatolo gy than nondiabetic women (4.9% versus 0.0%, p
This finding was based on case numbers of 2 versus 0 and was not diagnostic for an eating disorder.
Uncontrolled studies using DSM-III diagnostic criteria in self-report questionnaires found much higher prevalences of bulimia in diabetic women.
The estimates ranged from 11.9%-35.0%31-33.
One explanation is that the more stringent DSM-III-R criteria required quantification of binging episodes (at least two per week for at least 3 months) as well as some method of purging (self-induced vomiting, laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or vigorous exercise), whereas DSM-III criteria did not33.
The prevalence of eating disorders in diabetes may thus vary widely depending on which diagnostic criteria are employed.
Greater reporting of bulimia may have also occurred due to the anonymity of a questionnaire.
Response rates, however, were as low as 30%32.
An increased prevalence of eating disorders in diabetes relative to the general population remains unproven.
OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Three controlled diagnostic interview studies have examined the prevalence of psychiatric disord er s other than depression in adult diabetic populations2-4

(Table 24.5).
In a study in Germany3, the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder of any severity other than depression was virtually identical between diabetic in div iduals (15.8%) and healthy control subjects (15.6%) but was twice as high in those with other somatic diseases (30.4%; p
The diabetic group, other somatic illness group, and healthy control group had prevalences of mild psychiatric disorders (including depression) of 23.6%, 24.7%, and 10.7%, respectively, and of moderate to severe psychiatric disorders of 19.5%, 26.0%, and 15.5%, respectively (p
O n e diff e re n c e between diabetic individuals and healthy control subjects thus appeared to be more mild ps y c h ia t ric dis ord e rs in th e di ab etes group.
These findings, as well as the very high prevalence of depression in the diabetic group (27.3%; Table 24.2), indicate that diabetes may have a special propensity for depression and not for other psychiatric illnesses, and that persons with diabetes may be especially at risk for mild cases of depression1.
Differences between diabetic and control subjects in ps ychiat ric dis orders ot her than de pression were found in other studies.

insulin release.
These actions serve to increase glucose levels in the blood.
Stress in diabetic individuals has also been traditionally viewed as a hyperglycemic stimulus.
The hyperglycemic effect of stress in diabetes, however, has eluded consistent documentation.
Stress has been reported to increase35-37, decrease38-40, or have no significant effect41-45 on diabetic glucose regulation.
The response to stress may not be uniform across all persons with diabetes.
Controlled laboratory studies do suggest that the stress-blood glucose response is reliable within diabetic individuals44.
Recent studies have focused on the role of coping styles in moderating the relationship of stress and glucose regulation.
Stress has been associated with poor glycemic control in diabetic persons whose keynote response to stress was one of anger or lacking in stoicism46.
Coping styles marked by avoidance, detachment, or denial may also adversely affect glycemic control in diabetes, as well as compliance with diabetic treatment regimens47,48.
The study of stress in diabetes has arguably drawn more attention than any other psychosocial area of investigation in the disease.
The inconsistent nature of the findings has served to document that the role of stress in diabetic persons may be far more complex than in nondiabetic individuals.
The effects of stress in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are influenced by aberrant regulation of stress hormones, the relative presence of insulin at the time of stress, and autonomic nervous system abnormalities associated with diabetic neuropathy, as well as individual psychological differences49.
Identifying diabetic subgroups whose disease is responsive to stress will require researchers to consider host differences from both a physiologic and psychologic perspective.
RELATIONSHIP OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS TO THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF DIABETES
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AND THE REPORTING OF DIABETES SYMPTOMS Diabetes is a progressive metabolic disorder with cumulative symptoms across multiple organ systems.
Physical symptoms are frequently reflexively attributed to diabetes with little consideration given to the potential role of psychological factors in their production and/or maintenance.
Evidence is beginning to emerge suggesting that psychological as well as diabetic factors may contribute to the reporting of gastrointestinal50, metabolic51, and neuropathic52,53 symptoms in diabetes.
A study was made of the relationship of depression to 512
STRESS AND GLUCOSE REGULATION The effect of stress on glucose regulation has been the subject of considerable study.
Acute stress in the general population typically results in an increase in heart rate, high-amplitude galvanic skin response, vasoconstriction in the peripheral vascular system, and elevated levels of skeletal muscle activity.
Stress also causes increased production of pituitary hormones, catecholamines, corticosteroids, and suppression of
the reporting of symptoms typically presumed to result from diabetes51.
Scores for individual symptoms were correlated with glucose regulation (HbA1 and fasting plasma glucose) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory Scale).
The findings are summarized in Table 24.651.
HbA1 was poorly correlated with nine of 11 symptoms and made a significant independent contribution only to the reporting of polyuria.
Findings were similar when fasting plasma glucose was used as the measure of glucose regulation.
Depression was correlated with nine symptoms and had a significant independent effect on the reporting of two of three hyperglycemic symptoms, five of six hypoglycemic symptoms, and both nonspecific symptoms.
Diabetes symptom reporting may be more related to depressive mood than to conventional markers of glucose control.
Diabetes symptoms may also be unreliable in dicators of poor contr o l wh en fea t ur e s suggestive of depression are present.
Another study further illustrates how psychological factors may influence the clinical presentation of diabetes50.
Symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal motor dysfunction were examined for their relationship with diabetic neuropathy and psychiatric illness.
Log-linear analysis revealed that each group of symptoms (upper gastrointestinal symptoms, altered bowel habits, and abdominal discomforts) was significantly associated with psychiatric illness (p

Only symptom groups were examined since the number of subjects undergoing autonomic nerve testing was small.

symptoms were also found to be more related to psychiatric illness than to peripheral neuropathy (Table 24.7)50.
Psychological factors, pa rt icularly depression and anxiety, may lower the threshold for the reporting of diabetes symptoms.
This may be especially prevalent in the area of sexual dysfunction.
Impotence in diabetic men may result from neuropathic or vascular complications associated with their diabetes.
Psychiatric illness, however, is also associated with sexual dysfunction in that at least 25% of depressed nondiabetic males complain of impotence.
Sexual dysfunction in diabetes may thus at times be falsely ascribed to neurovascular disease.
Abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence, frequently thought to be confirmatory of an organic pathogenesis, has been observed in nondiabetic depress ed individuals54,55.
These anomalous physiological findings normalized upon resolution of the depressive episode.
A similar degree of nocturnal penile tumescence irregularities was reported in diabetic patients with and without impotence56, implying that organic factors do not account for all cases of diabetic erectile failure.
Psycholo gical as we ll as physiolog ical factors may contribute to d i a b etes symptom re porting and should be consid ered in causal speculations.

RELATIONSHIP OF DEPRESSION TO DIABETES SEVERITY It is a prevalent clinical belief that depression in diabetes is secondary to psychosocial hardship brought on by increasing severity of the medical condition.
Despite its intuitive appeal, such a hypothesis has been difficult to prove.
Severity of diabetes has been examined in numerous ways, including duration of di ab e t e s , p re s en c e o f di ab etes complications, and 513

functional limitations perpetuated by worsening diabetes.
While one study found a significant correlation between depression symptomatology and the duration of diabetes6, other investigations reported no association between diabetes duration and either major depres sive disorder15 or depression sy m p to ma to logy19,20.
One explanation for this inconsistent relationship between diabetes duration and depression is that diabetic patients may adapt psychologically to their medical illness over time.
Another explanation is that the onset of depression usually precedes the diagnos i s of non - insulin -dependent diabetes mellit us (NIDDM) and recurrent episodes of depression are common in the early stages of this form of diabetes.
Eleven studies have examined the association of depression with different measures of diabetes severity46,15,17,19,20,57-60 (Table 24.8).
One 10-year prospective study reported that coronary heart disease had developed at followup in 39% of diabetic patients who had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder at baseline, compared with only 15% of diabetic patients w h o w e r e n o t de pr e s s e d at initia l examin ation (p
S u ch positive findings, however, have been the exception.
Statistically significant associations between depression and severity of diabetes were not found in 25 of 32 measurements (Table 24.8).
If a positive relationship does exist between depression and diabetes severity, it is not obvious and has defied convincing documentation.
The lack of a consistent association between depresTable 24.8
sion and diabetes severity is counterintuitive, and further studies are needed to ascertain the true nature of the relationship.
The presence of diabetes complications alone may not result in depression unless severe functional limitations, such as blindness, impotence, and cognitive impairment, are present.
Depression may be related to other indices of advancing disease, such as changes in cerebral vasculature 4.
Inconsistencies in the definition of diabetes severity itself may also explain the lack of a significant association with depres sion.
For example, asymptomatic nerve conduction velocity, as well as debilitat ing neuropathic symptoms, may both be deemed positive for diabetic neuropathy.
The nature of depression in diabetes is complex, and adverse life events, severity of the medical illness, genetic and personality factors, and psychiatric history are all likely contributors to its occurrence.
PSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENTS IN ADULT DIABETIC POPULATIONS
PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES IN DIABETES The efficacy of psychotropic medication for criteriadefined psychiatric disorders in diabetic populations is largely unknown.
While such studies have been conducted on groups of primary care patients that included patients with diabetes, the outcome in this subset was not analyzed and reported separately61-63.
Two controlled studies have examined the effect of psychopharmacological therapies in diabetic patients.
In one, tricyclic antidepressant treatment resulted in complete remission of lower extremity pain in diabetic neuropathy patients, with concomitant relief of depression52.
In the second study, 8 weeks of treatment with nortriptyline resulted in a significant reduction in depression symptoms64.
The conventional antidepressant agents have side-effect profiles that may limit their use in persons with diabetes (Table 24.9)65.
I n s o m n i a , agitation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug interactions that are not specifically relevant to diabetes may also be encountered66-69.
Antidepressant agents may provoke cardiac arrhythmias and conduction delays as well as induce dangerous orthostatic hypotension66-68.
This risk may be even greater in diabetic individuals.
While the reduced chance for weight gain with fluoxetine increases the attraction of this agent in NIDDM, intolerance to the medication from nonspecific gastrointestinal distress or from overstimulation may limit its use65.

PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES IN DIABETES Important advancements in the treatment of affective and anxiety disorders have been realized over the past decade using the techniques of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT)70,71.
CBT evolved from observations that depression is characterized by habitual errors in thinking that are themselves amenable to systematic reprogramming.
Depression is removed by sys t e m a ti cally chall e nging "unrealistic" negative thinking, including negative predictions ("I'll always be alone") and overgeneralizations ("nothing ever goes right for me").
The techniques of CBT may not be fully effective for depression in diabetes because there is a certain negative realism in thinking that often attends the experience of advancing diabetes ("I'll never be the same sexually"; "I won't be able to see like other people").
Nevertheless, psychotherapy
may have a uniquely prominent place in the treatment armamentarium because antidepressant medications may interfere with diabetes or be contraindicated by extant comorbid medical conditions.
Despite a large literature in nondiabetic subjects, there have been no studies of the efficacy of CBT for depression or other psychiatric disorders in diabetes.
Controlled outcome studies of psychotherapy for DSM-IV-defined psychiatric disorders are needed.
