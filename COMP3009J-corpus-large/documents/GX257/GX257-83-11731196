U. S. Government Passenger Transportation Handbook June 7, 2000 FOREWARD This handbook sets forth regulations and procedures governing procurement, billing, and payment of passenger transportation services for the account of the United States Government.
In accordance with Public Law 105-264, October 19, 1998, and the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998, the U.S. Government travel charge card is the required method used by the Government to procure passenger transportation and related services from commercial transportation service providers (TSPs).
However, the U.S. Government Transportation Request (GTR), Optional Form 1169 may only be used in certain travel situations.
This guide replaces the 1994 edition entitled, "GTRs How to Prepare and Process U.S. Government Transportation Requests."
It was developed in conjunction with the revision of 41 CFR 10141.2 (now 41 CFR 102-118) and the Federal Travel Regulations.
It was developed to assist administrative and fiscal personnel who prepare and process travel documents as well as individual Government travelers.
Careful application of the principles and instructions in this guide will result in greater efficiency in the procurement of transportation services for the Government, improved TSP services, and conservation of travel funds.
The General Services Administration prescribes regulations governing the use of travel documents that are published in 41 CFR 102-118.
This handbook is published to aid in the implementation of these regulations.

INTRODUCTION Passenger Transportation Services Furnished for the Account of the United States Government in accordance with 41 CFR 102-118.200(b) Selection of the method of transportation Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), 41 CFR 301-10.4 requires agencies to select the transportation most advantageous to the Government, when cost and other f considered.
Under 5 U.S.C. 5733, travel must be by the most expeditious transportation practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of official method of actors are means of duties.
Methods of common TSP transportation an agency may authorize Airline Train Ship Bus Methods of procuring passenger transportation services The required method of payment for authorized official travel is the Government Travel Card.
In accordance with Public Law 105-264, Section 2, Government Transportation Requests (GTRs) should only be used when a waiver has been granted (see Chapter 3).
Cash should be used only to pay for those expenses which, as a general rule, cannot be charged in accordance with FTR, 301-51.100, 51.101, and 72.200.
Such services, regardless of the procurement method specified by the agency, must be 1 procured directly from either a Travel Management Center (TMC) or a travel agent.
A travel agent may be used only as prescribed in the FTR or applicable regulations of the Department of Defense (DOD).
Government agencies should encourage travelers to use TMCs for all common TSP arrangements.
NOTE: Effective January 1, 2001, Government travelers are required to use TMCs selected by their agency.
1 For the purposes of this handbook the term "Travel Management Center" refers to both TMCs and Commercial Travel Offices (CTOs).
6 REQUIRED METHODS: (1) Government Contractor-issued Travel Card (GCTC) a.
Individually billed b. Centrally billed account (2) Government Transportation Request (use only when waiver has been granted) ALTERNATIVE METHODS: Government contractor-issued travelers check Cash obtained from an advance Frequent traveler credits Personal funds, including cash or a personal charge card Agency heads or their designees may specify which of these Government-provided methods of payment, or combination thereof, travelers will use to procure official passenger transportation services.
Use of Contract City-Pair Fares Contract City-Pair fares must always be used if such fares are available, except as stated in 41 CFR 301-10.107.
NOTE: City-pair contractors are not required to accept payment other than by methods (1) and (2) above (41 CFR 301-51.1).
Restrictions Issuing officers and travelers must adhere to the regulations requiring the use of U.S. flag TSPs, when available, for travel on official business.
The Comptroller General of the United States prescribes guidelines (4 CFR 52) for the use of U.S. flag vessels and certificated U.S. flag air TSPs.
Expenditures for service furnished by a foreign flag TSP generally will be allowed only when service by a U.S. flag certificated TSP is "unavailable".
See Chapter 7 for details.
It is the policy of the Government that lowest cost coach accommodations will be used for all modes of passenger transportation.
Special train accommodations i.e., sleeping car, club car, reserved coach, and extra-fare trains, steam ship travel, and other than lowest cost air coach travel may only be used if authorized and approved due to special circumstances.
See 41 CFR 301-10.4 and 301-72.1.
7 Mandatory Terms and Conditions governing the use of U. S. Government passenger transportation documents The U.S. Government will not be responsible for charges exceeding those applicable to the transportation or accommodations of the type, class, or character authorized in passenger transportation documents.
The issuing official, by his signature, certifies that the requested transportation is for official business.
TSP shall not honor requests showing erasures or alterations not validated by initials of the issuing official.
TSP shall insert date on which travel commenced, if known.
Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on overcharges made hereunder and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982.
Government travel must be via the lowest cost available which meets travel requirements; e.g. Government contract fare, through, group, excursion, or reduced one-way or round-trip fare.
This should be done by entering the term "lowest coach" on the U.S. Government travel document if the specific fare basis is not known.
U.S. Government passenger transportation documents must be use as method of payment for all official travel expenses.
U.S. Government passenger transportation documents should be in accordance with FTR Chapter 300 and 301, FMR 102-117 (40 CFR 102-117), and the "U.S. Government Passenger Transportation" handbook.
Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part, FMR 102-117 (40 CFR 102-117) and the "U.S. Government Passenger Transportation" handbook.
Interest on overcharges using a charge card shall accrue from the "Run Date" on the Notice of Overcharge and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of Treasury pursuant to the Dept Collection Act of 1982.
8 CHAPTER 2.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR-ISSUED TRAVEL CARD (GCTC) On November 30, 1998, the United States Government implemented a new charge card program, which replaced the American Express travel card.
This new program is called "GSA SmartPay."
This new program issues Government Travel Cards (GTCs) as VISA or MasterCard cards.
These Government contractor-issued travel cards (GCTC) when authorized should be used to the maximum extent possible for official travel expenses (41 CFR 301-51.100).
GTCs are issued SmartPay logo in and "For Official purchased using t with unique prefixes and account numbers.
Each card displays the GSA the upper right corner and includes the phrases, "United States of America" Government Use Only CPP" centered at the top.
Official travel can be he Travel Card or the Integrated Card as shown below: TRAVEL CARD INTEGRATED CARD For additional information on the SmartPay program visit the SmartPay website at: http://www.fss.gsa.gov/services/gsa-smartpay or contact the General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service, Services Acquisition Center (FCX), 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-6658.

13 The GTR may be used to purchase: Tickets and/or transportation for individual or group travel.
Quantities of tickets or tokens under the bulk purchase plan.
Tickets issued under blanket arrangements covering definite periods of time.
Charter, contract, tender, or quotation services.
Excess baggage service only.
Quantity (bulk) ticket purchases At the discretion of an agency head or his designee, an issuing officer may issue a single GTR, identified as "Bulk Purchase" (see figure 2, block 8) to procure quantities of transportation tickets, as well as tickets or tokens for intracity transportation involving local or short-haul transit service.
These bulk purchases are restricted to the following situations: A continuing substantial volume of individual travel via the same mode and class of transportation is required between one origin and one destination; and Each one-way single fare for such transportation does not exceed $250 for the round-trip, exclusive of Federal transportation tax; and Each group of tickets or tokens is to be used within any one 60-day period of a fiscal year.
Tickets so procured must be annotated: "GOVERNMENT" and "NOT REDEEMABLE FOR CASH EXCEPT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT."
All stocks of tickets and tokens must be subjected to specific accountability controls.
Agency responsibility Each agency adopting the quantity-ticket-purchase method shall issue internal instructions clearly defining the particular circumstances and conditions under which transportation tickets may be purchased in quantity.
Further, each agency shall establish specific accountability controls for stocks of tickets and tokens and for periodically reviewing its regulations to ensure maintenance of a reasonable and objective quantity purchase program.
Multiple ticket purchases under single (blanket) GTRs 14 Federal agencies must sign agreements with TMCs (see NOTE below) in order to use blanket GTRs.
Under the provisions of these agreements, a blanket GTR is issued at the beginning of each calendar week or other payment period, mutually agreed upon by the agency and the TMC, to cover all tickets issued during the period, not to exceed one month.
A listing must be maintained to show the number and value of each ticket issued under the blanket GTR, as well as other information essential to agency and TSP fiscal requirements.
TMCs, being agents of the TSPs, must follow TSP ticket issuing and billing procedures (see Chapter 9).
Completely unused tickets procured on a previously paid blanket GTR and all partially unused tickets shall be redeemed under the procedures utilizing SF 1170 (see Chapter 5).
NOTE: GSA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and DOD have entered into contracts with certain travel agencies for the issuance of TSP tickets for Government travel and for other transportation services.
Travel agencies that have contracts with GSA (on behalf of all civilian Government agencies except NASA) and NASA are referred to as Travel Management Centers (TMCs), and those having contracts with DOD are referred to as Commercial Travel Offices (CTOs).
Prohibitions The GTR shall NOT be issued: To procure individual passenger transportation services costing $10 or less, exclusive of transportation tax (unless justified by special circumstances).
To procure air excess baggage service costing $15 or less for each leg of a trip (unless justified by special circumstances).

To pay for toll road or toll bridge charges.
To obtain transportation services or privileges desired but not required for official business, including extra-fare trains or planes, stopovers, and indirect routings.
The GTR shall be issued only for the portion of the transportation expenses properly chargeable to the Government.
Charges for services other than those authorized must be borne by the traveler and collected from him/her by the TSP or TMC.
THE ISSUANCE OF A GTR AFTER A SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED OR THE ISSUANCE OF A DUPLICATE GTR IS PROHIBITED.
15 Control and accountability Agencies shall maintain accountability records and physical control of GTR stock.
Effective physical control should include storage of GTR stock in a locked container or locked storage room.
Employees responsible for the issuance and use of GTR forms shall be held accountable for their disposition.
Travelers or those who are accountable are responsible for the custody of TSP tickets and other transportation documents received in exchange for GTRs or other procuring instruments.
Failure to safeguard such documents may result in personal liability; of the traveler or those who are accountable, if unauthorized persons use tickets or documents.
Lost or stolen GTRs The person that is accountable must report a lost or stolen GTR promptly, in writing, to the appropriate agency office.
If the lost or stolen GTR shows the TSP or agent tendered to, service desired, and point of origin, then the named TSP or agent and other local TSPs must also be notified promptly in writing.
A GTR reported as lost or stolen but subsequently recovered must not be used under any circumstances.
The word "CANCELLED" should be marked on the face of the GTR and it should be forwarded immediately through the issuing office to the office maintaining accountability records.
Cancelled GTRs A GTR that is spoiled during preparation, cancelled, or prepared for issuance but not used should be marked "CANCELLED" across the face and forwarded at once through the issuing office to the office maintaining accountability records.
Disposing of obsolete, spoiled, cancelled, or unused GTRs Obsolete GTRs, as well as GTRs spoiled in preparation, cancelled, or otherwise unused, should be returned to the office in each agency that maintains accountability of those forms.
The accountable office must provide a list of the GTR numbers which are obsolete, spoiled, cancelled, or otherwise unused to the GSA Federal Supply Service, General Products Commodity Center (7FXM-W S), 819 Taylor Street, Room 6A24, Fort W orth, TX. 76102.
After the General Products Commodity Center has notified the sender that the GTR numbers have been received, the GTRs may be destroyed in accordance with applicable regulations.
The National Archives and Records Administration provides instructions for the retention and disposal of GTRs in General Records Schedule 9 and 36 CFR 1228.
These instructions can be viewed online under Resources at http://www.nara.gov/records/.
16 TSP validation of GTRs TSPs or their agents (TMCs) must: Not honor a GTR that is incomplete, unsigned, or shows erasures or alterations that have not been initialed by the issuing officer.
Require that the GTRs be completely filled out and properly signed by the issuing officer so as to be valid for presentation to obtain transportation services and/or accommodations.
Require the person presenting a valid GTR to establish his identity as the traveler or the party authorized to receive the ticket, exchange order, refund slip, or other transportation document.
In the absence of satisfactory identification, the TSP will not honor the GTR.
Not accept the memorandum card copy (OF 1169-A) of the GTR in lieu of the original (OF 1169).
GTR identification on tickets and coupons TSPs shall stamp or endorse each coupon of the ticket, exchange order or other transportation document with the words "U.S.
GOVERNMENT" and the serial number of the GTR authorizing the service.
Each Government Excess Baggage Authorization/Ticket (GEBAT) shall show the GTR number, the complete name and address of the agency to which charges applicable to the excess baggage services shall be billed, and the name of the traveler, as shown on the authorizing GTR. 17 PREPARING THE GTR Issuing office responsibilities A GTR must be completely and properly filled out and signed by the issuing officer because: a) TSPs or their agents will not honor a GTR which is incomplete, unsigned, or shows erasures or alterations that are not initialed by the issuing officer.
b) An improperly executed GTR compromises an agency's ability to perform a technical audit of the paid GTR and pursue any overcharge claims on behalf of the Government.
Entries other than signatures should be typed whenever possible or printed in ink.
It is essential that the carbon impressions of entries be clear and easily readable on all copies.
A GTR must be prepared and given to the TSP/TMC in exchange for each ticket.
If a blanket GTR is used to purchase multiple tickets issued during a designated payment period, the GTR must be given to the TSP/TMC prior to issuance of the first ticket.
Since the GTR is both a procurement document and a contract document, issuing officers are prohibited from giving only a GTR number to the TSP/TMC in lieu of an actual GTR.
The memorandum card copy (OF 1169-A) must be prepared simultaneously with the original (OF 1169) and must clearly show all information other than signatures that appear on the original at the time of surrender for service.
Government travel must be via the lowest cost fare available, which meets travel requirements; e.g., Government contract fare, through, group, excursion, or reduced oneway or round-trip fare.
The lowest cost fare available is the one for which the traveler meets all conditions.
The issuing officer must assure that a request is conveyed to the TSP or its agent; for the lowest cost, fully refundable coach fare available, by entering the term "lowest coach" in "CARRIER (TSP) AND CLASS OF SERVICE" (block 12) on the GTR.
If the specific fare basis is known, it should also be entered in the "CARRIER (TSP) AND CLASS OF SERVICE" block of the GTR. 18 Figure 2.

ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PROCURING PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION Use of cash Travelers must comply with the rules in 41 CFR 301-72, Subpart C that limit the use of cash.
One of the following payment methods to procure common TSP transportation is considered the equivalent of cash (41 CFR 301-51.101): (a) (b) Personal credit cards; Cash withdrawals obtained from an ATM using a Government contractor-issued individually billed travel; card Checks, both personal and travelers (including those obtained through a travel payment system services program). (c) For passenger transportation services costing: (a) (b) $10 or less, and air excess baggage charge of $15 or less for each leg of a trip more than $10, but not more $100 Travelers are required to use a Government contractor-issued travel card (GCTC) or GTR to procure common TSP transportation services.
Cash may only be used under emergency circumstances or when use of GCTCs or GTRs is impracticable or not accepted.
Also, cash may only be used when the travelers' agency authorizes the use of group, charter, or excursion arrangements.
(See 41 CFR 301-51.100 and 41 CFR 301-51.101).
Unauthorized Cash Purchase of Common TSP Transportation If you are a new employee or an invitational or infrequent traveler who procedures for purchasing common TSP transportation, your reimbursement for the full cost of the transportation.
In all ot reimbursement will be limited to the cost of such transportation using the payment (41 CFR 301-51.102). is unaware of proper agency may allow her instances, your authorized method of 41 CHAPTER 5.
REFUNDS General The following circumstances result in unused passenger transportation documents: (a) (b) (c) (d) Tickets are purchased for Government travel but are never used; Travel is terminated short of the authorized destination; The return portion of a round-trip ticket is not used; or Services actually furnished are different or of a lesser value than those authorized and the GTR cannot be so endorsed.
All adjustments in connection with official passenger transportation must be promptly processed to prevent losses to the Government.
Therefore, as soon as possible, the Government traveler must submit all unused tickets, including portions thereof, Miscellaneous Charge Orders (MCOs), Ticket Refund Applications, notices of fare adjustments, etc., and a full report of the circumstances to your agency in accordance with your agency's procedures for recovery of refunds due the Government.
(See NOTE below.)
That office is usually the one that paid the TSP or Travel Management Center (TMC) for the tickets issued to the traveler, the office that processes the traveler's travel reimbursement voucher, or the office that issued the GTR.
If a traveler is uncertain as to where to submit unused tickets, either the traveler's ordering issuing authority, or GSA's Program Support and Business Division should be consulted (see page 30).
UNUSED TICKETS HAVE MONETARY VALUE GOVERNMENT TRAVELERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE INSTRUCTED TO RETURN ALL UNUSED OR PARTIALLY UNUSED TICKETS TO THEIR AGENCY FOR PROCESSING AS A REFUND DUE THE GOVERNMENT.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD UNUSED OR PARTIALLY UNUSED TICKTS BE FILED, DESTROYED, OR THROWN AWAY! NOTE: Excess baggage coupons do not have a redemption value.
If a traveler does not use all of the excess baggage coupons prepared by the issuing TSP, the traveler must surrender them with his travel reimbursement voucher for cancellation.
42 Time Limitation Time limitations for redemption of unused tickets is controlled by specific legislation enacted by Congress.
In American Airlines Inc. v. the United States, Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) docket No. 95-1218, (1/24/96), the Court found that unused tickets (or portions of unused tickets) paid for by the Government can be recovered up to ten years from the date of purchase, based upon existing law.
This preempts any time limitations indicated on issued tickets.
Application of interest on the amount above, is calculated from thirty (30) days after the original mailing of the SF 1170 "Notice of Indebtedness."
Unused Tickets or Coupons Unavailable Lacking unused tickets or coupons as evidence of the unfurnished services, the traveler or person in charge of the group of travelers shall obtain written acknowledgement of the situation from the TSP's representative for submission with their report.
If transportation and/or accommodations are furnished for a lesser number of persons than specified on a party ticket, the TSP's conductor or ticket collector shall note on the ticket or coupon the number of persons actually transported and the number and type of accommodations furnished.
Agency Responsibility An agency must establish administrative procedures for collecting unused, partially used, and exchange tickets.
The procedures must provide: (a) W ritten instructions explaining traveler liability for the value of tickets issued until all ticket coupons are used or properly accounted for on the travel voucher; Instructions for submitting payments received from TSPs for failure to provide confirmed reserved space; The traveler with a "bill charges to" address, so that the traveler can provide this information to the TSP for returned or exchange tickets.
Procedures for promptly identifying any unused tickets, coupons, or other evidence of refund due the Government.
(b) (c) (d) 43 Refund or credit for unused transportation on an individually billed Government charge card Any charges billed directly to an individually billed Government charge card should be credited back to that account (41 CFR 301-10.115). (a) If a traveler purchases a ticket against an individual charge card, any airline ticket refund due will be the traveler's responsibility.
In this case, a traveler should return the unused or partially unused ticket to the issuer and obtain a credit card refund notice (CCRN) receipt.
The amount will be subsequently credited to the cardholder's account.
The traveler should then deduct the amount of the charge from the amount claimed on the travel voucher.
A note should be placed on the face of the travel voucher explaining that the ticket, or portion of it, was unused and a refund has been requested.
The traveler should inform the finance of notice will enable the finance office to transportation charge.
In this instance, the voucher for the ticket because the refund account.

46 Prepaid Tickets/PTAs A prepaid ticket, commonly referred to as prepaid ticket advice (PTA), is a ticket that is purchased in one location for a traveler to pick up at another location.
A prepaid ticket is usually ordered by telephone from a Travel Management Center (TMC) or air TSP.
The ticket itself is actually issued by the originating TSP at the airport in the city where the travel commences.
W hen prepaid tickets are issued the tariffs of certain scheduled air TSPs require the payment of a nonrefundable service charge, which is automatically added to the price of the ticket.
The provisions contained in some TSP's tariffs waive the service charge for official travel.
If a prepaid ticket is ordered and subsequently not used, the following procedures apply: (a) As soon as it is known that the ticket was not claimed, immediately notify the airline or TMC, which arranged the transaction that the ticket was not claimed, and will not be used.
If the ticket was prepaid through a TMC, the TMC must obtain authority f to process a refund.
Once that authority is received (usually within a few or refund will be issued according to the original form of payment.
If penalty applies to the fare, both the nonrefundable service charge and penalty will be deducted from the refund.
rom the airline days), a credit a cancellation the applicable (b) (c) If the ticket was purchased directly from the airline, authority to refund will be made immediately.
Either a credit card refund notice or a check will be sent, depending on the original form of payment.
Prepaid tickets, regardless of whether they were purchased through a TMC or an airline, are refundable only to the "billed to" office, never the Government traveler.
W hile awaiting the refund or credit, agencies should keep a record of the unclaimed ticket in their suspense file to ensure that they are correctly billed for the ticket.
If a refund or credit is not received within a reasonable time (2 weeks), agencies should contact the airline or TMC.
If a prepaid ticket is claimed by the traveler but is unused or partially unused, the unused coupons must be returned to the "billed charges to" office and processed the same as any other unused ticket.
(d) (e) NOTE ** TMCs are not automatically notified by the airline when a prepaid ticket has not been claimed.
The traveler or appropriate agency official must notify the TMC. 47 Miscellaneous Charges Order (MCOs) TSPs should not issue MCOs for exchanged, downgraded, or unused tickets purchased with GTRs.
Some TSPs occasionally issue MCOs erroneously.
The following procedures apply if an airline inadvertently issues an MCO to a Government traveler on official business: (a) An MCO issued against an original ticket purchased with a GTR should be returned to the fiscal office or designated agency official responsible for handling unused tickets.
MCOs submitted with travel vouchers should be attached to the front of the vouchers.
The traveler should annotate on the voucher that an MCO is attached.
Agencies shall issue a SF 1170 for an MCO and process it in the same manner that the SF 1170 is processed for an unused ticket purchased with a GTR (see instructions on page 50).
If an MCO employee should be same way is issued for a cash purchase or for a ticket purchased with a Government charge card, the traveler is responsible for obtaining the refund.
The MCO returned to the issuer of the original ticket and processed for refund in the that an unused ticket is processed for a refund.
(b) (c) (d) 48 Refunds From Foreign Flag TSPs (a) Standard Form 1170 and related procedures do not apply when unused passenger transportation services billed by foreign flag TSPs are involved except for: (1) Canadian or Mexican TSPs; or (2) Foreign flag TSPs maintaining billing offices in the United States.
(b) Agencies shall institute procedures to effect recoveries for such unused services by deduction or setoff from the foreign flag TSP's unpaid bills.
Both agencies and travelers in foreign areas shall be kept informed of local regulations and requirements to ensure that the interests of the United States will be protected.
Adjustments for unfurnished transportation services not reported on the SF 1170 but made by deduction or setoff shall be noted on the deduction voucher with a full description of each unused ticket or portion thereof.
In addition, the deduction voucher shall be annotated with the GTR number, the disbursing office (D.O.) voucher number, the D.O. symbol number, and the date of payment of the voucher on which the GTR was paid if other than the deduction voucher.
The unused ticket or portion thereof shall be forwarded to the TSP and a copy of the transmittal letter shall be attached to the deduction voucher involved.
(c) (d) (e) Unused Coupons For a Flight Between Two Common Rated Cities A common rated fare is a fare that applies from either of two geographically close or adjacent cities to a single destination.
W hen the fare is the same from two different points of origin, a coupon for a flight between these cities has no refundable value.
For example, a fare from San Francisco to Honolulu may be the same as the fare from Los Angeles to Honolulu.
Because of scheduling, some airlines will allow passengers to fly between San Francisco and Los Angeles at no extra cost when enroute to Honolulu.
Thus the fare from San Francisco to Los Angeles to Honolulu is the same as Los Angeles to Honolulu.
W hen this circumstance occurs, the flight segment between San Francisco and Los Angeles is good for passage, but has no refundable value.
Another example is Colorado Springs to Chicago and Denver to Chicago.
In some instances, the fares are the same, and because of scheduling, a routing through Denver is sometimes allowed.
W hen such routing happens, the flight coupon between Colorado Springs and Denver has no refundable value.
(See illustrations below) 49 Tickets That Are Only Partially Refundable Tickets Carrying Cancellation Penalties Certain types of fares carry penalties for change or cancellation, once the t penalties apply, an indication that the tickets are subject to penalties: must endorsements box at the top of each ticket.

If be written in the (those requiring penalties ranging penalties will be Round Trip Excursion Fare Tickets Used Only One Way If unrestricted round trip fare tickets are used only one way, the unused portion of the ticket should be refunded in an amount equal to one half of the round trip fare.

54 CHAPTER 6.
COMPENSATION FOR DENIED BOARDING AND VACATING SEAT VOLUNTARILY Denied boarding The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that, with a few exceptions, airline passengers "bumped" against their will (involuntary denied boarding) be compensated by the airline.
The amount depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay: Substitute scheduled compared scheduled transportation arrival time to original arrival time Amount of compensation 1/ No compensation 100% of one way fare to final destination (not to exceed $200) 200% of one way fare to final destination (not to exceed $400) W ithin 1 hour More than 1 hour later, but less than 2 hours later (4 hours on international flights) More than 2 hours later (4 hours later for international), or no substitute travel arrangements In addition to the above compensation, travelers always get to keep their original ticket and Government travelers or their agency can use it for official travel on another flight or have it refunded.
_______________ 1/ Subject to confirmed reservation and check-in requirements; does not apply to charter flights or scheduled flights with 60 passenger or less airplanes, or when "bumping" occurs because the airline substituted a smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use, or between foreign cities, and may not apply to international flights inbound to the U.S. Airlines may offer free transportation on future flights in place of a check, but travelers have the right to insist on a check if that is the choice of the Government agency paying for the travel.
55 Service delays and cancellations If requested by the traveler, many airlines will, under certain circumstances, provide a free telephone call, free overnight lodging, and/or free ground transportation to and from a local hotel when their flights are delayed or cancelled (see applicable TSP Tariff Rule 240).
DOT requires that airlines make sure passengers receive an explanation of their contract of carriage, and airline agents must answer questions about information in the airline's tariffs and must help travelers locate specific tariff rules, if necessary.
Travelers needing assistance or wishing to put a complaint about an airline on record with the DOT may call the Aviation Consumer Protection Division at (202) 366-2220 or write: Aviation Consumer Protection Division C-75 U.S. Department of Transportation 400 7th Street, SW Washington, DC 20590 Regulations governing airline overbooking, notice of terms of contract of carriage, baggage liability, and airline computer reservation systems are contained in 14 CFR 254, and 255 respectively.

This may also be viewed on line at: http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer/flyrights.htm. domestic 250, 253, available pamphlet Since the individual's travel on official business is for the account of the United States, the Government would be damaged by involuntary denied boarding, or other delay or failure as defined by DOT regulations or the TSP's tariff, and is entitled to reimbursement.
The Government traveler who has been denied confirmed reserved space must ensure that the TSP shows "Treasurer of the United States" as the payee on the compensation check (and any ticket refund check).
Government travelers must give the TSP a receipt for the check(s), retain a copy of the receipt, and forward the check(s), the copy of the receipt, and any unused ticket to the agency for deposit or reuse.
(41 CFR 301-10.116) 56
Voluntarily Surrendering Seat W hen travelers voluntarily surrender their seat; at the request of scheduled airlines, they may only be compensated when: (a) (b) Surrendering their seat does not interfere their performing official duties; W hen voluntarily surrendering their seat results in additional expense from personal funds and the traveler is not reimbursed; or As a result of volunteering the traveler is delayed during duty hours and is charged leave for the additional hours.
(c) (See 41 CFR 310-10.117) 57 CHAPTER 7.
USE OF FOREIGN-FLAG AIR OR FOREIGNFLAG OCEAN TSPs Background Travelers are required by 49 U.S.C 40118 (Fly America Act), to use U.S. flag air TSP service for all air travel funded by the U.S. Government.
The Comptroller General of the United States prescribes guidelines (4 CFR 52) for the use of U.S. flag vessels for travel on official business and of U.S. flag air TSPs holding certificates under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. 1371(1970), for Government-financed passenger transportation (including but not limited to Government dependents, consultants, grantees, contractors, and subcontractors), when such vessels and air TSPs are available.
Such use is required by 46 U.S.C. 1241 and 49 U.S.C. 40118 whether the United States pays the transportation charges to the TSP or reimburses the traveler or other entity for that expense.
The use of foreign-flag air TSPs may be authorized or approved only when U.S. flag air TSP service is unavailable as determined by the Comptroller General of the United States.
Each voucher covering expenditures involving foreign-flag ocean or foreign-flag air passenger transportation in whole or in part, whether payable to the TSP or to the traveler or other entity, must be supported by a certificate or memorandum (figure 22) as to the unavailability of U.S. flag service, signed by a responsible official of the agency that authorized the travel or transportation or by the traveler who has knowledge of the facts concerning usage.
U.S. flag certificated service - "available"/ "unavailable" Generally, passenger service by a U.S. flag air TSP is "available" if the TSP can perform the commercial foreign air transportation needed by the agency and if the service will accomplish the agency's mission.
Expenditures for service furnished by a foreign-flag air TSP generally will be allowed only when service by an U.S. flag air TSP is considered "unavailable".
For a full explanation see the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), (41 CFR 301-10.135 through 10.138) and Comptroller General Decision B-138942.
58 Certification statement The certificate supporting a voucher involving foreign flag ocean or foreign flag air service shall read substantially as shown in the following: I certify that it is/was necessary for (Name of traveler or agency) to use, or to transport personal effects/freight on, __________________________________ (Foreign-flag vessel(s) or air TSP(s)) (Flight Identification No(s).) between ____________________________and____________________________ en route from ___________________________to__________________________ on ________________________for the following reasons: __________________ (Date) ___________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ __________________ (Date) _____________________________________________ Signature of traveler or authorizing officer _____________________________________________ Title or position _____________________________________________ Organization Figure 22.
59 Employee liability for disallowed expenditures W here the travel is by indirect route or the traveler otherwise fails to use available U.S.-flag air TSP service, the amount to be disallowed against the traveler is based on the loss of revenues suffered by U.S. flag air TSPs (FTR 301-10.143, 10.181).
Sum of U.S.-flag TSP segment mileage authorized ________________________ Sum of total segment mileage authorized X Fare for official travel portion of trip MINUS Sum of U.S.-flag TSP Segment mileage traveled ________________________ Sum of total segment mileage traveled X Through (actual) fare paid The traveler is liable only if the difference is greater than zero.
For a full explanation of the formula for determining traveler liability see 56 Comptroller General 209 (1977).

No duplicate payments are made.
(Procedures and controls must be established to prevent duplicate payments, to recover any duplicate payments that may be made, and to perform an annual review of effectiveness of those procedures.)
The TSP is provided with notice of an apparent error, defect, or impropriety within 7 days of receipt of an invoice.
Submission of paid transportation bills for Postpayment audit Agencies must forward their original paid transportation bills and all supporting documents to the General Services Administration's Audit Division each month for postpayment audit (41 CFR 102-118).

Defaulted air TSP Protection All Air Traffic Conference of America (ATC) TSPs (except United Airlines) and all Regional Airline Association (RAA) TSPs have entered into a defaulted air TSP agreement with the General Services Administration (GSA) which assures that no Government traveler need be stranded en route because of the bankruptcy of an airline.
Airline ticket coupons issued by a defaulted TSP on its own ticket stock for air transportation on that defaulted TSP will be honored by participating TSPs.
The agreement applies to GTR purchased tickets validated on or before the TSP's default date and is effective for 90 days from ticket validation date.
Honoring TSPs are not required to provide different service than specified on the defaulted TSP ticket coupon.
Any additional service requested by the traveler must be purchased by the traveler.
The honoring TSP is compensated at the lower of either the fare for the service performed or 71 the stated fare on the defaulted TSP ticket coupon.
Honoring TSPs submit bills to GSA, Audit Division (FBA), W ashington, DC 20405 supported by priced copies of the defaulted TSP ticket coupons "lifted" by the honoring TSP for forwarding to the proper "bill charges to" office.
Government travelers who have not commenced travel but who hold GTR purchased for travel on a defaulted TSP should return them for replacement tickets if purchased Government Travel Management Center.
