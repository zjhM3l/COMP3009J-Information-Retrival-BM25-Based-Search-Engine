Background and Explanation of Provisions
On January 17, 2001, the IRS and Treasury published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG 126100-00) in the Federal Register (66 FR 3925, corrected by 66 FR 15820 and 66 FR 16019) under Section 6049 (the 2001 proposed regulations), which would provide that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien individual must be reported annually to the IRS.
Under regulations currently in effect, reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest is required only if the interest is paid to a U.S. person or a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Canada.
The IRS and Treasury requested comments on the 2001 proposed regulations, and a public hearing regarding the 2001 proposed regulations was held on June 21, 2001.
The IRS and Treasury received numerous comments on the proposed regulations, and several commentators spoke at the public hearing on the 2001 proposed regulations.
After careful consideration of all the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations should be withdrawn and a new notice of proposed rulemaking should be issued on this subject.
Accordingly, this document withdraws the 2001 proposed regulations and provides new proposed regulations (the 2002 proposed regulations).
Most of the comments received on the 2001 proposed regulations were highly critical of the regulations.
In particular, many commentators expressed the view that the administrative burden imposed by the 2001 proposed regulations would significantly outweigh any benefits obtained by the IRS from the additional information collected.
Some commentators also stated that the 2001 proposed regulations could have a severe negative impact on U.S. banks, particularly U.S. banks with a deposit base that included a significant number of nonresident alien individuals, some of whom had expressed concerns that the information collected under the 2001 proposed regulations might be misused.
Other commentators raised certain technical concerns regarding the 2001 proposed regulations, particularly with respect to the reporting requirements for bank deposit interest paid to joint account holders.
After consideration of the comments received, the IRS and Treasury have concluded that the 2001 proposed regulations were overly broad in requiring annual information reporting with respect to U.S. bank deposit interest paid to any nonresident alien.
The IRS and Treasury have decided instead that reporting should be required only for nonresident alien individuals that are residents of certain designated countries.
The IRS and Treasury believe that limiting reporting to residents of these countries will facilitate the goals of improving compliance with U.S. tax laws and permitting appropriate information exchange without imposing an undue administrative burden on U.S. banks.
Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations would modify the current regulations (which require reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest only if paid to Canadian residents) by requiring in addition reporting of U.S. bank deposit interest paid to residents of Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Payors may, however, at their option, choose to report bank deposit interest paid to all nonresident aliens or to any nonresident alien who is a resident of a country other than the countries listed above.
If the IRS and Treasury determine that this list of countries should be modified in the future, regulations providing such a modification will be proposed and comments will be requested on those proposed regulations.
In other respects, the 2002 proposed regulations generally follow the approach set forth in the 2001 proposed regulations.
Thus, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that, if a nonresident alien who is a recipient of U.S. bank deposit interest is a resident of a country for which reporting of such interest is required, a copy of Form 1042-S, "Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding", must be furnished to the nonresident alien.
Like the 2001 proposed regulations, the 2002 proposed regulations provide that the payor or middleman can satisfy this requirement by furnishing a copy of Form 1042-S either in person or to the last known address of the nonresident alien.
In addition, to conform to the changes made in the 2002 proposed regulations, the Form 1042-S requirements have been modified with respect to joint accounts.
For example, the 2001 proposed regulations provide that, if a joint account holder is a U.S. non-exempt recipient, the payor or middleman must report the entire payment to that person.
If all joint account holders are foreign persons, the 2001 proposed regulations require the payor or middleman to report the payment to the nonresident alien individual that is a resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA).
The 2002 proposed regulations retain the requirement that the entire payment be reported to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if there is a U.S. non-exempt recipient that is a joint account holder.
However, the 2002 proposed regulations modify the 2001 proposed regulations by providing that, if all joint account holders are foreign persons, reporting is required to any one of the joint account holders that is a resident of one of the listed countries.
Section 1.6049-8(a) currently provides, for purposes of the requirement that U.S. bank deposit interest paid to individuals who are Canadian residents must be reported, that the payor or middleman may rely on the permanent address found on an applicable withholding certificate described in Â§1.1441-1(c)(16) (Form W-8) to make the determination of whether the nonresident alien individual resides in Canada.
However, the regulation also provides that a payor or middleman may rely on its actual knowledge of the individual's residence address in Canada, even if a valid Form W-8 has not been provided, to make such a determination.
The 2002 proposed regulations, like the 2001 proposed regulations, eliminate this "actual knowledge of the individual's residence address" rule because it creates a result that is contrary to the presumption rules contained in Â§1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) (and made applicable to reportable payments by Â§1.6049-5(d)(2)).
In this regard, the presumption rules generally provide that interest on a U.S. bank deposit that cannot be reliably associated with a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9, "Request for Taxpayer Identi fication Number and Certification", must be presumed
to be paid to an undocumented U.S. non-exempt recipient.
Accordingly, the 2002 proposed regulations clarify that a payor of interest on such a deposit must report the payment on a Form 1099 as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in accordance with the presumption rules.
Further, such payment is subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to apply to payments made after December 31 of the year in which they are published as final regulations in the Federal Register.
Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.
It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations, and, because the regulations do not impose a collection of information on small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply.
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.
Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely (in the manner described in the "ADDRESSES" portion of this preamble) to the IRS.
The IRS and Treasury Department request comments on the clarity of the proposed rules and how they can be made easier to understand.
All comments will be available for public inspection and copying.
A public hearing has been scheduled for December 5, 2002, beginning at 10 a.m. in Room 4718, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC.
Due to building security procedures, visitors must enter at the main entrance, located at 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW.
In addition, all visitors must present photo identification to enter the building.
Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the immediate entrance area more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts.
For information about having your name placed on the building access list to attend the hearing, see the "FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT" portion of this preamble.
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing.
Persons who wish to present oral comments must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (a signed original and eight (8) copies) by November 14, 2002.
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments.
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for reviewing outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.
Drafting Information The principal author of the regulations is Alexandra K. Helou, Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International).
However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Generally, amounts described in this paragraph (a) are not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
See Â§31.3406(g)-1(d) of this chapter.
