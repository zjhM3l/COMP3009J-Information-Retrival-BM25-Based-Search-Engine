The volunteers provide the animals--from cats and dogs to birds and iguanas to chickens and sheep--with the love and compassion they deserve.
We work with the shelter staff and interact with the public during the adoption process.
We provide extra care for the animals that need medical attention or just a little additional `TLC.'
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 1 WELCOME! Welcome to the Seattle Animal Shelter's Volunteer Program.
Being a volunteer is extremely rewarding, educational, exciting and fun.
You can have a huge impact on the lives of these homeless animals.
Cleaning up a neglected animal, giving them a meal, a blanket and a pat on the head will touch your heart and bring you back for more.
It is so rewarding to see how the animals respond immediately to the love they receive while they are at the shelter.
In many cases this is the first time someone has really cared for them.
The volunteer program was started in 1998 with only six volunteers.
The number of volunteers and the many different ways to volunteer have grown tremendously over the years.
Because of the volunteer program dogs are walked everyday; cats are socialized; dogs learn basic obedience training; cats and dogs have their photos posted on the www.seattleanimalshelter.org web site; sick, injured or abused dogs and cats recuperate in foster homes; and most importantly dogs' and cats' lives that would otherwise be euthanized are saved.
The Seattle Animal Shelter Volunteer Program was created FOR THE ANIMALS.
Christine A. Titus Volunteer Programs Coordinator Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 2 THANK YOU! We would like to thank you for choosing to participate in our program.
As a volunteer, you are a valuable asset to our organization, and to the many animals, which need loving homes.
Since 1972, Seattle Animal Control has provided a multitude of services to the City's residents.
Animal Control Officers mediate neighborhood nuisance complaints and investigate complaints of neglect and abuse.
Animal bites are handled in conjunction with the Seattle Police Department and the Seattle-King County Health Department.
In recent years, Seattle Animal Control has been given the responsibility of monitoring "Off-Leash" areas in the city's parks and the city's many horse-drawn carriages.
The City's Animal Shelter provides access for the return of lost animals to their owners, and for the adoption of unwanted, unclaimed animals to good homes.
Providing an education program to the area's schools and pet visitation to nursing homes are also services performed by Seattle Animal Control.
The time and energy contributed by volunteers will help to keep these programs functioning.
Since your support as a volunteer is so extremely important, your decision to participate must be made with the full understanding of the commitment and responsibility it demands.
This manual has been prepared for you as a reference guide.
It contains information regarding our policies and procedures, tools for dealing with the public, and how to safely handle shelter animals.
Please read it carefully so you will be well equipped to answer questions knowledgeably and to provide quality care to the animals at the shelter.
Thank you for giving your time and energy to the animals at Seattle Animal Shelter.
We hope that the time you spend here will be as rewarding to you as it is to the animals you care for.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 3 HISTORY AND GOALS The Seattle Animal Shelter is a municipal government agency, run by the City of Seattle.
In 1972, the Humane Society for all of King County split off from the City of Seattle territory, and the City of Seattle created the agency.
Seattle Animal Control's primary responsibility is to protect the human citizens of Seattle.
The agency's secondary responsibility is to protect the animal residents of Seattle.
Seattle Animal Control field officers cover 92 square miles within Seattle.
The agency serves 550,000 citizens and cares for 8,000 animals a year.
Thanks to special programs and public education, the number of animals seen at the shelter has decreased dramatically over the years.
In 1972, for example, the shelter cared for 25,000 a year! Also part of the Seattle Animal Shelter is the low-cost Spay and Neuter Clinic, created in 1989.
Seattle is one of the first governments to start a low-cost spay and neuter clinic.
The Clinic has a huge impact on the effort to reduce the number of unplanned and unwanted animals.
Because more people can afford to have their animals spayed or neutered, there are a lot fewer unwanted puppies and kittens.
The Seattle Animal Shelter strives to be a leader in the animal welfare industry.
They are successful in this effort thanks to the creation of progressive programs, such as the foster program, which provides rehabilitation for otherwise "unadoptable" animals, and the public education and animal anti-cruelty programs, which help owners better understand the needs of their animals and enable the Animal Control officers to intervene when owners abuse, injure, or neglect their animals.
Through these and other efforts, the agency is also able to help eliminate negative stereotypes that often exist about animal control agencies.
The agency aspires to have an even greater impact on the community.
For example, they plan on creating a mobile spay and neuter operation that provides off-site and mobile pet adoptions, and they also plan on creating an education curriculum for schools.
The Seattle Animal Shelter sets ambitious goals.
The agency is constantly working toward ending the cycle of violence and abuse toward animals and sustaining its policy of never euthanizing adoptable animals.

Christine Titus Volunteer Programs Coordinator Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 12 REQUIRED TRAINING CLASSES The Seattle Animal Shelter (SAS) has developed the following training classes to better educate shelter volunteers about shelter policy and health and safety for the animals and the public.
All shelter volunteers must complete Volunteer Orientation and Dog I and II before they begin participating in the volunteer program (Dog II is optional for those who plan to work with cats only).
Team leaders will designate each class as either a prerequisite (must be taken before participating on the team) or a continuing education requirement (can be taken after joining the team).
Team leaders may require additional training.
All classes are open to all interested volunteers.
For more specific information, please review the volunteer program descriptions, or contact the team leaders for teams that interest you.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 14 QUICK REFERENCE SAS VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS Name 9 Lives Program Description Volunteers assess the special needs of sick or injured cats and communicate findings to the shelter staff, supervisor, and foster care coordinators for further consideration.
Volunteers take shelter dogs wearing adoption banners for walks in Seattle-area parks to show them off to the public.
This increases the socialization opportunities for the dogs and gives the shelter lots of positive exposure.
This team educates the public about the standards of care for animals, laws regarding animal abuse, how to identify cruelty and abuse, and whom to call to report acts of animal cruelty.
Volunteers in the Critters program provide care and attention to all the non-dog or cat animals that come into the shelter.
The goals of the program are to provide the necessary attention these animals need, work on socialization to help these animals be more adoptable, increase the number of adoptions by public outreach and awareness, and to provide foster homes when needed.
This program runs in cooperation with http://www.petfinder.com.
The photography team posts pictures and descriptions of adoptable animals available at Seattle Animal Shelter on the www.petfinder.com web site.
Each shelter dog is walked twice a day for exercise, fresh air, socialization, human contact.
During this time they are also taught basic dog obedience skills.
Volunteers bathe and groom animals that come to the shelter in poor condition.
Grooming improves the confidence of the animals and makes them more presentable to the public, thereby increasing their chances for adoption.
Volunteers in this program work toward increasing the public's awareness of cats as pets, with the goal of increasing the number of cat adoptions.
The foster program was established to give injured, sick, abused, homeless, and unsocialized cats and dogs who would otherwise be euthanized the chance to heal, recover, and find permanent, loving homes.
Prerequisites Volunteer Orientation, Matchmakers, Dog I, Cat I Advanced Dog Walking Anti-Cruelty Program Volunteer Orientation, Matchmakers, Dog I 
We organize such fundraising and PR events as the IKEA bell ringing event, Pet Pictures with Santa Claws, and events involving schools and local radio stations.
The Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk is a 3.1 fun run and walk held at Seward Park the second Sunday in June.
The proceeds from the event go to the Help the Animals Fund, which in turn uses the money to provide vet care for sick, injured and abused animals.
Team members take shelter dogs on runs to Myrtle Edwards Park.
Prerequisites Volunteer Orientation, Dog I Volunteer Orientation, Dog I Get Fit with Fido Race Team Graphic Design Matchmakers Pet Therapy Shelter Dog Training Get Fit with Fido volunteers and shelter dogs participate in community charity races to increase awareness of the shelter and to raise money for the Help the Animals Fund by organizing the Furry 5k Fun Run and Walk.
Participants create a variety of promotional materials including brochures, ads, posters etc.
The team also works with other volunteer programs on a project-byproject basis to support their graphic needs.
Matchmakers volunteers work with the public at the shelter.
Volunteers answer questions and facilitate introductions between potential adopters and shelter animals.
Volunteers and companion animals visit nursing homes to bring love and affection to our elderly and sick neighbors.
Participants assist in the dog-related training required of all volunteers.
The focus of the training is on understanding body language of shelter dogs under stress and on dog obedience skills to make the animals ready for prospective owners.Volunteer Orientation, Matchmakers, Dog I 
We provide basic care and human contact for cats that are healthy and adjusted, but prioritize efforts toward those cats that are sick, injured or behaviorally challenged.
9 Lives volunteers provide nursing care and gentle socialization for cats that may otherwise fall very ill or are unable to present well to the public because of environmental stress.
Volunteers give special TLC to our 'special needs' felines.
How Can Volunteers Help? o Assist shelter staff -- Attend to basic creature comforts, such as clean water, litter, food and kennel liners.
o Assess the cats -- Observe their health and behavior, attend to their needs, and report on cats' condition to the team leader, animal-control staff or Foster Care coordinator for further care.
o Follow through is very important -- 9 Lives volunteers must be comfortable asking questions of shelter staff and/or the team leader.
o Basic "home" nursing care -- This includes steam treatments, administering eye ointment and nasal spray, treating ear mites, gently cleaning eyes and noses, grooming and removal of matted hair Volunteer Qualifications o Volunteers must have a genuine concern for the welfare of cats. o No specific tasks will be laid out per shift; therefore, volunteers must be self-motivated and have the ability to make appropriate judgment calls and ask questions when needed.
o Volunteers must be able to complete multiple tasks, have good communication skills and be able to follow shelter safety protocol as outlined in the volunteer orientation manual and in the 9 Lives manual.
o Experience with cats and knowledge of feline "language" is preferred but not required.
o A willingness to work with all cats, regardless of appearance, is important.
A sick cat is not always a pretty cat, but he or she may be the cat most in need of your love and attention.
o Volunteers are required to attend team meetings.
Training Requirements Prerequisites: o Volunteer Orientation o Dog I Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 17 o Cat I o 9 Lives training with Team Leader Required continuing education: o Cat II Time commitment An estimated six hours per month.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 18 ADVANCED DOG WALKING Program Description Our program sends volunteers to parks in the Seattle area every Sunday morning.
The dogs wear "I'm Available for Adoption" banners, promoting both the shelter and themselves.
The goals of the program are to increase public awareness about the shelter, increase dogs' chances of adoption with the extra visibility, exercise the dogs and increase their socialization.
Greenlake is the perfect opportunity for our orphans to meet with the public.
How Can Volunteers Help? There are two different roles for the volunteers: promote the shelter (PR) and handle the dogs (dog handler).
These duties have been divided so that volunteers can become experts in each role.
The PR Volunteer o Talks to the public and answers questions o Is outgoing, friendly, enthusiastic and educated about the shelter o Carries flyers and shelter information, treats, etc. helps the dog handlers get water and pick up after the dogs.
The Dog Handling Volunteer o Is responsible for the safety of the dog and its interaction with the public and other animals o May answer questions, but the primary concern is the dog's well-being, safety and comfort o Will have great dog-handling skills, and be able to read and pay attention to the signals a dog may be giving off due to stress, anger, fear, etc.
Volunteer Qualifications o As one of the most public programs in shelter, volunteers must have extensive dog experience and training skills, great people skills and commitment.
o You must have excellent dog-handling skills, so that the dog looks calm and in control.
Since a lot of these dogs didn't get the proper training and attention they needed before coming to the shelter, they may be a little wild when walking (maybe for the first time) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 19 on a leash, especially with all the stimulation of being out with you and other dogs at a park.
As a result you have to be calm, confident and strong so that you and the dog have fun and don't spend the time fighting against each other.
o One goal of the program is to increase awareness of the wonderful animals the shelter has and what a great place it is.
The more volunteers know, the better prepared they will be to answer questions.
o Must have a sincere commitment to the animals -- if volunteers don't show up in the morning, the animals won't get to go to the park.
Training Requirements Prerequisites o Volunteer Orientation o Dog I 
The time commitment is from 8:45 a.m. to noon.
We'd like a commitment of two weekends per month but require at least one weekend per month to stay in the program.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 20 ANTI-CRUELTY PROGRAM Program Description Volunteers in the Anti-Cruelty Program evangelize the shelter's message of proactive compassion, educate Seattle's citizens about animal cruelty, and encourage them to report abuse to Seattle Animal Control so appropriate action can be taken to rescue animals in need.
How Can Volunteers Help? o Door hangers Going to neighborhoods where abuse is most prevalent and distributing door hangers that provide information on reporting animal cruelty.
Furry food drive Collecting and distributing cat and dog food to low-income families with animals in need.
o Doghouse drive Helping the shelter collect donations of used doghouses and cat dwellings.
o Inclement Weather Awareness Spreading the word about the danger of keeping pets in cars during sunny months and the need for proper shelter during cold and rainy weather.
o Special events Working at special events throughout the year, including the SAS Furry 5K and the PAWS Walk, where volunteers set up and run the Anti-Cruelty booth.
o Fundraising Fundraising for the Help The Animals Fund, which pays the veterinary bills incurred in the rehabilitation of abused animals.
Events include the Furry 5K, bell ringing at Ikea during the holidays, and Santa Claws photos at the shelter.

Ability to handle and train these dogs (in basic commands) is an essential part of this program.
Both dog and volunteer get plenty of exercise strolling around the shelter grounds.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 28 DOG WALKING RULES o o o o o o o o o o o o o Please sign in! It's important that the shelter staff know who is coming and going.
Select a chain collar and a sturdy lead-gentle leads are also available.
Go to the dog's kennel and read the information on the kennel door.
Pick a dog according to your size and skill level.
Take a moment to interact with the dog before entering the kennel.
Enter the kennel and close the door-do NOT attempt to leash your dog with the door open.
Do not let the dog jump up on you-prospective owners want a well-behaved dog.
Put the collar and leash on the dog.
Before exiting the kennel, be sure there are not any other "loose" dogs in your exit path.
Make sure you are in FULL control of your dog before exiting the cage.
For reasons of safety and health, DO NOT LET YOUR DOG APPROACH ANOTHER VOLUNTEER WHO HAS A DOG! Always maintain a 6-foot distance between your dog and any other dogs in the vicinity.
Maintain control of the dog at all times.
If, for some reason, your dog gets into a fight with another dog, DO NOT attempt to break up the fight.
Report the incident to an Animal Care or Field Officer immediately! When returning your dog to its kennel, go into the kennel with the dog on the leash.
IF the kennel is being cleansed with foam, DO NOT allow the dog in, as it will burn their paws.
Bring the dog to an empty kennel, or take the dog out for another walk until the kennel has been rinsed out.
Do not leave the chain collar on a dog.
Close the door securely behind you before removing the collar and leash.
After exiting the kennel, be sure to replace the padlock.
Remember to disinfect your hands with anti-bacterial gel before handling another dog! When walking dogs in the dark, during the winter months, reflective vests must be worn by dog walkers, and dogs must be outfitted with reflective collars.
When walking dogs on wet rainy days, wipe off muddy paws with a towel upon entry into the shelter.
Do not bring your child(ren) to the shelter.
Shelter rules state that no child under the age of 18 is to ever handle the animals.

Program Description Volunteers in the Dog Washing program bathe and groom shelter dogs.
The goal of the program is to increase adoptions by presenting clean, happy dogs to their potential new families.
The grooming time should be a fun experience for the groomer and a time of affection and attention for the dogs.
The program also takes one dog each Wednesday AM to an off-site grooming salon for complete grooming.
Volunteer Qualifications o Volunteers must have strong dog handling skills and must be confident in their ability to remove dogs from their kennels.
The lifting of dogs in and out of the grooming tub requires some physical strength.
o Volunteers must be willing to get wet and get their clothes dirty.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 30 Training Requirements Prerequisites o Volunteer Orientation o Matchmakers o Dog I 
Grooming times are weekend mornings and weekday evenings when the shelter is closed to the public.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 31 FABULOUS FELINES! Program Description The purpose of Fabulous Felines is to increase the public's awareness of cats as wonderful, lifelong companions, thereby increasing the number of adoptions by committed, responsible owners.
This is accomplished by working with some of the other programs like Nine Lives, the Marketing team, Foster Care, Matchmakers and Special Events, and by creating cat-specific promotions and materials.
Fabulous Felines is primarily responsible for coordinating monthly off-site adoption events for foster cats and periodic off-site events for promoting adoptions of shelter cats.
How Can Volunteers Help? o Assist at monthly off-site foster cat adoption events and distribute flyers for adoption events.
o Help coordinate adoption "mini-events" aimed at promoting adoptions of shelter cats. o Support the Foster Cat and Matchmaker teams to decrease the length of time that cats spend in foster care and in the shelter.
o Provide assistance to foster parents with harder-to-place cases.
o Gather information on various cat topics and create promotional materials.
o Identify locations and strategies to promote cats o Work to promote cats during shelter special events and identify cat stories for the writing team.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 32 Training Requirements Prerequisites o Volunteer Orientation o Dog I o Matchmakers Time Commitment: There will be one 1 - 2 hour program meeting per quarter, and anywhere from 2 - 10 hours per month, depending on the project.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 33 FOSTER CARE Program Description Foster parents save hundreds of lives each year by opening their homes and hearts to help young, ill, injured, abused, or under-socialized animals.
Many of these animals would otherwise be euthanized due to the lack of space and staff time necessary to provide individual attention and care.
The joy of seeing an animal placed into a loving, permanent home, knowing that as a foster parent you have directly made a difference in, or even saved the animal's life, is extremely rewarding.
How Can Volunteers Help? o During its stay in a foster home, the animal is fed, socialized, groomed, trained and Fostering saves lives! medicated as directed.
o When the animal is healthy and ready to be adopted, various programs are available to promote the foster animals for adoption.
The most successful is the www.petshelternetwork.com website where foster animals' photographs and stories are posted.
o Foster parents have the option to meet all potential adopters, and foster animals may be adopted straight from the foster homes, only returning to the shelter for spaying or neutering (if necessary). o The shelter's Help the Animals Fund which pays for all veterinary care and medicine.
Foster parents are responsible for providing food, time, and love.
o All foster parents have the first chance to adopt their foster animal (provided they meet the basic adoption requirements).
While the program was not designed for this purpose, we understand that sometimes foster parents get attached or meet "the one" and decide to adopt.
Fostering shelter animals is a very rewarding experience, for both foster parent and animal! Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 34 o Non-volunteers may also become foster parents.
Volunteer Qualifications o Foster parents must be able to provide a safe, loving and stable environment for the foster animal.
o Experience with specific issues such as behavior problems, medical problems, orphaned puppies or kittens is a plus, but not necessary.
o Foster parents must be willing to nurse injuries/illness -- they must have common sense, patience, and the ability to deal with illness or occasionally even death.
o Foster parents must be able to transport their foster animal to and from the shelter, and to the vet during regular business hours if health problems develop.
Training Requirements Prerequisites o Experience with dogs and/or cats Continuing Education o Classes on puppy, dog, kitten 
o Our Foster Care Manual should be read and used as a reference, and additional reading material may be provided depending upon the case involved.
Foster Care coordinators are readily available to help guide you through any situation that may come up.
Time Commitment The time commitment varies depending upon the situation and the animal, but the average stay in a foster home is 2-3 weeks.
The average daily commitment is 2-3 hours.
Daily and total time commitments may be extended for various reasons including health, behavior, rate of growth, or space limitations at the shelter.
Flexibility is appreciated.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 35 FURRY 5K FUN RUN AND WALK The Furry 5K Race raises public awareness and donations for the Help the Animals Fund! The Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk is a 3.1 mile fun run and walk held at Seward Park the second Sunday in June.
It is the only fun run in Washington that invites people to participate with their dogs.
The 2002 F5K attracted 2,301 humans, 1089 dogs and one cat! The proceeds from the F5K go to the Help the Animals Fund.
This is the Fund and the Seattle Animal Shelter uses to provide vet care for sick, injured and abused animals.
During its first three years the F5K has provided one third to one half of the annual budget for the HTAF.
We believe the F5K has the potential of providing two thirds of the budget.
So the F5K is a vital part of the HTAF.
This Fund makes the Shelter's goal of not euthenizing adoptable pets possible.
By being a part of the Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk you will save lives.
Volunteer Positions: Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk Planning Committee: This group of dedicated volunteers makes the F5K a reality.
They meet once or twice a month, depending on what needs to be done, for about nine months.
Generally the Planning Committee markets the F5K and works with the timing company to set up and run the event.
Planning committee positions and basic duties include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 36 o o o o o o o o o o o o Directors: responsible for every aspect of the race Marketing Coordinators: directs the public relations and funding aspects of the race Sponsorship Coordinators: gathers sponsors for the F5K Vendor Coordinators: gathers vendors for Day of Race Pet Expo Prize Coordinators: solicits prizes from the community for the awards Advertising and Media Coordinators: gets the word out about the F5K Graphic Artists: designs poster, T-shirt, brochure and other items needed by the F5K Web Site Masters: updates the F5K web site with fresh text, links, and graphics Registration Coordinators: coordinates pre race and day of race registration Logistics Coordinators: gathers equipment needed for race day Race Course Coordinators: setup, direct, and take down run/walk course Volunteer Coordinators: gathers all SAS volunteers needed for the F5K Day of Race Volunteers: This group of 100-120 dependable and flexible Seattle Animal Shelter Volunteers make the Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk work.
In general, they arrive on Race Day to set up all the equipment needed for the event, direct participants through registration, direct participants through the run/walk course, and take down all the equipment.
There are several jobs available on Race Day, but the usual shift is from 6am 12pm.
In many cases this is the first time that the public has seen the Seattle Animal Shelter volunteer program in action and they are impressed and pleased at the hard work that we do to save animals' lives.
During the month of May, the F5K Volunteers ask that all Seattle Animal Shelter volunteers advertise the event.
This can be as simple as displaying a poster and a few event brochures in your cube at work.
If you are dedicated and interested in keeping the Seattle Animal Shelter a progressive institution, please join the Furry 5K Fun Run and Walk volunteer crew!

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 47 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS One of the most important tasks of Seattle Animal Shelter volunteers is to assist the public at the shelter and answer questions.
Visitors to the shelter are more likely to adopt when they are offered assistance in selecting a companion animal.
In order to best serve the public and to be effective in getting shelter animals adopted into good homes, the Seattle Animal Shelter asks all volunteers to become knowledgeable about shelter animals, and basic policies and programs.
As a volunteer, you will be confronted with a variety of questions while you are working with the public at the shelter.
You are not expected to know all the answers to all the questions.
But, you can prepare yourself by learning basic shelter policy and procedure.
Below is a list of common questions and correct answers to help you get started.
Keep in mind that you should never give anyone information unless you are 100% sure you have the correct information--once you give an answer, it becomes fact to the person who asked! When you are asked a question that you do not know the answer to, please find someone at the shelter who has the information.
How long do you hold strays before they are available for adoption? Seattle Animal Shelter holds strays that have no identification for four business days before they're evaluated for adoption.
We do not count the day the animal arrived at the shelter, nor do we count Monday, when the shelter is closed.
Adoptable animals will be available to the public on the fourth business day.
If the animal comes in on... ...it is available for adoption on... Sunday Friday Monday Friday Tuesday Saturday Wednesday Sunday Thursday Tuesday Friday Wednesday Saturday Thursday For example, if an animal comes in to the shelter on Sunday, do not count Sunday, do not count Monday, count Tuesday, count Wednesday, count Thursday, count Friday, and Friday is the day the animal will be available.
We will make every effort to return animals to their owners before making them candidates for adoption.
Animals that are microchipped or are wearing traceable identification may be held at the shelter for weeks while attempts are made to contact the owner and give them a chance to claim the animal.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 48 Can animals that are still in the holding period be handled by the public? Absolutely not! Animals that are still under the holding period restriction are not yet considered the property of the City.
Until the animal is released from the holding period, the owner is the only person who can grant permission to handle the animal.
How do you define adoptability? It is the vicious, they are reasons policy of Seattle Animal Shelter to adopt out friendly, healthy pets.
Sick, injured, and feral animals are held for the appropriate period to be claimed.
If not claimed, placed in foster care, when possible.
Animals that pose a risk to public safety for of health or temperament are humanely euthanized.
So, what about euthanasia? It is extremely important to answer questions about euthanasia as accurately and as sensitively as possible.
Euthanasia is an unfortunate aspect of shelter life.
The decision to euthanize any animal is made by the Animal Care Staff.
It is never an easy decision.
Most animals are euthanized due to illness, age, or temperament.
Euthanasia is accomplished by injection of an overdose quantity of sodium pentobarbital, a barbiturate.
This is the most painless and humane method of euthanasia to date.
There is a great deal of compassion applied throughout the process, as well as technical skill.
The staff that perform the euthanasia are trained and certified.
The animal feels a needle prick, then immediately falls into a deep level of unconsciousness.
Death generally occurs within seconds of the injection.
How long do you hold shelter and foster care animals available for adoption? Once an animal has gone through the required holding period, it will be put up for adoption if it is friendly and healthy.
Once in the adoption room or in foster care, there is no set holding period or time limit.
The animal will stay in the care of the shelter as long as the animal is healthy and there is space available.
Fortunately, in the past few years, the Seattle Animal Shelter has not been greatly pressured for space, and the Animal Care Staff have gone to exceptional lengths to place adoptable animals.
Can animals that are in the adoption room be handled by the public? Yes.
The "adoption animals" are the only animals at the shelter that are allowed to be removed from their cages.
Adoption animals can be taken into the "Get Acquainted" room.
Adoption dogs can also be taken outside to the fenced area ("Canine Corral") located across the alley, west of the shelter.
There are balls and toys available there, as well as scoop equipment.
What does "First Choice" mean? Prospective adopters can place a one day hold on an animal that is still restricted under the four-day holding period.
The person putting the animal on hold is called the "First Choice" person.
If the original owner does not claim the animal and the animal is put up for adoption, Page 49 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter the animal is held for the first day it is available for adoption so the "First Choice" person can return to the shelter and adopt the animal.
If the First Choice person does not adopt the animal on that day, the animal will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis on the next day.
Although the First Choice person is under no obligation to adopt the animal or any other animal, we request that potential adopters make a 100% commitment to come back and handle the animal to determine if it is suitable for them.
Why are some dogs in kennels behind the chain? These dogs are being held for a variety of reasons, mainly associated with criminal investigations.
Volunteers are not given any information regarding these cases.
Volunteers and visitors are prohibited from going behind the chain for any reason.
What's included in the price of the adoption? For all animals, the fees include a City animal license, a microchip identification, spay or neuter, vaccinations, a certificate for a free health exam at any local veterinary hospital, and a gift pack supplied by a participating pet food company.
For cats, the cost also includes testing for Feline Leukemia Virus.
What's the process for adopting an animal? Prospective adopters should leave the animal they are interested in adopting in its original kennel.
We ask that visitors take the cage card to the receiving office and fill out an application.
An officer will screen the application to determine if the adopter will be a responsible pet owner and to determine the suitability of the particular animal based on the adopter's lifestyle.
Once approved, the adopter will sign the adoption agreement and pay the cashier.
The adopter will be provided a brochure describing the microchip identification, a certificate for a free health, and a gift pack.
If the animal has not yet been spayed or neutered, the adopter will be advised when to return to pick up the animal after the procedure.
Aren't these puppies and kittens too young to be spayed or neutered? The Municipal Spay/Neuter Clinic has been performing "pre-pubescent" surgeries for nearly eight years.
The procedure is endorsed by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Humane Association, the American Kennel Club, the Cat Fanciers Association, many state and local veterinary associations, and an increasing number of local animal shelters.
Studies of animals that have undergone early sterilization show no significant adverse side effects.
Younger animals recover more rapidly from both the anesthesia and the surgery.
Certain undesirable behaviors (roaming, marking territory, etc.) may also be prevented.
What if the adopter does not want the spay or neuter surgery performed on a young animal he or she is adopting? Seattle Animal Shelter does not offer this as a choice.
It is shelter policy that all animals will be surgically altered prior to their release from the shelter.
If prospective adopters cannot agree to this, then they might consider going elsewhere to obtain an animal.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 50 What vaccinations do shelter animals receive? All animals entering the shelter are inoculated against the major transmittable diseases.
Dogs are vaccinated for distemper and parvovirus (DHLPP).
Cats are vaccinated for feline distemper (FVRCP) and upper respiratory disease.
Animals that exhibit signs of contagious diseases are place in the Isolation Ward for a designated period to minimize chances of infecting the other animals.
All animals received at the shelter are also given a single dose of "Strongid" worming medication.
What kind of veterinary care do shelter animals receive? Seattle Animal Shelter has contracts with many local veterinary hospitals to provide emergency, life-sustaining care.
The amount allocated per animal is minimal, but most vets go above and beyond what they anticipate being compensated for.
Animals with non lifethreatening injuries are frequently transported to the shelter for cage rest and observation and are placed in foster care when possible.
Veterinary care is paid for mostly through the Help the Animals Fund.
This is a private, non-government fund.
Donations can be made at the shelter.
What is a temperament test? All dogs adopted through SAS must first be given a temperament test.
Animal Care Staff will spend time interacting with the dog to determine what sort of personality it has, to better match the dog with a prospective home.
This cuts down on the number of adoption returns due to conflicts with family members and other pets.
What do you do with all the pit bulls? Pit Bull dogs are held for the required number of days.
After the holding period, the fate of each animal is determined on a case-by-case basis by animal specialists who are experts with the breed.
If the dog is determined to be adoptable, we will work closely with purebred rescue groups to find a suitable destination for the dog.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Copyright 2003 Seattle Animal Shelter Page 51 CAGE CARDS 
The purpose of the card is to assist potential adopters in choosing the dog that is right for their lifestyle.
These cards are occasionally updated and reformatted, so the following is a general guideline: Top Section The top section contains information about the name, age, breed, sex and spay/neuter status of the dog.
It also has the case # for the dog, which will be needed for reference during the adoption process.
Middle section The middle section contains information as it relates to the dog's personality.
Shelter officers spend some time with the dogs, handle them and give them various behavior tests to determine what their personality is like.
Potential adopters should read this information to determine if the dog is right for them.
For example, an escape-oriented dog would not do well in a home with no fence on a busy street.
Bottom section This section contains information regarding the type of home that would be best for the dog, and comments about the dog's personality.
Potential adopters should pay special attention to whether the dog should go to an experienced/inexperienced home, and whether or not the dog has been approved to go to a home with children.
The latter is especially important -- some dogs are very insecure and will not tolerate having their tails and ears pulled, teasing or rough play.
Others are so active that they could easily injure children by knocking them over.
During the adoption process, officers rarely make exceptions, so it's best to direct adopters to dogs that better fit their experience and family situation.
