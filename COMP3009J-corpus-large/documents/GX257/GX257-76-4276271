During spring and summer 1993, record flooding inundated much of the upper Mississippi River Basin .
The magnitude of the damages-in terms of property, disrupted business, and personal traumawas unmatched by any other flood disaster in United States history .
Property damage alone is expected to exceed $10 billion .
Damaged highways and submerged roads disrupted overland transportation throughout the flooded region .
The Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers were closed to navigation before, during, and after the flooding .
Millions of acres of productive farmland remained under water for weeks during the growing season .
Rills and gullies in many tilled fields are the result of the severe erosion that occurred throughout the Midwestern United States farmbelt .
The hydrologic effects of extended rainfall throughout the upper Midwestern United States were severe and widespread.
The banks and channels of many rivers were severely eroded, and sediment was deposited over large areas of the basin's flood plain .
Record flows submerged many areas that had not been affected by previous floods .
Indus trial and agricultural areas were inundated, which caused concern about the transport and fate of indus trial chemicals, sewage effluent, and agricultural chemicals in the floodwaters .
The extent and duration of the flooding caused numerous levees to fail.
One failed levee on the Raccoon River in Des Moines, Iowa, led to flooding of the city's water treatment plant .
As a result, the city was without drinking water for 19 days .
As the Nation's principal water-science agency, the U .S .
Geological Survey (USGS) is in a unique position to provide an immediate assessment of some of the hydrological effects of the 1993 flood .
The USGS maintains a hydrologic data network and conducts extensive water-resources investigations nation wide .
Long-term data from this network and information on local and regional hydrology provide the basis for identifying and documenting the effects of the flooding .
During the flood, the USGS provided continuous streamflow and related information to the National Weather Service (NWS), the U .S .
Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and many State and local agencies as part of its role to provide basic information on the Nation's surface- and ground-water resources at thousands of locations across the United States .
The NWS has used the data in forecasting floods and issuing flood warnings .
The data have been used by the Corps of Engineers to operate water diversions, dams, locks, and levees .
The FEMA and many State and local emergency management agen cies have used USGS hydrologic data and NWS forecasts as part of the basis of their local flood-response activities .
In addition, USGS hydrologists are conducting a series of investigations to document the effects of the flooding and to improve understanding of the related processes .
The major initial findings from these studies will be reported in this Circular series as results become available .
U .S .
Geological Survey Circular 1120, Floods in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, 1993, consists of individually published chapters that will document the effects of the 1993 flooding .
The series includes data and findings on the magnitude and frequency of peak discharges ; precipitation ; water-qual ity characteristics, including nutrients and man-made contaminants ; transport of sediment ; assessment of sediment deposited on flood plains ; effects of inundation on ground-water quality ; flood-discharge vol ume ; effects of reservoir storage on flood peaks ; stream-channel scour at selected bridges ; extent of flood plain inundation ; and documentation of geomorphologic changes .

VI Contents Geomorphic Changes on the Mississippi River Flood Plain at Miller City, Illinois, as a Result of the Flood of 1993 By Robert B. Jacobson and Kevin A. Oberg Abstract During the flood of 1993 on the upper Mis sissippi and Missouri Rivers, the most dramatic changes to flood plains resulted at levee-break complexes .
At these sites, large discharges were concentrated through narrow levee breaks, which resulted in high water-surface slopes and intensely turbulent flow .
These conditions created extensive, deep scours and permitted sediment laden water to flow into areas behind the levees .
As a result, large areas of formerly productive bottom land were eroded or covered by thick deposits of sand .
The levee break at Miller City, Illinois, cre ated a typical large levee-break complex .
As much as 28 percent of the Mississippi River discharge flowed through the break during the peak of the flood.
With velocities as great as 300 centimeters per second, the flow through the levee break was able to scour an area 2,200 meters long to a maximum depth of more than 20 meters .
Transport of sediment from the main channel, through the break, resulted in net deposition of at least 8 .2 million cubic meters of sand .
Although the history of this part of the Mis sissippi River Valley indicates that channel changes have been extensive and frequent, the geomorphic changes that resulted from the 1993 flood seem to be unprecedented during the last 10,000 years or so .
The large geomorphic changes at Miller City during the 1993 floods are attribut able to the magnitude of the flood, the hydraulic head artificially increased by the levee, and the lack of energy dissipation on the agricultural flood plain relative to presettlement, forested conditions .
INTRODUCTION Large amounts of rainfall in the upper Missis sippi River Basin through winter, spring, and summer 1992-93 produced widespread and persistent flooding (Parrett and others, 1993 ; Wahl and others, 1993) .
The flood of 1993 on the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers set record discharges at many streamflow-gag ing stations (Parrett and others, 1993) .
More than 26,000 km 2 of urban and agricultural land were inun dated ; total costs of the flood exceeded $12 billion (Interagency Floodplain Management Review Com mittee, 1994) .
More than $1 .2 billion in losses were attributed to actual flooding of agricultural bottomland (Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee, 1994) .
Along the Missouri River, more than an esti mated 1,800 km 2 of prime agricultural land was severely affected by erosion and deposition (Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee, 1994) .
More than 300 km2 of this prime agricultural land was covered with sand deposits that were more than 60 cm thick .
The costs to remove this sand and return the soil to its former productivity levels have been estimated to be about $1 .2 million per square kilometer (Vance, 1994) .
The most severe erosion and sedimentation damages by far were associated with breaks of agricultural levees .
Purpose and Scope This report documents the geomorphic changes associated with a levee break typical of those created Introduction 1 by the 1993 flood .
The geomorphic effects at levee breaks are of concern because erosion and sedimenta tion at levee-break complexes are substantial public safety and economic hazards .
Furthermore, routing of sediment to and from storage in flood plains has the potential to redistribute sediment-borne contaminants .
The levee-break complex chosen for documentation here occurred on the Mississippi River at river mile 34, which is near Miller City, Illinois (fig .
1) .
A chronol ogy of events during the levee break, measurements of discharge and velocity in the main channel and the break, maps of erosion and deposition, descriptions of erosional features and sediments, and a comparison of the levee break to the Holocene history of the Missis sippi channel are presented .
Although it is one of the larger levee-break complexes created during the flood, the Miller City levee-break complex contains features typical of many of the levee-break complexes of the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers .

Louis, Missouri Q .C .
Dohrenwend, U .S .
Geological Survey, oral common ., 1994) .
Large hydraulic heads and flow constriction through narrow openings in the levee breaks created zones of intense scour downstream and upstream from typical breaks .
Flow through the levee breaks also trans ported large quantities of sediment onto the flood plain .
A levee-break complex consists of the levee break and associated erosional and depositional fea tures .
Although erosion and deposition patterns in levee break complexes can be quite complicated, they gener ally consist of scour, stripped, and depositional zones (fig .
2) .
The scour zone (locally called blue, blew, blow, or blown holes) is an area of deep erosion, usually more than 1 to 2 m deep, with steep sides .
Detached blocks of cohesive sediment are common along the margins of the scours, which attest to erosion by gravitational slumping and toppling.
The planform of scours ranges from cir cular to elongated ; many scours extend upstream and downstream from the break to form elongated channels .
In cases where the scour channels connect with the main channel upstream, the scours are efficient structures for funneling water and sediment onto the flood plain (fig. 2) .
Exit scours were formed when floodwater over topped the levees or descended the banks as it reentered the main channel .

Exit scour zone Levee-Break Complexes Levees may break as a result of a variety of mechanisms, which include overtopping by floodwa ter, liquefaction of the levee or foundation material, or mass failure .
The term "levee break" in this report describes levee sections where the levee was com pletely removed or eroded at least to ground level, regardless of the erosion mechanism .

Definition of features in a typical levee-break complex .
Downstream from the levee break, the scour zone is skirted with a zone where erosion generally is less than 50 cm deep .
This zone is referred to as the "stripped zone" (figs .

Stripped zones commonly have shallow, rounded scours near their upstream margin and are characterized by abundant grooves (fig .

Some grooves are parallel to flow directions and seem to have been carved by debris carried by the floodwa ters, whereas other grooves are evidently related to preexisting weaknesses in the soil, such as those caused by plowing (fig .

4) .
Extensive areas of the flood plain used for agriculture were covered with sand deposits, some of which were as much as 4 m thick ; according to Vance (1994), some sand deposits were as much as 6 m thick on the Missouri River flood plain .
Mud deposition seemed to be minor in extent .
Mostly, mud was left as thin deposits in eddies or slackwater areas or was deposited during recession of the floodwaters in low areas that existed before the flood .
The geomorphic effects of mud deposition were minor.

Downstream from the stripped zone, there is a transition into the depositional zone that consists of sediment deposits of varying thicknesses .
Because of the sequence of flooding at any partic ular site, sand and mud (silt- and clay-sized sedi ment) may have been deposited over stripped zones or may partially fill scours .
Generally, sand depos its are thickest and coarsest closer to the scour.
Sed imentary features include sand waves, dunes, and B Figure 4 .

Introduction 3 Scour zones and sand deposits in levee-break complexes are by far the most dramatic geomorphic effects of the 1993 flood .
In contrast, geomorphic changes in nonleveed areas consisted of minor bank erosion and sedimentation in natural levees and crevasse-splay features (fig .
5) .
Natural-levee sed imentation was prominent in nonleveed bank areas with dense woody vegetation .
Crevasse-splay fea tures, which consist of a scour (crevasse) and asso ciated sand deposits (splay), are similar but much smaller natural analogs for levee-break complexes .
Crevasse splays occur where a weakness in the nat ural levee, or flow concentration, results in erosion of a crevasse channel through which sediment is transported from the channel onto the flood plain (Collinson, 1978) .

THE FLOOD OF 1993 AND THE MILLER CITY, ILLINOIS, LEVEE-BREAK COMPLEX The flood of 1993 on the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers was notable for the extreme discharge and long duration .
Discharges in excess of the esti mated 100-year flood were recorded on the Missouri River from Rulo, Nebraska, to Hermann, Missouri, and on the Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa, and St. Louis (Parrett and others, 1993 ; fig .
1) .
At Thebes, Illi nois, the peak discharge was 28,200 m3/s on August 7, 1993 (Reed and others, 1994) ; the estimated recur rence interval was from 10 to 50 years (Parrett and oth ers, 1993) .

In addition to large discharges, the flood of 1993 was notable for its long duration .
At St .
Louis, the Mississippi River was above flood stage for more than 2 months .
At Thebes, several smaller floods occurred from April 1993 through May 1994 in addi tion to the main flood of July through August 1993 .

History of the Miller City Levee-Break Complex The levee near Miller City, which is locally called the Len Small levee, was designed and con structed by local landowners to protect agricultural 89Ã¯Â¿Â½22'30" land in Dogtooth Island bend of the Mississippi River (fig .
7) .
The levee is continuous along the left bank (facing downstream) of the Mississippi River from Fayville, Illinois, to past the apex of Dogtooth Island bend .
The levee was designed to deflect high velocity floodwaters of the Mississippi River away from agricultural land at the upstream part of the bend .
The downstream part of Dogtooth Island bend is not protected by a levee, so low-velocity back flooding has occurred in the area south of the Miller City Road during many floods .

Features of the Miller City, Illinois, levee-break complex area .
The Flood of 1993 and the Miller City, Illinois, Levee-Break Complex 5 was constructed from locally available materials by using draglines and scrapers .
Most of the levee material is uncompacted top soil .
Internal stratigra phy of levee remnants showed that black top soil was interbedded with clean, white sand units .
The river side of the levee was protected with riprap at the site of the break and for some distance upstream and downstream .
The riprap and numerous wing dams located in this reach of the Mississippi River are maintained by the COE to improve navigation .
The levee broke on July 15, 1993, at about 1 :00 p .m . local time .
According to anecdotal evi dence from several witnesses, the levee was inspected 15 minutes before the break .
At the time of the break, the water level on the channel side of the levee was estimated to be as much as 2 m below the levee crest .
[For comparison, at the U .S .
Geo logical Survey (USGS) streamflow-g . aging station at Thebes, which is about 16 km upstream, the daily mean stage was 104 .68 m on July 15 ; on July 20 and August 7, the daily mean stage at Thebes peaked at 105 .24 m (table 1)] .
An eyewitness related that a loud noise drew his attention at 12 :50 p .m .
When he looked at the levee from a distance of about 500 m, he saw a near-horizontal, 15- to 30-cm-diameter fountain of water gushing out of the side of the levee .
The hole quickly enlarged, and a section of the levee failed .
As the levee eroded and widened, water began to fill the area between the main levee and a cross levee (fig .
8A) .
During the first few days after the break, flow through the break was extremely turbulent (fig .
9) with standing waves that were about 1 m high .
The area between the main levee and the cross levee is the upstream end of a channel that the Mis sissippi River occupied during 1820 (fig .
10) .
The extension of the 1820 channel formed an arcuate trough to the east and south with about 1 .5 m of relief before the 1993 flood .
The 1820 channel was bounded to the north and east by a terrace scarp that cut laterally into alluvial deposit of late Wisconsin and presumed early Holocene age (Fisk, 1944) .
The scarp ranged from about 2 to 3 m high .
As the low area between the two levees filled, water flowed northward and eastward over the scarp, and fol lowed low areas of former channels that extended Standing waves are stationary wave forms indicative of criti cal flow, which occurs in flows with large ratios of velocity to depth .
6 toward Horseshoe Lake (figs .
8A, 10) .
As water lev els rose in the Horseshoe Lake area, flow began to move southward along former channels, descended the scarp, and reentered the 1820 channel to the east and downstream of the cross levee (fig .
8A) .
By July 17, water that reentered the 1820 channel had eroded a secondary scour at least 400 m long by upstream (northward) migration of a steep head cut (location A, fig .
8A) .
Most of the area of Dogtooth Island bend south of the Miller City Road was inun dated by backflooding or seepage by this time .
Much of the early floodwater followed low areas directly to Horseshoe Lake .
Subsequent over flow of Horseshoe Lake to the south and east caused water to flow across the Miller City Road between Willard and Roth, Illinois (fig .
7), and down 0 .5- to 1-m-high scarps that separate paleochannels of the Mississippi River, notably the scarp between depos its of Holocene channel-position stage 2 and those of channel-position stages 5 and 9 (fig .
10) .
Obser vations during the flood indicated that flow over the road and down the terrace scarps typically was fast, highly turbulent, and characterized by standing waves .
Aerial videotape from July 17 indicated small areas of flow over the cross levee at the extreme northern and southern ends .
Larger quantities of overflow were noted on July 19 .
Because the area had been evacuated, the precise time and mecha nism of failure of the cross levee are not known .
However, by July 20, a substantial part of the cross levee had broken, and by July 31, the entire 400 m of the cross levee was removed .
After the cross levee was breached, flow through the main levee was concentrated in the 1820 channel, and floodwater that moved through the sec ondary scour immediately downstream of the cross levee (location A, fig .
8A) reversed direction and flowed northeastward .
By July 26, flow was 5,570 m3 /s from the Mississippi River main channel into the break, and 8,000 m 3/s of flow was measured near the peak discharge on August 7 .
From July 17 through August 10, the northern (left) bank of the main scour eroded laterally more than 60 m (loca tion B, fig .
8A) .
In the process, more than 680 m of a county road was removed, as well as a house, a machine shed, and the front yard and front porch of another house (fig .

Observations from water and aerial reconnaissance from July 26 through August 8 indicated that the main-flow vectors were oriented along the 1820 channel with divergence to the northeast and southeast (fig .
8A) .
To the north of the Miller City Road, in the area between Willard and Roth, flow vectors were to the east and northeast; secondary flow diverged southward across the Miller City Road (fig .
7) .
All the Dogtooth Island bend area south of the Miller City Road was inundated at this time, although water that flowed at higher velocities seemed to be confined to the northern one-half of the area.
Floodwater diverged to the south and followed the 1820 channel until it encountered the levee .
Then it con centrated in a low area defined by channel-position stage 12 (Fisk, 1944) and flowed to the southeast until ponded water forced the flow to the east and back into the main channel near river mile 16 (fig .
7) .
Because of the wide angle of divergence of flow, it is impossible to define the degree to which flow around Dogtooth Island bend was cut off as a result of flow through the levee break .
The location of flow back into the Mississippi River channel ranged from about river mile 20 as determined by the downstream extent of the Len Small levee, to about river mile 13 .3, which is immediately upstream from the Cache River cutoff (fig .
7) .
Floodwaters slowly receded after the peak on August 7 (table 1) .
As higher areas became dry, flow concentrated in the 1820 channel and the newly scoured areas .
Flow in secondary scours oriented to the north and northeast once again reversed and moved into the 1820 channel .
Probably the most dramatic change during this time was about 3 km east of Roth where large volumes of water were continuing to drain from Horseshoe Lake (fig .
7) .
As the water level dropped in the main channel of the Mississippi River, a reentry scour was created by upstream migration of the headcut (fig .
11) .
Erosion pro cesses were still continuing during the last week of August 1993 .
Subsequent to the summer flooding during 1993, the Miller City area was affected substantially by three additional floods (fig .
6) .
During late September and early October 1993, intense rainfall in Missouri resulted in another rise on the Mississippi River ; the peak dis charge of 20,600 m3/s was at Thebes .
In mid-November 1993, intense rain in Missouri and southern Illinois cre ated a flood with a peak discharge of about 13,500 m3 / s at the streamflow-gaging station at Thebes .
Both floods were sufficient to create a high volume of flow through the levee break with subsequent inundation of most of Dogtooth Island bend south of the Miller City Road .
Before the November flood, construction had begun on a new levee alignment, and rock dams had been built across the main scour and one of the secondary scours (fig .
8B) .
The November flood caused increased erosion around the southwestern corner of the dam that had been constructed across the main scour.
Another flood in April 1994 had a peak discharge of 18,500 m 3/s at Thebes .
This flood created extensive changes, which included erosion of as much as 100 m of the southern margin of The Flood of 1993 and the Miller City, Illinois, Levee-Break Complex the main scour and extensive reworking of sand depos its in the area of the 1820 channel .
The April 1994 flood also destroyed about 1,000 m of newly reconstructed levee.
Measurements Measurements of discharge, velocity, and bathy metry in the levee break were made by the U .S .
Army 89Ã¯Â¿Â½30' 89Ã¯Â¿Â½22'30" Corp of Engineers (COE) and the USGS from July 26 through September 9, 1993 .
The USGS measurements were made in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) .
Discharge and velocity were measured in the Mississippi River upstream from the levee break and in the levee break.
The COE mea sured discharge by the moving-boat technique (Smoot and Novak, 1969) and bathymetry by use of a digital echo-sounder and range-range positioning system .
