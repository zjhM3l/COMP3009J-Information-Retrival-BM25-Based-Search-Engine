INTRODUCTION This Policy Book is assembled in dictionary form and may be used in conjunction with the Meat and Poultry Inspection Regulations and the Meat and Poultry Inspection Manual, Directives and Notices.
It is a composite of policy and day-to-day labeling decision, many of which do not appear in the above publications.
They are subject to change and therefore a periodic updating of this book will take place.
Note: Red Meat Required percentages of meat required for red meat products are shown on the basis of fresh uncooked weight unless otherwise indicated.
For purposes of this Policy Book, whenever the terms beef, pork, lamb, mutton, or veal are used they indicate the use of skeletal muscle tissue from the named species(9CFR 301.2).
Note: Poultry Required percentages for poultry products are based on a cooked deboned basis unless otherwise stated.
When the standards indicate "poultry", the skin and fat are not to exceed natural proportions per(9CFR 381.117(d)).

ADDED SOLUTIONS(WITH JUICES): Products with added solutions that are cooked in an impervious bag and as a result of the cooking contain free flowing juices that are not drained, should be labeled to reflect the solution and the juices, e.g., ("Roast Beef Contains up to 12% solution with Juices").
ADDED SOLUTIONS (POULTRY) (BONELESS): Boneless poultry products containg solutions can be labeled similarly to the PFF language for cured pork products, that is "Cured Chicken and Water Product X% of Weight is Added Ingredients."
The terms "with natural juices" or "water added" are not permitted since both terms do not adequately convey the amount of solution added to the poultry products.
Additionally, the term "with natural juices" is misleading when a solution is introduced into poultry product by means of marinating, soaking, injecting, tumbling, etc.

AGED: The term "Aged" on a label must be qualified, e.g., "Aged 65 days."
"Aged Days" may also be approved and in this case, the blank is filled in by the establishment at the time the product is labeled.

HYDROLYZED BEEF STOCK: A beef stock which has been treated with acid, alkali, or enzymes to digest the protein.
The protein molecules are broken down into amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, and peptones.
As the digestion is carried out for longer periods of time, more and more of the larger molecules are broken down into amino acids, with free alpha-amino groups.
By analyzing these alpha-amino nitrogens one can determine the degree of hydrolysis.
100% hydrolysis would mean that all the nitrogen (protein) is in the form of amino acids.
10% of hydrolysis would mean that only 10% of the nitrogen is in the form of free amino acids, while the rest is still present in polymeric form.
The label should indicate the degree of hydrolysis.
This is determined from the ratio of amino nitrogen to total nitrogen.
amino nitrogen = % hydrolysis total nitrogen A product labeled 50% Hydrolyzed Beef Stock must, therefore, have 50% of the total nitrogen present as amino nitrogen.
Adding percent solids is optional.
The percent solids would not necessarily be the same percent as hydrolysis depending on the thickness (consistency) of product.

Approved procedures must be attached to the label records accompanying new or modified labels submitted for approval.
See: Policy Memo 083A dated May 12, 1988
LABELING FOR SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS: If a product fails to comply with a standard only because the meat or poultry content is lower than required and the product has generic identity as a nonmeat product (e.g., pizza, stew, pies), then the product may be designated by the nonmeat terminology in the standardized name (e.g., "PIZZA," "STEW," "PIE"), provided the meat/poultry content of the product is conspicuously disclosed contiguous to the product name along with a statement of the amount of meat/poultry in the standardized product.
(For example, PIZZA (contains 5% sausage; SAUSAGE PIZZA contains 12% sausage.)
Such product may not be nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles.
For this purpose,
nutritional inferiority is defined, consistent with the requirement of 21 CFR 101.3(e)(4), as any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present at 2% or more of the U.S. RDA per serving of protein or any of the vitamins or minerals for which U.S. RDAs are established.
A quality control procedure must be approved for such products by the Processed Products Inspection Division before the label can be used.
If a product is nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles, it must be labeled "imitation" in accordance with 317.2(j) and 381.1(b).
See: Policy Memo 069 dated March 23, 1984 LABELING OF INSTITUTIONAL AND WHOLESALE TYPE, LARGE IMMEDIATE CONTAINERS: On institutional and wholesale type, large immediate containers, all mandatory information must appear on the principal display panel except that the first usable panel to the right of the principal display panel may be used for the firm's name and address and the ingredients statement.
See: Policy Memo 082 dated May 5, 1985 LABELING OF MODIFIED BREAKFAST SAUSAGE, COOKED SAUSAGE, AND FERMENTED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY A NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIM: Modified breakfast sausage, cooked sausage, and fermented sausage products are substitute versions of the standardized or traditional products that have been formulated and processed to reduce the fat contents to qualify for use of nutrient content claims, but do not comply with the standard of identity or composition as described in the meat and poultry regulations or the Standards and Labeling Policy Book (Policy Book) because of the use of ingredients used for fat replacement which are precluded or restricted by these standards.
The deviation from the standard or the traditional, i.e., "regular product," is conveyed by associating an expressed nutrient content claim for the appropriate reduction in fat content and the standardized or traditional product name, e.g., "Reduced Fat Frankfurter" or "Low Fat Pepperoni."
The nutrient content claims that may be used are those related to a reduction in fat contents that are identified in the regulations for meat products in 9 CFR Part 317 and for poultry products in 9 CFR part 381.
Maintaining Product Integrity: The following guidelines must be applied to assure that the modified versions of the
subject meat and poultry sausage products do not violate the integrity of the standardized or traditional product for which they purport to be substitutes: (1) the product must be similar in shape, flavor, consistency, and general appearance to the product as prepared according to the regulatory or traditional standard, (2) the meat or poultry used to formulate the modified product must come from the same anatomical location when the standardized term is related to an anatomical region on an animal, e.g., "ham" is expected to be from the hind leg of the hog and cured; thus, "lean smoked ham sausage" would be comprised of meat from the hind leg of a hog that has been smoked and cured, (3) the modified sausage product must result from the same processing procedures as those specified for the subject sausage products described by regulatory or Policy Book standards, (4) there must not be deviations from product safety criteria (e.g., salt content, curing agents, pH, water activity and/or moisture/protein ratio) that are provided in the regulatory or Policy Book standards for sausages, and (5) the modified product must achieve the appropriate reduction in fat content to be eligible to use a nutrient content claim in conjunction with the standardized or traditional product name.
Performance Characteristics: In producing modified, substitute versions of sausages, the deviations from ingredient provisions of the regulatory and Policy Book standards should be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim while maintaining the performance characteristics similar to the standardized or traditional product, i.e., similar preparation, cooking, and handling characteristics.
If a modified version of the standardized or traditional sausage does not perform in substantially the same way as the standardized or traditional item, the label must include a prominent statement informing the consumer of such differences.
For example, a "low fat frankfurter" that essentially has all of the characteristics of a frankfurter, but cannot be grilled, would indicate "not recommended for grilling."
A "reduced fat pepperoni" that displays essentially all the characteristics of pepperoni, but cannot be cooked, would , for example, indicate "not recommended for cooking" or "do not cook."
Safe and Suitable Ingredients: A modified, substitute sausage product must be formulated with approved safe and suitable ingredients, e.g., those identified in 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4) and 381.147(f)(4), and those determined to be safe and suitable by the Food Standards and Ingredients Branch, Product Assessment Division.
Such ingredients are to be used at the lowest level necessary to achieve the intended effect of reducing fat as compared to the standardized or traditional product.
Safe and suitable
ingredients are those used to replace fat, improve texture, and prevent syneresis.
An ingredient or component of an ingredient that is specifically required by the regulatory or Policy Book standard for characterizing purposes, e.g., cheese in a cheesefurter, fresh livers in liver sausage, cured ham in a ham sausage, and fennel or anise in an Italian sausage, shall be present in the required amount, if applicable, or otherwise in a significant amount to provide a characterizing identity to the product.
Moreover, an ingredient or component of an ingredient that is not permitted by regulations for use in any meat or poultry sausage product, e.g., sodium benzoate, shall not be added to a modified, substitute product.
Product Identity: The name of the modified version of the standardized or traditional product that complies with all parts of the policy prescribed herein is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim for the meat and/or poultry product with a reduction in fat content and the applicable standardized or traditional term, e.g., "Lean Sausage," "97% Fat-Free (or "Low Fat") Kielbasa," "Low-Fat Frankfurter Made with Beef, Pork and Turkey," "Reduced Fat Pepperoni," "Extra Lean Turkey Italian Sausage," and "Lite Genoa Salami."
The size and style of type must conform to the nutrition labeling regulations.
Ingredients Statement: To assist the consumer in differentiating between the standardized or traditional sausage product and the modified, substitute version, ingredients that are not provided for by regulatory or Policy Book standards, or used in excess of the allowable levels specified, must be appropriately identified with an asterisk in the ingredients statement.
The statement(s) defining the asterisk(s), e.g., "*Ingredient(s) not in regular " (fill in name of the standardized or traditional product), or "*Ingredients(s) in excess of amount permitted in regular " (fill in name of the product), or both as standardized or traditional appropriate, must be legible and conspicuous, and shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same size and style of type.
See: Policy Memo 123 dated January 20, 1995 LABELING OF MEAT AND POULTRY STICK ITEMS: Stick items such as beef jerky, pepperoni sticks, and beef sticks must be labeled (i.e., contain the required label
features as outlined in 317 and 381, Subpart N) according to the following guidelines: (1) If sold in fully labeled bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers, stick items do not have to be fully labeled unless they are individually wrapped.
This type of container cannot be reused.
(2) If sold in bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers that are not fully labeled, stick items must be fully labeled.
Bulk containers such as these may only be refilled with fully labeled product.
(3) If sold in small, fully labeled cartons, boxes, or similar containers (e.g., 3 oz., net weight) that are only intended for retail sale intact, stick items may be individually wrapped and unlabeled.
See: Policy Memo 111 dated June 6, 1988 LABELING OF MODIFIED SUBSTITUTE VERSIONS OF SAUSAGE, HAMBURGER OR GROUND BEEF PRODUCTS: FRESH (SPECIES)
This policy allows modified versions of fresh (species) sausages, ground beef, or hamburger to contain non-meat or poultry, "fat-replacing ingredients" (e.g., binders such as carrageenan, modified food starch) and to be identified by certain nutrient content claims in accordance with nutrition labeling regulations effective on August 8, 1994, in conjunction with descriptive labeling, e.g., "Lean Pork Sausage with a X% Solution of ...," or "Low Fat Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product."
This policy allows for the use of terms defined in regulations, e.g., "Lean," "Reduced Fat," "Low Fat," etc., to be used to describe fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger products with a reduction in fat content resulting from the use of added ingredients (i.e., "fat replacers" such as carrageenan and isolated soy protein).
These products must meet the criteria for use of the nutrient content claim associated with the fat reduction.
The nutrient content claim may be used in conjunction with the standardized name provided the consumer is informed of the actual components of the product through labeling, i.e., descriptive product name, ingredients statement, and Nutrition Facts.
Meat products, including those that meet the criteria established for claims, such as "Lean," "Low Fat," "Lower Fat," "Reduced Fat," etc., that combine fresh (species)
sausage, ground beef, or hamburger, and other safe and suitable ingredients, for the principal purpose of replacing fat, may be descriptively labeled.
Examples of such products are "Lean Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product," "Low Fat Ground Beef With a X% Solution of ...," "Lean Beef Sausage, Water, and Carrageenan Product," or "Reduced Fat Pork Sausage, Water, and Binders Product," provided conditions prescribed in the regulations, viz., 9 CFR 317, for use of the nutrient content claim are satisfied.
In contrast, modified versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef or hamburger product containing added ingredients that do not qualify for use of a nutrient content claim prescribed in the nutrition labeling regulations must be labeled as Imitation Pork Sausage, Imitation Beef Sausage, Imitation Ground Beef, Imitation Hamburger, Beef Patty or Beef Patty Mix in accordance with 9 CFR Section 317.2(j)(1) and Sections 319.141 (Fresh pork sausage), 319.142 (Fresh beef sausage), and 319.15 (Miscellaneous beef products), respectively.
Descriptively labeled, modified, substitute versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger product with a reduction in fat content must comply with the following guidelines: (1) The descriptive name of a modified, substitute product with a reduction in fat content is the applicable nutrient content claim used in conjunction with the appropriate standardized name and fat-replacing ingredients, e.g., "Low Fat Ground Beef, Water and Carrageenan Product," or "Lean Pork Sausage With a X% Solution of Water, Modified Food Starch, Spices, and Salt."
Words in the descriptive name may be of a different size, style, color, or type but, in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible.
Moreover, no word in the descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one third the size of the largest letter used in any other word in the descriptive name.
The solution statement, when used, is considered to be part of the descriptive product name and must comply with descriptive name sizing requirements.
(2) Fat-replacing ingredients (e.g., binders and water) and fat in the finished product may not exceed 30 percent of the product as formulated for the modified, substitute ground beef, hamburger, or fresh beef sausage product, and no more than 40 percent of the product formulation for the substitute fresh pork sausage.
The fat content must be in accordance with
requirements for content claim.

(3) The product includes mandatory nutrition labeling prescribed in the meat inspection regulations, viz., 9 CFR 317.
(4) The product is formulated with approved safe and suitable ingredients, e.g., those identified in 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4), and which are determined to be safe and suitable by the Food Standards and Ingredients Branch, Product Assessment Division, that are used at the lowest level necessary to achieve the intended effect as a fat-replacing ingredient (i.e., binder).
(5) If percentage labeling is included as part of the product name, e.g., "Extra Lean Ground Beef With a X% Solution of ...," a Partial Quality Control (PQC) program for the addition of solutions must be approved before the label can be used.
See: Policy Memo 121B dated January 20, 1995 LABELING OF PRODUCT NAMES, FANCIFUL NAMES, WORD SIZE: Words in product names or fanciful names may be a different size, style, color, or type, but in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible.
Moreover, no word in a product name, i.e., a common or usual name, a standardized name, or a descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one-third the size of the largest letter used in any other words of the product name.
The same guidelines apply to letters of words in fanciful names that may accompany the product name.
For example, for a product labeled Chili Mac--Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce, "Chili Mac" is the fanciful name and "Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce" is the product name.
No letter in "Chili Mac" may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in "Chili Mac."
Similarly, no letter in the descriptive name may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in the descriptive name.
This policy is not intended to address the relative size of words in fanciful names versus product names.
The size of words in qualifying statements, e.g., "Water Added," "Contains up to ...," "Smoke Flavoring Added," etc., are not affected by this policy memo.Labeling not in compliance with these guidelines may be used until present supplies are exhausted.
Inspectors in charge shall determine the amount of present supplies.
See: Policy Memo 087A dated September 16, 1985 LABELING OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING MEAT WITH ADDED SOLUTIONS OR OTHER NONMEAT INGREDIENTS IN SECONDARY PRODUCTS: In those situations where meat containing an added solution or other nonmeat ingredients, e.g., Ham-Water Added, Corned Beef and Water Products, Beef-Containing up to 10% of a solution, are used in secondary products in sufficient quantities to meet the minimum meat requirement without including the added solution, or nonmeat ingredients, the product name need not include any reference to the added solution or nonmeat ingredients; e.g., Corned Beef and Cabbage would be an acceptable name for a product if the corned beef portion of the corned beef and water product was present in a sufficient quantity to satisfy the 25% cooked corned beef requirement.
The ingredients statement, however, must include nomenclature as required by the regulations or policy (see also Policy Memos 066C and 084A).
In this example, the ingredients statement would list "Corned Beef and Water Product-X percent of added ingredients are . . . ."
For products in which the added solution ingredient as a whole is used to meet the minimum meat requirement, the product name must include nomenclature required for the component, e.g., Beef (containing up to 10 % of a flavoring solution) Burgundy.
The ingredients statement must also include the same nomenclature for the meat ingredient.
See: Policy Memo 102 dated January 6, 1987 LABELING OF PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIALLY COLORED: Labels of products which are artificially colored either by artificial colors or natural colors must bear a statement to indicate the presence of the coloring, e.g., "artificially colored" or "colored with annatto."
Products whose true color is disguised by packing media, e.g., colored pickling solutions, must also have labels that include a statement that indicates the presence of the color.
The statement must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner contiguous to the product name.
When a component within a product is artificially colored, e.g., breading, sauce, and sausage, a qualifying statement is necessary.

Sausages coated with Myvacet shall show, adjacent to the product name, a qualifying statement disclosing the presence of the compound, e.g., "Summer Sausage Coated with a Solution of Distilled Acetylated Monoglycerides."
NACHO STYLE, NACHO FLAVOR, AND SIMILAR TERMS: Acceptable terminology for products possessing the commonly expected flavor characteristics associated with "Nachos," a Mexican hors d'oeurve.
The characterizing flavor components generally include, but are not limited to, cheese (Cheddar or Monterey Jack), tomato (tomato solids, tomato powder), spices, or other natural seasonings and flavorings (usually garlic and onion), and chili peppers (mild or hot).
Romano and Parmesan cheese are also often present.
However, these cheeses may not be used to satisfy the above cheese requirement.
NATURAL CLAIMS: The term "natural" may be used on labeling for meat products and poultry products, provided the applicant for such labeling demonstrates that: (1) the product does not contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, or chemical preservative (as defined in 21 CFR 101.22), or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and (2) the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed.
Minimal processing may include: (a) those traditional processes used to make food edible or to preserve it or to make it safe for human consumption, e.g., smoking, roasting, freezing, drying, and fermenting, or (b) those physical processes which do not fundamentally alter the raw product and/or which only separate a whole, intact food into component parts, e.g., grinding meat, separating eggs into albumen and yolk, and pressing fruits to produce juices.
Relatively severe processes, e.g., solvent extraction, acid hydrolysis, and chemical bleaching would clearly be considered more than minimal processing.
Thus, the use of a natural flavor or flavoring in compliance with 21 CFR 101.22 which has undergone more than minimal processing would place a product in which it is used outside the scope of these guidelines.
However, the presence of an ingredient which has been more than minimally processed would not necessarily preclude the product from being promoted as natural.
Exceptions of this type may be granted on a case-by-case basis if it can be demonstrated that the use of such an ingredient would not significantly change the character of the product to the point that it could no longer be considered a natural product.
In such cases, the natural claim must be qualified to clearly and conspicuously identify the ingredient, e.g., contains refined sugar.
All products claiming to be natural or a natural food should be accompanied by a brief statement which explains what is meant by the term natural, i.e., that the product is a natural food because it contains no artificial ingredients and is only minimally processed.
This statement should appear directly beneath or beside all natural claims or, if elsewhere on the principal display panel, an asterisk should be used to tie the explanation to the claim.
The decision to approve or deny the use of a natural claim may be affected by the specific context in which the claim is made.
For example, claims indicating that a product is natural food, e.g., "Natural chili" or "chili - a natural product" would be unacceptable for a product containing beet powder which artificially colors the finished product.
However, "all natural ingredients" might be an acceptable claim for such a product.
See: Policy Memo 055 dated November 22, 1982 NATURAL SMOKED COLOR: Approval can be properly granted to labels with this statement when the products involved are "Smoked" and not artificially colored.
The results of the use of artificial smoke materials can, by means of a number of processing operations, result in a color characteristic being acquired by the frankfurters, bologna, and the like.
The term "Natural Smoked Color" can be used to properly identify this point.
NAVARIN: Navarin is a stew containing lamb or mutton and vegetables and considered a national dish of France.
It must meet the meat stew standard of 25% meat.
Show true product name, e.g., "Navarin-Lamb Stew."
NEGATIVE LABELING: (1) Negative product example, "turkey product labeling is allowed if it is unclear from name that the ingredient is not present.
the use of the term "no beef" on the label pastrami" would further clarify that does not contain beef.
the For of the
(2) Negative labeling is allowed if the statement is beneficial for health, religious preference, or other similar reasons.
For example, highlighting the absence of salt in a product would be helpful to those persons on sodium-restricted diets.
(3) Negative labeling is allowed if the claims are directly linked to the product packaging, as opposed to the product itself.
For example, flexible retortable pouches could bear the statement "no preservatives, refrigeration or freezing needed with this new packaging method."
(4) Negative labeling is allowed if such claims call attention to the absence of ingredients because they are prohibited in a product by regulation or policy.
The statement must clearly and prominently indicate this fact, so as not to mislead or create false impressions.
For example, "USDA regulations prohibit the use of preservatives in this product" would be an acceptable statement for ground beef.
(5) Negative labeling is allowed to indicate that absence of an ingredient when that ingredient is expected or permitted by regulation or policy.
This could also apply to ingredients which are not expected or permitted by regulation or policy if the ingredients could find their way into the product through a component.
For example, the use of "no preservatives" on the label of "spaghetti with meat and sauce" (where regulations do not permit the direct addition of preservatives) would be acceptable if the product contained an ingredient, such as cooking oil, which could contain antioxidants but do not.
These guidelines do not preempt the requirements of the nutrition labeling regulation.
Therefore, negative claims such as "unsalted" would have to comply with the provisions stated in the nutrition labeling regulations.
See Policy Memo 019B dated August 18, 1994 NET QUANTITY OF CONTENTS ON COMBINATION PACKAGES: The guidelines for stating the net quantity of contents on combination packages containing both liquid and solid products are as follows: 3.
The declaration of net quantity of contents for a combination package shall be expressed in terms of fluid measure for individual products that are liquid and in terms of avoirdupois weight for individual products that are solid, semisolid, or viscous, provided the quantity statements for identical packages or units are combined.
For example, the fruit drink would be expressed in fluid
measure and the meat, cheese, crackers, and cookies would be expressed in the combined avoirdupois weight.
2.
The declaration of quantity shall be preceded by one of the following terms, as appropriate: "Net Weight," "Net Wt.," or "Net Contents."
The net quantity of contents declaration may appear in more than one line.
Therefore, both stacked and side-by-side declarations would be considered appropriate.
- Descriptive terms may be used to identify the liquid and solid components of the package, e.g., entree, meal, or drink; however, such terms shall not include brand names.
- Connecting words such as "and" or "plus" are permitted to be used as part of the declaration of contents.
Examples of acceptable net content declarations are as follows: (1) Entree Net Wt. 8 oz, Drink 4 fl oz (120ml) (2) Net Contents: lunch 8 oz plus fruit drink 4 fl oz (3) Net Wt. 8 oz Drink 4 fl oz (120ml) (4) Net Weight 8 oz. and 4 fl oz. Federally inspected meat and poultry products are exempt from the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), including the mandatory metric labeling provisions that went into effect February 14, 1994.
However, if metric labeling is included voluntarily, such labeling should comply with the FPLA.
The guidelines contained in this policy memo will be subject to the provisions prescribed in 9 CFR 317.2(h) and 381.121 of the Federal regulations.
See: Policy Memo 124 dated January 17, 1995
NET WEIGHT STATEMENT: Divider Pak: On a product where two cans are taped together, one of which contains the meat or poultry item and the other a vegetable, e.g., "Chicken Chow Mein," the meat or poultry label may include the net weight on the 20% panel.
The vegetable can bears the true name of the product with the total net weight of the other can and the drained weight of the vegetable can.
Double Packing: When a poultry product and a non-poultry product are separately wrapped and placed in a single immediate
container bearing the name of both products, the net weight shown on the immediate container may be the total net weight of the two products or the net weight of the poultry product and the non-poultry product separately.
Additional Net Weight Information: Nonregulatory information of a net weight nature, e.g., 4-3 oz. packages, accompanying a net weight statement is acceptable and need not adhere to the size and spacing restrictions.
Open Net Weights: Open net weights may be presented in pounds and ounces, decimals, decimal fractions, or fractions, e.g., 1 1/2 lbs., 1.6 lbs.
Net Weight Requirements: The statement of net quantity of contents is required on all products intended for sale at retail intact.
In addition, shipping containers must bear a net quantity of contents statement if product inside is not uniform in weight (i.e., random weight).
Piece counts may not be used in lieu of a required net quantity of contents statement on a shipping container but may be used as additional information.
Multi-Unit Retail Packages: Fully labeled packages of more than one of the same meat or poultry product packages in an open (i.e., clear) overwrap do not have to include a net weight statement.
See: 317.2(h) 381.121(b) MPI Bulletin 211 NET WEIGHT STATEMENTS ON PACKAGES WITH HEADER LABELS: The guidelines for determining the size and location of net weight statements on meat food product packages with header labels are as follows: 1.
The entire front of the package is considered the principal display panel of the package and its area is used to determine the size of the net weight statement.
Print size specifications for the net weight statement specified by the regulations must be followed.
2.
The net weight statement should be placed within the lower 30% area of the header label if no other mandatory labeling features are printed on the rest of the principal display panel of the package.
If mandatory features do appear below the header label, the net weight statement must be placed within the lower 30 % of the total area containing any mandatory information.
A "Header Label" is a small label applied across the top of a package usually bearing all of the mandatory labeling information.
The rest of the package is most often a clear film containing a meat or poultry product, e.g., luncheon meat.
This type of packaging is designed to be used on peg board type displays.
See: Policy Memo 047 dated May 3, 1982 "NEW" AND SIMILAR TERMS: Terms like "new," "now," "improved," and similar terms may be used within the following guidelines: 1.
The terms may only be used for a period of 6 months from the date of the initial approval, except as noted in 2., 3., and 4.
below.
2.
Extensions to the 6-month period may be granted if: a.
Processors distribution labeling as time can be can demonstrate that production or delays precluded the use of the approved scheduled.
In such situations, the lost restored.
b.
Processors can demonstrate that labeling inventory needs for the 6-month period were over estimated due to poor sales.
The processors must maintain records which indicate the amount and the date the labeling was originally purchased.
In this situation, up to an additional 6 months can be granted.
No further extension will be considered.
is customary to distribute geographical regions, each sketch approval for 6 months adequate controls over the the products.
3.
In those situations where it "new" products to various geographic area may receive a if the processor can assure segregation and distribution of
4.
In situations where it is customary to test market product in no more than approximately 15% of the intended total marketing area before total distribution begins, labeling for the test market area can receive a sketch approval and also be included in the 6-month sketch approval given to the labeling of the product distributed to the total marketing area.
Processors must be able to assure that only 15 % of the total market is involved in test marketing.
See: Policy Memo 107 dated August 18, 1987
NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER: Product must contain at least 25% cooked "Corned Beef."
NO ROLL: The term "No Roll" is permitted on marking devices and labels for single ingredient red meats (carcasses, primal and retail cuts) provided the term is not accompanied with an official grade name (e.g., "No Roll Choice").
NON-DAIRY WHITE SAUCE OR NON-DAIRY SAUCE: A sauce made with a non-dairy creamer.
If this type of a sauce is proposed for use with "Chipped Beef," a suitable name would be "Non-Dairy White Sauce with Chipped Beef" or "Non-Dairy Sauce with Chipped Beef."
The reference to "Cream" or any of its derivations should not appear in the product name.
NONSPECIFIC MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS: Red meat items of this type do not have specific requirements, i.e., they do not possess a standard of identity or composition.
Consequently, these products shall be identified by one of two ways: (1) A descriptive name that identifies characterizing components and/or ingredients, or (2) a fanciful or coined name that is accompanied by an ingredients statement.
The latter approach should be used when the use of a descriptive name is not practical, e.g., when the descriptive name would read like an ingredients statement.
When a fanciful name or coined name is used, the ingredients statement should appear contiguous to the product name on the principal display panel of an immediate container.
NONSTANDARDIZED COOKED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS CONTAINING BOTH LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY INGREDIENTS: This policy does not apply to cooked sausage products which contain poultry ingredients up to 15% of the total ingredients (excluding water).
The labeling of nonstandardized cooked sausage products must comply with 319.180.
Meat food products are those in which more than 50% of the livestock and poultry product portion consists of livestock ingredients.
Such cooked sausage products which contain poultry ingredients at more than 15% of the total ingredients (excluding water) must have product names that indicate the species of livestock and kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g.,
"Beef and Turkey Frankfurter" or "Frankfurter Made From Beef and Turkey".
Poultry food products are those in which more than 50% of the livestock and poultry products portion consists of poultry.
Livestock ingredients at more than 20% of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that indicate the kind(s) of poultry and species of livestock ingredients, e.g., "Turkey and Beef Frankfurter" or "Frankfurter Made From Turkey and Beef".
Such cooked sausage products which contain livestock ingredients at 20% or less of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that are appropriately qualified to indicate the inclusion of livestock ingredients, e.g., "Turkey Frankfurter - Pork Added or Turkey Frankfurter - With Pork".
(The product names of cooked sausage products which contain no livestock ingredients designate the kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g., "Turkey Frankfurter".)
Cooked sausage products containing over 50% meat ingredients would carry the red meat legend while those containing over 50% poultry ingredients would carry the poultry legend.
See: Policy Memo 087A regarding word size in the labeling of product names.
See: Policy Memo 005A dated November 25, 1987 NOODLE: See: Macaroni and Noodle Type Products NOODLE CHICKEN VEGETABLE DINNER OR NOODLE CHICKEN DINNER WITH VEGETABLES: (Canned or in glass jars). cooked chicken.
NUGGET LABELING: Nuggets are irregularly shaped, usually bite-sized meat and/or poultry products which are usually breaded and deep fat fried and intended to be used as finger foods.
There are a number of different types of nuggets, the labeling for which is: (1) Products made from a solid piece of meat or poultry may use the term "Nugget" as part of the product name without further qualification (e.g., "Chicken Nugget," "Beef Nugget").
Products made from chopped and formed meat or poultry may use the term "Nugget" as part of the product name, provided a qualifying statement describing such process Product must contain at least 6%
(2)
is shown contiguous to the product name (e.g., "Chicken Nugget, Chopped and Formed" or "Beef Nugget, Chopped and Formed").
(3) Products made from chopped meat or poultry and containing binders, extenders and/or water may use the term "Nugget" as a fanciful name, provided a descriptive name immediately follows "Species" or "Kind" nugget (e.g., "Breaded Nugget-Shaped Chicken Patties").
Products described in (1), (2), and (3) above which are breaded shall be labeled as "breaded" and shall be limited to 30% breading.
(4)
See: Policy Memo 088 dated May 23, 1985
OAT FIBER: "Oat fiber," should be identified in the ingredients statement as "isolated oat product."
It may be used in non-standardized products and in products, such as, "taco fillings."
OLD FASHION or OLD FASHIONED: The terms "Old Fashion" or "Old Fashioned" are considered subjective in nature and may be used unqualified on labels for meat and/or poultry products with the exception of Old Fashioned loaf.
See: 317.8(b)(9)(iii) OLEO STOCK: See: 317.8(b)(20) OLEOMARGARINE: The Establishment No. may be omitted from the outer container, provided that articles are completely labeled including Establishment No. inside.
See: 317.2(i) OLIVES, STUFFED: Acceptable ingredient declaration for olives stuffed with real pimentos.

OPEN DATING: Labels showing further qualifying phrases in addition to the explanatory phrase must submit with the application sufficient documentation to support these additional claims.
See (317.8(b)(32) 
Some local authorities require that packaged foods heated and sold hot from industrial catering vehicles be dated with the day the foods were placed in the warming units (e.g., Tuesday, Friday, etc.).
When assured by the local authorities that the foods are under a rigid local inspection program, the designations may be approved without an explanatory statement as required by the regulations.
To date, only the county of Los Angeles, California, has provided this assurance.
The packing date should be shown on immediate or shipping containers of poultry food products as required by regulations (381.126 and 381.129(c)).
When meat or poultry products are packed and held in freezer storage for later repacking, the explanatory phrase on repacked product should be in terms of "sell by" or "use before."
However, if a "packed on" phrase is desired, the date shown shall be that of the original packing of the product.
