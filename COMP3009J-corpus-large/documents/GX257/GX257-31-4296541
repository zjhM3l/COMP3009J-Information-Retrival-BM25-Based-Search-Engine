60 2 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs Introduction.

"Our Federal investment has shown that substance abuse prevention is possible and that models of excellence are available.
The Federal "seal of approval" we award today is a message to communities that they should insist upon and work toward the same level of excellence in substance abuse prevention.
As a Nation, we can settle for no less."
Tommy Thompson Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services History Community-based prevention efforts to curb substance abuse problems in the United States have led to significant reductions in substance use and abuse.
Many of these efforts have been carried out under the leadership of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) and State alcohol and drug abuse agencies.
These prevention efforts are rooted in the belief that communities themselves offer the most effective approach for planning, implementing and evaluating prevention efforts that can best respond to the specific needs of community members.
Recognizing excellence among substance abuse prevention programs began nearly two decades ago with the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD) and the National Prevention Network (NPN).
In the mid-1980s, they established detailed procedures and rating criteria for such programs.
In 1987, CSAP joined with NASADAD and NPN to honor grassroots prevention programs and to showcase innovations in prevention that have merit for replication.
In 1999, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) became yet another partner in our endeavor to seek out and recognize cutting edge prevention programs.
Today, the commitment to the field of substance abuse prevention and the partnership formed among SAMHSA/CSAP, NASADAD, NPN, and CADCA are stronger than ever.
Together, we are proud to sponsor the Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Awards and recognize the contributions of outstanding prevention programs that are reducing alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use.
The Exemplary Awards Program The Exemplary Awards program recognizes prevention programs in two tracks: Promising Programs, those that have positive initial results but have yet to verify outcomes scientifically, and Model Programs, those that are implemented under scientifically rigorous conditions and demonstrate consistently positive results.
The Exemplary Awards recognize prevention programs that are innovative and effective and that successfully respond to the needs of their target populations, both as Promising Programs and Model Programs.
Selection Process Promising Programs--A rigorous and multifaceted procedure is used each year to identify and select programs to receive an Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award.
All nominated programs submit to a three-level review process.
First, State agency personnel and national organizations submit nominations certifying the accuracy of the information contained in each application.
Applications are then reviewed by a select group of at-home reviewers, which includes experts in the field of substance abuse prevention and former Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award winners.
Finally, the National Review Committee (comprised of experts in substance abuse prevention and related health fields) thoroughly reviews 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs 3 and scores the top applications and recommends which ones merit an Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award.
Final selections are made jointly by NASADAD, CADCA, and CSAP.
Reviewers of the 2000 Exemplary Awards Program evaluated 32 prevention programs under the Promising Programs track, according to the following criteria: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Philosophy Background and need (program planning) Goals and objectives Population(s) to be served Activities and strategies Community coordination Evaluation Program management Model Programs--These science-based prevention programs were selected under a discrete track.
They meet criteria established by CSAP's National Registry of Effective Prevention Programs (NREPP), which encompass 15 separate dimensions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Theory Fidelity of interventions Process evaluation quality Sampling strategy and implementation Attrition Outcome measures Missing data Outcome data collection Analysis Other plausible threats to validity Integrity Utility Replications Dissemination capability Cultural and age-appropriateness Award Recipients The 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award recipients demonstrate that prevention can best be achieved through the use of multiple strategies that address the unique characteristics of individuals, targeted populations, and communities.
These culturally diverse programs from throughout the country embody a wide range of prevention strategies, including community mobilization, cultural enhancement, skills and resiliency-building, mentoring, parent education, health promotion, and social competency.
The 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Awards demonstrate that both Promising Programs and Model Programs can yield results in ongoing efforts to reduce the many serious and complex problems associated with substance abuse.

All Stars is a program that prevents high-risk behaviors including drug use, violence, and early sexual activity through the development of positive personal characteristics in young adolescents.
The program focuses on changing five specific qualities that are vital to achieving preventive effects.
All Stars' objectives are (1) to develop peer norms that encourage abstinence from sex and reject violence and drug use; (2) to increase students' perceptions that high-risk behaviors will interfere with their lifestyles; (3) to increase students' personal commitment to avoid the use of drugs, abstain from sexual activity, and avoid violence; (4) to increase the degree to which students are socially bonded to positive friendship groups and social institutions; and (5) to increase positive parental attentiveness to young adolescents.
The All Stars program uses interactive methods to discuss values, ideals, norms, and personal commitments.

School staff is largely responsible for introducing and implementing the program, and their efforts are directed toward improving peer relations and making the school a safe and pleasant place.
The Bullying Prevention Program attempts to restructure the existing school environment to reduce opportunities and rewards for bullying behavior
This school-based program, developed by SwedishNorwegian professor Dan Olweus, is both systems and individual oriented, and there are intervention components at both the school, classroom, and individual levels.
Because of the proven relationship between aggressive behavior and current and later substance abuse, counteracting bullying behavior is also likely to prevent and reduce substance abuse.

Susan P. Limber Associate Professor Institute on Family and Neighborhood Life Clemson University 158 Poole Agricultural Center Clemson, SC 29634 Phone: (864) 656-6320 E-mail: slimber@clemson.edu Clientele The Bullying Prevention Program targets students in elementary, middle, and junior high schools.
All students participate in most aspects of the program, while those students identified as bullies or victims of bullying receive additional individual interventions.
Major Services Core components of the program are implemented at the school, classroom, and individual levels.
It is highly recommended that one or more "educational teacher discussion groups" be established at each school.
These groups meet regularly for 1.5 hours on a fixed day and time, (for example, every other week), to review and discuss the core elements of the program.
The discussions are based on the book Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Olweus, 1993) and the teacher manual Olweus' Core Program Against Bullying and Antisocial Behavior: A Teacher Handbook (Olweus, 1999).

10 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs Ã¯Â¿Â½ Significant reductions in students' reports of general antisocial behavior such as vandalism, fighting, drunkenness, theft, and truancy.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Significant improvements in the social climate of the class, as reflected in students' reports of improved order and discipline, more positive social relationships, and a more positive attitude toward schoolwork and school.
Similar results have been documented in two recent (1997 to 2000) large-scale intervention projects in Norway involving more than 5,000 students from 40 schools.
Positive, although somewhat weaker, effects have also been reported in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) selected the Bullying Prevention Program as one of their 10 Blueprints Model programs.
Beginning in 2001, the Norwegian Government offered the Bullying Prevention Program to all comprehensive schools in Norway through a systematic training program over a period of 4 to 5 years.

The Coping Power Program is delivered to moderateto high-risk children in the late elementary school and early middle school years.
The program lasts from 15 to 18 months and includes an integrated set of child and parent components.
Coping Power is based on an empirical model of risk factors for substance use, and addresses high-risk children's deficits in social competence, self-regulation, school bonding, and positive parental involvement.
The Coping Power child component consists of 33 group sessions and periodic individual sessions and is delivered in school-based settings.
The Coping Power parent component consists of 16 group sessions and periodic home visits and individual contacts.
Postintervention results indicate that the program has had effects on reducing children's aggressive behavior and preventing their substance use.

The Coping Power program has also been delivered along with a teacher inservice training component, which has served as a universal intervention program.
Accomplishments Coping Power is being evaluated in four grant-funded intervention research studies and has been translated and disseminated in clinical trials in the Netherlands and in a residential school for deaf children.
Followup studies of children originally involved in Coping Power intervention are ongoing and at this time focus only at pre- to immediate post-intervention effects.
These data show that Coping Power has produced significant preventive effects in children's substance use and a number of improvements in the predictor variables presumed to mediate substance use.
By the end of intervention, even though relatively few sixth graders were using substances overall, the Coping Power program significantly lowered levels of substance use in participating children (an overall score of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use) as compared to control children.
Teachers rated the Coping Power intervention children as having improved social skills.
Teachers also noted that intervention children perceived their improved social skills, tended to have less aggressive behaviors, and were less angered by social problems.

Intervention effects on school bonding were more limited, although intervention children tended to perceive themselves as more academically competent.
Intervention parents had become more supportive and involved with their children.
On several of these outcomes, the children who had received both the indicated Coping Power Program targeted at high-risk children and the universal intervention had the best results, indicating the importance of nesting targeted interventions for high-risk children within universal interventions.
Funding The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide funding for Coping Power.
2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs 15 Early Risers "Skills for Success" Program ......................................................................
.....................................................
Early Risers "Skills for Success" Program is a multifaceted skill-building program specifically designed for children 6 to 12 years of age with early onset aggressive and disruptive behaviors.
The program targets risk factors and associated developmental processes that lead to the development of a pattern of early-starting, serious, and chronic substance abuse.
"Early starters" not only inflict harm on themselves and society through substance abuse, but they also serve as magnets, drawing in their peers who covet their adult-like substance use behavior.
The primary goal of Early Risers is to help at-risk children achieve competence during the formative years of their development.
This is accomplished by coordinated, high-strength intervention components that teach children skills for self-regulation, pro-social peer affiliation, academic success, and positive school adjustment with the support of proactive and effective parenting practices.
The program features 2 complementary components (CORE and FLEX) that are delivered in tandem, continuously over a 2- or 3-year period.

.................................................
The Fairfax Leadership and Resiliency Program is an intensive substance abuse and violence prevention program designed to serve selected and indicated populations of adolescents who are currently enrolled in mainstream or alternative high school settings.
As a resiliency program, basic assumptions regarding adolescents and the impetus for substance abuse and violence exist within a protective/risk factor framework that is interpreted from a clinical resiliency orientation.
Internal strengths identified through resiliency research as the most predictive of future success and adaptation in life are identified and concentrated through programming specifically designed to enhance and promote them.
Programming also targets specific risk factors with the purpose of reducing or eliminating them over time with the understanding that, unless effectively addressed, the identified factors have the potential for causing difficulties throughout life.
....
Clientele The Fairfax Leadership and Resiliency Program specializes in serving indicated and targeted populations of older high school adolescents possessing significant risk factors.
Major Services The Fairfax Leadership and Resiliency Program is multitiered and intensive, serving identified youth over a period of multiple years.
Groups of 6 to 10 adolescents are formed in the school setting and meet once weekly during the school day, with individual followup occurring as needed.
These group meetings run throughout the school year and are strongly oriented as process and clinical resiliency groups.
Participants are invited to attend the program for as long as they are in school, over a period of up to 4 years.
In addition to weekly group meetings, alternative activities are held once a week after school and include volunteering at a local rehabilitation shelter for abused and neglected animals.
This activity places youth in the roles of healers, a powerful experience during the time period of identity formation.
A Puppet Project also is conducted, in which adolescents learn and perform skits for elementary age children on such topics as alcoholism in the home, violence, social skills, and conflict resolution.
Additionally, adventure activities are offered during the summer months, providing a unique environment for intensive work on specific resiliency and risk factors.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Funds for program implementation.
Accomplishments The "Community Knowledge, Values, and Mobilization" component produced a statistically significant increase in coverage of alcohol issues in local newspapers and on local television stations in the experimental communities over their matched comparison communities.
The "Responsible Beverage Service Practices" Component produced a significant reduction in alcohol sales to minors.
Overall, off-premise outlets in experimental communities were half as likely to sell alcohol to minors as those in comparison communities.
The "Responsible Beverage Services" Component also yielded an increased adoption of responsible alcohol serving policies in the experimental communities over the comparison communities.
Limited but promising results in reducing alcohol service to heavy-drinking patrons were also seen in the experimental communities.
The "Access to Alcohol" component achieved some of its goals as all communities adopted some aspects of local policies to reduce alcohol access, particularly high-density, on-premise outlets.
One community actually began a ban on new outlets.

.....................................................
Project SUCCESS (Schools Using Coordinated Community Efforts to Strengthen Students) is a selective and indicated program designed to prevent and reduce substance use and abuse among high-risk, multiproblem adolescents in alternative schools.
This project places highly trained professionals in alternative schools to provide a full range of substance abuse prevention and early intervention services.
Project SUCCESS counselors use the following intervention strategies: information dissemination, normative and prevention education, problem identification and referral, community-based processes, and environmental approaches.
In addition, resistance and social competency skills such as communication, decision-making, stress and anger management, problem-solving, and resisting peer pressure are taught.
Counselors primarily work with adolescents individually and in small groups, conduct prevention/education discussions and programs, train alternative school staff, coordinate the substance abuse services and policies of the school, and refer and followup with students and families needing substance abuse treatment.
Project SUCCESS links the school to the community's continuum of care.
Both youth and parents are referred, when necessary, to human services agencies; community groups; alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs (ATD) prevention and treatment agencies, and other organizations.

The fundamental goal of the program is to reduce and prevent substance abuse relapse and recidivism.
Participants in the four-phase program learn the facts about substance abuse and related factors, develop personal and interpersonal skills, and make use of intervention and prevention resources.
The underlying rationale for the program lies in the belief that a majority of crimes are directly or indirectly related to substance abuse.
The target population for Project Blanket is adult males and females and youth who are incarcerated or in juvenile detention and have exhibited substance abusing behavior.
Specifically, program participants range from 12 to 50 years of age with the majority of them being single, unemployed African Americans (54 percent) from urban areas.
Additionally, participation in Project Blanket is on a voluntary basis unless otherwise stipulated.
Major Services Project Blanket comprises a holistic approach for providing substance abuse prevention services.
The program consists of support groups, individual assessment, pre-release planning, post-release goal planning, referrals, assistance, advocacy, case management, and other community support.
The institution-based component involves participant selection and orientation; a four-phase, activitycentered curriculum that emphasizes cognitive and behavioral restructuring; a pre-release assessment; and preparation for return to society.
Additionally, the four-phase curriculum consists of information on classes of different substances of abuse and description of risk factors associated with substance abuse behavior, personal and interpersonal skills, and intervention and prevention resources.
The postrelease component focuses on wraparound social services and the participants' retention in 12-step recovery and other support groups to aid in maintaining long-term sobriety and recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.
Participants who require services beyond the scope of Project Blanket's parent organization, Strength Incorporated, are referred to the Community Service Provider Network.

.....................................................
Project Towards No Drug Abuse (TND) is an ongoing drug abuse prevention project designed to develop and test school-based prevention strategies specifically for high school-age youth.
The theoretical background for Project TND is a motivationenhancement, behavioral skills, decision-aking model.
The current version of the TND curriculum consists of 12 45-minute interactive sessions, which provide an awareness of stereotyping influences, drug use myths, the course of addiction and other consequences of use, and the importance of health as a value (motivation material).
The sessions emphasize listening, communication, prosocial coping skills, conflict management, tobacco cessation, and selfcontrol skills (skills material); as well as the connections between thinking, choices and behavior; attitudinal perspective-taking; and the decision making process (decision making material).
Accomplishments Parameters of this program were investigated in three true experimental field trials thus far, involving a total of approximately 3,000 youth.
At 1-year followup, TND produced a 27 percent, 30-day prevalence reduction in cigarette smoking; a 22 percent prevalence reduction in marijuana use; a 9 percent prevalence reduction among baseline alcohol drinkers; a 26 percent prevalence reduction in hard drug use; and a 25 percent prevalence reduction in weapon-carrying.

............................
The SAFE Children program is a partnership between the Institute for Juvenile Research at the University of Illinois at Chicago and eight Chicago public schools.
The program emphasizes helping families manage child development in high-risk environments.
It is based on the "developmentalecological model," which focuses on how characteristics of neighborhoods and schools affect children and families and determine how well a child does in school and later in life.
The program aims to help with the transition to elementary school, make that first year successful, and set a firm base for the future.
Families with children entering first grade and living in inner-city, high-crime neighborhoods are enrolled in a 22-week family program that emphasizes developing support networks among parents, parenting skills, and understanding of schools and related child development issues.
In addition, children are provided tutoring in reading to ensure mastery of basic reading skills in the first year of school.
.........................
Major Services SAFE Children coordinates multiple family groups, family support networks, reading, and tutoring services.
Accomplishments The SAFE Children program results in improved academic achievement in children, improved maintenance in parental involvement in school (instead of the typical pattern of a severe dropoff), improved parenting skills, and improved social competence and behavior in children.
Funding The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention provides funding for SAFE Children.

Box 80529 Austin, TX 78708 Phone: (512) 349-6964 Fax: (512) 837-0998 The San Antonio Fighting Back (SAFB) of United Way serves as a facilitator and catalyst convener for improving the quality of life of those most at risk through a comprehensive community partnership to reduce substance abuse, crime, and violence.
This is accomplished through the implementation of six strategies: public awareness, community empowerment through organizing and mobilization, capacity-building for problem-solving, environmental change, community development, and economic restoration and public policy advocacy.
The use of these strategies enables SAFB to maintain sustainability and to effect change by successfully advocating for the institutionalization of effective practices in systems, such as law enforcement, health care, human service delivery, funding, resource distribution, and public sector governance.
Clientele The boundaries for the SAFB target area are defined by the attendance zones of the San Antonio Independent School District and include ethnically diverse groups of residents from the east and southeast of the city.
This district is the eighth largest in the Nation and one of the poorest, with 98 percent of its students receiving free lunches.

2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs 53 Skills, Opportunities, And Recognition (SOAR) Program SOAR is a scientifically-tested, comprehensive, school-based program designed to promote positive youth development and academic success.
The program is a school-wide, school climate program for elementary schools that promotes the healthy development of young people by increasing skills for successful participation in the family, school, peer group, and community; opportunities for active involvement in family and school; and consistent recognition for effort and improvement.
A SOAR school provides social skills training for elementary students, training for their teachers to improve methods of classroom management, and instruction on providing developmentally sequenced parenting workshops.
The long-term results indicate that students in SOAR classrooms are more committed to school, have better academic achievement, and have less misbehavior in the school and the community.
SOAR was tested as the Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP), developed by Drs. J. David Hawkins and Richard Catalano of the University of Washington's Social Development Research Group, and is based on their Social Development Theory.

make a significant impact on known risk and protective factors for substance abuse, violence and aggressive behavior, and academic success before the critical middle school years, when children are most typically beginning to engage in risk behaviors.
By increasing protection for children and putting them on a positive trajectory, SOAR can help reduce the overall number of at-risk youth entering the middle school years.
Major Services Each SOAR school is a learning community promoting intellectual and social development through challenging instructional programs and caring classroom, school, and family environments.
The program includes three basic components: school, family, and peer.
Accomplishments SOAR, tested as SSDP, demonstrated in several evaluation studies a significant impact on academic achievement, substance abuse, and violent behavior in youth.
Immediate outcomes show significant reductions in early childhood aggression; greater attachment and commitment to school; higher levels of classroom participation, and lower rates of initiation of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use compared to controls schools.
Additional results show higher levels of social skills, better work skills, higher scores on standardized tests, lower levels of interaction with antisocial peers, and lower levels of delinquency initiation.
A long-term followup of students (6 years after the intervention was completed) showed significant effects on problem behaviors at age 18.
Intervention students reported more commitment and attachment to school, better academic achievement, and less school misbehavior than controls at age 18.
In addition, fewer students had engaged in violent delinquent acts, heavy drinking, and sexual activity.

2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs 55 The Social-Competence Promotion Program for Young Adolescents (SCPP-YA) The 45 session Social Competence Promotion Program for Young Adolescents (SCPP-YA) is a social and emotional learning program that has 3 modules.
The first module includes 27, 40-minute lessons of intensive instruction in self-control, stress management, social problem-solving, and communication skills.
The other modules include two nine-session programs that teach students to apply these personal and social competencies to the prevention of substance use and high-risk sexual behavior.
This 1-year program has produced benefits with diverse fifth- through seventh-grade populations.
It is most effective when offered in the context of coordinated, multiyear social development and health-promotion programming.
......................................................................
.....................................................
Major Services SCPP-YA is a classroom-based program that emphasizes (1) the enhancement of children's selfcontrol, stress management, problem-solving, and communication skills, and (2) the prevention of substance use and high-risk sexual behavior.
The modules are presented with very detailed lesson plans to foster high-quality implementation.
In addition, training is provided to school staff so that the program is well implemented in the classroom and supported and reinforced by educators and families.
Accomplishments Several controlled studies indicate that SCPP-YA improves students' skills, attitudes, and behaviors.
In addition, process evaluations show that students, teachers, and parents respond very favorably to the program.
Also, research indicates that SCPP-YA improves students' problem-solving skills, social relations with peers, and behavioral adjustment.
Program students made greater gains than control students in the number, effectiveness, and the planning of alternative solutions they generated to solve problem situations.
Furthermore, program students' alternatives included fewer aggressive and more compromise solutions than controls, and they employed more adaptive stress-management strategies when faced with situations that make them upset or anxious.
SCPP-YA training also enhances positive involvement with peers as measured by self-report and teacher ratings.
Results from confidential self-report surveys indicate that relative to controls, program students engage in less antisocial behavior, become less inclined to use drugs, and are less likely to engage in excessive alcohol use.

..................................
The STARS for Families (Start Taking Alcohol Risks Seriously) program is a health promotion program designed to prevent alcohol use among middle and junior high school youth.
It has undergone more than 8 years of research supported by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health.
The program's goal is to prevent alcohol use among middle and junior high school youth.
STARS for Families includes media-related, interpersonal, and environmental prevention strategies matched to the specific initiation, change stages, and risk and/or protective factors of individual children.
All prevention strategies are based on the MultiComponent Motivational Stages (McMOS) theoretical model (Werch and DiClemente, 1994).
This innovative program has been shown to result in avoidance of, or reductions in, alcohol use among youth, which has been linked to the occurrence of social problems, injury, illness, death, and rising health care costs.
...................
Major Services The STARS for Families program provides the following services: Health Care Consultations.
The health care consultation protocol permits brief (20-minute) standardized health care provider interventions for youth within specific stages of alcohol initiation and change, while providing a full range of prevention messages addressing risk and protective factors associated with stages of alcohol initiation.
Key Facts Postcards.
Key Facts Postcards mailed to parents/guardians permit parent-child alcohol communication and help parents/guardians talk to their child about staying away from alcohol.
Parents/guardians are mailed 10 postcards, each with different Key Facts addressing the same risk/protective factors found in the health care consultation protocols.
A tear-off, postage-paid portion of the card permits each parent/guardian to provide process data regarding whether he or she talked to his or her child about the key fact message and how useful the message was in helping the parent talk to his or her child about preventing alcohol use.
Parent/Guardian Take Home Lessons.
The Parent/Guardian Take Home Lessons provide a set of brief alcohol prevention activities for parents and/or guardians and their children to complete and return.
Each lesson includes a cover letter describing the program, a set of three activity sheets, a contract which has the child promise to avoid alcohol use, and a feedback sheet to collect process data regarding parent/guardian use of and satisfaction with each lesson.

CADCA is pleased that this year's nominees continue to demonstrate that local, community-based action designed to meet identified needs can indeed make a difference and reduce substance abuse and violence in a community.
We salute their efforts and look forward to continued success in creating safe, healthy, and drug-free communities."
General Dean Chairman and CEO, CADCA CADCA With more than 5,000 community coalition members from across the country, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) is working with these coalitions to realize its vision of An Organization of Excellence Building Drug-Free Communities.
Community coalitions--more than any other entity--are poised to connect multiple sectors of the community, including businesses, parents, media, law enforcement, schools, religious organizations, health providers, social service agencies, and the Government.
By acting in concert through the coalition, all of the partners gain a more complete understanding of the community's problems.
Together, the partners organize and develop plans and programs to coordinate their anti-drug efforts.
The result is a comprehensive, community-wide approach to substance abuse and its related problems.
CADCA's mission is to create and strengthen the capacity of new and existing coalitions to build safe, healthy, and drug-free communities.
The organization supports its members with technical assistance and training, public policy, media strategies and marketing programs, and conferences and special events.
CADCA partners with a number of significant private and public organizations.

Executive Director, NASADAD Testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration March 21, 2000 NASADAD The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Inc.
(NASADAD) is a private, not-forprofit educational, scientific, and informational organization.
The Association was originally incorporated in 1971 to serve State drug agency directors and then, in 1978, the membership was expanded to include State alcoholism agency directors.
Today, all States have combined their State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.
The Board of Directors is composed of a president, first vice president, vice president for drug abuse issues, vice president for alcohol issues, past president, secretary, and treasurer, as well as 10 regional representatives elected by the Association members in the respective regions.
NASADAD's basic purpose is to foster and support the development of effective alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs throughout every State.
NASADAD also serves as a focal point for the examination of alcohol and drug-related issues of common interest to both State and Federal agencies.
62 2000 Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Programs "When it comes to showcasing model programs, there is a continuum that consists of replication, adaptation, and innovation.
Model programs shown to be effective should be replicated, while adaptation of such programs should take place when appropriate.
If replication or adaptation is not feasible, then innovation must occur in order to further the field.
National recognition of such programs is imperative, and findings from these programs should be disseminated nationwide."
Michael Langer President, National Prevention Network NPN The National Prevention Network (NPN) is an organization of State alcohol and drug abuse prevention representatives and an affiliate of NASADAD.
NPN provides a national advocacy and communication system for substance abuse prevention.
State prevention representatives work with their respective State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors to ensure the provision of high quality and effective alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug abuse prevention services in each State.
NPN, in collaboration with the NASADAD Prevention Committee and staff, implements its mission at the national level.
NPN believes that prevention is a complex process that requires more than a singular strategy or approach.
A wide range of factors contributes to alcohol and drug problems, and preventing them is based on the understanding that such factors vary among individuals, geographic regions, age groups, racial/ethnic groups and genders.
Effective prevention is a systemic responsibility involving local, State and national agencies; organizations; and groups.
In conjunction with NASADAD and through NPN's network of State prevention representatives, NPN provides leadership, coordination, and communication to its member States and to the field of prevention in general.
