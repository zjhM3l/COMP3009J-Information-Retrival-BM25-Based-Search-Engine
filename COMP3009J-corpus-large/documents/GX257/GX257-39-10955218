There's no place like New Jersey for the holidays.
Where else, for instance, could you see a reenactment of Washington's crossing of the Delaware? Launched from Titusville, it harkens back to one of the seminal events in American history.
And as if that weren't enough, there's more revolution in the air Â­ at the annual reenactment of the Battle of Trenton which is held the first Saturday after Christmas.
As for less martial pursuits, why not round out your family's celebration of the season with a visit to Ringwood Manor's Victorian Christmas display? While you're in the holiday spirit, take a trip to see the Famous Clinton Guild Christmas Parade or take a tour of Woodstown by candlelight.
For information on the Trenton battle reenactment, call (609) 777-1770.
