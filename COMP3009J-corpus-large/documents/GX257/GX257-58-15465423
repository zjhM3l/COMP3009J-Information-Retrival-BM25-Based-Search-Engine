Student Performance and Instructional Program Delivery B. Gifted and Talented Program C. Compensatory Education D. Career and Technology Education E. Technology F. Discipline Management and Safety
B. GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAM
State legislation passed in 1987 requires all school districts to provide services for gifted and talented students.
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted a state plan for serving gifted students that was designed to provide guidance to districts on meeting the requirements of the law.
The plan also offered assurance that all students would be afforded the opportunity to be fairly and accurately assessed for the appropriate services.
In 1995, state law required the SBOE to "develop and periodically update a state plan of the education of gifted and talented students."
The plan was designed "to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented."
The SBOE plan, adopted in 1996, provides direction for the refinement of existing services and for the creation of additional curricular options for the performance of gifted students.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students identifies five program areas that serve as the basis for measuring how well districts provide services to gifted and talented students.
The areas are student assessment, program design, curriculum and instruction, professional development and family-community involvement.
As shown in Exhibit 2-21, the percentage of Riviera ISD students enrolled in gifted and talented programs was highest among the peer districts and higher than the state average.
Yet no teachers were assigned for G/T program specifically, and the proportion of instructional expenditures budgeted for gifted programs was second lowest among peer districts and significantly lower than the statewide average.
State law requires all Texas school districts to have educational programs serving the needs of gifted and talented students for all grades.
Gifted and talented students are defined as students who have high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.

TEA requires districts to use a systematic process to identify gifted and talented students.
Funding is available through the Texas Foundation School Program.
Riviera ISD provides instruction to students identified as gifted and talented in general classes with teachers who have received specialized training.
The district's definition of gifted for students in Kindergarten through grade 2 includes all children.
At the end of the second grade, teachers identify and nominate students for further assessment as part of the formal program.
Members of the community, parents or businesspeople may nominate students in grades three through eight for specialized training.
A student may also request the training.
Students in high school who attend Accelerated Programs of Pre-Accelerated Programs (AP) in English, science and math courses are considered gifted and talented.
The district encourages all teachers to obtain the 30 hours of initial staff development training required for teachers who provide services to gifted and talented students.
It has been the district's philosophy that all children are gifted and talented, and that instructional strategies appropriate for use with gifted and talented students are also appropriate for use with all students.
All elementary and middle school teachers and high school teachers who teach Advanced Placement (AP) and pre AP classes received the 30 hours of initial staff development training.
Although the district encourages its teachers to receive the required training to teach gifted and talented classes, training was last held in 1995.
The teachers that received the training are scattered throughout grade levels, and it is not known if all gifted students are in their classes.
According to one district official, the program has not been effective in the past.
FINDING
At Riviera ISD, students are identified as gifted and talented mostly based on teacher recommendations.
At the high school level, any student enrolled in AP classes is considered a gifted student.
Although teacher recommendations and enrollment in AP classes could be part of the criteria used to identify gifted and talented students, they are not enough to comply with requirements of the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
The plan requires that students be assessed under multiple qualitative and quantitative measures.
Riviera ISD provides limited opportunities to these gifted and talented children.
The students are placed in the same classroom as regular education students and are taught the regular curriculum.
There are no substantial instructional changes for these students.
According to one principal, teachers are simply instructed to "expect" more from these students.
English allows for challenging selections and science offers science fair participation.
Parents, teachers and community members commented in the forum and through TSPR surveys that the district lacks an effective gifted and talented program.
Recommendation 9: Comply with the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students and adopt a five-year plan for the Gifted and Talented Program.
Long-range planning and student evaluation are important components of a successful gifted and talented program.
