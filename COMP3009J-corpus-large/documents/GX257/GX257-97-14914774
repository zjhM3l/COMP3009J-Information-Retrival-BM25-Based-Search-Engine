BOARD OF SUPERVISORS COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AGENDA ITEM GREG COX First District DIANNE JACOB Second District PAM SLATER Third District RON ROBERTS Fourth District BILL HORN Fifth District DATE: TO: SUBJECT: SUMMARY: February 26, 2002 Board of Supervisors CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Â­ REPORT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE SURVEYS (District: All) Overview The citizens of San Diego County expect quality services regardless of whether they are shopping at a local business or requesting a service that is delivered by a local government agency.
In fact, the customers the government serves should have even higher expectations from public agencies, because they cannot go elsewhere for service.
One of the priorities of the Board, and key theme of the Chief Administrative Officer's goals, is improving the way County government serves its customers.
Providing the residents of San Diego County with superior County services in terms of quality, timeliness and value, is one of the ways this County is earning the respect and support of its residents.
Customer feedback is provided to the County through the Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey and numerous departmental customer service surveys.
We also assess the quality of service delivery internally through Mystery Shopper and Phone Shopper Surveys.
This report summarizes the customer satisfaction data obtained from the following survey tools: The seventh Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey, conducted in August 2001, and Six rounds of Mystery Shopper and Phone Shopper Surveys, conducted during calendar year 2001.
As was shown in previous Surveys, the County's customers remain generally satisfied with County services.
The results for the August 2001 Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey were distributed to the departments through the Customer Service Leadership Committee.
Departments reviewed the results and are working towards correcting any identified weaknesses.
Department Heads also receive the results of each round of Mystery and Phone Shopping Surveys to encourage continuous program improvement.

Recommendation(s) CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER Direct the Chief Administrative Officer to continue to work with the County to resolve customer service issues identified by these surveys, especially those common Countywide, through the activities of the Customer Service Leadership Committee.
Fiscal Impact This item has no fiscal impact.
Business Impact Statement N/A Advisory Board Statement N/A BACKGROUND: Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey The seventh bilingual Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey (Survey) was conducted in August 2001 for a two-week period.
External customers who visited a County office remained the focus of the Survey.
Customers fill out a Survey at the time they received service.
The Survey was designed to query the level of satisfaction of our customers in the following categories.
promptness courtesy knowledge receipt of information requested satisfaction with results of visit overall impression of visit The Survey also asked how long it took for employees to return a customer's phone call, and invited respondents to write comments and suggestions describing how the County could better serve them.
Lastly, the Survey asked optional demographic information about the respondent.
The Department of Human Resources (based on 30 surveys) and the Medical Examiner (Based on 12 surveys) both achieved 99% customer satisfaction ratings.
The following departments achieved 95% customer satisfaction or greater.
Clerk of the Board Â­ 98% (based on 159 Surveys) Office of Disaster Preparedness Â­ 98% (based on 20 Surveys) Library Â­ 97% (based on 957 Surveys) Office of Public Health Â­ 96% (based on 800 Surveys) Auditor Â­ 95% (based on 301 surveys) Children's Mental Health Services Â­ 95% (based on 79 surveys)

The departments that showed the greatest improvements were Probation (79% to 88%), and the Medical Examiner (92% to 99%).
The Department of Environmental Health showed the greatest fluctuation in ratings (97% to 86%).
The Departments of Environmental Health has analyzed the data and is pursuing improvement opportunities.
The District Attorney's Bureau of Child Support Enforcement received the lowest ratings, with a 59% rating based on 37 Surveys.
The County Department of Child Support Services has since replaced the Bureau of Child Support Enforcement.
Child Support Services has restructured its organization to focus all direct customer contact activities into a single Customer Service Division.
That Division includes the call center, interview teams for walk-in customers, an ombudsman program to help customers resolve problems and a state hearing process to resolve disputes.
Goals of 1 minute average call answer time and 15 minute walk-in wait time have been established and communicated to staff and our customers.
In general, the departments surveyed remained within a few points of the satisfaction level they achieved during the November 2000 Survey (the previous Survey period).
This Survey will be conducted again in May 2002.
Results Summary The data, which support the following summary of the Survey results, appear in Attachment A.
The Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey was distributed to 195 mail stops (offices).
One hundred sixty-four (164) or 84% of the offices returned completed Surveys, for a total of 6,829 Surveys.
This return is equivalent to the number of Surveys completed and returned during previous Survey periods.
Table 1 provides an overview of basic statistics of all Countywide Surveys to date.

Consistent with previous Surveys, approximately one-third of the surveys included written comments on the quality of customer service received and/or suggestions for improving services.
The majority of the comments received were of a positive nature.
There were 47 employees commended by name, by two or more customers, during the Survey period.
For reliability purposes, as with previous Survey analyses, the results summarized below focus on departments and offices evaluated by 10 or more respondents.
Departments that participated in the Survey, but received less than 10 evaluations, included Air Pollution Control District, Farm and Home Advisor, General Services, Purchasing and Contracting, and Registrar of Voters.
Results By Department And Office Department Satisfaction Ratings The first six questions of the Survey measured the quality of service received by customers when they visited a County office.
Averaging these six ratings, every department received a score equivalent to percentage ratings between 59% and 99% (Figures 1-5).

Countywide ratings for promptness, courtesy, knowledge, information, and overall impression The first four Questions on the Survey rate the aspects of quality service delivery that are within the departments' control.
Ratings for promptness, courtesy, knowledge, and the receipt of requested information were analyzed to pinpoint where efforts to improve customer service should be concentrated.
Table 4 shows the analysis, per question, for overall County ratings.

Customers are the most satisfied with staff courtesy.
The majority of departments surveyed by more than 10 people were given their highest ratings for courtesy.
Of those, the following departments received the highest ratings in courtesy.
Medical Examiner - 100% (12 Surveys) Office of Disaster Preparedness Â­ 98% (20 Surveys) Clerk of the Board Â­ 98% (159 Surveys) Human Resources Â­ 98% (30 Surveys) Library Â­ 98% (957 Surveys) Office of Public Health Â­ 97% (800 Surveys) Alternate Public Defender Â­ 97% (53 Surveys) In the majority of cases, the lowest department ratings were attributed to promptness, followed by the receipt of needed information.
Continuing to concentrate efforts on reducing customer wait times, providing creative alternatives to established processes, and decreasing project cycle times will have the greatest impact on overall customer satisfaction.
It is also recommended that departments re-examine the information requested most often, and the questions asked most frequently.
This analysis could be used to ensure thorough training of staff and distribution of materials in multiple formats, including adding information to recorded messages, printed brochures and pamphlets, and updating of web pages.
Language Surveys were again available in English and Spanish.
Most of the Surveys were completed in English (5423 or 79%), while 1406 (or 21%) were completed in Spanish.
This percentage shows an increase in the percentage of Surveys completed in Spanish as compared to all previous Survey periods (Table 5).

Approximately one-third of the respondents took the time to write comments and/or suggestions regarding the services they received.
This percentage has remained stable since the inception of this Survey in December of 1997.
Respondents provided over 2400 individual suggestions and/or comments.
They were categorized as they related to: Process, Infrastructure, Staff, or Other.
The comments were additionally categorized as negative, positive or mixed (part of the comment was positive and part was negative).
As detailed in Table 6, comparing the number of negative comments in each category to the total number, areas needing improvement become more clear.

Positive Comments: For most of the departments/regions that received 10 or more comments, the majority of the comments were positive.
For departments receiving 10 or more comments, the following departments received 80% or higher positive comments.
Agriculture, Weights, and Measures (100%) Human Resources (100%) HHSA, Office of Public Health (97%) Clerk of the Board (95%) Library (94%) Alternate Public Defender (93%) HHSA, Children's Mental Health (91%) HHSA, North Central Region (91%) Public Works (90%) Auditor (85%) Animal Control (84%) Parks and Recreation (83%) HHSA, Adult Mental Health Services (81%) Negative Comments: There was only one department that received more negative than positive comments (Child Support Services).
Fourteen of the 19 comments received were negative.
The highest concentrations of negative comments referenced both process and staff.
The positive comments received by Child Support Services all referenced staff.
Child Support Services is in the process of reviewing these results.
Suggestions: Written text was categorized as a suggestion when ways to improve services and the delivery of those services were suggested.
The majority of the suggestions referenced infrastructure improvements, followed closely by process improvements.
As in previous rounds of surveying, when the comments and suggestions are combined, customer input was positive and related mostly to staff.
Frequency of Calls The Medical Examiner had the highest percentage (67%) of counter customers who indicated that they call two to three times per week.
This percentage jumped dramatically from the last Survey, where only 20% of the customers indicated that they called the Medical Examiner that often.
Between 10 and 20% of the customers of the following departments also call frequently.
Public Works (20%) Human Resources (17%) Disaster Preparedness (12%) Auditor (11%) Library (11%) Housing and Community Development (10%)

Timeliness of Return Phone Calls Eighty-one percent (81%) of the departments who received 10 or more responses to this question returned calls on the same day 50% of the time or greater.
This is roughly equivalent to the November 2001 Survey when the percentage was 84.
The following departments did exceptionally well returning their calls on the same day.
Clerk of the Board (94%) Human Resources (82%) Public Works (82%) Office of Disaster Preparedness (80%) Only two offices that showed more than 10 responses to this question show that the "doesn't call back" option chosen over 20% of the time.
HHSA, North Central, Polinsky Center (21%) Child Support Services (58%) Countywide Results Countywide cross-tabulations of responses to optional questions about age, ethnicity, income and gender were performed.
Cross-Tabulations of Responses By Age The two age groups with the largest numbers of respondents remained consistent with all of the previous Surveys: 26-34 (1413), and 35-44 (1683).
Again consistent with the previous Survey results, only 7% did not indicate age.
The data suggest a trend of customers' overall positive impression increasing as age increases.
The age group that had the highest overall positive impression was 65 or over, at 94%.
Cross-Tabulations of Responses By Ethnicity As in previous Surveys, the largest group of respondents indicated that they were White-Non Hispanic (40%), followed by Hispanic (32%).
The ethnic groups that had the highest overall positive impression of our services were as follows.
Hispanic Â­ 92% Native American Â­ 89% Asian Â­ 92% Other Â­ 89% White-Non Hispanic Â­ 91% Pan-Asian Â­ 86% African American Â­ 90% Of those rating overall satisfaction, 9% did not indicate ethnicity.
Cross-Tabulations of Responses By Income Consistent with previous Survey results, the largest number of respondents (2531) indicated their income to be in the $0-$15,000 range.
The highest overall positive impressions were expressed over a range of incomes (i.e. all of the income ranges over $30,000 were equivalent).
This represents a more evenly distributed satisfaction over income ranges than has been seen in past Surveys.
Twenty percent of respondents did not indicate income.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Â­ REPORT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE SURVEYS (District: All)
Cross-Tabulations of Responses By Gender More females (61%) filled out Surveys than males (30%), and both genders indicated almost identical ratings for positive overall impression with our services.
Some people did not indicate their gender (9%).
These statistics are consistent with the majority of the previous Surveys.
Mystery Shopper and Phone Shopper Surveys Data from the Mystery Shopper and Phone Shopper Surveys conducted in 2001 are included in Attachment B.
The rounds include January, March, May, July, September, and November 2001.
A Master List for conducting Mystery and Phone Shopping includes every public office and every public telephone number for each County department as listed in the government section of the Pacific Bell White pages.
The Master List has approximately 500 locations and/or phone numbers, which translates into approximately 2000 individual shopping contacts each calendar year.
It is the goal of the Mystery Shopper and Phone Shopper program to shop each County office and phone number on the Master List at least once during each calendar year.
A team of County employees is assembled to conduct each round of shopping.
Participants represent each of the five County Groups, and conduct shopping activities outside their own department and Group.
Participants are from various levels in the organization, and are encouraged to utilize this program as a cross-training opportunity for themselves and their staff.
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) from each department's web page are used as the basis for the questions that are asked.
Several departments have submitted supplemental questions, in addition to the FAQs.
Departments without FAQs posted on the web were asked to submit appropriate questions directly to the Customer Service Center.
Mystery/Phone Shopping has been refined to utilize four distinct survey evaluation forms.
The shopper chooses the most appropriate form based on the shopping situation.
Mystery Shopping: used when a conversation with a County staff member occurs in person.
Mystery Shopping Â­ Unstaffed Site: used when a location is visited that does not have staff on site.
Phone Shopping: used when a conversation with a County staff member occurs over the telephone.
Phone Shopping Â­ Recorded Message: used to evaluate recorded messages on published County phone numbers.
Each evaluation form rates specific customer service criteria that lead to the formation of the shopper's opinion of the County's service.
Three personas are used during Phone Shopping: Normal, Wrong Number, or Problem.
The "Normal" persona is an average person calling to ask for some information.
The "Wrong Number" assignment directs the callers to pretend that they are trying to reach another department, in order to evaluate staff's willingness to assist them and refer them to the correct department.
The "Problem" persona is a person who either has a problem or is a
- 13 -
SUBJECT:
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Â­ REPORT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE SURVEYS (District: All)
problem.
This persona is used to evaluate the ability to maintain quality service in difficult situations.
At the conclusion of each round of shopping, the results are tabulated by Group and distributed via e-mail.
The visits and phone calls are rated on a 1-5 rating scale, with 5 being the highest possible score.
Results Summary Comments noted during the on-site visits and telephone contacts are distributed with the results of each shopping round in an effort to provide assistance to the departments/programs in designing corrective actions.
In many instances, ratings range between 4 and 5.
When problems are noted, they most often concern long waits on hold, problems with recordings or phone trees, and outdated published phone numbers.
Shoppers also note particularly helpful and courteous employees.
Three calendar years of shopping have been completed since the inception of the Mystery/Phone Shopping Program, as seen in Tables 7 through 9.

What's Next? The departments have reviewed the results of the August 2001 Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey, including the written comments/suggestions.
Mystery/Phone Shopper Surveys are distributed and reviewed following each round of surveying.
The Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey will be conducted again in May 2002.
The Mystery Shopper/Phone Shopper Surveys will continue to be conducted six times each year.
The next customer satisfaction summary report that is brought before your Board will include: Countywide Customer Satisfaction Survey results from May 2002, and Several rounds of 2002 Mystery Shopper/Phone Shopper results.
These surveys, along with other Countywide customer service programs, will continue to be implemented by the Customer Service Center and threaded throughout the organization through the monthly meetings of the Customer Service Leadership Committee.
The County continues to build on the teamwork established through the Customer Service Leadership Committee to address Countywide customer service issues and to delve deeper into the core issues that support the delivery of quality customer service.
Current customer service activities are focusing on providing additional support to departments, providing advanced
