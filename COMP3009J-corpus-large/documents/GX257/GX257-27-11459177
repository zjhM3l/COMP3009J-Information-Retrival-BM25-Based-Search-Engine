Representative of world-class wetlands, the Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia and northern Florida is a complex environment, with an intricate and diverse food chain ranging from protozoa to alligator, bear, human, and osprey.
Here two great rivers are born--the St. Marys, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean, and the Suwannee, which meanders to the Gulf of Mexico.
A sand bowl that is fed by rain runoff and by springs spans roughly nine hundred square miles and consists of water prairies, lakes, islands, streams, and rivers, floodplains, bogs, batteries, houses, hammocks, pine barrens, canals, cypress groves, and dense underbrush, making this wetland unique in the world.
It ebbs and flows based on the amount of rain that falls in the expanded area.
As matter grows into thick foliage swimming on a lake and the roots spread into the peat from earlier plants, the water bodies fill in, first creating floating islands and then becoming fixed and surrounded by water-ways.
Thus, the Native American term 
Fire, generally from lightning, sweeps through during dry periods, burning deep into the peat, creating new openings for water and reopening lakes and channels.
The cycle continues; new growth resumes until one day only minute channels of water exist, and the swamp is no more.
Such is the rich short life of the Okefenokee, created some seven thousand years ago.
As a child growing up in Georgia, I read in school about the mysterious Okefenokee with its alligators, bears, and snakes.
I heard tales of "wild," illiterate, barefooted families who lived in this trackless water-wilderness, populated by the ivory-billed woodpecker and the fabulous whooping crane.
It was a dark and fascinating myth.
By then the ivory-billed woodpecker was near extinction, and the whooping crane had not existed there in modern times.
Yet as I did research for this study, I came across a wonderful story.
Four thousand years ago Native Americans made the lake and swamp area their home, as we know from the many burial mounds on the Okefenokee's islands and at its edges.
Early European explorers told of a handsome race, with beautiful women and fierce warriors, living in the land of the trembling earth.
Native Americans remained there until late in the nineteenth century.
After they left or were driven south, pioneers moved into the swamp and established their own culture.
They were for the most part self-sufficient, leading settled and fruitful lives.
As the swamp became better known, efforts were made to remove the large stands of cypress and pine.
First came an attempt to drain the swamp; although success was close at hand, the company failed.
Then a better-financed lumber company created railroads through the swamp, made Billys Island their headquarters, built a company town, and harvested the great virgin cypress forest.
Broken and almost clear-cut, the huge swamp began to renew its growth, forgotten by everyone except a few environmentalists.
But now the Okefenokee Swamp is preserved for posterity, having been placed under governmental stewardship in the 1930s.
The ivory-billed woodpecker and the panther are no longer seen, but the bear, alligator, and osprey hold court in a renewed environment of rich growth and natural order.
Now the dangers are larger and more pervasive.
Lower water tables, acid rain, disturbed environmental surroundings, habitats crowded by humans and businesses, and ground water pollution have created new challenges for those who want to preserve this area.
A barometer of our stewardship must be the health of the Okefenokee Swamp and its surrounding wetlands.
The present study has been undertaken so that readers may learn about the natural history and see portraits of this unique swamp in its current state and thus be moved to participate in the efforts to protect it forever.
