MISSOURI STATE PLAN FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH PURPOSE Title VII-B, Education for Homeless Children and Youth, of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney Act - P. L. 107-110) provides State Educational Agencies (SEAs) with grant funds to carry out policies to ensure that homeless children and youth have access to a free, appropriate public education (including a public preschool education), provided to the children of a resident of a state and is consistent with the state school attendance laws.
States are to review and revise the residency requirements of their compulsory school attendance laws or other laws, regulations, practices or policies that may act as a barrier, to assure that homeless children within the state are afforded a free and appropriate education, ensuring that such children and youths have an opportunity to meet the same challenging state student academic achievement standards to which all students are held.
DEFINITIONS For the purposes of the State Plan, the following definitions apply:
A homeless individual is one who: A. lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and B. includes-i. children and youths who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; are abandoned in hospitals; or are awaiting foster care placement;
ii. children and youths who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings (within the meaning of section 103(a)(2)(C)); iii. children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings The first category may include some individuals who have moved in with others.
Consideration of each individual case, along with the permanency of the situation, will be needed in order to identify those who are homeless.
The term "enroll" and "enrollment" includes attending classes and participating fully in school activities.
Unaccompanied Youth a youth not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian./9/02 Missouri State Homeless Plan 1 State Plan Section 722(g) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Act: (g) STATE PLAN(1) IN GENERAL- Each State shall submit to the Secretary a plan for the education of homeless children and youths within the State.
Such plan shall include the following: (A) A description of how such children and youths are (or will be) given the opportunity to meet the same challenging State academic achievement standards all students are expected to meet.
Students experiencing homelessness in Missouri are not segregated from their housed peers on the basis of their homelessness and are included in the appropriate educational programs, including compensatory educational programs for the disadvantaged, educational programs for the handicapped; programs for students with limited English proficiency, programs in vocational education, programs for the gifted and talented, preschool programs, and school meal programs.
Students experiencing homelessness are to be included in all regular school assessments.
(B) A description of the procedures the State Educational Agency will use to identify such children and youths in the State and to assess their special needs.
A Homeless Children and Youth Census is conducted every three years, with information gathered from shelters and school districts.
Once the information is gathered, it is distributed on the department's website in order to develop an enhanced statewide understanding of the needs of Missouri's identified homeless children and youth.
In order to receive the most accurate count possible for the homeless census, shelters are asked to count children Pre K and those that may have dropped out of school.
The school districts are asked to count those children enrolled in school that meet the definition of homeless children and youth.
The method our department uses for conducting the homeless children and youth census has also enabled the needs of the homeless to be better identified.
The shelter is able to list what they see as special needs of the homeless, and the school district is able to list what they see as special needs of the homeless.
As a result, the school district and shelter are both becoming more in tune with the specific needs of Missouri's homeless children and youth they each address.
5/9/02 Missouri State Homeless Plan 2 (C) A description of procedures for the prompt resolution of disputes regarding the educational placement of homeless children and youths.
Every school district in the state must designate a board appointed Homeless Coordinator.
The homeless coordinator must work to ensure that homeless children and youth have equal access to the same free public education as is provided to other children and youth.
The district Homeless Coordinator's responsibilities include: 1.
assist with immediate enrollment of homeless children and youth and provide assistance with obtaining academic and medical records; 2.
make school placement decisions based on the best interest of the child and wishes of the parent, guardian, or unaccompanied youth (if the school of best interest is different than the parent or guardian or unaccompanied homeless youth's wishes, then a written statement explaining the school placement decision and the appeal rights must be provided to the parent, guardian, or unaccompanied homeless youth); 3.
handle enrollment disputes (homeless children or youth must be enrolled in the school in which the parent, guardian, or unaccompanied homeless youth seeks enrollment during the dispute and the coordinator will carry out the state's grievance procedure as quickly as possible after receiving notice of the dispute); 4.
prohibit the segregation of homeless children and youth; 5.
provide/arrange transportation and inform the parent, guardian, or unaccompanied homeless youth of the transportation services the school district must make available and assist the homeless children and youth in accessing transportation to and from school; 6.
inform parent, guardian, or unaccompanied homeless youth of the educational and related opportunities available to them; 7.
disseminate public notice of the educational rights of homeless children and youth in places where homeless children and youth receive services (soup kitchens, shelters, salvation army, school, PAT areas, food pantries, community organizations, etc.).
(The school district and phone number of the homeless coordinator may also be listed on the notice for contact information.)

The booklet is in easy to read and understand format and is posted in generic form on the department's website.
An updated version of the "Keeping Kids in School" booklet will be made available before the start of the new school year.
There has been an overwhelming response for additional copies of this booklet across the state.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Administrative Manual for Federal Discretionary Programs contains valuable information on identification of homeless children and youths, responsibilities of the homeless coordinator, school assignment and placement of homeless children and youth, school records, testing, immunization, providing comparable services, transportation, grant funding, staff development, and use of local Title I funds.
