During spring and summer 1993, record flooding inundated much of the upper Mississippi River Basin .The magnitude of the damages-in terms of property, disrupted business, and personal trauma was unmatched by any other flood disaster in United States history .
Property damage alone is expected to exceed $10 billion .
Damaged highways and submerged roads disrupted overland transportation throughout the flooded region .
The Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers were closed to navigation before, during, and after the flooding .
Millions of acres of productive farmland remained under water for weeks during the growing season .
Rills and gullies in many tilled fields are the result of the severe erosion that occurred throughout the Midwestern United States farmbelt .
The hydrologic effects of extended rainfall throughout the upper Midwestern United States were severe and widespread.
The banks and channels of many rivers were severely eroded, and sediment was deposited over large areas of the basin's flood plain .
Record flows submerged many areas that had not been affected by previous floods .
Indus trial and agricultural areas were inundated, which caused concern about the transport and fate of indus trial chemicals, sewage effluent, and agricultural chemicals in the floodwaters .
The extent and duration of the flooding caused numerous levees to fail .
One failed levee on the Raccoon River in Des Moines, Iowa, led to flooding of the city's water treatment plant .
As a result, the city was without drinking water for 19 days .
As the Nation's principal water-science agency, the U .S .
Geological Survey (USGS) is in a unique position to provide an immediate assessment of some of the hydrological effects of the 1993 flood .
The USGS maintains a hydrologic data network and conducts extensive water-resources investigations nation wide .
Long-term data from this network and information on local and regional hydrology provide the basis for identifying and documenting the effects of the flooding .
During the flood, the USGS provided continuous streamflow and related information to the National Weather Service (NWS), the U .S .
Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and many State and local agencies as part of its role to provide basic information on the Nation's surface- and ground-water resources at thousands of locations across the United States .
The NWS has used the data in forecasting floods and issuing flood warnings .
The data have been used by the Corps of Engineers to operate water diversions, dams, locks, and levees .
The FEMA and many State and local emergency management agencies have used USGS hydrologic data and NWS forecasts as part of the basis of their local flood-response activities .
In addition, USGS hydrologists are conducting a series of investigations to document the effects of the flooding and to improve understanding of the related processes .
The major initial findings from these studies will be reported in this Circular series as results become available .
U .S .
Geological Survey Circular 1120, Floods in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, 1993, con sists of individually published chapters that will document the effects of the 1993 flooding .
The series includes data and findings on the magnitude and frequency of peak discharges ; precipitation ; water-qual ity characteristics, including nutrients and man-made contaminants ; transport of sediment ; assessment of sediment deposited on flood plains ; effects of inundation on ground-water quality ; flood-discharge vol ume ; effects of reservoir storage on flood peaks ; stream-channel scour at selected bridges ; extent of flood plain inundation ; and documentation of geomorphologic changes .

VI Sediment Transport in the Lower Missouri and the Central Mississippi Rivers, June 26 through September 14, 1993 Sediment Transport in the Lower Missouri and the Central Mississippi Rivers, June 26 through September 14, 1993 By Robert R. Holmes, Jr.
Abstract Sediment data were collected at five sites in `he lower Missouri and the central Mississippi "'ivers during the 1993 flood .
Bedloads were indi -ectly estimated to be generally less than 5 percent of the suspended-sediment load for this period .
Suspended-sediment loads for the 1993 `food generally were less than during previous goods in 1951 and 1973, which is thought to be attributable to the trapping of sediment in the resi~,rvoirs in the Missouri River Basin that have been operational since 1953 and the depletion of sedi-nent supply and dilution of sediment concentra`ion by the large 1993 flood volumes .
Sediment apparently went into storage, either in the channel or the flood plain, upstream `rpm St .
Louis, Missouri, because the total sus -)ended sediment transported by the Mississippi Iiver past St .
Louis was 22 million metric tons Iess than that transported past the two upstream -?diment stations-below Grafton, Illinois, and at =Iermann, Missouri .
The storage of sediment was -partly verified by the massive amounts of newly deposited sediments on the flood plains .
A nonhomogenous mixture of water is -)resent at St. Louis, which is 24 kilometers down, tream from the normal junction of the Missouri .and the Mississippi Rivers .
During the 1993 good, the suspended-sediment concentration var~ed from one shoreline to the other by a factor of -iearly five .
Aerial photography taken on July 25 ; ndicates the river became well mixed 88 kilome`ers downstream from the normal junction of the `wo rivers .
Several days before and after July 25, ,he junction of the two rivers was 32 kilometers upstream from the normal junction .
The dynamics of sediment transport and movement were exemplified by 4 meters of channel-bed scour from July 12 through July 20 at the Mississippi River at Chester, Illinois .
The channel-bed changes generally followed a pattern of scouring during the flood rise followed by channel-bed aggradation during the recession .
INTRODUCTION Flooding in the upper Mississippi River Basin in 1993 will long be remembered for the magnitude and duration of the river stages and discharges and the sediment deposition in the flood plains .
Record peak discharges were reported at 40 streamflow-gaging stations operated by the U.S .
Geological Survey (USGS ; Parrett and others, 1993) as the Mississippi River at St .
Louis, Missouri, was continuously above flood stage for 81 days from June 26 through September 14 .
The record flooding mobilized, transported, and deposited large quantities of sediment throughout the upper Mississippi River Basin .
The Mississippi River system transports more sediment than any other river in North America (Meade and others, 1990) .
High quantities of sediment affect river navigation and operation of reservoirs and water-treatment plants .
Sediments can adsorb and transport numerous contaminants, such as pesticides and toxic metals, that could be a problem for public health .
To monitor the transport of sediment, the USGS operates data-collection stations for sediment transport at five sites on the lower Missouri and the central Mississippi Rivers .
Purpose and Scope This report summarizes information on sediment concentrations, loads, and size distributions in the lower Missouri and the central Mississippi Rivers during the 81-day flood period from June 26 through Introduction 1 September 14, 1993 .
Data were collected at five existing USGS sediment data-collection stations (hereafter referred to as "sediment stations") during the flood (fig .
1 ; table 1) .
The data collected consist of water discharge, velocity, channel geometry, water-surface slope, detailed multivertical cross-section suspendedsediment concentrations, daily single-vertical sus pended-sediment concentrations, and particle-size dis tributions of bed material and suspended sediment .
Suspended-sediment concentrations and loads at the five sediment stations are analyzed in relation to tem poral and spatial aspects of sediment transport .
Bedload was estimated by applying theoretical equations to hydraulic and geometric data collected onsite dur ing streamflow discharge measurements .
In addition, sediment data from the 1993 flood are compared with those from the 1951 and the 1973 floods on the Mis- sissippi River and from the period of record at each station .
Methods for Data Collection and Computation Two types of sediment stations, daily and peri odic, are operated by the USGS .
The type of station is defined by the frequency and quantity of data col lected.
A daily sediment station has daily concentra tion and load published when, according to Porterfield (1972, p .
1), "sufficient determinations of sediment concentration and water discharge are obtained to jus tify computation of daily sediment discharge .
The end product is a tabulation of daily mean concentration, suspended-sediment discharge (load), and periodic determinations of particle-size distribution of sus pended sediment and bed material ."

'River mile is measured from the junction of the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers for the Missouri he Mississippi River stations .
` Type of record published can be either daily or periodic.
Daily stations have data collected frequently ,and load, whereas periodic stations have data collected less frequently, and usually only load estimates are 3 Water discharge was measured at the Mississippi River at Grafton, station number 05587450 .
4 Although this is a daily record station, daily samples could not be collected at this station .
Therefore, nent loads was computed by transport relations .
River stations and from the Ohio River inflow for enough to define the daily sediment concentration published for time spans of months or longer.
most of the 1993 flood period suspended-sedi ates four daily sediment stations on the central Mississippi River (table 1) .
Data collected at a periodic sediment station are insufficient for daily load computation, but may be adequate to warrant estimation of sediment loads for months or longer periods .
These estimates are made by the use of sediment-transport curves, which relate either suspended-sediment load or concentration to water discharge (Glysson, 1987) .
The USGS operates one periodic sediment station on the lower Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri (table 1) .
All suspended-sediment data were collected according to methods described in Edwards and Glys son (1988) .
At a USGS daily sediment station, sus pended-sediment samples generally are collected once daily (or more frequently) by a local contract observer (hereafter referred to as "observer") at a single loca tion in the river.
Multivertical cross-section samples (hereafter referred to as "cross-section sample") also are collected to "adjust" the single vertical observer samples .
These cross-section samples are collected by using either an equal discharge increment method (EDI) or an equal width method (EWI ; Edwards and Glysson, 1988) at 5 to 10 locations across the stream .
From these data, the daily mean concentration and daily suspended-sediment load are computed by meth ods described in Porterfield (1972) .
Conditions prevented the collection of daily samples at the Mississippi River below Grafton, Illi nois, during the 1993 flood.
Therefore, the EWI cross section data, which were collected periodically, and the data from a few samples collected by the observer are the only sediment data available for this sediment station during the 1993 flood .
A suspended-sediment transport relation (hereafter referred to as "curve") was developed by using the data from the cross-sec tion samples collected during the flood and the sedi ment samples collected before the flood (fig .
2) .
These data, which are shown with the date of collection next to the sample point, indicate a looped curve (hereafter referred to as "hysteresis") (fig .
2) .
This hysteresis is more exaggerated than normal because of the deple tion and dilution of sediment during the 1993 flood, which will be discussed in the section entitled "Sedi ment Loads ."
By using this curve, an estimate was made of the suspended-sediment concentration for each day during the flood period .
The suspended-sediment load for the flood then was computed as the sum of all the daily loads that had been determined as the product of the estimated concentrations, water dis charge, and a conversion factor for tons per day .
The daily suspended-sediment loads before the flood period were determined by methods described in Por terfield (1972) for daily sediment stations .
Since 1948, monthly EDI cross-section samples have been collected at the Missouri River at Hermann by the USGS or the U .S .
Army Corps of Engineers .
During the 1993 flood, EDI samples were collected more frequently by the USGS .
A curve was developed that related suspended-sediment concentration to water discharge .
Because of depletion and dilution of sediment, the 1993 flood data plot below the straight line on the basis of previously collected data, and, therefore, a different line was drawn by visual fit (fig .
3) .

Relation between water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration for the Mississippi River below Grafton, Illinois . were estimated from this curve .
The suspendedsediment load for the flood period was determined to be the sum of all the daily loads that were computed as the product of the daily estimated mean suspendedsediment concentrations, the daily mean water dis charge, and a conversion factor for tons per day.
During the flood, USGS personnel collected daily suspended-sediment samples from the Missis sippi River at St. Louis l at two longitudinal locations (one each near the Missouri and the Illinois shorelines) to account for the incomplete mixing of the Missouri River inflow 24 km upstream.
Cross-section samples usually consisted of 10 verticals collected by using the EDI method .
However, during the flood, one crosssection sample was collected from the front of a barge tow as a nine-vertical EWI sample because the mono rail system used to collect the samples was disabled .
The Mississippi River sediment stations at Chester and Thebes, Illinois, are daily sediment sta tions ; suspended-sediment samples are collected at least daily by observers at a single location in the river .
During the 1993 flood, samples were collected twice daily at Thebes and three times daily at Chester 'During normal flow conditions, USGS personnel collect the two location samples weekly because use of contract observers at this station is not feasible .
From a combination of the samples collected every 2 weeks, cross-section samples collected every 2 months, and the daily turbidity records from two nearby water works intakes (one on each side of the river), a daily record is computed . by the observers .
Cross-section samples were col lected by using the EDI method .
Bed-material samples were collected according to methods described in Edwards and Glysson (1988) .
Suspended-sediment samples were collected from the Mississippi River at Chester, Illinois . by using a US P-63 sampler suspended from a specially designed boom-hoist car.

Relation between water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration for the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri .
Most bed-material samples from the 1993 flood were collected from the bow of a boat because of the extreme depths and velocities .
Particle size was determined on all cross-section suspended-sediment and bed-material samples collected during the flood [tables 2 and 3] .
For suspended sediment cross sections collected by using the EDI method, concentration and size were analyzed for each vertical sampled .
For those suspended-sediment and bed-material cross sections collected by using the EWI method, the samples from all the vertical sections were composited for a single analysis of size ; the con centration of the composited suspended-sediment samples also was determined.
Bedload was not measured directly during this flood because accurate measurements in the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers are not possible at this time under such conditions with existing bedload samplers .
These inaccuracies are, for the most part, the result of the extreme temporal and spatial variability of bedload transport and the distortions of natural flow fields when the bedload sampler moves near the bed (Meade and others, 1990) .
The measurement inaccuracies are increased during the sampling conditions (high veloci ties and large depths) on the Missouri and the Missis sippi Rivers during the flood .
No direct determination of bedload could be made during the 1993 flood, but estimates of bedload were made for each of the five sediment stations .
However, because of the lack of onsite verification data, no single equation could be used to make accu rate estimates of the bedload for such a large river sys tem .
The following equations were used : Meyer-Peter and Muller (Meyer-Peter and Muller, 1948), Modified An attempt was made to collect bedload samples for the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri, by using an experimental sampler designed at the U .S .
Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington .
The sampler was suspended from a crane on the U .S .

The values from these equations give a range of bedload transport estimates for the 1993 flood.
These three equations were selected on the basis of the onsite data required for computation, demon strated use of the equations in a previous upper Missis sippi River study (Jordan, 1965), grain size of material used to develop the equation, and the ability of the equation to estimate the bedload directly.
SEDIMENT TRANSPORT DURING THE 1993 FLOOD The Mississippi River at St .
Louis was continu ously above flood stage from June 26 through Septem ber 14.
From the sediment data collected during the flood at the five stations listed in table 1, suspendedsediment loads have been computed and bedload esti mated for the flood period .
The St .
Louis sediment sta tion was selected to define the flood period because data also had been collected there during the 1951 and the 1973 floods .
The suspended-sediment loads and particle-size data allow examination of the spatial and temporal variation of sediment sizes at the five sedi ment stations, comparison of the 1993 flood with other floods and the period of record, and investigation of the storage and flux of sediment in the lower Missouri and the central Mississippi Rivers .
The cross-section and single vertical suspended-sediment concentration data allow examination of the temporal distribution of concentration in a flood of this magnitude and the non homogenous mixture of sediment downstream of the junction of two large rivers . station at St. Louis, the suspended-sediment concen tration first peaked on July 4, and water-discharge first peaked on July 11 .
During the flood period, the suspended-sediment concentration peaked a second time within 1 day of the water-discharge peak on August 1 .
Similar characteristics of peak sequences between water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration can be seen at Chester and Thebes .
Suspended-sediment loads for the flood period were, in millions of metric tons, 7 at the Mississippi River below Grafton, 70 at the Missouri River at Her mann, 55 at the Mississippi River at St. Louis, 52 at the Mississippi River at Chester, and 51 at the Missis sippi River at Thebes .
The ranges in daily mean con centration and daily loads are listed in table 4 .
Bedload was computed for the range of water discharges at each station during the 1993 flood .
Aver age curves drawn through values of computed bedload values and corresponding water discharge (fig .
5) were used to estimate the daily bedload on the basis of the daily mean water discharge .
The estimated bedloads for the flood period as calculated by use of each equa tion are listed in table 4 .
The three equations provide estimates that generally are within 11 percent of each other at each sediment station except for those below Grafton and at St .

The ranges of the mea sured variables used as input in the bedload equations are listed in table 5 .
The estimated bedloads generally are less than 5 percent of the measured suspended sediment load for all sediment stations except for the station below Grafton where the bedload estimate made by using the Modified Einstein equation was 18 percent of the suspended-sediment load .

At the sediment Accuracy of Suspended-Sediment Concentrations and Loads The accuracy of suspended-sediment-concentra tion data is dependent on sampler error ; measurement error, which includes spatial and temporal misrepre sentations of the mean suspended-sediment concentra tion, as well as onsite personnel error; and laboratory analysis error .
On the basis of reports by the Federal Interagency Sedimentation Project (1952) and Bever age and Futrell (1986), the sampler error was esti mated to be less than 15 percent for the onsite conditions (velocity, depth, bed roughness) during the 1993 flood .

The annual sus pended-sediment load for these stations generally has been thought to be within 10 percent of the true value on the basis of multiple computations of the same record by using variations in the suspended-sediment concentration hydrographs .
These variations were shifted within the estimated range of errors associated with suspended-sediment concentration .
These errors are evident when the data are plotted as shown in figure 4 .
By interpolating the suspended-sediment concentration hydrographs through the middle of the "noise pattern" in these data, some of the error can be dampened out .

For suspended-sediment loads estimated from transport relations, accuracy varies with the type of stream and density of data collection .
In general, the accuracy of the estimate increases with a longer period of record estimated (for example, 3-month period load in comparison with a daily load) because "some of the inaccuracies in measured daily sediment loads will inevitably cancel each other when summed over long periods" (Walling, 1977, p .
531) .
Because the curves used in this report were developed by "visual fit" instead of by regression analysis, a statistical measure of error is unavailable .
However, the probable accu racy of the load estimates for the flood period was 14 determined by a curve that was developed for the Mississippi River at Thebes by using data from four multivertical cross sections and four of the samples collected by observers during the flood period .
Because a daily record exists for this station, the suspended-sediment load estimated by the transport relation for the flood period was compared with the daily computed load for the flood period with the result that the daily record computed load had been overestimated by 14 percent .
This error is a combina tion of all data collection and laboratory errors previ ously discussed plus any error inherent in the transport relation .

Louis was above flood stage for 31 days from June 29 through July 29, whereas in 1973, the river was above flood stage from March 9 through May 20 for a total of 73 days .
The water-discharge volumes and suspended-sediment loads for all flood periods are listed in table 6 .
During the 1993 flood, less sediment was transported on a per-day basis than during the 1951 and the 1973 floods .
One explanation for this difference could be the effect of anthropogenic basin changes from 1951 to 1993 .
Since 1953, reservoirs upstream on the Mis souri River have substantially decreased the sediment transported to the lower Missouri River (Meade and Parker, 1985) .
Holmes (1993) reported a significant downward trend in suspended-sediment concentration from 1948 through 1979 for the Mississippi River at St .
Louis, whereas no trend was detected from 1980 through 1991 .
In addition, a large number of levee breaches occurred during the 1993 flood on the Mis souri River .
These breaches provided numerous poten tial sinks for sediment.
For the Mississippi River sediment stations at St .
Louis, Chester, and Thebes, the median daily suspendedsediment concentration and load for the 1993 flood and the period of record are listed in table 7 .
The median daily loads during the flood were more than five times the median load for the period of record, whereas the median concentrations for the 1993 flood period are extremely low and almost equal to the median concentra tion for the period of record.
Furthermore, the suspended sediment concentrations during the flood are low when compared with concentrations from previous rises in streamflow during the 1993 water year .
The hydrographs of water discharges and suspended-sediment concen trations on the Mississippi River at Thebes for increases in discharge during November 1992 and during the 1993 flood are shown in figure 9 .
The peak suspended-sediment concentration for the first peak in the 1993 flood rise is about one-third of that for the November rise, whereas the peak water discharge for the 1993 flood is about twice that for the November 1992 rise .
The large differences in suspended-sediment concentrations possibly are caused by the seasonal dif ferences of the two rises ; for example, late fall and mid to late summer .
However, the differences are more likely attributable to the depletion of the sediment supply and dilution of the sediment concentration that could be caused by any combination of the following : the unusually wet spring and early summer in 1993 prevented many farmers from plowing and planting, which reduced the amount of fine sediment available to be transported to the rivers ; greater-than-normal flow for much of the spring and early summer on the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers had already purged the system of much of the fine sediment avail able for resuspension ; extremely high-water dis charges diluted the sediment concentration ; or the impact of raindrops, which detach sediment particles, was decreased on native soil by water in many fields .
Between 21 and 29 percent of the 1993 annual suspended-sediment load was transported during the flood period at the sediment stations on the lower Missouri and the central Mississippi Rivers (table 8) .
These percentages of annual load transported are less than those transported by smaller rivers (Meade and others, 1990) where between 52 and 98 percent of the sediment load was transported in 10 percent of the Table 6.

The larger the river system, the less effect suspended-sediment load transported during lower frequency floods have on the annual sediment delivery.
However, regardless of the size of a river system, major channel and bed changes are the result of the dynamics of sediment transport during these low-frequency floods .
The mean annual suspended-sediment loads also are listed in table 8 .
The 1993 water year annual load exceeded the mean annual load by 52 to 75 per cent for all stations except the Missouri River at Her mann where the 1993 load exceeded the mean annual load by 128 percent .
Mixing of Sediment From the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers The Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River 24 km upstream from the sediment station at St .
Louis (fig .
1) .
At St. Louis, the water from the 30,000 Missouri River, which routinely carries a larger sedi ment concentration, is not completely mixed with the water from the central Mississippi River.
The sedi ment contributions for each river are evident in figure 10 .
The more sediment-laden Missouri River water flows along the Missouri shoreline (in the back ground) and the clearer Mississippi River water flows along the Illinois shoreline .
The lateral distribution of suspended-sediment concentrations determined from cross-section samples collected during the flood period is shown in figure 11 .
The concentration of suspended sediment near the Missouri shoreline was about five times greater than that near the Illinois shoreline .
Waters from two major rivers sometimes can flow for tens of kilometers before they become visually mixed .
The mixing distance depends on the river conditions, such as water discharge, season, tempera ture, and relative water discharge and sediment inputs from the two rivers .

In addition, for a large part of the 1993 flood period, the two rivers began flowing together 32 km upstream from where they normally meet .
Inspection of aerial photography taken on August 3, 1993, after major levees failed downstream from St .
Louis on August 1 and 3 indicates that the rivers became mixed 43 km downstream from the nor mal junction of the two rivers .
Aerial photographs taken on June 22, 1988, during a major drought shows that the rivers were mixed within 8 km of their junction .
Knowledge of how this mixing takes place is important for the management of water-treatment plants that are supplied by the Mississippi River.
Storage and Flux of Sediment in the Lower Missouri and the Central Mississippi River Basins Large quantities of sediment were transported past the five sediment stations on the lower Missouri and the central Mississippi Rivers during the 1993 flood (table 8) .
The suspended-sediment load of the Missouri River at Hermann was 10 times greater than 18 that of the Mississippi River below Grafton .
The suspended-sediment load transported by the Mississippi River past St .
Louis was 22 million metric tons less than the sum of the 77 million metric tons of suspended-sediment load transported past the two upstream sediment stations below Grafton and at Hermann during the flood period .
The smaller load at St .
Louis implies that sediment went into storage between the upstream stations and St .
Louis .
This implication is partly verified by the presence of massive quantities of newly deposited sand on river bend flood plains (fig .
12) .
Most of the sand seems to be associated with major levee breaks where high hydraulic heads built up before the levee broke .
These high hydraulic heads in conjunction with the levee break resulted in high-energy flows that transported tremendous quantities of sand onto the flood plains .
Recent surveys (G .K .
Schalk, USGS, written commun ., 1994) from selected Missouri River bend flood plains indicate more material was deposited on the flood plain than was scoured from the levees and flood plains, which indicates that much of the sand came from the river.
Deposition of as much as 0 .14 m of silt and clay and 4 m of sand Sediment Transport in the Lower Missouri and the Central Mississippi Rivers, June 26 through September 1 4, 1993 Fmk Figure 10 .
The Mississippi River at St .
Louis, Missouri, July 30, 1993, looking west, showing the lateral variability in sediment concentration .
Lighter areas are higher in suspended sediment, (Photograph from Srenco Photography, St. Louis, Missouri, 1993, and published with permission .) over more than 20,000 hectare has been observed on the river-bend flood plains downstream from Hermann .
Preliminary estimates from the surveys indicate that more than 35 million metric tons of sediment were deposited on the flood plain between Hermann and the mouth of the Missouri River.
More sediment was transported by the Missouri River at Hermann than by the Mississippi River at St. Louis because the water-surface slope of the Missouri River at Hermann was about 30 percent greater than that of the Mississippi River at St .
Louis (table 5) .
This smaller slope decreases the transport power of the river and, in turn, decreases the ability of the river to suspend and transport sediment .
The total sediment loads at the Mississippi River sediment stations at St .
Louis, Chester, and Thebes for the flood period were within 7 percent of each other [within the accuracy of suspended-sediment-data col lection (Meade and others, 1990)] .
Therefore, on a macroscale, sediment was neither being stored nor added to the system between St .
Louis and Thebes, which implies that the system as a whole was in equi librium because the load at St .
Louis virtually equalled that at Chester and Thebes .
Potential major sinks for sediment were created by levee breaks on the Missis sippi River below St .
Louis ; however, aerial and ground reconnaissance revealed noticeably less associated sand deposition than was evident at the Missouri River levee breaks .
The smaller sand deposits on the Mississippi River could be related to stream pattern differences (abundant, wooded midchannel islands on the Mississippi River compared with much fewer midchannel islands in the Missouri River), differences in width of riparian zones, timing of major levee breaks, and differ ences in energy slope.
On a microscale, there were dynamic changes in the reach from St. Louis to Thebes .

Scour in the channel bed was as great as 4 m from July 12 through July 20, 1993 (fig .

Such scouring adds to the sediment in transport.
A general pattern of scour during the flood rise was followed by aggradation during the recession (fig. 13B) .
However, as of February 3, 1994, the channel bed still had not aggraded to the previous bed level of November 17, 1992 (fig .

SUMMARY Sediment data were collected at five sediment stations on the lower Missouri and the central Missis sippi Rivers during the 1993 flood .
The suspended sediment loads transported past these sites for the 81day flood period from June 26 through September 14, 1993, were, in millions of metric tons, 7 at the Missis sippi River below Grafton, 70 at the Missouri River at Hermann, 55 at the Mississippi River at St .
Louis, 52 at the Mississippi River at Chester, and 51 at the Mississippi River at Thebes .
By using the Meyer-Peter and Muller, the Modified Einstein, and the Schoklitsch equations, bedload was estimated for these sites to be generally less than 5 percent of the suspendedsediment load, except for the station below Grafton .
The 1993 flood generally transported less sedi ment per volume of water discharge than did other floods on the Mississippi River.
This decrease in trans ported sediment probably is attributable to the con struction and operation of reservoirs in the upper 20 Missouri River since 1953 that greatly decreased the supply of sediment, as well as the depletion and dilu tion of sediment that was evident during the 1993 flood .
Possible causes of these phenomena are the unusually wet spring and early summer that prevented many farmers from plowing and planting, which made less fine sediment available to be transported to the rivers ; greater-than-normal flow for much of the spring and early summer, so that the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers had already purged the system of much of the fine sediment available for resuspension ; extremely high water discharges diluted the sediment concentration ; and the decrease in raindrop impact on native soil because of the water in many fields .
The suspended-sediment load transported by the Mississippi River past St .
Louis was 22 million t less than the total of the suspended-sediment loads trans ported past the two upstream sediment stations below Grafton and at Hermann (77 million t) .
This loss of sediment implies that sediment was being stored between the upstream stations and St. Louis and is partly verified by the massive amount of newly deposited sediments on more than 20,000 ha of the flood plain downstream from Hermann .
New sediment deposits as thick as 4 m were observed .
The ability of the Mississippi River near St .
Louis to transport sedi ment generally was less than the Missouri River at Hermann because the water-surface slopes at St .
Louis were about 30 percent less than those at Hermann .
The Missouri River at Hermann contributed 10 times as much sediment as the Mississippi River con tributed below Grafton, which is upstream from the 26 Sediment Transport in the Lower Missouri and the Central Mississippi Rivers, June through September 14, 1993 Figure 12 .

The inflow of the Missouri River causes a nonhomogenous mixture of water in the Mississippi River past St .
Louis 24 km downstream from the inflow.
The suspended-sediment con centration near the Missouri shoreline is almost five times that near the Illinois shoreline .
Aerial photo graphs taken on July 25, 1993, show that the Mississippi River became well mixed 88 km downstream from its normal junction with the Missouri River.
In the Mississippi River reach between St .
Louis and Thebes, the suspended-sediment loads are fairly constant, which implies equilibrium ; however, many dynamic changes occurred within this reach .
For example, at Chester, as much as 4 m of scour was measured between July 12 and July 20, 1993 .
The channel-bed changes generally followed a pattern of Collection of data on large rivers, such as the Missouri and the Mississippi, often requires specialized equipment, such as this monorail system built underneath the Thebes, Illinois, railroad bridge . scouring during the flood rise followed by aggradation during the recession .
