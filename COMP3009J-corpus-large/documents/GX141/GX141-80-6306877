Prevailing winds transport the compounds, sometimes hundreds of miles, across state and national borders.
SO2 and NOx gases and their particulate matter derivatives, sulfates and nitrates, contribute to multiple negative environmental effects: air quality impairment and impacts to public health, acidification of lakes and streams, damage to forest ecosystems, visibility degradation, and acceleration of the decay of building materials and statues.
Reducing the Pollutants that Cause Acid Rain EPAs Acid Rain Program, established under Title IV (Acid Deposition Control) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, calls for major reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the pollutants that cause acid rain.
In an innovative approach to environmental protection, the program uses market incentives to achieve a nationwide limit on SO2 emissions more cost effectively than traditional regulatory methods.
The Acid Rain Program requires a two-phased tightening of restrictions on fossil fuel-fired power plants, resulting in a permanent cap on SO2 of 8.95 million tons nationwide, half the amount emitted in 1980.
Phase I of the SO2 program ran from 1995 through 1999 and affected roughly 440 of the larger, higher emitting utility units, primarily in the eastern U.S. Phase II began in 2000 and extends to all affected sources throughout the country (over 2,000 units nationwide).
NOx emission reductions are also phased, with Phase I beginning in 1996, and Phase II in 2000.
Rather than setting an absolute limit on emissions, EPA controls how much NOx is emitted for each unit of fuel consumed (lb/mm Btu).
(NOx emissions are not capped).
The limits on emission rates per unit of fuel consumed will maintain annual NOx emissions 2 million tons below what emissions would have been without the Acid Rain Program (beginning in 2000).
Another market-based strategy to reduce emissions is the Ozone Transport Commission's NOx Budget Program, a program to reduce summertime NOx emissions, which cause ground level ozone (or smog) in the Northeast United States.
The program caps NOx emissions at 219,000 tons in 1999 and 143,000 tons in 2003 (less than half of the 1990 baseline emission level of 490,000 tons).
The NOx Budget Program uses an allowance trading system, similar to the SO2 trading system under the Acid Rain Program, to harness free market forces to reduce pollution.
The goal of the NOx Budget Program is to reduce NOx emissions region-wide as a part of each state's effort to attain the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ground level ozone.
These NOx reductions will take place in two phases, the first phase beginning on May 1, 1999 and the second phase on May 1, 2003.
The Role of C-MAP: Understanding the Spatial Relationships between Emissions, Acid Deposition, and Environmental Response Phase I of the Acid Rain Program achieved substantial emission reductions, resulting in significant environmental and health benefits.
Understanding the response from these emission reductions to deposition levels and to the environment, is one of the most difficult and important questions remaining.
As even greater emission reductions occur under Phase II of the Acid Rain Program (2000 forward), and with additional NOx reductions expected in the Northeast under the NOx Budget Program, the ability to describe the ecological response to these reductions becomes increasingly important in determining whether current control levels provide adequate protection to human health and the environment.
Using C-MAP, we can better understand the environmental effectiveness of current air pollution reduction strategies geographically, in order to determine if further pollution control steps may be necessary.

Questions Currently Being Explored Using C-MAP
Emission Trends
* Have emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) significantly decreased since 1980? Total sulfur dioxide emissions were significantly reduced during Phase I of the Acid Rain Program.
Phase I sources reduced SO2 emissions by more than 50% from 1980 levels; total utility SO2 emissions (Phase I and II sources) were reduced almost 30% nationwide.

Since 1990, total utility nitrogen oxide emissions (Phase I and II sources) were reduced an average of 23% nationally, following implementation of Phase I of the Acid Rain Program.
However, electric utilities contribute only about one-third of total NOx emissions.
Since total NOx emissions from other sources have remained relatively constant (motor vehicles and other industrial sources also contribute significantly), the reductions achieved under the Acid Rain Program have not resulted in a significant change in total NOx emissions.

Air Quality
* Are reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions resulting in improvements to ambient air quality and sulfur/sulfate deposition? Significant improvements in air quality are observed (ambient sulfur dioxide, sulfate concentrations and sulfur/sulfate deposition) following significant reductions in SO2 emissions beginning in 1995 (Phase I of the Acid Rain Program).

Sensitive Resources
* Where are the most ecologically sensitive areas? Many of the sensitive resources affected by air pollution and acid deposition are found in the same parts of the country: Northeast (Adirondacks), Mid-Atlantic (Mid-Appalachians), Southeast (Great Smokies), Upper Midwest, and West.
+ Acidic Surface Waters View map + Nitrogen-Saturated Forests View map + Sensitive Forest Ecosystems View map + Multiple Sensitive Resources View map * How do the locations of ecologically sensitive areas relate to trends in deposition? Many of the sensitive resources affected by air pollution and acid deposition are found in the same parts of the country: Northeast (Adirondacks), Mid-Atlantic (Mid-Appalachians), Southeast (Great Smokies), Upper Midwest, and West.
Significant reductions in SO2 emissions correlate to large, regional reductions in wet sulfate deposition throughout the Midwestern region, with substantial reductions in the Northeast, Mid- Atlantic, and Southeast.
Due to relatively constant total NOx emissions, although some reduction in wet nitrate deposition is observed in these regions, the changes from earlier years are not significant.
