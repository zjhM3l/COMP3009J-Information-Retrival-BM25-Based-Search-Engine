Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Yosemite National Park Lead Agency: National Park Service Finding of No Significant Impact Purpose and Need This Finding of No Significant Impact documents the decision of the National Park Service (NPS) to adopt a plan to remove Cascades Diversion Dam and the determination that no significant impacts on the human environment are associated with that decision.
The purpose of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is to remove an unnatural obstruction on the Merced River and to restore the river's natural free-flowing condition.
This removal project is consistent with the Wild and Scenic River guidance provided in the Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan (Merced River Plan) and will meet the direction of the Yosemite Valley Plan, which calls for the dam removal of the dam.
Cascades Diversion Dam is classified as a high-hazard structure.
It is in unsatisfactory condition due to flood damage sustained in 1997 and to continuing deterioration associated with age.
In addition, the dam no longer serves a useful purpose - water is not diverted from the site to generate electricity or for other uses, and the impoundment does not regulate high water.
Removal of the existing dam structure is necessary to prevent possible uncontrolled and sudden failure, which could result in a release of impounded water and the deposition of concrete and timber debris, grouted rockfill, and impounded sediment along the downstream channel.
Such an occurrence could pose a considerable threat to valued resources (such as aquatic life, scenic vistas, and recreational opportunities), infrastructure (El Portal Road, wastewater, telephone, and electrical lines), and human life.
In addition, the National Park Service is entrusted with conserving and restoring park values.
This responsibility includes protecting the biological and physical processes that created the park, along with scenic features, natural landscapes, and native plants and wildlife.
The removal of the dam would work toward fulfilling this mandate by restoring this segment of the Merced River.
A complete description of the proposal and its environmental consequences are contained in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.
Alternatives Analyzed
The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment analyzed three alternatives, Alternative 1: No Action, Alternative 2: Complete Dam Removal, and Alternative 3: Partial Dam Removal.
The National Park Service developed these alternatives based on the proposed action's purpose and need, issues raised during scoping, and other public comment.
The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment disclosed the potential environmental consequences that may result from implementation of each alternative.
Comments received during public review of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment were considered in preparation of this Finding of No Significant Impact and are summarized in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Summary of Public Comments and Responses (NPS 2003).
Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative maintains the status quo at Cascades Diversion Dam, as described in Chapter III, Affected Environment.
It provides a baseline from which to compare the action alternatives, to evaluate the magnitude of proposed changes, and to measure the environmental effects of those changes.
Under the No Action Alternative, Cascades Diversion Dam would continue to degrade and would eventually fail.
Dam failure would likely occur during high-flow conditions, releasing large debris and sediments to the river and banks.
In addition, continued deterioration of the dam over time would result in the release of large debris.
Dam debris could damage downstream natural, cultural, and scenic resources as well as recreation opportunities and park facilities.
Dam debris could also result in serious injury and/or fatality to recreational users of the river.
There are voids under the existing timber crib sheathing and many boards are on the verge of collapse that create a potential safety hazard for people walking on the wooden crest of the dam.
The National Park Service would remove dam debris from the river as soon as possible following release, although debris retrieval would not likely commence until low-flow conditions, which could be several months after dam failure or debris release.
Diverted riverflows and erosion could result in adverse impacts to vegetation, soils, and cultural resources along the riverbanks.
Over the long term, uncontrolled dam failure would restore free flow of the Merced River at this location.
Alternative 2: Complete Dam Removal
Alternative 2 includes complete removal of the dam, the dam abutments, the intake structure, and the screenhouse, and restoration of the related river channel located beneath the dam site.
Approximately 4,400 to 5,400 cubic yards of sediments (including rock and boulders) in the area upstream of the dam would be excavated and repositioned to stabilize the river-right bank and decrease the potential for sediment erosion.
Natural river processes would continue to transport remaining sediments (up to a maximum range of approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of sediment) from the impoundment area over time, allowing for a gradual re-establishment of the natural river channel and related riparian habitat.
It is expected that the river would fully recover over time, as sediments are transported from the impoundment area.
However, the rate of natural channel recovery and restoration would be monitored to determine if additional restoration actions were necessary.
Following removal of the river-right abutment, intake structure, and screenhouse, the river-right bank would be stabilized using a bioengineered bank stabilization system (brush layering incorporated into a boulder structure) to prevent erosion.
The objective of this alternative would be to restore the natural river character with a mixture and distribution of boulders, cobbles, gravels, sand, silt, soil, and vegetation similar to those found in adjacent riverbank segments.
Alternative 3: Partial Dam Removal
Alternative 3 includes complete removal of the dam, the river-left dam abutment, and the screenhouse on the river-right intake structure, and restoration of the related river channel located beneath the dam site.
Under this alternative the river-right dam abutment and intake structure would be retained for use as a river viewing platform.
Approximately 4,400 to 5,400 cubic yards of sediments (including rocks and boulders) in the area upstream of the dam would be excavated and repositioned to stabilize the river-right bank and decrease the potential for sediment erosion.
Natural river processes would continue to transport remaining sediments (up to a maximum range of approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of sediment) from the impoundment area over time, allowing for a gradual re-establishment of the natural river channel and related riparian habitat.
It is expected that the river would fully recover incrementally over time, as sediments are transported from the impoundment area.
However, the rate of natural channel recovery and restoration would be monitored to determine if additional restoration actions were necessary.
Following removal of the dam and screenhouse, the river-right bank would be stabilized upstream and downstream of the intake structure using a bioengineered bank stabilization system to prevent erosion of the river-right bank.
The objective of this alternative would be to restore the natural river character with a mixture and distribution of boulders, cobbles, gravels, sand, silt, soil, and vegetation similar to those found in adjacent riverbank segments.
Alternatives Considered but Dismissed
The National Park Service considered five additional alternatives to the proposed action that were dismissed from further consideration because they did not meet the project's purpose and need.
These included:
Â§ Remove Cascades Diversion Dam and Complete Sediment Removal.
Removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam in conjunction with complete removal of the 15,000 to 20,000 cubic yards of sediment in the upstream impoundment would remove sediments that were present prior to construction of the dam in 1917.
Removal of sediment present prior to dam construction would not result in the re-establishment of a near-natural river channel and related riparian habitat.
In addition, this alternative would require 700 to 750 truck trips to remove dam materials and sediment and would entail a project duration of seven months.
This would result in greater impacts to air quality, traffic and access, and recreation-related experience than the action alternatives considered in this environmental assessment.
Â§ Restore Cascades Diversion Dam and Hydroelectric Generating Facility.
Repair of Cascades Diversion Dam and the entire hydroelectric generating facility to fully functioning capacity would require complete removal and reconstruction of the dam overflow structure, reconstruction of approximately one mile of penstock, which would need to be installed under El Portal Road (Highway 140), reconstruction of the tailrace (or outlet channel), and purchase and installation of new generating equipment in the powerhouse.
Although this alternative would alleviate the high-hazard condition of the dam, consistent with the project's Need, it is inconsistent with the Purpose of the project to remove an unnatural obstruction on the Merced River and to restore the river's free-flowing condition, consistent with the Merced River Plan (NPS 2001a) and Yosemite Valley Plan (NPS 2000a).
Â§ Replace Cascades Diversion Dam with Boulders.
This option would require complete removal of the dam overflow structure and installation of large boulders at the current dam site to impound water and limit downstream sediment transport.
This option would perpetuate unnatural conditions at the site, limiting free flow of the Merced River and other natural processes.
Similar to the above scenario, this option is inconsistent with the Purpose of the project.
Â§ Remove Portions of the Dam Over Time.
This option would remove the dam overflow structure, abutments, and the intake structure in phases over a series of years, ultimately resulting in complete removal of all structures and impounded sediments.
Phased removal of the dam over a period of years would expand removal-related impacts.
For example, transportation- and recreation-related effects of removal would last years instead of one season.
Removing only a portion of the dam's overflow structure in the first season could destabilize remaining structures and could result in uncontrolled failure.
Uncontrolled failure of the remaining structures would have downstream impacts on resources and free flow of the Merced River and has potential to adversely affect park facilities, recreational uses, and visitors, similar to the No Action Alternative.
Therefore, this alternative would not be consistent with the Need for this project.
Â§ Combine the Removal of Cascades Diversion Dam with the Final Phase of the El Portal Road Improvement Project.
The National Park Service intends to remove Cascades Diversion Dam, let natural processes prevail through this reach of the Merced River, and allow the river to stabilize.
If the National Park Service decides to proceed with the El Portal Road Improvement Project - Cascades Dam to Pohono Bridge, potential future designs will need to comply with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as well as other legislation and park planning documents.
Although the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is completely distinct from the El Portal Road Improvement Project, the road improvement project is included in the cumulative impact analysis in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment because it is a reasonably foreseeable project that the National Park Service may decide to pursue.
Environmentally Preferable Alternative
The environmentally preferred alternative is determined by applying criteria identified in Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act to each alternative considered.
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the environmentally preferred alternative would best: (1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations; (2) assure for all generations safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings; (3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk of health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences; (4) preserve important historic, cultural and natural aspects of our national heritage and maintaining, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice; (5) achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities; and (6) enhance the quality of renewable resources and approaching the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.
The National Park Service has considered all alternatives in this analysis in accordance with National Environmental Policy Act and Council on Environmental Quality regulations (Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, Section 1505.2) and has determined that Alternative 2: Complete Dam Removal, as presented in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment is environmentally preferable.
After review of potential resource and visitor impacts, and developing mitigation for impacts to natural and cultural resources, the preferred alternative achieves the greatest balance between (1) providing a high level of protection of natural and downstream cultural resources while concurrently attaining the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation; (2) reducing risks to public health and safety; and (3) providing aesthetically pleasing surroundings.
Why the Preferred Alternative Will Not Have a Significant Effect on the Human Environment
Complete dam removal under Alternative 2 would restore the free-flowing condition of the Merced River and return this portion of the river to a more natural condition, thereby enhancing its biologic and hydrologic integrity.
Overall, there would be long-term minor to moderate beneficial impacts on soils, public safety with respect to geologic hazards, hydrologic processes, water quality, vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat, scenic resources, orientation and interpretation, and park operations.
There would be negligible to minor beneficial impacts related air quality, noise, transportation, recreation, and socio-economics.
There would be adverse short-term removal-related impacts to the above resources, which would be reduced by the application of Best Management Practices and resource-specific mitigation measures (see Mitigation, below).
There would be no net loss of wetland habitat as a result of the project.
As the base level of the river drops following dam removal, and the river stabilizes, the channel of the Merced River would narrow in the vicinity of the dam.
As the river narrows, there would be a change in wetland habitat from riverine upper perennial wetland (currently located in the main channel of the Merced River) to palustrine forest, scrub shrub, or emergent wetlands that would line the narrower river channel.
There could be a temporary reduction in the size of wetlands that line the Merced River channel, as wetland vegetation establishes in proximity to the new river channel.
Dam removal activities would have a short-term impact to special-status species associated with ground disturbance and the potential introduction of pollutants.
However, dam removal activities would occur in a controlled manner, with the application of mitigation, reducing the adverse effect to a negligible intensity.
Removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and revegetation would restore the free-flowing condition of the Merced River and return this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing the biological integrity of this segment for Wawona rifle beetle and harlequin duck.
The bioengineered bank stabilization and revegetation would have a beneficial effect on habitat for special-status bats and California spotted owl at this location.
Ground-disturbing activities under the preferred alternative could have a local, long-term, minor, adverse impact to as-yet unknown archeological resources.
Any actions would be performed in accordance with stipulations in the park's 1999 Programmatic Agreement.
Ground-disturbing activities under the preferred alternative could also affect ethnographic resources.
Any actions would be performed in accordance with stipulations in the park's 1999 Programmatic Agreement, such as disturbance avoidance or culturally sensitive design measures.
In addition, the park would continue to consult with culturally associated American Indian tribes under this Programmatic Agreement and the cooperative agreement for traditional uses.
Therefore, the preferred alternative would result in a local, short-term, negligible, adverse impact to ethnographic resources.
These impacts are not considered significant because of their short duration and low intensity.
In addition, mitigations are incorporated into the project design.
The impact of the removal of Cascades Diversion Dam was evaluated and disclosed in the Yosemite Valley Plan Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (Yosemite Valley Plan)(NPS 2000).
This environmental assessment is tiered to the Yosemite Valley Plan and provides greater detail on the manner in which the dam would be removed.
Controlled removal of Cascades Diversion Dam under the preferred alternative would be conducted in compliance with the park's 1999 Programmatic Agreement.
This would avoid impacts to downstream cultural properties.
As to the removal of the dam itself, the Yosemite Valley Plan disclosed that the impact of removing this cultural property is moderate and adverse.
The park has already satisfied the mitigation requirements specified for this point in the process in the 1986 Memorandum of Agreement between the park and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
The Memorandum of Agreement requires additional mitigation measures once the dam is removed.
The Cascades Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment also analyzed cumulative impacts of the project, and in no case were cumulative impacts considered significant.
Complete removal of Cascades Diversion Dam would have both long-term and short-term impacts on natural, cultural, and social resources, though none of the impacts are considered a significant effect on the human environment as defined in the National Environmental Policy Act.
In addition, no highly uncertain or controversial impacts, unique or unknown risks, or elements of precedence have been identified, and implementing the preferred alternative will not violate any federal, state, or local environmental laws.
Non-impairment of Park Resources
Pursuant to the 1916 Organic Act, the National Park Service has a management responsibility "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of future generations."
Therefore, the National Park Service cannot take an action that would "impair" park resources or values.
Based on the analysis provided in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment, the National Park Service concludes that implementation of Alternative 2, Complete Dam Removal, would have no major adverse impacts to a resource or value whose conservation is (1) necessary to fulfill specific purposes identified in the establishing legislation or proclamation of Yosemite National Park; (2) key to the natural or cultural integrity of Yosemite National Park or to opportunities for enjoyment of the park; or (3) identified as a goal in the park's General Management Plan or other relevant National Park Service planning documents.
Consequently, implementation of the proposed action will not violate the National Park Service Organic Act.

Public Involvement and Coordination
Public Involvement
Scoping History
The National Park Service conducted public scoping for the proposed action during Spring 2001.
The Yosemite National Park Superintendent mailed a letter announcing the beginning of the planning process for removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam to individuals and organizations on the park's planning mailing list.
The letter was also posted on the park's web site.
During the planning process, alternatives were developed that addressed dam removal and compliance with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, as amended (16 United States Code [USC] 1274[d]
Through scoping and the public comment review process on the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment, the planning process is being conducted in consultation with affected federal agencies, state and local governments, tribal groups, and interested organizations and individuals.
On-Site Public Meeting
On April 18, 2001, the National Park Service held an informal public scoping meeting to discuss the potential removal of Cascades Diversion Dam.
The meeting included project orientation, group discussion, and a visit to the dam site to view the existing conditions.
The purpose of the informal public scoping meeting was to: (1) provide participants with an overview of existing conditions and the proposed action; (2) ask participants to identify key issues that should be analyzed during the environmental review and compliance process; and (3) provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions regarding project alternatives and the overall environmental review and compliance process.
Results of Scoping
Scoping comments were received through April 27, 2001.
As a result of the scoping effort, over 75 public scoping comments were elicited.
All comments were reviewed and analyzed to determine public concerns.
In addition, the National Park Service posts a project fact sheet and project planning updates on the park's web site.
Project planning updates have also been presented at ongoing open house meetings and in the park's planning update newsletter.
Based on public scoping comments, and applicable federal law, regulations, and executive orders, the National Park Service determined that an environmental assessment (not an en environmental impact statement) would be the appropriate level of compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.
Public scoping comments, and issues raised by National Park Service staff, provided input used in the alternatives development process and in the analysis presented in this document.
Public Comment
The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment was released for a 30-day public review period beginning February 19, 2003 and closed March 24, 2003.
In addition, the National Park Service held regular Open Houses during 2003 to disseminate information and collect informal written comments on the Cascades Dam Removal and other projects.
Comments received during the formal public comment period consisted of 22 letters, emails, and faxes from 23 individuals with a total of 81 comments.
Issues raised included NEPA compliance, alternatives, bank stabilization, interpretation, aesthetics, and cumulative projects.
None of the comments received introduced substantive new information nor raised any issues not fully considered in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.
No modifications to the proposed action were made as a result of comments.

Coordination
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a Special Site Permit for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project in conjunction with preparation of the El Portal Road Improvements Environmental Assessment in 1997.
In December 2002, the National Park Service requested an extension on the timeline of the permit for dam removal activities.
The extended permit would be valid only for actions related to dam removal, and would not be valid for actions regarding possible future El Portal Road improvements.
In addition, the National Park Service notified the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was a discrete project from the future El Portal Road Improvement Project and would not include road improvements.
The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will not be implemented until the extended permit is in place.
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board
The National Park Service is in the process of applying for California Regional Water Quality Control Board Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification.
The National Park Service may be required to submit a report of waste discharge, and obtain Waste Discharge Requirements or an individual waiver.
Copies of the existing waste discharge waiver are on file at Yosemite National Park.
The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will not be initiated until the certification is place.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is not likely to adversely affect any threatened or endangered species or critical habitat (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Letter, March 10, 2003, Reference Number 1-1-03-I-1275).
California State Historic Preservation Officer
Cascades Diversion Dam has been the subject of previous evaluation and mitigation actions, as described at the beginning of this chapter.
In 1986, the National Park Service evaluated the impacts associated with the demolition, relocation, and/or rehabilitation of all components of the Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant (also known as the Cascades Powerhouse).
This evaluation included the removal of the dam.
With the completion of this evaluation, the National Park Service completed the consultation process associated with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
As part of this process, the National Park Service signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the California State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
A copy of the memorandum is located at the end of Chapter VI of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.
A copy of the verification letter is also on file at Yosemite National Park.
The National Park Service has complied with the various stipulations of the Memorandum of Agreement and has sent a letter to the State Historic Preservation Officer indicating that the Section 106 consultation process is complete.
A letter of concurrence was received from the California State Historic Preservation Officer on March 18, 2003.
The letter requested additional details regarding compliance with stipulations of the Memorandum of Agreement, but indicated there is no objection to any aspect of the notification regarding the adverse effects, provided the proposed mitigation measures are implemented (table 1-1).
A copy of the verification letter is on file at Yosemite National Park.
Culturally Associated American Indians
The National Park Service conducted consultation with culturally associated American Indian tribes according to stipulations of the Programmatic Agreement and specific agreements.
Between June 28, 2000 and July 17, 2000, National Park Service representatives met with representatives from seven tribal groups associated with Yosemite National Park.
