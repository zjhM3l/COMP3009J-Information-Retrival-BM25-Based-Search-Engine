New Jersey Residents Receive States Top Military Award at Clifton ____________________________________________________________
CLIFTON, NJ- October 16, at 7:00 p.m. Senator Norm Robertson and Assemblyman Gerry Zecker will co-host with the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs an award ceremony, at Clifton High School, to present the New Jersey Distinguished Service Medal, the states top military award, to 153 Passaic and Essex County residents who are combat veterans of World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Persian Gulf War, Somalia or Bosnia.
Clifton High School is located at 333 Colfax Avenue in Clifton.
In order to be eligible for the Distinguished Service Medal, recipients must currently be a resident of New Jersey and also have been a resident of the state at the time they entered into military service; have been honorably discharged; and, must have received at least the equivalent of the Air Medal, Purple Heart, or Bronze Star or proof of having served in combat while on active duty during wartime.
Those recipients whose service was recognized by the award of the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Air Medal or equivalent medal will receive a NJ Distinguished Service Medal with an oak leaf cluster.
The DSM can be awarded posthumously to the next-of-kin of a veteran who meets the criteria.
The NJ DSM was originally issued in 1858 for those who had distinguished themselves in the New Jersey Militia, but was infrequently used until re-authorized by Governor Kean in 1988.
After the Spanish American War, the Mexican Border Expedition and again after World War I, the State of New Jersey minted special medals for returning NJ veterans to honor their service.
After WWII, Korea, Vietnam and subsequent combat actions no such medal was available.
The State of New Jersey was looking for an appropriate way to honor all of these returning combat veterans and acknowledge the debt the state owed them for their service.
The NJ DSM was then authorized for that purpose.
It is New Jerseys highest military award.
Since its re-authorization in 1988, about 8000 medals have been awarded to combat veterans from New Jersey.
The New Jersey veterans receiving the New Jersey Distinguished Service Medal are a credit to our state and our nation.
Their sacrifice and their bravery in combat is truly deserving of New Jerseys highest military award.
The award also serves as a great way to thank our veterans for their extraordinary achievements while our nation has been at war, said Acting Governor Donald T. DiFrancesco.
In order to be eligible for the Distinguished Service Medal you must meet all the following criteria: ~ currently be a resident of New Jersey ~ have been a resident of New Jersey at the time you entered into military service ~ have been honorably discharged ~ have proof of having served in combat while on active duty during wartime.
Those recipients whose service was recognized by the award of the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Air Medal or equivalent medal will receive a NJ Distinguished Service Medal with an oak leaf cluster.
The DSM can be awarded posthumously to the next-of-kin of a veteran who meets the criteria.
Anyone interested in applying for the New Jersey Distinguished Service Medal should send a written request together with copies of all pertinent information, discharge document (e.g. DD 214 ), award citation, honorable discharge, etc. to:
NJDMAVA ATTN: CIO-GS-PA P.O. Box 340 Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0340 Be sure to include full name, home address and daytime telephone number.
