USAID's principal objectives in Ecuador are to conserve biodiversity, increase support for the democratic system, improve the quality of life of the population living along Ecuador's borders and increase economic opportunities for the poor.
Environment: Ecuador may have more biological diversity than any other country on earth, and USAID's program is helping to conserve substantial areas of this globally significant habitat.
USAID efforts focus on improving the country's environmental policy and legal framework, developing improved natural resource management practices and strengthening the capabilities of local groups to carry out effective conservation actions.
The development of improved policies, legal frameworks and science-based regulations has played a key role in reducing the often violent conflict associated with management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
The biologically rich Reserve (the focus of USAID/Ecuador's efforts in the Galapagos) was declared a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in December 2001, a landmark victory for conservation and USAID.
Democracy: USAID's democracy strategy focuses on strengthening the transparency and accountability of selected democratic institutions, fostering greater inclusiveness of historically disadvantaged groups in key democratic processes and increasing consensus on policies that are critical to democratic consolidation.
USAID was instrumental in supporting a new Criminal Procedures Code that came into effect in July 2001.
USAID's work with the accusatory justice system through effective training and other related efforts, such as improving civil society capacity to oversee government functions and expanding access to justice, is ongoing and will continue to fight corruption.
USAID will continue to provide technical assistance and training to key justice sector institutions to ensure proper implementation of the Code.
USAID is also supporting this year's elections as a means of reinforcing the legitimacy of democracy, strengthening the governing mandate of elected representatives and facilitating greater citizen participation in this key democratic process.
Border Development - Southern Border: USAID supports the 1998 Peace Agreement to improve social and economic conditions of inhabitants along the Ecuador-Peru border.
USAID support focuses on income generation for small and micro-entrepreneurs; increasing availability and access to social services (with an emphasis on health, water, and sanitation); improving natural resources management (including sustainable forest management, land titling, and technical assistance in production and marketing of timber and non-timber products); and strengthening local government.
Border Development - Northern Border: USAID's northern border program focuses on increasing stability and prosperity and strengthening local institutions.
USAID supports social and productive infrastructure (including health, water and sanitation services and the construction and/or repair of roads, bridges and small irrigation systems) and civil society activities including an on-going land-titling program for small farmers; human rights and legal defense; the provision of environmental assessments and monitoring and a drug-use education and prevention program.
Additional activities are specifically directed at strengthening indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian community organizations.
Poverty Reduction: USAID's program focuses on two areas: a) support for strengthening the microfinance sector, allowing increased access to financial and non-financial services by urban and rural microentrepreneurs and b) strengthening the macroeconomic environment by increasing fiscal transparency, improving tax administration, strengthening the investment climate and promoting competitiveness.
