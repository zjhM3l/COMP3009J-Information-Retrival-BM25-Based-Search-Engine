Steven A. Lonsdorf, President, Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, Inc.
Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Members of Congress:
The difficulties of Long Term Capital Management, L.P. have raised a number of economic issues.
This U.S. hedge fund, which specializes in fixed-income arbitrage, only recently collapsed and was resuscitated by an unprecedented bailout by 14 private sector banks.
This rescue came amidst intense speculation about the safety of hedge funds, not only for the individual investors in the funds, but also for the banking community as a whole.
Some of these concerns are valid, and should be addressed.
Hedge funds have operated for many years with a noticeable lack of transparency and consequently have been easy scapegoats for much deeper-seated problems that have nothing to do with the activities of hedge funds.
Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, Inc. and its affiliates have been researching hedge funds for over six years and should be able to shed some light on the activities of the hedge fund industry.
Perhaps the first question to address is whether Long Term Capital Management, L.P.'s investment strategies jeopardized the banking system in the U.S. and around the world.
We believe the answer to this question is both yes and no.
Long Term Capital's biggest problem was not its strategy, but its extreme use of leverage.
The fund was able to generate such highly leveraged positions that the demise of those positions would have caused price dislocations in the markets in which it was involved.
This could have destabilized these markets and further eroded investor confidence in the stability and viability of these markets and in the banking system.
However, Long Term Capital could not have achieved these large, highly leveraged positions without significant loans from banks and investment houses.
In our opinion, the question should be raised as to whether the banks did sufficient investigation regarding the risk of these loans to Long Term Capital.
Banks also allowed leveraged loans to be made in the very markets in which their own proprietary trading desks were already engaging in leveraged transactions.
We point this out so people do not think that hedge funds are the only investors using high leverage.
The proprietary trading desks of most major international banks trade much larger positions than almost any single hedge fund.
Whether the banks should have been able to gauge adequately the counter-party risks in these over-the-counter derivatives transactions is another matter, and Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, Inc. is not qualified to assess the banks' abilities to gauge those risks.
Even given the large amounts of leverage in play, it is questionable whether the size of Long Term Capital's positions was so great that the U.S. banking system was in danger of collapsing.
At worst, a loss in these large positions could have damaged profit margins for the banks involved, reduced liquidity in the markets, and compromised banks ability to loan money in the future.
Many people may wonder whether hedge funds have collectively grown so large and their positions so venturous that they are a source, rather than a mitigator, of systemic risk.
This scenario is unlikely.
First of all, hedge funds never claimed to be mitigators of systemic risk.
It is probably true, however, that hedge funds make the global markets more efficient and help to establish the true market value of currencies, interest rates, and stock markets.
We estimate the global hedge fund industry manages approximately $300 billion in equity as of the end of 1997.
(See Exhibit I) This is not a significant amount of capital when compared to the level of capital in the global financial markets.
Our proprietary research indicates that the leverage used by hedge funds in general is quite modest.
Approximately 30% of all hedge funds use no leverage.
Approximately 54% of all hedge funds use less than 2 to 1 leverage (one dollar is invested as two).
Only approximately 16% of all hedge funds use greater than 2 to 1 leverage.
(See Exhibit II).
Very few hedge funds use leverage greater than 10 to 1.
Most hedge funds that use higher leverage are involved in various arbitrage strategies so that the amount of leverage is not necessarily an accurate barometer of the amount of actual market risk.
The assets controlled by hedge funds are very small in relation to the total size of the world's financial markets.
Hedge funds are given far more credit by the press and politicians for causing global market dislocations than they deserve.
Historically, it has been the financial policies of sovereign governments that have caused most of the world's financial problems, not hedge funds.
The general lack of information available about hedge funds and their actual trading activities has created an information vacuum that has allowed the press and certain world government leaders to use hedge funds as a convenient scapegoat to explain away their own policy shortcomings.
One could ask whether Long Term was too big, too leveraged, and too intertwined with other large market participants to fail.
Long Term Capital was not too large in terms of actual client equity under management.
There are other hedge fund management companies that are much larger.
However, Long Term Capital was too leveraged to adequately control the risk factors present in today's global markets.
The world changed and Long Term Capital was caught in a trading situation that its models did not predict accurately.
This is normal and happens to all traders from time to time.
However, the extreme use of leverage made the consequences of being wrong unacceptably large.
It is impossible for any mathematical model to assess completely in advance all the possible portfolio risks that could occur during times of unusual market conditions.
The Asian situation, Russia's devaluation of debt to between 10 and 20 cents on the dollar, concerns about Latin American currencies, the widening of spreads between U.S. Treasuries and other nations' sovereign debt, as well as U.S. corporate debt created situations in the markets that were difficult to foresee.
If hedge funds got on the wrong side of these market moves and used substantial leverage, as Long Term Capital did, very serious losses could occur.
One should keep in mind that mutual funds and other traditional investment vehicles also lost substantial amounts of investor capital.
In fact, our research shows that hedge funds as a group protected investors' equity more efficiently in August and year-to-date than other traditional investment vehicles.
(See Exhibit III) Historically, hedge funds have protected investors' capital in stock market downturns.
(See Exhibit IV)
Usually when a hedge fund loses large sums of money the investors are the only losers.
Ordinary citizens are typically not affected.
Long Term Capital was an exception to the general rule because of the magnitude of its positions and the involvement of so many banks and brokerage houses.
Even in this case, it is hard to determine the direct effect on ordinary citizens.
Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, Inc. does not have enough specific financial information regarding the actual trading positions of Long Term Capital and the amount of risk exposure that specific international banks and brokerage houses had to determine if this situation necessitated the coordinated bailout that took place.
We do believe that it was prudent for the Federal Reserve to have coordinated the private sector bailout of Long Term Capital, thus hopefully avoiding a much worse situation in the future that might have necessitated the use of public funds.

The Van Worldwide Hedge Fund Indexes
The Van Hedge Fund Index is based on performance information received from U.S. and offshore hedge funds.
The underlying hedge fund data bank contains information on over 4,000 funds.
It consists of two databases.
The primary database, which is used in construction of the Index, contains detailed information on over 2,600 hedge funds (1,500 U.S. and 1,100 offshore).
These funds represent about $140 billion of assets.
The secondary database contains basic information on approximately 1,400 hedge funds.
The Indexes are used primarily for benchmarking and are produced as a service to institutions, plan sponsors, consulting firms, individual investors and the financial services industry.
The information received from individual hedge funds is considered to be confidential.
Hedge fund manager identity and returns are released only with the manager's permission.
The primary use of the database is to identify hedge funds for investors, and on request, to custom-design hedge fund portfolios.
The Company is a registered investment advisor based in Nashville, Tennessee.
The Company's Chairman is a member of the Advisory Board of the Financial Markets Research Center of Vanderbilt University.
This Index information, as well as educational information for investors on hedge funds, including research findings of VAN and its affiliates, are found on a website at www.vanhedge.com.

HEDGE FUNDS TROUNCE ALL EQUITY INDICES IN AUGUST
Short Sellers Big Winners
In the face of some of the greatest global market instability in recent memory, U.S. and Offshore hedge funds on average substantially outperformed every major equity investment index in August.
For quite some time, hedge funds have been crying 'Bear!' and lagging the markets due to their defensive positions.
In August, they were vindicated.
While the Average Equity Mutual Fund lost -16.6% and the S
As a result, year to date, U.S. hedge funds on average are up 1.1% while the Average Equity Mutual Fund is down -11.2%, the DJIA is down -3.6% and the S
Approximately 25% of U.S. hedge funds and 20% of Offshore hedge funds were profitable in the month.
Equally importantly, some of the strategies specifically designed to be uncorrelated to the markets performed as they should.
The 'market neutral' strategies and market timing funds either had very small losses or were profitable.
Many continue to recommend increasing allocations to hedge funds in light of their overall superior performance during periods of market instability.
During the six S
This is a telling point for investors, particularly those who've staked their futures on index funds and similar vehicles.
August's major sell-off presented U.S. and Offshore Short Selling hedge funds with substantial profit opportunities.
U.S. Short Selling hedge funds on average were up 29.1% in August, while their Offshore counterparts were up 20.6%, thereby providing investors in these funds with relief from losses incurred over the course of one of the longest running bull markets in history.
Year-to-date through August, the best performing hedge fund investment styles world-wide were as follows: U.S. Short Selling (+26.9%), U.S.
Market Timing (+17.4%) and Offshore Short Selling (+16.2%).
SOME HEDGE FUND INVESTING STRATEGY DEFINITIONS
Aggressive Growth: Expected acceleration in growth of earnings per share.
Often current earnings growth is high.
Generally high P/E, low/no dividends.
Usually small-cap or micro-cap stocks which are expected to experience very rapid growth.
Distressed Securities: Buying the equity or debt of companies that are in or are facing bankruptcy.
Investor buys company securities at a low price and hopes that company will come out of bankruptcy and securities will appreciate.
Emerging Markets: Investing in the equity or debt of emerging markets.
These countries tend to have high inflation and high, volatile growth.
The definition of an "emerging market" is the market in any country with per capita GNP of U.S. $7620 or less in 1990 (World Bank).
Financial Services: Manager invests at least 50% of his portfolio in the securities of banks, thrifts, credit unions, savings 
Currently available quarterly only.
Fund of Funds: Manager invests in other money managers or pooled vehicles which may utilize a variety of investing styles, creating a diverse investment vehicle for his investors.
The manager may or may not choose to reveal to his investors the funds in which he is invested.
Healthcare: Manager invests at least 50% of his portfolio in the securities of healthcare products; pharmaceutical, biomedical, and medical services, and/or other healthcare companies.
Currently available quarterly only.
Income: Investment with a focus on yield/current income rather than solely on capital gains and appreciation over time.
Macro: A global or international manager who employs an opportunistic, "top-down" approach, following major changes in global economies and hoping to realize profits from significant shifts in global interest rates, important changes in countries' economic policies, etc.
Market Neutral-Arbitrage / Convertible Arbitrage: Manager focuses on obtaining returns with low or no correlation to the market.
Manager buys different securities of the same issuer (e.g., the common stock and convertibles) and "works the spread" between them.
For example, within the same company the manager buys one form of security that he believes is undervalued and sells short another security of the same company.
Market Neutral-Securities Hedging: Manager is long some securities and short others, with no real correlation between long and short plays.
Presumably, "net exposure" to the market is reduced because if the market moves dramatically in one direction, longs might lose but shorts will gain and negate the move, and vice versa.
If longs selected are undervalued and shorts overvalued, there should be net benefit.
Market Timing: Large commitments to one or two asset classes depending on economic or market outlook.
Frequently, a portfolio will be invested 100% in either stocks, bonds, or cash equivalents.
Anticipates/predicts timing of when to be in and out of markets.
Media/Communications: Manager invests at least 50% of his portfolio in the securities of companies involved in: telecommunications, the media, publishing, information technology, the manufacture of cellular products, and/or other information services.
Currently available quarterly only.
Opportunistic: Manager changes from strategy to strategy as manager deems appropriate.
Can utilize one or many investing styles at a given time and is not restricted to any particular investment approach or asset class.
Several Strategies: Manager employs various specific, pre-determined strategies in an effort to diversify his approach, e.g., using "Value," "Aggressive Growth," and "Special Situations" strategies in tandem to realize short- and long-term gains.
Short Selling: Strategy is based on finding overvalued companies and selling the shares of those companies.
The investor does not own these shares.
He is anticipating that the share price of the company will fall and borrows the shares from his broker.
Ideally, when the share price does fall, the investor buys shares at the new, lower price and thus can replace, to the broker, the shares sold earlier, thus netting a gain.
This strategy is also employed where the investor believes share price will fall due to company problems, etc.
Special Situations: Usually "event-driven."
Manager takes significant position in limited number of companies with "special situations," where companies' situations are unusual in a possible variety of ways and offer profit opportunities: e.g., depressed stock, an event in the offing, offering significant potential market interest (e.g., company is being merged with or acquired by another company), reorganizations, bad news emerging which will temporarily depress stock (thus manager shorts stock), etc.
Technology: Manager invests at least 50% of his portfolio in the securities of electronics companies, hardware and software producers, semi-conductor manufacturers, computer service companies, biotechnology and/or other companies dealing in "high technology."
Currently available quarterly only.
Value: Manager invests in stocks which are perceived to be selling at a discount to their intrinsic or potential worth, i.e., "undervalued," or in stocks which are out of favor with the market and are "underfollowed" by analysts.
Manager believes that the share price of these stocks will increase as "value" of company is recognized by the market.

The Limitations of Statistics
Any statistic, such as the Van Ratio (also called the Risk of Loss^TM) is based on the historical behavior of whatever is being measured - in this case, hedge funds.
It measures the Risk of Loss in that past period.
If the world didn't change in any way, and the fund's behavior didn't, and Risk of Loss was a perfect measure, then Risk of Loss (or any other statistic being used) might well provide us a solid guideline for the future.
Unfortunately, things don't work that way.
No statistic is perfect, and, in addition, both the world and fund behavior do change.
Accordingly, investors should exhibit caution in using statistics as guidelines to investment decisions.
Statistics do not and cannot predict events in the future with any certainty.
Investors should make their decisions based on a variety of factors in addition to looking at statistics and past results as possible guidelines.
Hedge funds have inherent in them an element of risk that is not present to the same degree in many other investments, such as mutual funds.
That risk is the future use of bad judgment by the fund manager in such areas as portfolio concentration, leverage and/or liquidity.
Further, that particular risk is not measurable, as, by definition, it relates to the future.
For example, many hedge funds use large amounts of leverage and the risk control of the fund's leverage is often totally dependent, from moment to moment, on the judgment of its manager.
While the history of hedge funds overall has been good in this regard, there have been occasional hedge fund failures.
Accordingly, a single hedge fund, or a number of hedge funds, that might exhibit low Risk of Loss characteristics for the past, could become much more risky very quickly if the hedge fund managers in question did not control risk as well as they had in the historical periods measured.
Neither statistics nor past results are necessarily indicative of future performance.
Explanatory Notes * All information provided for various managers or indices is from sources believed to be reliable.
Data are not necessarily audited or independently verified.
* Van Ratio measurements represent empirical estimates of the probability of an annual loss within the time periods measured; these estimates assume that returns are normally distributed.
The Van Ratio (Risk of Loss^TM) is calculated two ways.
M[1 ](Method 1) calculates Risk of Loss for all benchmarks, including hedge funds, mutual funds and the S
In calculating Risk of Loss for hedge funds, for example, it uses, for both returns and standard deviation, the quarterly average returns of all hedge funds in our database for which Risk of Loss^ is measured.
All hedge funds in the sample are used for each period.
Thus, hedge funds as well as all other benchmarks obtain the benefits of diversification in this measurement.
As can be seen, the Van Ratio so calculated is significantly lower for hedge funds in the periods measured.
M[2 ](Method 2) calculates the Van Ratio (Risk of Loss^TM) for each hedge fund separately over the periods measured.
The separately calculated Van Ratios for each fund are then averaged to obtain the M[2 ]Van Ratio.
Thus, hedge funds do not obtain the benefits of inter-vehicle diversification in this calculation.
By contrast, diversification is provided the other benchmarks for which only calculation M[1] has been done.
(The format in which information is provided for the other benchmarks, by outside third parties, makes it problematic to perform the M[2] calculation for them.)
M[2] represents the method in which the Van Ratio has been presented in the past.
In order to obtain the low Risk of Loss resulting from the benefits of diversification assumed by method 1 (M[1]), an investor would have to be invested in a basket of hedge funds or mutual funds or stocks that mimics the movements of all hedge funds or mutual funds or stocks, respectively.
The Van Ratio as calculated in Method 1[ ]is most appropriately used in comparing the relative risk among benchmarks; i.e., the Risk of Loss for the "average" hedge fund so calculated is less than the Risk of Loss^TM for the average mutual fund.
The Van Ratio as calculated in Method[ ]2, is most appropriately used in comparing the risk of an individual hedge fund against the "average" hedge fund.
* As with any investment, investors are subject to a risk of loss.
* Past results are not necessarily indicative of future performance.
* Compound annual returns are calculated using geometrically-linked quarterly average returns by style and in aggregate.
* S
* Information on hedge funds is based on a sample of funds in Van Hedge Fund Advisors, Inc.'s ("VHFA") database and may not be representative of all hedge funds.
Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, Inc.
("VAN") and VHFA attempt to provide accurate information on hedge funds but do not warrant its completeness or accuracy.
* All information provided is accurate to the best of VAN's and VHFA's knowledge and belief.
Opinions and estimates constitute our judgment and are subject to change without notice.
The information herein should not be construed as investment or legal advice.
Neither VAN nor VHFA assume responsibility for the interpretation, accuracy or completeness of the information.
Each reader is solely liable for any use such reader may make of this information.
* Different statistics may be based on different numbers of funds, for technical reasons.
Some numbers may have been adjusted due to the effects of rounding.
If a manager's performance history began at any time other than the beginning of a quarter, that manager's statistics were calculated assuming the manager's performance history began at the beginning of the quarter.
* Monthly hedge fund returns are estimated based on a smaller sample than the quarterly results; therefore, geometrically linking three monthly results will not yield a quarterly result.
* Monthly and quarterly returns are based on the performance of funds reporting returns by a given time and represent a subset of the VHFA database.
As a result, funds becoming defunct in that reporting period are unlikely to be included in the Index for that period.
* Hedge fund averages are not dollar-weighted.
* Hedge fund returns reported are net of fees and performance allocations.
* This material is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of any financial instrument.
* In some cases, predecessor portfolios have been included in performance numbers.
* Neither VAN nor VHFA assume responsibility for investments in hedge funds by investors who review this document.
Investors are urged to seek professional advice in selecting individual hedge funds and to perform extensive due diligence on funds prior to investing.
* "Survivor bias" is a factor in most databases.
This term describes the inability of trackers to adequately include all information, including all losses, if any, of all defunct funds.
Some survivor bias is expected and aggregate statistics therefore may be skewed positively.
