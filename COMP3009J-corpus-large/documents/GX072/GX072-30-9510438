ACTION: Temporary final rule with request for comments.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: Commander, Seventh Coast Guard District is temporarily changing the regulations governing the West 79th Street Causeway Bridge, mile 1084.6 across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway at Miami, Florida.
This temporary rule establishes scheduled openings on the hour and half hour, Monday through Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and allows the bridge to remain closed from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The drawbridge will open on demand during all other periods including federal holidays and Sundays.
This action is necessary to facilitate drawbridge rehabilitation to resolve related vehicle traffic flow problems during rush hour.
DATES: This rule is effective from November 21, 2000, to February 28, 2001.
Comments must be received by December 31, 2000.
ADDRESSES: Comments and material received from the public, as well as documents indicated in this preamble as being available in the docket, are part of docket [CGD07-00-106] and are available for inspection or copying at Commander (obr), Seventh Coast Guard District, 909 S.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Regulatory Information
We did not publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this regulation.
Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing an NPRM.
Publishing an NPRM is impracticable and contrary to the public interest because rehabilitation is underway.
Further, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.
Rehabilitation is underway and a delayed effective date is impracticable.
Request for Comments
We encourage you to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments and related material.
If you do so, please include your name and address, identify the docket number for this rulemaking (CGD07-00- 106),
[[Page 76936]]
indicate the specific section of this document to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment.
Please submit all comments and related material in an unbound format, no larger than 8\1/ 2\ by 11 inches, suitable for copying.
If you would like to know they reached us, please enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
We will consider all comments and material received during the comment period.
We may change this temporary rule in view of them.
We do not now plan to hold a public meeting.
But you may submit a request for a meeting by writing to the address under ADDRESSES, explaining why one would be beneficial.
If the Coast Guard determines that a public meeting would aid this rulemaking, we will hold one at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register.
Background and Purpose
The West 79th Street Causeway Drawbridge, mile 1084.6, across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, has a vertical clearance of 19.5 feet at mean high water and a horizontal clearance of 90 feet between fenders.
This bridge normally operates under 33 CFR 117.5, which requires the bridge to open promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request to open is given.
However, on May 9, 2000, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) requested that drawbridge operations be temporarily changed to allow for rehabilitation of the drawbridge.
On June 6, 2000, the Coast Guard issued temporary regulations with request for comment to allow a 30-minute opening schedule on Monday through Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. (65 FR 35826).
Discussion of Comments and Changes
We received one comment during the comment period.
FDOT requested additional restrictions due to vehicle congestion caused by the rehabilitation of the drawbridge.
In addition to the existing temporary regulations that allow the drawbridge to open on the hour and half hour, Monday through Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., FDOT asked to be able to allow the bridge to remain closed from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This is necessary to resolve vehicular traffic congestion that is a result of the bridge rehabilitation.
The drawbridge will open on demand during all other periods including federal holidays and Sundays.
All of the above provisions are included in this revised temporary rule.
Regulatory Evaluation
This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order.
The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order.
It is not ``significant'' under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT)(44 FR 11040, February 26, l979).
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be minimal because the bridge will only be closed two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening on weekdays the bridge will still open 30 minute intervals and on demand during other periods.
Small Entities
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The term ``small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
This rule will affect the following entities, some of which may be small entities; owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the Intracoastal waterway at mile 1084.6.
Although this temporary rule will be in effect for four months, vessel traffic can still pass through the drawbridge every 30 minutes during weekdays and Saturday, except during the weekday morning and afternoon vehicle traffic rush hours of 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
The drawbridge will open on demand during all other periods including federal holidays and Sundays.
Assistance for Small Entities
Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they could better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.
If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or government jurisdiction and you have questions concerning is provisions or options for compliance, please contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT for assistance in understanding and participating in this rulemaking.
We also have a point of contact for commenting on actions by employees of the Coast Guard.
Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards.
The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business.
If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247).
Collection of Information
This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).
Federalism
We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13132 and have determined that this rule does not have implications for federalism under that Order.
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) governs the issuance of Federal regulations that require unfunded mandates.
An unfunded mandate is a regulation that requires a state, local, or tribal government or the private sector to incur direct costs without the Federal Government's having first provided the funds to pay those unfunded mandate costs.
This rule will not impose an unfunded mandate.
Taking of Private Property
This rule will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.
Civil Justice Reform
This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.
Protection of Children
We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks.
This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not concern an environmental risk
[[Page 76937]]
to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.
Environment
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under figure 2-1, paragraph (32)(e), of Commandant Instruction M16475.lC, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
