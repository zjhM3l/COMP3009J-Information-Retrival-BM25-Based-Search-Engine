Spotlight Genomics and Disease Prevention Information System (GDPInfo) OGDP is pleased to launch the beta testing phase of the new Genomics and Disease Prevention Information System (GDPInfo).
We realize there may still be programming bugs and usability issues with the system, but we welcome feedback from you, our target audience.
We invite you to try the GDPInfo query tool, and send your comments to: Genetics@cdc.gov.
Please indicate "GDPInfo" in the subject line.

Genetics in the News
The following are headlines from on-line news articles published during the past week.
The headlines and lead sentence are exactly as they appear in the popular press and do not necessarily reflect the opinions or recommendations of CDC.
Free registration required for some articles.

Gene-Mappers Take New Aim at Diseases (October 29) The New York Times reports, "A $100 million project to develop a new kind of map of the human genome was announced today by an international consortium.
Its goal is to hasten discovery of the variant genes thought to underlie common human diseases like diabetes, asthma and cancer."
Myriad reports finding obesity gene (October 29) MSNBC reports from Reuters, "Myriad Genetics Inc. said it has discovered a gene that appears directly linked with human obesity and that its structure means it could be relatively easy to develop drugs to combat the condition."
Genetic susceptibility for cold sores identified (October 29) Health-News.co.uk reports, "One of a group of six recently identified genes may convey susceptibility to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1-related cold sores, US researchers report."

Research identifies gene behind heart defect (October 28) Reuters Health reports, "An international group of researchers has identified a single gene that contributes to the risk of developing the second most common type of hereditary heart disease."
Wanted: 100,000 gene donors (October 28) Chicago Sun-Times reports, "Northwestern University plans to ask up to 100,000 people to donate their genes in the interest of science."
Duke University Names Willard as Director of Genomics Institute (October 28) dBusinessNews.com reports, "Huntington Willard, Ph.D., a leader in emerging fields of genomics, who is current director and president of the research institute of University Hospitals of Cleveland, has been named director of the Duke University Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy (IGSP)."
Genetic cause of 'random' heart disorder revealed (October 28) New Scientist reports, "Studying inbred populations can reveal a simple genetic basis for diseases thought to have highly complex causes."
Gene pioneer urges dream of human perfection (October 26) The Globe and Mail reports, "James D. Watson, the grand duke of DNA, described one of his greatest fears yesterday to a packed auditorium: that society will be too scared to use genetics to make people as perfect as they can be."
Panel debates ethics of genetic industry (October 25) Naragansett Times reports, "Pondering the ethical conundrums that go hand in hand with the explosion of genetic understanding and technology is not an activity limited solely to philosophers and the theologians."
Concern over genetic test revolution (October 24) BBC News reports, "Genetic tests for the likes of obesity and skin complaints could soon be available over-the-counter, BBC News Online has learnt."
Enzyme replacement therapy found to effectively treat patients with Fabry disease (October 24) EurekAlert reports from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, "Raul Hernandez was no stranger to sports activity, and was active in Little League by the time he was 10 years old."
Repeat Diabetes Screening Called For To Increase Detection of Genetically At-Risk (October 24) Doctor's Guide reports from Pediatric Diabetes, "Failure to screen regularly for Type 1 diabetes can result in 2-3 percent of genetically at-risk children being missed."
Funding for Global Protein Database Will Create One Reliable Resource (October 23) NIH reports, "Throwing its financial support behind the concept of a centralized repository for protein data, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has awarded a three-year, $15-million grant to combine three of the world's current protein sequence databases into a single global resource."
