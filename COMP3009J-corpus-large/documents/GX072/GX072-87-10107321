Genetics in the News
The following are headlines from on-line news articles published during the past week.
Free registration required for some articles.
Study confirms obesity is in the genes (September 25) Reuters Health reports, "New study findings confirm what many would believe to be common sense--that overweight parents are more likely to have overweight children."
Gene lab probes cures for children (September 25) BBC News reports, "A brand-new laboratory at one of the country's leading research hospitals is hoping to produce therapies for the most severe genetic diseases."
Asthma link to English-speaking countries identified (September 25) Ananova reports, "A new study shows asthma is most common in English-speaking countries.
The condition's rapid growth in Britain, Ireland, the US, Australia and New Zealand indicates it is a social not a genetic problem."
Rutgers scientists mapping DNA links to complex diseases (September 24) Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, reports, "A Rutgers computer research team is developing a genetic linkage map that may help scientists eventually pinpoint the DNA differences that predispose people toward heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, osteoporosis and other complex diseases."
Two programs will follow up on Human Genome Project (September 24) EurekAlert reports, "The University of Washington has received two five-year grants of $15 million each from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) for inaugurating the next phase of research into understanding how the human genome functions."
Family Setting Influences Irritable Bowel Syndrome (September 24) Reuters Health reports, "Heredity plays a role in the gastrointestinal disorder irritable bowel syndrome, but family environment may have an equal or greater influence, researchers suggest."
Marker may explain high blood pressure (September 24) Daily News reports, "Researchers have identified a marker on the male chromosome that may partly explain why high blood pressure affects more men than women until middle age."
Known Gene Activates Generation Of Glucose In Liver (September 24) UniSci reports, "Researchers have discovered that a known gene activates the enzymes that generate glucose in the liver -- a surprising new finding that could lead to a breakthrough in diabetes research."
Family may hold genetic cancer clue (September 22) BBC News reports, "One family could hold the genetic key to a rare cancer, scientists believe."
Researchers Use Statistical Gene Profiling to Predict Breast Cancer Clinical Status (September 21) Duke University Medical Center reports, "Researchers at Duke University have developed a new statistical approach to classifying breast cancers based on profiles of their gene expression."
UK 'stumbling in gene minefield' (September 21) BBC News reports, "Medical technology is fast outpacing society's own ability to decide whether inventions are good or bad, says a leading scientist."
Long-Term Memory Seen To Be Linked To Specific Genes (September 21) UniSci reports, "Forming a memory and keeping that memory stored are very different things -- and they're different at the cellular level in the brain, as well."
Disease gene pairing points to future (September 21) BBC News reports, "For the first time, science has revealed insights into the way genes interact to cause illnesses like asthma, diabetes and obesity."
Dining habits governed by your genes (September 20) New Scientist reports, "Dining habits are governed by your genes, a study of identical and fraternal twins has revealed."
Gene that prevents tumor growth also carries messages from circadian clock (September 20) EurekAlert reports, "Scientists have long known that the gene Nf1 is so important to development that when it is missing the condition known as Neurofibromatosis results, causing tumors and sometimes leading to cancer before the patient reaches adulthood."
Gene tests for cancer won't stop (September 20) thestar.com reports, "The Ontario government has given hospitals the green light to continue with genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancers even though an American company says it owns the patent on the genes in question."
