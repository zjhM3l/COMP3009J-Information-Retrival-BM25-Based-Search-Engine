Large gains were noted in Florida and California and only Arizona had a smaller crop.
Florida produced 76 percent of the total, California rebounded to 21 percent, and Texas and Arizona combined for three percent.
Florida produced 298 million boxes of citrus, up 23 percent over the previous season and only two percent below the 1997-98 record crop of 304 million boxes.
More fruit per tree and below average droppage for all but the colored grapefruit spurred increases of 25 percent for oranges, 13 percent for grapefruit, and 41 percent for tangerines.
Tangelo production continued the downward trend of recent years reaching a 30 year low.
Lime production increased for the sixth consecutive season with a 20 percent gain while lemon production was off following the alternating pattern of recent years.
Production of Navels was up eight percent with fresh fruit shipments comprising 55 percent of early-midseason-Navel oranges' fresh utilization.
Bearing acreage was down 14,700 acres or two percent from the previous season.
The largest change was an 11,000 reduction in the early-midseason-Navel oranges.
Smaller decreases occurred in grapefruit and the specialty varieties.
Valencia oranges and limes showed small increases.
The final FCOJ orange yields reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association were down from the records set the previous season and below the yields of the prior two seasons.
All oranges were final at 1.547702, early-midseason oranges closed at 1.475739, and the late (Valencia) oranges reached 1.66336.
For comparison, the records set in 1998-99 were 1.633811 for all oranges, 1.584139 for early-midseason fruit, and 1.748058 for Valencias.
California citrus production rebounded from the December 1998 freeze.
Orange production was up 86 percent and tangerines were up 53 percent, both close to the level of 1997-98.
Lemons were up 21 percent but grapefruit declined for the third consecutive season.
Bearing acreage declined by 2,000 for Navel oranges but was the same as the previous season for other citrus varieties.
In Texas, the 22 percent gain in orange production was offset by a three percent grapefruit decline resulting in an overall increase of two percent in Texas citrus production.
Bearing acreage was unchanged for both citrus types.
Arizona's citrus production declined 11 percent, primarily due to the 10 percent decrease in lemons, which comprise over one-half of the total crop.
Percentage decreases for the other crops are: oranges, 4; grapefruit, 33, and tangerines, 11.
Bearing acreage held steady for each of the citrus varieties.

VALUE
The preliminary on-tree value of the 1999-00 citrus crop of $1.2 billion is higher than the revised values for all seasons since 1991-92.
This value is over five percent greater than last season's revised value of $1.1 billion.
The average weighted price per box was lower this season for all but the grapefruit varieties.
Valencia oranges, limes and grapefruit had higher crop values.
Preliminary value is based on that part of the crop priced at harvest, which accounts for all of the fresh fruit and about 40 percent of the processed.
Nearly one-half of the processed oranges were priced but the figure for processed grapefruit and tangerines is about one-quarter of the total.

1999-00 FLORIDA WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS, SELECTED AREAS, AND MONTHS
A mild freeze occurred the first week of January 1999.
Temperatures in the upper twenties and low thirties caused very little damage to foliage with virtually no loss of fruit.
Harvesting crews rapidly moved to the processors most of the fruit that had showed any icing from the freezing temperatures.
The remainder of January and most of February were generally mild and dry with some warm daytime temperatures.
Limited bloom started showing the first of March and the open bloom period continued into April.
The dry weather continued throughout the Spring with only a few spotty showers.
Growers used all types of irrigation equipment to maintain good tree condition.
Some trees were in various stages of wilt by the time the summer rains arrived in early June.
Abundant rainfall during the month helped refill some of the the lakes, ponds and streams which were depleted from the constant irrigation use.
Daily rains during July produced an abundance of new growth on trees of all ages.
The new crop of fruit continued to make good progress considering the slow start caused by the arid spring weather.
Periods of very hot and dry weather during August found growers irrigating to help increase fruit sizes.
Most water supply resources did not get fully replenished by the summer rains.
The 1999-2000 harvest season got underway in early September with limited shipments of early bloom Navels and grapefruit.
By the end of the month fresh fruit packers and shippers were moving Navels, Ambersweet oranges, white and colored grapefruit and a few early tangerines.
Rains associated with Hurricane Floyd and tropical storm Harvey soaked most citrus groves the last of September.
Neither storm had any direct wind effect on the citrus belt.
However, Hurricane Irene dumped an abundance of rain on the citrus belt the second week of October.
Damaging winds in the 30 to 50 mph range caused some loss of grapefruit in the Indian River growing region.
Also, there was standing water in many east coast and lower interior groves for three to five days.
Much of the excessive water was pumped out of groves into main canals some of which was lost for further use.
November was generally very dry and cool.
New growth was slowed due to shorter days, cool temperatures and dry conditions.
There was even some irrigation being used to maintain good tree and fruit condition.
Temperatures in the low thirties hit the citrus belt the first week of December with no adverse effects to crop.
The remainder of 1999 continued dry with only scattered showers and the resumption of irrigation in many areas.
January 2000 was very dry with only scattered showers and above normal temperatures.
Irrigation continued in all areas.
February was also dry with extensive irrigation use and very little new growth except in the lower interior where young trees had started pushing out feathery new growth and pinhead bloom buds.
Bloom buds were forming around the first of March on many trees in the central and southern areas of the citrus belt.
The cool temperatures and dry weather prolonged the bloom cycle for next season's fruit beyond April.
Most areas had limited bloom lasting until mid- May.
Fruit of all sizes occurred on trees of all ages due to the length of the blooming period.
Abundant rains the last of June supplied the moisture needed to put most trees in good condition.
The rest of the summer was near normal with some hard rains and some dry days.
Charted below is the historical average of monthly rainfall which includes data from two stations in each of the citrus producing areas.
The ten stations are: Avon Park (2 W), Clermont (7 S), Ft. Myers (FAA/AP), Ft. Pierce, Immokalee (3 NNW), Lake Alfred (Experiment Station), Orlando (Interna tional Airport), Ona, Plant City, and Vero Beach (4 W).

PRICES
All prices reported in this publication are on-tree prices representing the average price received by growers for their fruit.
The term "on-tree" relates to fruit returns to the grower after the costs of picking, hauling, and packing have been removed.
Prices are based on records of commercial fresh fruit sales and processed fruit returns.
Each season, beginning with the first month that three percent of a fruit type is harvested, monthly estimates are computed.
Reports from fresh fruit sales organizations and from packers provide data for an average f.o.b. price.
Processors report an average spot and cash price for fruit delivered to their plants.
From these values, an estimated charge for picking, hauling, and packing is deducted to arrive at an on-tree price.
The anticipated box utilization for the month is used to combine the fresh and processing price to obtain an average price for all methods of sales.
At the end of the season, monthly price averages are computed and weighted by boxes utilized, to provide the preliminary season average price.
A year later, after most processed products are sold, cooperatives and firms with participation plans report prices of fruit they handled.
These prices, combined with the spot and cash prices collected earlier, are weighted together by varieties to determine the final processing price received by growers.
From this price, charges for picking, hauling, and packing, as estimated by University of Florida economists, are deducted to arrive at the final on-tree price received by growers.
These preliminary figures for the season just ended, the revised figures for the previous season, and county production by type are released annually in late September.
COUNTY PRODUCTION
Estimates of citrus production by counties were prepared using objective survey data obtained from the citrus crop estimates program.
Production for Florida has been distributed to counties based on the biennial citrus tree census, limb count survey data adjusted for droppage to end of season, and size data at maturity.
Tree numbers by county which are used in the estimates were obtained from the latest tree census.
Productivity per tree is obtained from several objective fruit surveys including limb count, size, and droppage.
Because of the statistical sampling design, counties with higher production in general have a greater number of samples and, therefore, estimates for these counties can be considered more reliable.
Thus, for the same reason, estimates for the production areas are more reliable than for the individual counties.
TREE CENSUS
The Florida Agricultural Statistics Service first indexed the State's commercial citrus groves on aerial photography as of January 1966.
Ground crews identify all the State's groves by fruit type, row spacing, and year in which set.
Photo interpreters in the Orlando office then delineate the groves by variety blocks on photo transparencies at a scale of 1 inch to 660 feet.
Variety blocks are measured with planimeters to obtain acreage and then indexed by land section.
The design of the inventory survey allows for quick and economical updating.
Since 1966, the citrus belt has been resurveyed each second winter to determine changes.
Photo graphing begins in November when weather conditions are most favorable and is generally completed in 80 to 90 days.
The same three-mile-wide flight lines established in 1966 are photographed on each succeeding flight.
Approximately 14,000 square miles of photography are obtained at a 1 to 30,000 scale.
The last statewide survey was conducted as of January 2000.
New plantings increased but the gross loss was also higher, resulting in a net loss of 12,985 acres since January 1998.
Decreases in acreage and tree numbers were noted for each of the grapefruit categories and most of the specialty citrus.
Acreage and tree numbers continue to climb for Hamlin, Valencia, and other midseason oranges, and Honey tangerines.
Citrus acreage increased in the Central and Western areas.
Photographing for the next survey will begin in November 2001, and field work will update the acreage records as of January 2002.

HISTORY OF FLORIDA'S CITRUS INDUSTRY
The citrus tree is a native of the Orient.
From there it was carried ever westward by man, to India, to the Mediterranean, and on across the Atlantic.
Citrus was brought to the Americas by Columbus.
When he landed on November 22, 1493, he brought citrus seeds that were planted on the island of Hispaniola.
The first seeds planted on the mainland of the Americas were brought by the expedition of Juan de Grijalva when he landed in Central America between July 12 and July 20, 1518.
The exact date of the introduction of citrus trees into Florida is not known, but from a statement made by Pedro Medendez, dated April 2, 1579, it appears that citrus fruits were grown in abundance around St. Augustine at that time.
Early settlers in Florida some two centuries later found wild citrus trees scattered over the State.
One of the oldest cultivated groves planted in Florida (Hume, 1926 p. 95) is thought to have been the Don Phillipe grove in Pinellas County, planted sometime between 1809 and 1820.
Nearly 1.5 million boxes were shipped in 1887-88, the first season on record.
Citrus production in Florida had reached an all time high of more than 5 million boxes when the Great Freeze of 1894-95 almost totally wiped out the citrus industry.
It was not until 1909-10 that this level was reached again.
In 1999-00, Florida produced 298.4 million boxes representing 76 percent of the Nation's citrus production.
