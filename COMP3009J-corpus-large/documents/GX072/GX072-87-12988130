Home Ownership and Rental Programs
Home Ownership Programs
Title II - FHA Single Family Insured Loan Programs (1 to 4 units): HUD/FHA offers several mortgage insurance programs on one- to four-unit properties to finance home ownership, and for the construction or rehabilitation and financing of housing.
As an insuring agency, HUD provides the lending institutions with insurance against default by borrowers on mortgage loans.
In return, the lending institutions provide financing to eligible applicants for the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of homes.
* The Section 203, One-to-Four Family Home Mortgage Insurance Program, provides federal mortgage insurance to finance purchase and construction of housing.
FHA insures loans made by private financial institutions for up to 97% of the property value and for terms of up to 30 years.
The program is limited to owner-occupants.
* The Section 203(k), Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program, insures rehabilitation loans to finance rehabilitation of existing property, rehabilitation and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness of a property, and finance purchase and rehabilitation of a property.
The program is only available to owner/occupants.
* The Section 234, Condominium Housing Program, offers mortgage insurance to finance construction or rehabilitation of multifamily housing by sponsors who intend to sell individual units and to finance acquisition costs of individual units in proposed or existing approved condominium developments.
Under the program, profit-motivated or nonprofit sponsors may apply for a blanket mortgage covering the project.
Mortgage insurance on individual units is limited to owner-occupants.
* The Section 245, Graduated Payment Mortgage Program, insures mortgages to finance early home ownership for households that expect their income to rise substantially.
These "graduated payment" mortgages allow homeowners to make smaller monthly payments initially and to increase in size gradually over time.
The program is limited to owner-occupants.
* The Section 251, Adjustable Rate Mortgage Program, insures mortgages where the interest rate and monthly payment may change during the life of the loan.
The initial interest rate, discount points and margin are negotiable between the buyer and lending institution.
The program is limited to owner-occupants.
* The Section 203, Energy Efficient Mortgage Program, permits borrowers to purchase an existing single family property and finance 100% of the cost of eligible energy efficient improvements into the mortgage.
The cost of any improvements to the property that will increase the property's energy efficiency, and that are determined to be cost effective, are eligible for financing into the mortgage without an appraisal of the energy improvements.
The cost that may be added to the mortgage amount is the greater of 5% of the property's value (not to exceed $8,000) or $4,000.
The cost of the energy improvements must be determined based on a physical inspection of the property by a home energy rater or energy consultant.
The program is limited to one- and two-family properties.
* The Section 255, Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program, allows borrowers, age 62 and older, to covert the equity in their homes into monthly streams of income, lump-sum cash withdrawals, or a line of credit.
Under the program, FHA insures reverse mortgages that allow the borrower to retain ownership of the property.
They may sell the home at any time, keeping the sales proceeds in excess of the mortgage balance.
An FHA-insured reverse mortgage need not be repaid until the borrower moves, sells or dies.
When the loan is due and payable, if the loan exceeds the value of the property, the borrower or their heirs will owe no more than the value of the property.
FHA insurance will cover the balance due the lender.
* The Section 222, Homes for Service Members, provides mortgage insurance enabling members of the armed services on active duty to purchase a home partially subsidized by the service.
HUD allows the Departments of Defense, Transportation, and Commerce to pay the HUD mortgage insurance premiums on behalf of service members on active duty.
The program is limited to active service personnel, including U.S. Coast Guard or employees of National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who have served on active duty for two years.
* The Section 203(h), Mortgage Insurance for Disaster Victims Program, is a special mortgage insurance program to assist victims of Presidential-declared disasters.
Under this program, individuals or families whose residences were destroyed or damaged to such an extent that reconstruction or repair is necessary are eligible for 100 percent financing for the purchase of a home.
The program is limited to one-unit detached homes only.
Under the Section 203(h) program, two-, three-, four-unit properties and condominium units may not be purchased.
How to apply: Borrowers may obtain financing through any Title II-approved mortgage lending institution or Credit Union.

HOME Investment Partnership Program: The HOME Investment Partnership Program affirms the Federal Government's commitment to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing to all Americans and to alleviate the problems of excessive rent burdens, homelessness, and deteriorating housing stock.
HOME provides funds and general guidelines to State and local governments to design affordable housing strategies that address local needs and housing conditions.
HOME strives to meet both the short-term goal of increasing the supply and availability of affordable housing and the long-term goal of building partnerships between State and local governments and private and nonprofit housing providers.
The funds may be used for such activities as tenant-based rental assistance, homebuyer's assistance, property acquisition, new construction, rehabilitation, site improvements, demolition, relocation, and administrative costs.
All HOME-based housing and rental assistance must be targeted to low-income families, and HOME funds may not be used as matching funds for other Federal programs.
Jurisdictions must reserve 15% of their HOME funds for housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs).
A CHDO is a private, community-based nonprofit organization that has among its purposes the provision of decent, affordable housing for low-income persons.
Eligible Applicants: The State of Alaska and the Municipality of Anchorage currently qualify for annual allocation of HOME funds.
Property Disposition - HUD Homes: A HUD home is a property put on the market by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The Department acquires homes when Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured loans are foreclosed on by lenders.
HUD pays off the insurance claims for the mortgagees, acquires the property and puts them up for sale.
HUD offers attractive sales incentives, and most of the properties qualify for FHA-insured loans, which means low down payments and competitive interest rates.
Funding source: Applicants must obtain their own source of financing, which can be through cash or by obtaining a loan from a qualified mortgage lending institution.
Eligible applicants: All qualified buyers.
Bids for HUD Homes must be made through real estate agents.

Housing and Community Development Programs
Community Development Block Grant Program - Entitlement: This program provides Community Development (CDBG) on a formula basis to entitled communities directed toward neighborhood revitalization, economic development and improved community facilities and services.
Entitled communities develop their own program and funding priorities in consultation with local residents.
All CDBG activities must principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons; aid in the prevention or elimination of slums and blight; or address other community development needs that present a serious and immediate threat to the community.
Funding source: From each year's appropriation, 70% is allocated to metropolitan cities and urban counties.
The amount of each entitlement grant is determined by statutory formula, which uses several objective measures of community need, including poverty, population, housing overcrowding, age of housing and growth lag.
Eligible applicants: Metropolitan cities and urban counties are entitled to receive annual grants.
Metropolitan cities are central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or other cities within MSAs with populations of at least 50,000.
Currently, the Municipality of Anchorage is the only community in Alaska that receives a formula allocation of CDBG funds.
Community Development Block Grant Program - States: This program provides grants to carry out community development activities directed toward neighborhood revitalization, economic development, and improved community facilities and services.
Block grant funds are provided to the State, which distributes them as grants to the eligible units of general local government.
States are required to report annually on use of funds.
All CDBG activities must principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons; aid in the prevention or elimination of slums and blight; or address other community development needs that present a serious and immediate threat to the community.
Funding source: From each year's appropriation, 30% is allocated to non-entitlement areas.
The remaining amount is then allocated among the States on a formula basis.
Each State's allocation is distributed to units of general local government.
Eligible applicants: All States and Puerto Rico.
Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG): The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) reorganized the system of Federal housing assistance to Native Americans by eliminating several separate programs and replacing them with a single block grant program that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance.
It provides for tribal governing bodies to name a tribally designated housing entity (TDHE)--which may be the former Indian Housing Authority--to prepare an Indian Housing Plan (IHP).
NAHASDA aims to simplify the process of Federal housing assistance for Indian tribes and to make such assistance better fit the circumstances of Native Americans.
It became effective October 1, 1997.
It terminates assistance previously authorized under the Housing Act of 1937, the Indian Housing Child Development Program, the Public Housing Youth Sports Program, and the HOME Investment Partnership Program under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, and the Innovative Homeless Demonstration Program.
Some existing contracts will remain in force until they expire or are re-negotiated.
Assistance is in the form of a block grant made available on an annual basis using an allocation formula for Indian tribes with approved IHPs.
Every tribe that submits an IHP (which is approved) is awarded a block grant.
The IHP has two parts: a 5-year plan and a 1-year plan.
The 5-year plan must contain a mission statement, goals, objectives, and an activities plan.
The 1-year plan must contain goals, objectives, a statement of needs, an operating budget, a statement of the affordable housing resources currently available, and certifications of compliance.
Eligible Activities: Eligible affordable housing activities must develop or support rental or ownership housing or provide housing services to benefit low-income Indian families on Indian reservations and other Indian areas.
Affordable housing must cost no more than 30 percent of the family's adjusted income.
Eligible activities include modernization or operating assistance for housing previously developed using HUD resources; acquisition, new construction, or rehabilitation of additional units; housing-related services such as housing counseling, self-sufficiency services, energy auditing, and establishment of resident organizations; housing management services; crime prevention and safety activities; rental assistance; model activities; and administrative expenses.
Eligible Grantees: Indian tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) who will receive the block grant.
Indian Community Development Block Grant Program: The primary objective of the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program is to develop viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of lower and moderate income.
Tribes set their own community and economic development priorities.
They may request funding only for projects that meet the ICDBG Program's requirements for eligibility and national objectives.
Eligible Activities:
* Housing: This includes housing rehabilitation, land acquisition for housing, new housing construction, and direct homeownership assistance.
* Community Facilities: This category is divided into infrastructure (such as water and sewer), and buildings.
All tribal facilities, except buildings for the general conduct of government operations can be assisted.
* Economic Development: Economic development projects that are either tribal owned or individually owned can be funded.
A financial analysis of the project must be submitted, showing that a public benefit commensurate with the amount of the grant can reasonably be expected to result from the assisted project, and that the project has a reasonable chance of success.
Certain items not fundable with ICDBG funds include equipment, operating and maintenance costs, buildings for the general conduct of government, construction equipment, furnishings and personal property.
Eligible Applicants: Indian Tribes or Indian Organizations authorized by a tribe may apply pursuant to an annual Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).
A tribe is limited to one application; that application can include one or more separate projects, subject to a funding limit of $500,000 per application.

Economic Development and Empowerment
Economic Development and Supportive Services: The Economic Development and Supportive Services (ED/SS) program is designed to help families in public and Indian housing move to work and achieve self sufficiency.
It accomplishes this by providing funding to public housing agencies, Indian tribes, and tribally designated housing entities to support self-sufficiency activities among residents and promote independent living for the elderly and people with disabilities.
ED/SS funds a broad range of activities including:
Family Economic Development and Supportive Services:
* Economic and business development * Entrepreneurial training * Micro-loan funds or credit unions * Employment training and counseling * Employer linkage and job placement * Service coordinators/case managers * Supportive services, such as child care, supportive health care, tuition assistance, youth mentoring, and transportation costs.
Supportive Services for Elderly and Persons with Disabilities
* Meals * Ambulatory/self care * Housekeeping aid * Transportation services * Wellness programs and preventative health education * Referral to community resources * Adult day care (non-medical) * Personal emergency response systems * Congregate services * Employment of service coordinators * Other services/resources
Funding source: Applications for grants can be submitted pursuant to the annual Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA).
Eligible applicants: Limited to Public Housing Authorities and Tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) that evidence a partnership with a nonprofit or incorporated for-profit agency for the purpose of providing economic development and supportive services that assist residents to become self-sufficient.
Economic Development Initiative (EDI): The Economic Development Initiative (EDI) is designed to enable local governments to enhance both the security of loans guaranteed through HUD's Economic Development Loan Fund (also known as the Section 108 loan guarantee program) and the feasibility of the economic development and revitalization projects that Section 108 guarantees finance.
EDI accomplishes this by providing grants to local governments to be used in conjunction with Section108 loan guarantees.
A locality may use the grant to provide additional security for the loan (for example, as a loss reserve), thereby reducing the exposure of its CDBG funds (which by law must be pledged as security for the loan guarantees).
A locality may also use the EDI grant to pay for costs associated with the project, thereby enhancing the feasibility of the Section 108 assisted portion of the project.
Eligible activities under the EDI program are the same activities that are eligible under the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program.
EDI-funded projects must meet one of the CDBG program's national objectives.
Funding source: Applications for grants may be submitted pursuant to the annual Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA).
Eligible applicants: State and local governments.
Brownfields Economic Development Initiative: The Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) is designed to help cities redevelop abandoned, idled, or underutilized industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination--brownfields.
BEDI accomplishes this by providing funding to local governments to be used in conjunction with Section 108 loan guarantees to finance redevelopment of brownfield sites.
Eligible activities include:
* Site acquisition * Demolition * Remediation * Infrastructure construction or reconstruction * Assistance to for-profit businesses for economic development * Construction or reconstruction of public facilities.
Funding for BEDI is provided through a specific appropriation for brownfields redevelopment under the authority of the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) program.
BEDI funds are intended to be used in a manner consistent with previous iterations of the EDI program, but with a particular emphasis upon the redevelopment of brownfields sites.
Many of the brownfields activities are also eligible for Community Development Block Grant funding, which is awarded to entitlement communities on a formula basis and to States for distribution to non-entitlement communities.
Funding source: Provided through a specific appropriation for brownfields redevelopment under the authority of the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) program.
Applications for grants may be submitted pursuant to the annual Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA).
Eligible applicants: State and local governments.
Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program: Section 108 enables States and local governments participating in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to obtain federally guaranteed loans that can help fuel large economic development projects and other revitalization activities.
As the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development Block Grant program, Section 108 is one of the most potent and important public investment tools that HUD offers to State and local governments.
It allows them to transform a small portion of their CDBG funds into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects that can help renew entire neighborhoods.
Such public investment is often needed to inspire private economic activity, providing the initial resources or simply the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas.
However, Section 108 loans are not risk free.
State and local governments borrowing funds guaranteed by Section 108 must pledge their current and future CDBG allocations (up to the loan amount) as security for the loan.
Eligible activities: Like other CDBG assistance, Section 108 loan guarantees must be used for activities that meet national CDBG objectives.
They must:
* principally benefit low- and moderate-income families; * prevent or eliminate slums or blight; or * meet other urgent community development needs.
Although funded projects generate enough cash flow to support loan payments, the 20-year term means that projects do not necessarily need to support repayment immediately.
Statutory amendments in 1994 expanded the list of eligible activities to include public facilities, which generally do not yield cash flow.
Funding source: Eligible communities may apply for the loan guarantee year-round.
Eligible grantees: CDBG entitlement communities are eligible to apply for a guarantee from the Section 108 program.
CDBG non-entitlement communities may also apply, provided that the State agrees to pledge the CDBG funds necessary to secure the loan.
Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC): The purpose of this program is to empower American communities and their residents to create jobs and employment opportunities; take effective action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges of today; and to build for tomorrow as a part of a Federal/State/Local Government and Private Sector Partnership.
Empowerment Zones are awarded substantial Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grant funds in the amount of $100 million for each urban Zone.
Enterprise Communities are awarded approximately $3 million in Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grant Funds.
Funding source: Applications for designations can be submitted pursuant to the Notice of Invitation.
Eligible applicants: To be considered for Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community designation, an area must be nominated by the State and local governments or by a State-chartered Economic Development Corporation.

SHP supports five types of program designs: * Transitional housing, which helps homeless people move to independent living.
* Permanent housing for homeless people with disabilities.
* Safe havens--24-hour supportive housing that serves hard-to-reach homeless people with severe mental illness.
* Supportive services for homeless people not living in supportive housing.

This program provides funding to public housing agencies and private nonprofit organizations for rental assistance for homeless individuals who rent rehabilitated SRO units.
The rental assistance is paid to owners of the rehabilitated units in the form of monthly rental subsidies.
A portion of the subsidy covers the normal rental assistance that would be paid on behalf of the person occupying the unit under the Section 8 SRO program.
The rest of the subsidy can be used by the owner to help offset the monthly debt service on the rehabilitation financing.
Occupants of the rehabilitated units must otherwise be eligible for Section 8 rental assistance.
The Shelter-Plus Care (S+C) program is designed to ensure supportive housing opportunities for homeless people with disabilities and their families.
It accomplishes this by providing funding to States, local governments, and PHAs to be used to provide rental assistance for homeless people with disabilities and their families.
The four types of rental assistance available are:
* tenant based * single-room occupancy based * project based (contracted with a building owner) * sponsor based (contracted with a nonprofit organization) Grantees must match the rental assistance with supportive services that are at least equal in value to the amount of HUD's rental assistance.
Funding source: Applications for all Continuum of Care Programs must be consistent with a locally-developed Continuum of Care strategy.
Applications for grants can be submitted pursuant to the annual Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA).
Eligible applicants: States, units of general local government, public housing agencies (PHAs), Tribes, private nonprofit organizations, CMHCs that are public nonprofit organizations.
Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA): This program funds projects for low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families under two categories of assistance:

The Section 8 Rental Voucher and Certificate program provides direct rental subsidy payments on behalf of eligible families and individuals to private landlords.
Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) administer the Section 8 programs by ensuring applicants are income eligible and meet certain selection criteria to participate in the program.
The use of Section 8 Vouchers and Certificates allows participants to select their housing units from the private market.
Unit size is determined by the size of the family.
The Contract Rent is subject to Fair Market Rent limitations as determined by Rent Reasonableness.
The family's portion of the contract rent is computed by a formula that equates to 30% of the adjusted family income.
The balance of the rent (Housing Assistance Payments), is provided directly to the Landlord by the PHA.
To ensure units are in a decent, safe and sanitary condition, the PHA inspects the property before the family takes possession at move-in and annually thereafter, to ensure Housing Quality Standards (established by HUD) are maintained.
Funding source: A Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) is published annually in the Federal Register.
Funding is nationally competitive and allocated on a Fair Share basis.
Eligible applicants: Public Housing Authorities.
Interested tenants should contact the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) at (907) 272-1457 for availability of Section 8 certificates and vouchers.
The Section 8 - Project-Based Rental Assistance program provides rental assistance on behalf of eligible families, or elderly or disabled individuals.
Project-based assistance is tied to specific multifamily developments, which include those with HUD insured mortgages, HUD direct loans, and other private or government assisted financing.
Eligibility and rent amounts are the same as in the public housing program.
HUD's role is to provide direct rental subsidy, ensure eligibility requirements are enforced, and ensure that the housing meets specific housing quality standards.
Eligible applicants: Persons seeking residency should contact the manager or management agent of the apartment complex to make application.
