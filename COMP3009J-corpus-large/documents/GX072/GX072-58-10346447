Powered by NetworkEleven ImageMagick logo Home API Download Search ImageMagick.org: ____________________ Search ImageMagick uses an ASCII string known as "magick" (e.g. "GIF") to identify file formats, algorithms acting as formats, built-in images, and embedded profile types.
ImageMagick supports reading over 87 major file formats (not including sub-formats).
The following table provides a summary of the supported image formats.

FAX
RW
Group 3 TIFF
See TIFF format.
Note that FAX machines use non-square pixels which are 1.5 times wider than they are tall but computer displays use square pixels so FAX images may appear to be narrow unless they are explicitly resized using a resize specification of "150x100%".
FIG
R
FIG graphics format
Requires TransFig.

RW
Flexible Image Transport System
FPX
RW

Specify the format "GIF87" to write the older version 87a of the format.
Note that since Unisys claims a patent on the LZW algorithm (expiring in the US as of June 2003) used by GIF, ImageMagick binary distributions do not include support for the LZW algorithm so GIF files are written uncompressed.
Users are recommended to use the PNG or JPEG formats instead, and should consult the Unisys LZW web page before enabling LZW support.

MPC
RW
Magick Persistent Cache image file format
The native "in-memory" ImageMagick uncompressed file format.
This file format is identical to that used by ImageMagick to represent images in memory and is read in "zero time" via memory mapping.
The MPC format is not portable and is not suitable as an archive format.
It is suitable as an intermediate format for high-performance image processing.
The MPC format requires two files to support one image.
When writing the MPC format, a file with extension ".mpc" is used to store information about the image, while a file with extension ".cache" stores the image pixels.
The storage space required by a MPC image (or an image in memory) may be calculated by the equation (QuantumDepth*Rows*Columns*5)/8.

PNM is a family of formats supporting portable bitmaps (PBM) , graymaps (PGM), and pixmaps (PPM).
There is no file format associated with pnm itself.
If PNM is used as the output format specifier, then ImageMagick automatically selects the most appropriate format to represent the image.
The default is to write the binary version of the formats.
Use +compress to write the ASCII version of the formats.

On some platforms, ImageMagick automatically processes these extensions: .gz for Zip compression, .Z for Unix compression, .bz2 for block compression, and .pgp for PGP encryption.
For example, a PNM image called image.pnm.gz is automatically uncompressed with the gzip program and the image is subsequently read.
