Scientists' Only Consensus is Deformed Frogs Remain a Mystery

SAN FRANCISCO -- Scientists at a national conference Thursday came up with plenty of ideas about what might be causing frog deformities in Minnesota and other states, ranging from ultraviolet radiation and pesticides to leaking landfills and even tadpole cannibalism.
About the only thing researchers could agree upon during a four-hour session was that eye, limb and internal deformities documented since 1995 are still a mystery and probably will prove to have several causes.
More than one compound can cause some malformations, said Jack Bantle, a zoology professor at the University of Oklahoma.
"You may have different answers regionally, and you shouldn't just look for one answer."
He is one of several scientists who has been examining methoprene, a relatively common pesticide used to control mosquitoes and a few other insects.
Some researchers, including those at the Environmental Protection Agency lab in Duluth, have exposed frog eggs to methoprene and found no abnormalities.
But Bantle said he has found that ordinary sunlight breaks methoprene down easily and quickly into chemical byproducts -- some of which last much longer than methoprene does and appear to be more harmful to frogs in their early stages.
Bantle presented evidence that some methoprene byproducts, when added to fertilized frog eggs in a lab, produced a host of deformities in tadpoles, including head and eye malformations, facial defects and heart problems.
"You have to take this data with a grain of salt," he said, because no one knows whether what has been tested in the lab also can be found in frog breeding ponds in Minnesota or elsewhere.
Water a Factor in Debate
David Hoppe, biology chairman at the University of Minnesota-Morris, said that he continues to find high percentages of deformities in such species as the green, mink and northern leopard frogs that spend much of their lives in water.
"I've seen at least 80 mink frogs with grotesque deformities this year."
The more terrestrial species in Minnesota -- such as the gray tree frog, American toad, wood frog and spring peeper -- also show deformities, he said, but they appear to be less vulnerable.
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) officials released new figures at the conference for the number of frog deformities reported during 1997.
Judy Helgen, MPCA wetlands biologist, said more than 200 citizen reports were filed with the agency (about the same as in 1996), and scientists have confirmed abnormal frogs at 62 sites in 29 counties, not including some of the areas Hoppe has been using.
Last month the MPCA reported that water from four wells near ponds with deformed frogs had induced deformities in fertilized frog eggs in lab tests.
Helgen said Thursday that 34 more wells have been sampled near other sites, and that lab-test results with that water should be available within a couple of weeks.
Environmental Protection Agency officials have criticized the methodology of that study, which was conducted through the North Carolina-based National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the MPCA's federal partner in the project.
Jim Burkhart, the institute's lead scientist in the research, said extensive data back the preliminary results that suggest something in the water may cause some of the deformities.
He said the frog egg test has been blown out of proportion and is only a tiny part of the larger project that is analyzing hundreds of Minnesota water samples for dozens of chemicals, metals and other compounds.
He said it will take several months to complete the analysis.
Stan Sessions, a biology professor at Hartwick College in New York, disagreed with many of the other researchers and said that natural phenomena can explain the abnormalities.
Parasites that burrow into tadpoles and disrupt their normal limb development are responsible for multi-legged abnormalities, he said, and the missing limbs, eyes and other oddities probably were caused by tadpoles "chewing on each other," which he said he has observed in his lab.
Research will continue in several directions.
The institute is moving to involve scientists from other disciplines, such as human health, in the discussion.
A workshop next month will focus on potential human health concerns.
