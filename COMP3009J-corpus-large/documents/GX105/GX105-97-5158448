ORDER
I PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On May 23, 2002, XXXXXXXXXX (Petitioner) filed a request for external review with the Commissioner of Financial and Insurance Services (Commissioner) under the Patient's Right to Independent Review Act (PRIRA) MCL 550.1901 et seq.
After a review of the material submitted, the Commissioner accepted the request on May 30, 2002.
The case required a determination of medical issues.
It was assigned to The Center For Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR), an independent review organization (IRO), to provide its recommendation to the Commissioner.
The IRO completed its review and sent a copy to the Commissioner on June 13, 2002.
A copy of the report is attached.
II FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Petitioner is a XXXXXXXXXXXX member of Health Alliance Plan (HAP) under its Version I Subscriber Certificate through her employer, the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
Petitioner seeks authorization and coverage for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass).
Petitioner is 5' 5" tall and is 100 pounds overweight.
Her Body Mass Index (BMI) is 48.8.
HAP denied coverage because it claimed bariatric surgery is not a covered benefit of Petitioner's HAP Subscriber Contract.
HAP's Grievance Committee upheld the adverse determination at a hearing on May 8, 2002.
HAP's final adverse determination letter is dated May 10, 2002.
III ISSUE
Whether HAP properly denied Petitioner authorization and coverage for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass)?
IV ANALYSIS
Petitioner's Position
Petitioner states she is 100 pounds overweight and is 5' 5" tall.
Petitioner claims she has tried every diet and weight loss program there is to lose weight and has been unsuccessful.
She has tried dieting, diet pills, and exercise without any success in weight loss.
Petitioner claims that, because of her obesity, she has serious physical and emotional complications, including shortness of breath, joint and back pain, depression, anxiety, and other related illnesses.
Petitioner claims that her obesity has made it almost impossible to normally participate in family, recreational, and work-related activities.
She claims that it is very difficult for her to perform her employment tasks of making home visits.
She is a student at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and states sometimes it is impossible for her to sit in the classroom for an entire class session.
Petitioner indicates that in XXXXXXXXX, she was placed on a medical leave of absence from her place of employment.
Petitioner states there is a genetic history of heart disease, diabetes, and other illnesses in both her maternal and paternal families.
Based on her situation, Petitioner is very concerned about her life expectancy.
Petitioner's primary care physician is Dr. XXXXXXXXXX, M.D., of the XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
No documentation from Dr. XXXXXXX was forwarded to the IRO from HAP.
Medical records of Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXX, M.D. XXXXXXXXXXXX.
were submitted by HAP to the IRO for review.
Dr. XXXXXXXX, a non-affiliated HAP physician, provided a medical record for review that covered the period XXXXXXXXX to XXXXXXXXXXXX.
This medical record indicates that on XXXXXXXXX, Petitioner weighed 292 l/2 pounds and her blood pressure was 160/95.
Petitioner's medications were Xenical, Synthroid and Estrase.
Petitioner was placed on a 1,000-calorie diet and by XXXXXXXXXXXX, Petitioner's weight was at 267.8 pounds and her blood pressure was 146/95.
During this time period, Petitioner was also placed on Bontril and Lasix.
On XXXXXXXXX, Petitioner weighed 270 l/2 pounds and had a blood pressure of 143/100.
Her medications included Fastin.
On XXXXXXXXX, Petitioner was placed on a 2000-calorie diet.
Her blood pressure was 130/95.
By XXXXXXXXXXXX, Petitioner's weight had risen to 274.6 and her blood pressure was115/75.
Dr. XXXXXX, a physician at XXXXXXXXXXXX in XXXX, provided Petitioner a consultation regarding gastric bypass surgery.
In a XXXXXX letter to HAP, Dr. XXXX stated as follows:
I think it would be a beneficial option for Ms. XXXX who has been suffering with morbid obesity and in which other methods of weight loss have not been effective.
There are some studies that have proven with a BMI greater than 40 that surgery is the best choice, and Ms. XXXX fits that profile.
Also, obesity is a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease that can lead to long-term morbidity.
Ms. XXXX also has a family history of heart disease in a maternal grandmother who died at a young age.
Ms. XXXX also has expressed that the obesity has adversely impacted her lifestyle and daily activities.
If Ms. XXXX would be approved for the surgery, I think she has the motivation and the family support to sustain long-term weight loss.
As Ms. XXXXX health insurance carrier, I believe she should seriously be considered for coverage, as obesity is a serious chronic health condition.
The cost of the requested surgery according to HAP's Case Summary documentation is $40,000+.
HAP's Position
HAP indicates Petitioner's Body Mass Index (BMI) is 48.8.
According to HAP, a BMI of 19 to 24.9 is considered a healthy weight.
A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, and 39.9 to 40+ is considered very obese.
On April 3, 2002, HAP's Medical Director recommended Petitioner's request be denied as not a covered benefit.
Petitioner's case was then forwarded to the 1st level Grievance Officer for review.
The Grievance Officer upheld the denial in a letter to Petitioner dated April 17, 2002.
The basis of the denial was that the requested surgery was not a covered benefit.
Petitioner then filed a second level grievance, which was received by HAP on April 26, 2002.
The HAP Grievance Committee met on May 8, 2002 and also determined that bariatric surgery is not a covered benefit of Petitioner's HAP Subscriber Contract.
HAP's denial was based on the health care benefits outlined in item 2 of Exclusions, section E. Cosmetic Surgery, of Petitioner's Health Alliance Plan Version I HMO Subscriber Contract.
The provision from the contract excludes: "Surgical treatment for exogenous obesity."
HAP's final adverse determination letter issued May 10, 2002, states in part:
The information that you presented was carefully considered by the Committee.
However, as you are aware bariatric surgery is not a covered benefit of your Health Alliance plan Subscriber Contract.
Therefore, the Committee has determined that you request for HAP to provide bariatric surgery must remain denied.
IRO Review:
A practicing physician board-certified in internal medicine, a practicing physician board certified in general surgery and surgical critical care, and a licensed attorney on CHDR's professional appeals staff performed the IRO review in this case.
Both of the reviewing physicians have experience in treating patients with medical conditions similar to Petitioner's.
The IRO recommends that the HAP denial of coverage be reversed.
The IRO concluded that bariatric surgery is medically necessary for treatment of Petitioner's medical condition provided she receives psychiatric clearance and a medical evaluation prior to surgery.
The surgeon member of the IRO pointed out that even without her co-morbidities, Petitioner would qualify for bariatric surgery based upon the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria.
The surgeon recommended a medical evaluation to document the degree of degenerative joint disease; borderline diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea and other comorbid conditions should be performed so that improvement following surgery can be followed.
This reviewer also recommended a psychiatric assessment should be provided prior to surgery.
The internal medicine member of the IRO indicated that Petitioner's obesity had adversely affected her quality of life as she suffers from shortness of breath, joint and back pain and depression.
This reviewer claimed there is an increased risk for continued medical problems as a consequence of Petitioner's obesity.
This reviewer explained that literature demonstrates a benefit of bariatric surgery in patents who have a BMI of greater than 40 and have failed conventional diet therapy.
The IRO concluded that bariatric surgery is medically necessary for treatment of Petitioner's condition provided she receives psychiatric clearance and medical evaluation prior to surgery.
Commissioner's Review
The Commissioner concurs with the IRO recommendation to reverse HAP's final adverse determination dated May 10, 2002.
The Commissioner notes that, even without co-morbidities, Petitioner would qualify for bariatric surgery based upon the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria.
Petitioner is 5' 4" in height, and her current weight is 293.
She has a BMI of 50.
The Commissioner agrees with the IRO recommendation requiring Petitioner to have a favorable psychiatric assessment and medical evaluation performed prior to surgery.
If Petitioner is determined to be a candidate for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass), the surgery should be covered by HAP as a medically necessary health service.
HAP may require that the physician performing the surgery be contracted and selected by HAP.
V ORDER
Therefore, the Commissioner ORDERS that after a medical evaluation and psychological assessment are performed on Petitioner and she is determined to be a candidate for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass), Health Alliance Plan, must approve and cover the cost of the surgery and associated services as a medically necessary health service.
Health Alliance Plan may require that that a physician contracted and selected by Health Alliance Plan perform the surgery.
Health Alliance Plan is required to provide coverage for the bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) within 60 days from the date of this Order or from the date the surgical services are performed.
Health Alliance Plan shall provide the Health Plans Division of the Office of Financial and Insurance Services proof of payment within fourteen days of payment that also includes the total amount paid.
This is a final decision of an administrative agency.
Under MCL 550.1915, any person aggrieved by this Order may seek judicial review no later than sixty days from the date of this Order in the Circuit Court for the county where the covered person resides or in the Circuit Court of Ingham County.
A copy of the petition for judicial review should be sent to the Commissioner of the Office of Financial and Insurance Services, Health Plans Division, Post Office Box 30220, Lansing, MI 48909-7720.
