Checklists Birds E V E R G L A D E S N A T I O N A L P A R K _______________________________________________________________________ Introduction Bird sketch Everglades National Park was established in 1947 to protect the rich resources of South Florida's subtropical wilderness wetlands, particularly the diverse and abundant birdlife.
Birds have always been one of the park's principal activities for park visitors.
This page provides a complete list of the birds known from the park, 347 species as of 1 June 1984, along with a key indicating the abundance and seasonal occurrence of each species.
It follows earlier checklist compiled by William B. Robertson, Jr.
Willard E. Dilley, John C. Ogden and R.L. Cunningham and reflects the continuing growth of information about the birds of the Park.
As noted in the list, many birds are known in Everglades National Park from only a few records.
Users of this checklist can contribute to updating future lists by carefully recording details of their observations of less common species and reporting the information to park personnel.
