Sequence of Activities
Advanced Preparation: If you have not seen the popular movie Ice Age rent it; this will be the source of some information and misinformation, which students may have.
Put a word bank on the board before the narrative: Meteor, Yucatan, extinct, fauna, Eohippus, deciduous, saber toothed tiger, mammoth, mastodon, opossum, glacier, adapt, evolve, herbivore, carnivore, prairie.
Make a transparency of your "notes" from the narrative.
1.
Show students a hand full of gravel.
Ask: "This is one of Michigan's important natural resources.
It is used for paving and other construction.
Do you know how it is made?"[Allow students to guess.]
"It is not really manufactured, but is a special souvenir left to us in the Northern States by the glaciers.
2.
Ask students to look again at the graph of climate fluctuations that they analyzed in Lesson 6.
Review with questions: "What general trend do you see over the Pleistocene?" [Cooler.]
"What adaptations would have given animals an advantage during this time?" [Ability to migrate, fur, homeothermy (warm-blooded).]
3.
Ask students to imagine the longest snowstorm they can remember.
Then ask them to imagine that a few days after the storm, another storm hit, and then another.
"When would the snow melt?" [Not for a long time.]
Discuss the structure of glaciers with students.
They are highly compressed mountains of snow and ice.
In the glacier there is often mud, dirt, and gravel.
The pressure causes the glacier to melt a little at the bottom, so a glacier often actually moves a little, rolling over the terrain.
Now ask students to imagine that they were a primitive inhabitant of Asia living near a glacier.
Ask them to close their eyes and imagine that they are standing on a vast steppe (plain) looking at the edge of a glacier.
On the Student Pages, ask them to write what they would see.
[While this is certainly a creative exercise, students might imagine a "dirty" mountain of snow melting at the edges.
Many animals seek the edge of the glacier for meltwater.]
4.
Say: "Let me tell you how scientists imagine the Ice Age.
Because you will need to be able to take notes from material given to you orally in high school, today you will practice taking notes as I read to you.
Notes will be needed for study or even use on tests, so it is important that you be complete.
However, you do not need to write down every word I read; just include the important events.
The information you hear will be divided into groups according to how many years ago it occurred.
Your Student Pages will help you take notes as I tell the story.
You can use the word bank on the board to help you."
Read the narrative at the end of this lesson slowly, and keep the narrative in the spirit of a story.
Allow students to spell in their own way while taking notes, referring to the word bank on the board.
(Alternatively, you can duplicate this narrative for reading practice.)
5.
Say: "Here are the notes that I have prepared."
Show the transparency.
Allow students to supplement their notes if necessary.
65 mya (million years ago): asteroid impact in Mexico.
Trees flattened.
Many large animals extinct, including dinosaurs.
Air pollution, many plants and animals are extinct.
60 mya: warm, wetland covered with ferns and some trees; North America connected by land.
50 mya: tropical forests drying out and temperatures cooler.
India joined with Asia.
Lots of deciduous trees now.
Several species of ancestral horses.
40 mya: North America a cool, seasonal land.
20 mya: drier land; grasses spread.
Horses evolved to be taller, faster runners.
15 mya: Tall grass prairies with elephants, rhinos, buffalo, horses, camels, oreodonts.
Carnivores like lions and tigers.
4-6 mya: Most of the largest mammals were extinct.
North and South America join.
2-4 mya: Ice Ages began.
14-19,000 ya: humans migrated into North America.
11,000 ya: last glaciers retreated from North America
.
6.
Ask students if there were any animals in their imaginary scene.
Because of recent movies, it is very likely that they will mention them.
Divide students into groups and ask them to use print or Internet sources to prepare a poster of one of the Ice Age animals: Mastodon, mesohippus, oreodont, saber-toothed tiger, etc.
When students have finished, use them for an "Ice Age" display for the classroom.
Assessment
Student presentations are graded based upon the information included.
Also, students can research the following question: "Name 3 ways the land has changed in the last 65 million years."
[Asteroid impact; land uplifted so Bearpaw Sea drained; volcanoes near Rocky Mountains; Australia separated from Antarctica; India attached to Asia; North and South America joined; erosion]
Application Beyond School
Students can debate the reason that North American megafauna became extinct, whether it was human hunting or climate change.
"Has hunting caused extinction of animals?"
Connections
English Language Arts
Students can use their knowledge of Ice Age theories to access the credibility of related science fiction stories.
