SCoPE Site Lesson Plan
Title: Lesson 5 - St. Louis and the Mississippi River (SS030505)
Abstract In this lesson students continue their exploration of the history and economic development of St. Louis by focusing on the Mississippi River and its connections to both the history and economy of the region.
After engaging in a map activity investigating the course of the Mississippi River, students examine a chronology of river history.
In considering human-environmental interactions, students learn how the Mississippi River has enhanced St. Louis as well as the impact of human activity on the river.
As a culminating activity, students create a web summarizing what they have learned.

Sequence of Activities 1.
Show students a photograph of the Mississippi River at St. Louis such as the one located at: http://stlouis.missouri.org/images/river.html.
Point out the river on a map that also shows St. Louis.
Remind students that the river has been a vital part of the growth and development of the city and the whole country.
You may also read The Mississippi River from the Rookie Read About Geography series to the class.
It is a very basic picture book but one that has excellent photographs and could serve as a good introduction to the Mississippi River.
2.
Divide students into small groups and give each group a desk map of the United States.
Have students trace the Mississippi from its source in northwestern Minnesota to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico.
Trace the route on a large wall map so students are able to follow the course of the river.
Ask students to work in their small groups exploring the map and listing five observations they have made about the Mississippi River from the map.
Possible answers include the following: + The Mississippi is very curvy with lots of bends and turns.
+ The Mississippi forms the boundaries of several states.
+ The Mississippi flows mainly from north to south.
+ Many cities and towns are located along the river.
+ Many other rivers like the Missouri and Ohio flow into the Mississippi River.
3. Use Overhead #1 and Overhead #2 located in the Supplemental Materials (Supplemental Materials SS030505) to explore Facts about the Mississippi River with students.
Ask students to write several questions about the river.
Make a list of their questions on the board or chart paper.
Tell students that many of the questions will be answered as they explore the river in this lesson.
4. Use Overheads #3, #4 and #5 located in the in the Supplemental Materials (Supplemental Materials SS030505) to guide a discussion about the chronology of main historical events for the Mississippi River.
Use the following questions to enhance the discussion: + How did the types of boats used on the Mississippi change? + How did people use the river? + How did people change the river? + Did the importance of the river increase or decrease over time? Why? 5.
Ask students to think again about the chronology of Mississippi River history and the facts about the Mississippi River from Step 2.
Have students list the ways in which the river has benefited people.
Discuss student responses and write their ideas on an overhead transparency or board.
Add ideas from the following list of benefits to the list generated by students.
+ The river has transported people and cargo for thousands of years.
+ The river provides recreation such as boating, swimming, and fishing.
+ The river generates power.
+ The river benefits farming by transporting grain to many places by barge.
+ The river serves as a storm water collection system for two-thirds of the contiguous 48 states.
+ The river moves millions of tons of cargo including grain, petroleum products, coal, cement and sugar.
+ The river benefits manufacturing as factories use it for water, washing and cleaning products, cooling buildings and equipment.
+ The river generates money through commercial fishing and recreation.
+ The river fosters tourism.
+ The river has helped many cities like St. Louis grow and develop.
6.
As a project, have students design a `thank you card' for the Mississippi River.
Discuss the following criteria for the card with students: + The front of the card must describe in an illustration one specific benefit of the river.
+ The inside of the card must thank the Mississippi River and explain in words the benefit illustrated on the front.
Display the student cards where they can be shared.
7.
Explain to students that the Mississippi River has been of major benefit to people but that it also presents challenges.
For example, in the 1700s the river was filled with snags and other obstructions and very difficult to navigate.
Later, after steamboats were used, many parts of the river were too shallow for the large paddle wheelers.
The biggest challenge, however, has always been flooding.
Damaging floods occurred in 1927, 1937, 1965, 1973, 1982,1983, and 1993.
The 1993 flood was the most damaging Mississippi flood in U.S. history.
Share the following information about this flood with students.
+ The Mississippi River at St. Louis was above flood stage for 144 days between April 1 and September 30, 1993.
+ About 3 billion cubic meters of water overflowed from the river channel onto the floodplain downstream from St. Louis.
+ All other large Midwestern streams flooded including the Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois rivers.
+ Seventeen thousand square miles of land were covered by floodwaters in a region covering all or parts of 9 states.
+ Some of the reasons for the flood were higher than normal levels of precipitation, heavy individual storms, and ground saturation due to rain on top of a heavy winter snow pack in the upper reaches of the Missouri River.
+ Many experts feel humans may have contributed to the flooding by changing the river system through the drainage of wetlands for farming and building levees.
+ St. Louis was protected by a human made floodwall or levee.
The wall did develop leaks, but held back the river water during the flooding.
Many small levees in rural areas failed.
+ Nearly 50 people died as a result of the flooding, 26,000 people were evacuated, and over 56,000 homes were damaged.
+ Barge traffic was halted for two months causing carriers to lose an estimated one million dollars per day in freight revenues.
+ The flooding submerged eight million acres of farmland.
8.
Explain to students that the kind of flood seen in 1993 is not common and happens perhaps once every one hundred years.
Less serious flooding, however, has always been a problem along the Mississippi.
Ask students, "How have people adapted to floods?" Discuss student responses.
Possible answers include building dams and levees, building high water channels, buying flood insurance, etc.
Explain to students that some experts feel changing the natural flow of the river by building dams and levees can actually contribute to flooding.
You may wish to relate this information to your local area if flooding is also a problem there.
9.
Remind students that one important theme of geography is how humans interact with the environment.
Sometimes they adapt or change to fit the environment.
Sometimes they modify or change the environment to fit them.
Building dams and levees is an example of humans changing the environment.
Remind students that these changes can have both positive and negative consequences.
Explain that many people consider the Mississippi River to be the "most engineered" river in the world.
Ask students what they think this phrase means.
Guide students to the idea that people have done many things to change the river.
Share the following information with students about some of these changes: + The Mississippi River has been straightened and deepened to help barge navigation.
+ Rather than build boats to fit the river, people usually chose to change the river to accommodate the riverboats and barges.
That meant deepening and widening the river channel in many locations.
+ Floodplains and wetlands along the Mississippi River were drained for farming and later for suburban growth.
+ Locks and dams were built to make shipping possible between St. Paul, Minnesota and St. Louis.
+ Flood control structures such as dams, reservoirs, levees and floodwalls were built.
Ask students to cite examples of both positive and negative consequences of the changes listed above.
For example, the draining of wetlands allowed for more farming but also affected the wildlife in the area.
Draining wetlands may have contributed to flooding since the natural wetlands act as a sponge and soak up large amounts of floodwater.
10.
Explain to students that rivers are dynamic which means they are always changing.
River engineering projects are one example of such changes introduced by people.
Use Overhead #6 and located in the Supplemental Materials (Supplemental Materials SS030505) to explore one example of such a project at St. Louis.
11.
Explain to students that, like most rivers in the world, there are threats to the Mississippi River today.
Share the following information with students: + There has been a huge loss of wetlands along the river.
Many of these were drained and cleared of trees for farming and suburban growth.
+ The natural depth and flow of the river has been changed to aid navigation.
Therefore, the river is no longer really a natural system.
This can cause many problems such as the rate of flow and the erosion along the riverbanks.
+ Poor farming practices have contributed tons of sediment to the river.
+ Toxic pollution, especially in the Lower Mississippi is a big problem.
+ Industrial and municipal waste is dumped into the river by some factories and cities.
+ Pesticides for farms flow into the river system.
Ask students to think of some ways to eliminate or minimize some of the threats listed above.
Possible answers include farmers can be educated about proper farming methods and factories can be monitored regarding waste disposal.
12.
Tell students that the American Heritage River Project was created to help protect our country's rivers.
The Mississippi River, like the Detroit River, has been named one of 14 rivers in the American Heritage River Project.
Share the following information about this project: + This is a federal project designed to help local communities improve waterways and rivers so they are more attractive and usable by people.
+ The project provides resources to help river communities restore the environment, revitalize their economy, renew their culture, and preserve their history.
Ask students why they think such a project is valuable.
Discuss their ideas and point out that improving the quality of the river benefits many people.
In a democracy this is called "the Common Good" since it is good for all the people who have contact with the river.
13.
As a culminating project have students individually create a web summarizing what they have learned about the Mississippi River.
The web should have the following main topics: River Facts, River History, Benefits, Changes to the River, and Threats.
Assessment The web from Step 12 could be used as the performance assessment for this lesson.
Each student could design a poster summarizing what he/she learned about the river.
Application Beyond School Students could choose a river near their local community and compare it with the Mississippi River.
Connections Arts Students use various elements of design when they create their thank you card.
English Language Arts When students share and discuss answers, they practice the speaker's craft.
When students research and organize information, they use a variety of literacy skills.
Science Students explore positive and negative consequences on the ecosystem when they consider how people have changed the Mississippi River.
