TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ THE WORKING GROUP: EVALUATION OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES PROGRESS REPORT FOR 1995-1996 Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary: Wild sunflowers are native to the US and ancestors of the cultivated sunflower crop.
Having the ancestors of the cultivated crop assessable within the boundaries of the US allows the collection, evaluation, and utilization of the wild species for the improvement of cultivated sunflower.
Since there are 50 species of wild sunflower with considerable genetic variability, the task of finding desirable characteristics in this diversity is difficult.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), European Cooperative Research Network on Agriculture (ESCORENA) on sunflower has established a working group for the evaluation of wild sunflower species.
This group consists of 20 participants from 12 countries.
The group serves as the international structure and coordination of research on the wild species.
It has been active in characterizing and evaluating the wild species.
Participants of the group share the common goal of increasing the genetic diversity of the cultivated sunflower using the wild species.
It is through organizations such as the FAO that the US sunflower industry benefits from the numerous countries that participate in the working group sharing information.
The group has made significant progress in expanding our knowledge of the wild species, but the task is far from complete.
It is through international cooperation that we will be able to make a more rapid improvement in the sunflower crop.
