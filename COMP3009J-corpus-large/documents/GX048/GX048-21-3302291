California and New Mexico legislative panel to look at whistle-blower policy
A joint subcommittee of California and New Mexico state legislators will review the Laboratory's policy governing the treatment of whistle-blowers.
"We're very interested in protecting whistle-blowers," New Mexico Senate Majority Leader Manny Aragon, D-Bernalillo-Valencia, said during a panel hearing this week, "and we'll look into it as much as humanly possible."
The head of the joint subcommittee, California Senate Majority Leader Richard Polanco, directed staff assistant Saeed Ali to work with the Lab to find out how the Lab's policies compared with University of California policies.
The Laboratory's whistle-blower officer, Gil Griego of Internal Evaluations (AA-4), said he believes recent proposed changes to the Lab's policy have brought it in line with UC policy.
Aragon asked Griego to work with Ali to show him what steps the Lab has taken and how it has responded to earlier complaints about the policy.
The issues of whistle-blowers, the creation of the Lab's new Salary Policy Committee and forming organizations to represent Laboratory employees highlighted the hearing Monday afternoon before a full house at Fuller Lodge.
The joint subcommittee, which was created earlier this year at the request of Aragon and New Mexico House Speaker Raymond Sanchez, D-Bernalillo, met earlier in the day in Santa Fe and planned to continue the hearing Monday evening in EspaÃ±ola.
The hearing focused on employment and personnel issues at the Lab.
The issue of whistle-blowing was raised by Jay Coghlan of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, a Santa Fe activist group, who urged the lawmakers to look into two issues.
One is a review of the whistle-blowing policy at Hanford that Coghlan said was supposed to have resulted in recommendations for the Laboratory.
The other was a request that the state of California take an active role in protecting Laboratory whistle-blowers.
In response, California Assemblywoman Denise Moreno Ducheny directed the subcommittee staff to follow up on the issues, and Polanco said if the Laboratory policy "is not strong enough, we'll work on fixing it."
In addition to Aragon, New Mexico legislators attending the afternoon meeting were Reps. Luciano "Lucky" Varela, D-Santa Fe; Jeannette Wallace, R-Los Alamos-Sandoval; Debbie Rodella, D-Rio Arriba-Sandoval-Taos; and Ben Lujan, D-Santa Fe.
Former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya also attended as an adviser to the subcommittee.
The legislators from the two states were welcomed by Los Alamos County Councilor Denise Smith and County Administrator Joe King, who emphasized that the community of Los Alamos is separate from the Laboratory.
They said the community is working hard to diversify its economy and decrease its dependence upon the Lab.
Smith also noted that UC has become a more active participant in community affairs in recent years.
Polanco, in his introductory remarks, said he is encouraged by the community's efforts to diversify and said the subcommittee would welcome involvement where appropriate.
He also said the purpose of the subcommittee's work is to improve relations between the Laboratory and various interested constituencies.
He asked the audience to be as specific as possible in making comments and suggestions to help the legislators find appropriate solutions to possible problems.
Representatives of the Laboratory's Employee Advisory Council and the Diversity Council made presentations to the subcommittee during which questions about the new Salary Policy Committee were raised.
Rodella asked for information about current salaries and job categories to be broken down by ethnicity and division, and Polanco and Moreno Ducheny responded that they would seek the information.
The salary committee is part of a new process to examine compensation issues for employees with employee involvement.
Ruben Rangel, former chair of the Diversity Council and member of the salary committee, said the creation of the committee is significant because employees are being involved.
Rangel and current Diversity Council chair, Gloria Garcia, both praised Laboratory Director John Browne for his willingness to listen to employee concerns.
Rangel said members of the Diversity Council are "very excited" about Browne's attitude toward diversity-related issues.
Browne made a presentation to the joint subcommittee during its meeting in Santa Fe, but was unable to attend the Los Alamos and EspaÃ±ola parts of the session.
He told the legislators in Santa Fe that the Laboratory has made progress in addressing issues of concern to employees and said it will continue to take action to address such concerns.
Mary Barr of EAC said the council supports a full discussion and unbiased information about plans for an employee organization at the Laboratory based on the California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, or HEERA.
The Laboratory is scheduled to meet a March 1, 1999, deadline to adopt a collective bargaining policy.
She said employees deserve to have complete, accurate information about the impact of such a step, how it would be set up and how it has worked at other UC laboratories.
She said EAC planned to set up employee forums on the issue.
Several people on the panel and in the audience noted that personnel and employment issues at the Laboratory are often complicated because New Mexico, California and federal guidance may all apply.

Park-and-ride to change downtown stop Monday
The Northern New Mexico park-and-ride bus system is changing its downtown pickup and drop-off location in Los Alamos, beginning Monday.
The new location will be on Central Avenue near the intersection with 20th Street in front of the Mesa Public Library, said Dan Stover of the state Highway and Transportation Department.
In the meantime, 5,920 riders used the commuter-bus service last week between Los Alamos, Santa Fe and EspaÃ±ola, the first week that users had to pay for the service.
Ridership totals for Monday weren't available.
"The last few days have been fairly good," said Stover, noting that the contractor operating the bus service last week obtained a dozen buses to replace buses that were used when the service began earlier this month.
"When the new buses came online, it seemed to stabilize our service a bit," Stover said Tuesday.
Bus Ride New Mexico of Santa Fe is operating the system for the state road agency.
The bus service won't operate on Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, or Friday, Stover said.
Other improvements include adding service personnel to pickup/drop-off sites to assist riders with questions and respond to concerns and service questions.
"I think it relieved people's apprehension to have individuals there to tell people what is going on.
We're trying to improve the level of service and confidence in the system.
"I think to make this work, people have to have a high degree of confidence that buses will be there when they're supposed to be there," he said.
"The more the system stabilizes, the less likely we'll have to do that."
Stover also said drivers now are being assigned specific routes.
Stover said assigning routes should help drivers become more familiar with routes and the riders familiar with their driver.
"That is critical because the [bus driver] really is the person that links riders to the system," said Stover.
The state also is setting up an online system where riders can access real-time system operation information, Stover added.
Stover said state and city of Santa Fe officials continue to work on locating a southside Santa Fe pickup/drop-off location.
There are currently four other pickup/drop-off locations in Santa Fe.
Passes for the bus service are $17.50 for a 10-ride pass, $30 for a 20-ride pass and $50 for a 40-ride pass.
Passes can be purchased at the Furr's Supermarkets on Cordova Road and Pacheco Street in Santa Fe, and in Los Alamos and EspaÃ±ola.
Checks can be made to the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, he said.
Per trip fares are $2, $1 for citizens age 62 and above and students 18 and under.
Stover said the state is encouraging users to purchase a pass.
However, if riders want to pay on a per-ride basis, they should pay supervisors at the pickup/drop-off lots in Santa Fe, Los Alamos, Pojoaque and EspaÃ±ola, not the bus drivers.

Bus Ride of New Mexico is using 47-passenger diesel buses to operate the commuter-bus service.
