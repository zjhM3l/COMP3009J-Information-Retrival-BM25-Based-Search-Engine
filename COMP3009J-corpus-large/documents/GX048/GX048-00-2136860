TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ FAO WORKING GROUP REPORT: EVALUATION OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES PROGRESS REPORT 1997-1998 Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Wild sunflower species constitute the basic genetic stock from which the cultivated sunflower originated.
They have contributed specific agronomic characteristics for cultivated sunflower improvement.
There are 50 species of wild sunflowers, 36 perennial and 14 annual.
They offer a diverse source of potentially useful germplasm.
The difficult task is finding the desirable characteristics in the diverse species.
Efforts to study the diverse species will require international cooperation.
The Foreign Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (FAO), European Cooperative Research Network on Agriculture (ESCORENA) has established a sunflower network to do research on wild sunflower species.
The working group on wild species consists of 20 participants from 12 countries.
The present report presents the activities of the US researchers working on the wild species.
Advances have been made in the identification of new sources of genes for resistance to downy mildew.
Fatty acid composition of populations of wild sunflower from Canada were also reported.
Also a study was completed that compared the evaluation of fatty acid composition from the original populations to that obtained from the same populations regenerated for genebank maintenance.
Populations of wild annual species have been identified which have low saturated fatty acid, about half of that observed in the cultivated sunflower.
The group has made significant progress in identifying desirable agronomic traits from the wild species for use in cultivated sunflower.
However, much research remains to be done to take full advantage of the genetic diversity offered by the wild species.
