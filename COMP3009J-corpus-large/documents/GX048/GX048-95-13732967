TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ INTERNATIONAL SUNFLOWER YEARBOOK RESEARCH REPORT 2000-2001 Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary: Selection at the pollen level would greatly facilitate research for resistance to many biotic and abiotic stresses such as herbicide, salinity, low temperature, and phytotoxins which are expressed in the pollen.
A modified technique using fresh stigma of a cytoplasmic sterile line of cultivated sunflower and a germination medium containing polyethylene glycol was most effective for inducing pollen germination in wild sunflower species.
Sunflower has a long history of utilizing both wild and cultivated germplasm to increase its genetic diversity and economic value.
A study was conducted to compare the oil composition of original populations of wild annual sunflower to those regenerated for maintenance purposes.
There was a significant decrease in palmitic and stearic acids, an increase in oleic acid, and no change in linoleic acid in the regenerated populations compared to the original populations.
The worldwide sunflower industry has used a single male sterile cytoplasm, PET1 for almost 30 years making the crop extremely vulnerable to pending changes of the pest complexes due to the narrow genetic base.
This newly discovered cytoplasm from wild annual sunflower will provide the sunflower industry with a cytoplasmic male sterile source closely related to the cultivated sunflower.
The present trend in human diets is to decrease the consumption of the saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic fatty acids.
In an effort to reduce saturated fats in sunflower oil, a survey of wild annual sunflower populations was undertaken to identify potentially useful populations with low palmitic and stearic fatty acids (less than 7% combined).
The combined 5.8% palmitic and stearic acids which is almost 50% lower than the present level of these fats in sunflower oil was found.
