Quantitative Restrictions Were Converted To Tariff-Rate Quotas * Most U.S. and Mexican quantitative restrictions were converted to tariff-rate quotas (TRQ's) based on the "tariffication" of the former border measure.
* The NAFTA TRQ's provide that a certain quantity of product can enter duty-free, while anything over this amount is subject to an over-quota tariff -- established as the tariff equivalent of the border protection provided by the previous quantitative restriction.
The NAFTA TRQ's provide for growth in the quota amount.
The over-quota tariff is being phased out over a 10- or 15-year period.
Mexico's Import Licensing * Upon enactment of the agreement, Mexico eliminated import licensing requirements on U.S. agricultural exports.
Mexico replaced licensing requirements with a TRQ or an ordinary tariff, which are being phased-out over the NAFTA transition period.
* NAFTA TRQ's were established for Mexico's imports of corn, dry beans, milk powder, poultry, barley/malt, animal fats, potatoes, eggs, and some lumber products from the United States.
* The TRQ's are generally based on average annual 1989-91 trade, with some adjustment for special conditions.
The NAFTA quota volume will grow at a compounded annual 3-percent rate, except for barley/malt, which will grow at 5 percent.
* Mexico's over-quota tariffs are based on the tariff equivalent of the border protection provided by the import license.
This tariff equivalent, in the form of a tariff, are being phased out using the following formula: 24 percent over the first six years in equal annual installments, then a straight-line phase out over the remaining transition period.
The over-quota tariffs on all products are being eliminated over a 10-year transition period, except corn, dry beans, and powdered milk, which are being eliminated over 15 years.
* Mexico immediately eliminated the import license and the duty on millet and on grapes imported from October 15 to May 31.
The import licenses on wheat, grapes (June 1 to October 14), tobacco, cheese, evaporated milk, and day-old chicks imported from the United States were replaced by tariffs, which are being phased out over a 10-year period.
* Canada and Mexico maintain current import restrictions, both tariffs and tariff-rate quotas, on two-way trade in poultry, eggs and most dairy products.
U.S. Import Restrictions * The previous U.S. Section 22 import quotas for imports from Mexico were replaced by NAFTA TRQ's.
The quota quantities grow at a 3-percent compounded annual rate over the NAFTA transition periods.
The over-quota tariff was based on a 1989-91 tariff equivalent of the previous border protection.
* For dairy products, cotton and sugar-containing products, the over-quota tariff for imports from Mexico is being phased out over 10 years.
For peanuts, the over-quota tariff on peanuts imported from Mexico is being reduced over 15 years -- 15 percent over the first six years of the agreement, with the remainder of the tariff phased out over the remaining 9 years.
