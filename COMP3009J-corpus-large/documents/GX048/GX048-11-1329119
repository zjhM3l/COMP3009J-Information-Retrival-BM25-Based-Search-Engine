Dull mentality has been noted.
The affected individuals appear normal after birth, except for small testes.
Most characteristic features become evident at adolescence as hypogonadism, gynecomastia, incomplete virilization with variable eunuchoidism, and dull mentality.
Without testosterone therapy, most adult patients may become obese.
Occasional abnormalities may include cryptorchidism, hypospadias, ataxia, scoliosis during adolescence, and diabetes mellitus in adulthood.
Major Features Head and neck: Mandibular prognathism.
Mouth and oral structures: Taurodontism.
Thorax: Gynecomastia.
Hand and foot: Dermatoglyphic findings consist mostly of decrease in total finger ridge count.
Extremities: Hypostatic leg ulcers and varices and radioulnar synostoses.
Spine: Scoliosis.
Urogenital system: Hypogonadism, incomplete virilization, hypospadias, and eunuchoidism.
Endocrine system: Small testes, hyalinization of seminiferous tubules, nodular hyperplasia of Leydig cells, azospermia, sterility, elevated urinary gonadotropins, decreased urinary 17-ketosteroids, and diabetes mellitus.
Growth and development: Mental retardation and precocious puberty.
Behavior and performance: Behavioral problems and personality disturbances.
Ataxia.
Heredity: The classic form of Klinefelter syndrome is the XXY syndrome, but variants, such as XXYY, XXXY, XXXXY syndromes and mosaic patterns, such as XXX/XY also exist.
Isochromosome Xq with Klinefelter syndrome present Xi(Xq)Y, XXY/XXi(Xq)Y, and Xidic(Xq)Y forms.
Additional features: Tall stature and obesity.
Obesity.
