SCHUMER: FALSE ANTHRAX ALARMS STRETCH 911 EMERGENCY RESOURCES TO THE LIMIT
Schumer unveils new legislation in Syracuse to make terrorist hoaxes a federal crime, impose a five year jail sentence and fines
Senator: Terrorist hoaxes overburden law enforcement, take away from investigating real threats, scare an already anxious public
Standing with FBI, fire and police officials based in Syracuse, US Senator CHARLES E. SCHUMER today unveiled new, bipartisan legislation that will make terrorist hoaxes a federal crime.
The bill imposes prison sentences for anyone who threatens or falsely reports a terrorist attack, stiff fines, and liability for all expenses resulting from the disruption caused by the terrorist hoax.
Currently, there is no federal law dedicated to punishing terrorist hoaxes.
"Terrorist hoaxes are no laughing matter," Schumer said.
"By undermining the police's ability to investigate real terrorist threats, these pranks puts us all at risk.
Law enforcement is already working around the clock to bring those responsible for September 11 and the anthrax attacks to justice.
Wasting their valuable time and resources by committing pranks is essentially an extension of terrorism itself."
In just the first three weeks of October, the FBI responded to more than 3,300 cases relating to weapons of mass destruction nationally, 2,500 of which involved suspected anthrax incidents - a huge increase in the 250 assessments and responses the FBI normally handles in an average year.
These cases typically fall into three categories: (1) False alarms, which are being reported across the country by people who have come across powdery substances in public places, airplanes, and in their mail; (2) Deliberate hoaxes, pranks and practical jokes; and (3) Actual cases of anthrax exposure.
Since September 11, the Syracuse Haz Mat Unit has been sent out on 75 anthrax-related alarms, at an average cost to the Fire Department of $250 per alarm.
Fire Department officials estimate that they respond to each anthrax-related alarm with an average of three personnel for an average of one hour.
The Syracuse Police Department has logged at least 49 anthrax-related calls since September 11 and says the department's typical response is to send two officers for an average of 30 minutes per call.
Additionally, the Syracuse FBI office reports eight incidents since September 11 that have required agents to be sent out to conduct in-depth investigations.
Schumer said his bill would require perpetrators of terrorist hoaxes to reimburse the municipalities where they occur for the costs associated with investigating them.
Schumer also said that he is working to make
Test sure that a provision likely to be included in an emergency spending bill that would reimburse local governments for homeland defense efforts sends federal funds to Western New York law enforcement agencies.
Recent examples include:
Last Friday, a suspicious letter was sent to a judge at the James Hanley Federal Building in Syracuse.
Workers in the judge's office did not open the envelope and called 911 after a powdery substance was found on the mailing.
Local Haz Mat Teams responded to the call, and the letter was taken by the FBI to state labs for testing.
The results came back negative, leading authorities to believe the incident was a hoax. *
On November 8, a family planning clinic in West Seneca, New York received a Fed Ex package containing a powdery substance.
The package was similar to 131 other letters sent across the country.
Along with the Southtowns HazMat team and the West Seneca police department, the Buffalo FBI assigned four agents to the case.
The facility is closed until test results of the substance come back.
On October 25, authorities were called twice to Dunkirk High School to investigate anthrax threats.
The two incidents - a threatening note found in the morning and a white-powdered substance found in the afternoon - caused 620 students and staff to be held in lock-down for a combined 3.5 hours, according to school officials.
The Chautauqua County Haz Mat Team responded with five personnel
.
An apparent hoax diverted a Dallas-bound American Airlines flight from New York to D.C.'s Dulles Airport on October 29 after an threatening note was found on board.
The passengers and flight crew were forced to evacuate on the runway.
*
A Fed Ex deliveryman was charged with pulling an anthrax hoax on a Levittown, LI woman on October 16.
The woman found what proved to be a harmless white powder in a box decorated with a drawing of a devil and the words "USA" and "Satan."
The Nassau County Police Department said it responded with two sergeants and five officers in five vehicles to the incident.

On October 17, a seventeen-year-old was charged with falsely reporting an incident after the juvenile brought an envelope with the words "Death to All Who Open This" and containing white, powdery material to Kingston High School.
According to school officials, approximately 3,000 students and staff were held in lock-down for 90 minutes while some 50 local police, fire and emergency response personnel assessed the situation.
"Beyond the incredible waste of time and money caused by terrorist hoaxes, they scare people at the worst possible time," Schumer said.
"New Yorkers are tough and New Yorkers are stoic, but most New Yorkers are also a little on edge.
That's only natural.
Exploiting our anxiety by committing a terrorist hoax isn't just a show of bad taste of bad judgment.
It's sick.
It mocks the loss of thousands of lives September 11 and the people who have died from anthrax.
But my guess is that scaring people through terrorist hoaxes won't seem so funny after spending five years in jail."
Schumer's bill, the Anti-Hoax Terrorism Act of 2001, would:
Impose sentences of up to five years in prison for those convicted of sending a hoax concerning a weapon of mass destruction or falsely reporting a weapon of mass destruction.
This applies to bioterrorism, chemical or nuclear weapons, and incendiary explosives.
Hold offenders responsible for reimbursement for all expenses incurring resulting from the hoax.
In many cases, these expenses can easily top $1 million.
Fine offenders .
While the penalties would be determined by the judge in each individual case, fines of at least $10,000 would be common under this legislation.
