OUR MISSION
The Office of Homeless Coordination works with the community and state, federal and other local government to support the development and implementation of programs and activities to assist homeless individuals and families and those who may be at risk of becoming homeless.
This program has established a close working relationship with the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust incorporating the Continuum of Care model.
This model is based on the understanding that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves an array of circumstances, which lead to homelessness such as physical, economic and social factors.
The Continuum is a coordinated community-based process that provides outreach and assessment, emergency shelter as an alternative to the streets, transitional housing with appropriate supportive services (such as job training/placement, childcare, substance abuse treatment, and mental health services), and permanent housing.
