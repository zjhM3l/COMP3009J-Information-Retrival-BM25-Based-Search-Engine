The Kurds have been in a struggle with many other countries, nationalities, and cultures.
But they are also locked into a struggle amongst themselves.
I still think it is the case that the government of Turkey will not recognize Kurds as an ethnic group or minority within the boundaries of Turkey.
This policy obviously leads to a high degree of repression and assimilation of Kurds in Turkey.
Certainly Turkey has been as cynical as any other government in exploiting Kurdish nationalism and struggle for self-determination in asserting Turkish power in the region (for example, recent Turkish incursions into the Kurdish area of Iraq).
If I were the teacher of these two students I would try to communicate that I empathize deeply with both their viewpoints.
I might try to point out parallels in world history and current events (there are plenty--for example, Bosnian Serbs or Croats who reject greater Serbian or Croatian nationalism and have fought on the side of the Bosnian government; Basques who consider themselves Spanish or French and do not want a separate microstate; Scots or N. Irish who consider themselves first and foremost citizens of the UK ).
People can bring with them extreme emotions to a new culture and the process of adjusting to life in a new country can exacerbate them--maybe a depth of emotion that only someone who has experienced this displacement can understand.
The woman who considers herself Turkish of Kurdish descent can't reinvent herself to suit the other woman's extreme feelings.
I hope the strong Kurdish nationalist could come to see this.
Maybe it is this very extremeness of emotion and hostility that has allowed Kurds to survive without a nation state, but this now has no place in the new reality they both share: as Middle Eastern Immigrants, as Muslims, as people who must learn and use Swedish as a second language in Sweden.
(Just as a matter of information for readers, Turks and Kurds are both predominantly Islamic in religion, but the Kurdish language is not a Turkic one; rather it is of the Indo-European family.
Interestingly, as Muslims with territorial concerns, too, more than not, Kurds probably supported Turkish genocide against the Armenians; I've never read anywhere in the books that they found common cause against Turkish oppressors, anyway.)
On the other hand, if the assimilated Turkish Kurd wanted a friend of somewhat similar origins in a completely different, N. European society, then maybe she could approach the other woman with this idea:
I want and need you as a friend.
Help me to explore what "Kurdishness" might mean to me by telling me what it means to you.
But realize whether I am a Turk or a Kurd or a Kurdish Turk, I am now a minority in the host culture and I am, like you, a human being that can be hurt.
Moreover, hostility has no place in our relationship.
Let's put behind old animosities and help each other to adapt to the new challenges that face us in Sweden.
Good luck with the conflict resolution.

To Char Ullman:
By the way, in my classroom in Sweden during a break once there was a conflict beteween two women.
Both of them were kurds coming from Turkey, one of them (A) identified herself as a real kurd fighting for a free Kurdistan, the other one (B) had in a way been so assimilated in Turkey that the refused even to call herself a kurd, was maybe ashamed of it.
"A" got very angry with "B" and told her that she must not refuse her origin and identity.
