DOT News Masthead TSA 50-02 Friday, June 28, 2002 Contact: Heather Rosenker Phone: 202-385-1254 TSA Begins the Federalization Process At More Airports Washington, D.C.
Under Secretary of Transportation for Security John W. Magaw announced today that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will begin federalizing the next 133 airports the week of July 1, 2002.
The TSA will send assessment teams to conduct initial studies for the federalization of passenger security screening and/or baggage screening checkpoints.
This week marks a major step toward our goal of meeting our Nov. 19 deadline of a fully-deployed federal screening workforce, and our Dec. 31 deadline for installation of explosive detection systems, said Magaw.
The federalization process consists of three steps: a site survey to determine the best design of the checkpoints and baggage screening areas; checkpoint and baggage screening reconfiguration to best facilitate security and safety of the flying public; and the deployment of a general screening workforce.
The timeframe between arrival of the site assessment team and full deployment of a federal screening workforce depends on the size of the airport and other factors.
The recruitment, assessment, training and deployment of screeners at a given airport will take five weeks or longer.
The Transportation Security Administration, which has responsibility for civil aviation security, is in the process of establishing federal security operations in the nations commercial airports.
TSA will deploy federal personnel, including passenger and baggage screeners, to all airports by Nov. 19, 2002, and is responsible for having checked baggage-screening equipment in place by Dec. 31, 2002.
The TSA will begin site assessments to fully deploy a federal screening workforce and for installation of explosive detection devices at the following airports.
