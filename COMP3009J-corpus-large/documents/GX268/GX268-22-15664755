NEWS TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 8, 2002 Note: 4-Page list of recipients attached Contact: Michael Lyttle (512) 475-4542 Gordon Anderson (512) 475-4743 TDHCA Awards $4.45 Million in 2002 ESGP Funds to Benefit Homeless in Texas (AUSTIN) Â­ The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA) on Wednesday, May 1, announced that it has allocated $4.45 million to 73 local governments and non-profit organizations in Texas through the 2002 Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESGP).
ESGP is a competitive grant which provides funds to cities, counties, and non-profit organizations for activities relating to shelter and services for homeless persons and the prevention of homelessness.
The Department's 2002 ESGP allocation will benefit 73 projects in 34 counties in Texas.
Activities eligible for funding include: the renovation of shelters for use as homeless shelters; assistance in obtaining permanent housing; medical and psychological counseling; and the supervision, development and implementation of homeless prevention activities.
"ESGP represents one of the Department's most essential services to some of our most vulnerable neighbors," said Edwina Carrington, TDHCA Executive Director.
"Whether assisting a victim of domestic abuse, a homeless teen or an adult in need of psychological counseling, ESGP funds help our partners at the local level make a critical difference in the lives of these individuals."
ESGP funds, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, are reserved for each of the 11 service regions in Texas, and distributed in direct proportion to the percentage of poverty population that exists in each region.
The $4,452,650 in funds represents a 3.55% increase from the 2001 ESGP award.
