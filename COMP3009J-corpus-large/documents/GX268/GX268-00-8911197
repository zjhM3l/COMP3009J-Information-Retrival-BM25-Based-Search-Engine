Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Ã¯Â¿Â½ Department of Environmental Protection Fact Sheet Acid Rain In Pennsylvania Overview Acid rain is an environmental problem that has attracted global attention.
Since first making headlines in the 1970's, acid rain has been the subject of thousands of scientific reports
.
Its most visible effect is the acidification of thousands of lakes and streams throughout North America and Europe, with many more water sources vulnerable to its destructive effects.
Acid rain results from pollution that can travel hundreds of miles, crossing state, regional and international boundaries.
Only by working together can government, industry and the public make progress to reduce its impact.
is slightly acidic, has a pH level of .6; lemon juice has a pH level of 2.0; and battery acid has a pH level of 1.0.
Precipitation with a pH lower than 5.6 is considered to be acid rain.
The pH scale is logarithmic, which means there is a tenfold difference between one number and the next.
For instance, rain with a pH level of 4.0 is ten times more acidic than rain with a pH of 5.0, and one hundred times more acidic than rain with a pH of 6.0.
Monitoring since 1982 has shown that the pH of Pennsylvania rainfall averages 4.1 to 4.3, which is around 25 times the acidity of "pure" rain.
Pennsylvania receives some of the most acidic rain in the world.
How Is Acid Rain Produced? Acid rain, more properly called acid deposition, is caused by the emission of various pollutants into the air.
The principle sources are fossil-fuel power plants, other industrial facilities and vehicle exhausts.
These emissions contain sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), the major contributors to acid rain.
These gases combine with oxygen and water vapor in the air to form sulfuric and nitric acids.
The acids fall to the earth in two forms of deposition.
When precipitation such as rain, sleet or snow containing dissolved sulfuric or nitric acid falls to the ground, it is termed wet deposition or "acid rain."
If the acids descend as sulfate or nitrate particles, the phenomenon is labeled dry deposition.
In the United States, 64 percent of annual SO2 emissions and 26 percent of NOx emissions, are produced by electric utility plants that burn fossil fuels.
In 1999, 56 percent of NOx emissions came from mobile sources.
What are the Effects of Acid Rain? According to many scientists, acid rain causes problems in almost every aspect of the environment.
When acids enter lakes and streams, the effects on aquatic life can be devastating.
Organisms ranging from fish and frogs down to microscopic plankton cannot survive in highly acidic waters.
The low pH level can halt or disrupt the reproductive cycles of these organisms.
In addition, acidic rainfall will leach toxic aluminum from the soil into streams and lakes, further stressing or killing fish and other organisms.
Experts also believe that acid rain contributes to the reduction of crop and forest yields.
Instead of adding nourishment to fields and forests, acid rain leaches nutrients (as well as toxic aluminum) that cause sensitive trees and plants to grow slowly or even die.
Scientific reports suggest widespread forest damage in the northeastern United States and Canada due to acid rain.
Acid rain contributes to the deterioration of buildings and monuments.
The acid slowly wears away at certain types of stone causing billions of dollars in damage.
It can etch house and automobile paint.
Finally, acid rain can affect human health by releasing the lead in piping systems that carry water supplies.
Where Does Acid Rain Fall? These acids, suspended high above the earth, may be carried hundreds of miles by the wind before they eventually drop or wash down.
That's why acid rain is a problem that has no borders or territories.
Compounding the problem is the fact that emissions are not spread out evenly.
In the United States, SO2 and NOx emissions are concentrated in the coal-burning Ohio River Valley and its surrounding area.
The wind carries the gases in a northeasterly direction toward the Mid-Atlantic States, New England and Canada.
Acid Rain and the Clean Air Act Amendments Acid rain is one of the many air pollution issues addressed by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
The amendments required a 10 million ton reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by industry from 1980 baseline levels (nearly one-half).
This reduction had two phases.
The first phase, effective January 1, 1995, required the largest power plants in the United States to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.
The second phase, effective January 1, 2000, required additional smaller power plants to also reduce their emissions.
Statistics show that as a result of both phases, sulfate How Is Acid Rain Measured? Scientists measure the amount of acidity in water using the pH scale.
This scale runs from 0-14.
The lower the number on the scale, the stronger the acid, with the value 7.0 being neutral.
For example, "pure" rain, which concentrations in Pennsylvania's rain from 1995-2000 were 27.3 percent lower than observed from 1982-1994.
The NOx control program under Title IV also had two phases--the first one was effective January 1, 1996 and the second on January 1, 2000.
The overall goal was a national reduction of NOx emissions from power plants of two million tons from 1980 baseline levels.
As a result of both phases, the emissions from affected units in 2000 decreased 23 percent from 1990 levels.
However, NOx emissions from all sources, including automobiles (the other major source), have increased.
Therefore, overall NOx emissions have not changed significantly since 1980.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ From 1991-2000, overall SO2 emissions, mainly from coal-burning power plants, have decreased 24 percent.
From 1990-2000, NOx emissions from electric utilities were reduced by 23 percent, however NOx emissions from all sources, including automobiles, have increased.
In 1994 it was estimated that there will be a health savings (due to decreased sulfate and fine particulate levels) of $40 billion per year by 2010.

The objective of the network is to identify trends and measure the effectiveness of environmental programs.
DEP also works with companies to help them comply with regulations and enforces laws to control emissions that cause acid rain.
The department requires the placement of sophisticated electronic in-stack monitoring equipment to continuously monitor emissions of pollutants from industrial stacks.
Programs are underway to reduce NOx emissions from vehicles as well, including the use of alternative fuels, reformulated fuels and emissions testing.
What Can You Do To Reduce Acid Rain Formation? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conserve electricity.
Most of our electric comes from high-sulfur, coal-burning power plants.
If we use less electricity, we burn less coal.
Use automobiles less.
Try to carpool, use mass transit, walk or bike.
Contact local environmental groups and get involved in the acid rain issue.
