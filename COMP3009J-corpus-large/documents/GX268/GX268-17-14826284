If your driver license was issued before October 1, 2000, your license may be renewed for either four or eight years depending on whether you are eligible to renew by mail.
Your renewal notice will tell you if you are eligible to renew by mail.
If you are eligible to renew by mail, your license will be renewed for four years.

Four (4) year renewals will no longer be processed.
