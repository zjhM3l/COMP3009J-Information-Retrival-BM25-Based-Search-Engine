SUMMARY: This rule requires a minimum number of business hours for permit holders under the Florida Drug and Cosmetic Act, Chapter 499, Florida Statutes.
SUMMARY OF STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED REGULATORY COST: This rule will not impact the vast majority of permit holders because they currently meet the minimum business hours proposed in this rule.
However, some businesses may have to hire additional staff in order to meet these requirements.
Even though businesses are currently required to designate business hours on the application, for ease of calculation, the economic impact will be based on hiring an additional staff person at minimum wage.
The impact may amount to either $2,678 ($5.15 per hour X 10 hours per week X 52 weeks) or $5,356 ($5.15 per hour X 20 hours per week X 52 weeks) annually depending upon whether the business must hire additional staff to meet the 10 or 20 hour minimum.

Improved protection would be provided through the revision of the existing manatee protection zones in the Jungle Trail Narrows area that limit allowable motorboat speed and operation and the establishment of a seasonal safe haven zone in the Vero Beach Power Plant area.
SUMMARY: The existing seasonal (November 1 through April 30) zone (30 MPH in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway channel [ICW], Slow Speed outside the ICW) in Jungle Trail Narrows would be replaced by a year-round Slow Speed zone that would allow speeds up to 30 MPH in the ICW north of marker "95."
South of marker "95," including a portion of the Indian River east of Hole-in-the-Wall Island, would be a shore-to-shore Slow Speed zone that includes the ICW.
A seasonal (November 15 Â­ March 31) No Entry zone would be added to a portion of the canal system immediately north of the Vero Beach Municipal Power Plant.
Motorboat access to private residences, boat houses and docks in the No Entry zone by residents and authorized guests would be allowed at Idle Speed pursuant to permits issued under Rule 68C-22.003, FAC.
