SECTION TWO How to Design an After School Program
Louisiana Division of Administration 7
After-School Enrichment
The Four Steps for Designing an After School Program Step One: Conducting a Needs Assessment Effective needs assessments determine how many people need an after school program and what type of program the people want.
It is also helpful to use needs assessments to determine how much families are able to pay for the program.
Obtaining this type of information is important to program organizers, but there are additional benefits from an effective needs assessment.
Data collected from the needs assessment can help build support for the program.
Skeptics may be swayed when they see how many people are in need of the proposed program.
Needs assessments can also help program designers fine-tune their original plan to better meet the needs of those they hope to serve.
Time spent conducting an effective needs assessment is time well spent.
Needs assessments should be distributed to parents and families of children that would or could attend the program.
Additional needs assessments should be sent out to key stakeholders.
One of the most commonly used forms of needs assessment in the after school arena is the questionnaire or paper and pencil survey.
This type of assessment is mailed out, handed out or delivered electronically.
The questionnaire is designed to ask questions that will provide important data to those setting up the program (see pages 78-79 for a sample).
Questionnaires or surveys provide very specific answers to the questions asked.
Questionnaires are usually inexpensive to administer.
However, making sense of the data can prove challenging to those charged with that responsibility.
Remember the ultimate function of the summary is to focus energy, not to record every minute detail! If paper and pencil surveys do not seem right for your needs, consider telephone surveys or the door-to-door canvassing of a Louisiana Division of Administration 8

neighborhood.
The following suggestions on how to design a needs assessment are applicable to all three methods.
To help design your needs assessment, make sure you address the following issues.
Feel free to add to this list.
Â· Name, address and phone numbers (work, home and email if appropriate) Â· Ages of children in the family and school grade level Â· School attended Â· Information on the type of after school the family is currently using Â· Degree of satisfaction with that type of after school Â· Transportation needs Â· Hours of operation needed Â· Type of program families would like to see offered Â· Types of activities families would like to see offered Â· Parents ability to help with the planning of the program Â· Reading level and primary language of recipients Once the data has been collected and summarized it is a good idea to compile a short profile so the data can be shared in an organized and logical manner.
Findings from the needs assessment that relate to the following points should be covered in the profile.
Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Number of children needing after school Children's ages and school grade level Desired location of the program Transportation needs Hours of operation Fee structure Proposed program philosophy or mission
In addition funders will probably require that you present secondary data.

Step Two: Establishing Partnerships Your presence at today's training reflects your connection to others; this is good because connecting with others leads to partnerships, which are critical to the success of your work with after school programs.
Perhaps you worked with others to conduct your needs assessment, if so you have already begun to make important connections.
If you worked on the needs assessment alone then now is the time to use the data and support you gained from the needs assessment to encourage others to join you.
Who are the key players in your area? It is important to identify who else needs to be included in your start-up or improvement plans.
Programs often achieve success when they include some of the key players listed below.
Keeping in mind that this is a general list, how could you personalize it for your program?
Our Guest List Â· School Personnel, such as principals, classroom teachers, teacher assistants, guidance counselors and school nurses Â· Parents Â· Community Organizations Â· Civic Groups Â· Faith-Based Organizations Â· Local Business Â· Departments of Community Education Â· Recreation Departments Â· Federal, state or county agencies Â· Members of local government Â· Local advocacy groups involved with children's issues Â· Universities, colleges, and technical schools
Who would you like to add to this list?
Louisiana Division of Administration 11

Another strategy for increasing the likelihood of your success with step two is to create a sense of inviting others to join you rather than requiring or merely asking them to assist.
Your own enthusiasm and commitment is often the spark that motivates others to join you.

Step Three: Utilizing the Information to Design the Program Designing Program Goals and Objectives: Ideally the data collected from your needs assessments and the collective wisdom gleaned from your partnerships will pave the way for the establishment of the program's mission or the revision of an existing mission.
Out of this mission come goals, objectives and tasks.
As we begin our discussion it is important to keep these following definitions in mind.
A goal is included in a proposal to provide an overall conceptual orientation to the ultimate purpose of the project.
Goals are usually abstract in content, broad in scope, less subject to direct measurement and focused on long-term perspectives.
Goals should describe aims that can reasonably be achieved by the completion of the project unless otherwise instructed by the funder.
Most projects have only one or two goals, but you should always defer to guidance given by the funder.
Example: Improve the academic performance of children at Carver
Middle School.
An objective should be specific, concrete, measurable, and address short-term or intermediate accomplishments.
A proposal may have many objectives and they may be of several different types.
Most objectives fall within several categories: product, process, performance, or behavioral.
Example: To increase the math grades of 80% of the Carver Middle
School students participating in the after school program at least 50% of the time by one letter grade by May 2004.
Louisiana Division of Administration 14
After-School Enrichment
A task is the means or method by which the organization will accomplish the objectives.
Tasks are specific, but not necessarily measurable.
There will be many tasks in the program design.
Tasks describe the steps one must take in order to reach the measurable objectives.
Examples: Â· Purchase the Voyager curriculum.
Â· Train teachers working in the after school program to use the
Voyager curriculum.
Â· Using the Voyager curriculum, focus on math skills two days each week.
The importance of goals and objectives should Goals and objectives define the outcomes of a they serve the purpose of stating what the accomplish.
Goals and objectives form the basis will answer important questions such as:
not be minimized.
project, additionally project intends to on which reviewers
Â· Is the project relevant to the goals of my funding source? Â· Will the project accomplish something that is significant, important, timely, innovative, and worthy of my support? Â· Will the proposed outcomes help solve an identified problem or need? Â· Are the intended outcomes of the project achievable and measurable? Â· Is the project reasonable in terms of the size and budget of my organization? Â· Can the project be expected to result in data or information that will tell whether the award was a success? Â· Are the suggested procedures appropriate to carry out the intended outcomes? Â· Is the budget reasonable for what will be achieved? Â· Is the experience and training of key staff appropriate to the purposes of the project or can you demonstrate the ability to get qualified staff?
Louisiana Division of Administration 15
After-School Enrichment
Remember...
Goals and objectives are the "heart" of your project, and they are what will require the most consensus among partners.
Begin writing your goals and objectives now.
Circulate them for input later before continuing with the remainder of the proposal.
Louisiana Division of Administration 16
After-School Enrichment
Team Task Two: Let's practice writing some goals, objectives and tasks.
On your first index card write a goal for an after school program.
Do not label it as a goal.
On the second index card do the same thing, except this time write down a measurable objective that would support the goal you have written.
On the third index card write down a task that supports your goal and your measurable objective.
Remember not to label your cards.
When you have finished turn to the person next to you and exchange cards.
See if you can determine which are each other's goal, objective and task.
Be ready to tell the rest of us how things went.

Planning Program Tasks: "I like it best when my friends and I get to plan what we want to do.
Last week we made a play and the staff helped us with costumes, and now we're going to perform it for our families at a potluck dinner!" After school programs can provide children with the freedom they long for.
Most children are in a fairly structured environment all day.
When they get to your program they need time to relax, move at their own pace and pursue activities of their choice.
Â· Are there many different tasks for children to choose from? Do the choices include active play (dancing, running, jumping, climbing, exploring the environment and participating in sports), creative arts (arts and crafts, dramatic play and music), quiet time (chatting with friends, playing board games, spending time alone or in small groups) and enrichment activities (working on science projects, writing a newspaper, participating in math activities, doing homework or using computers)? Do the tasks give children the opportunities to learn in different ways and to test out new ideas? Â· Remember tasks can be fun and educational or helping children learn all at the same time! Â· Do the tasks match the mission of the program (e.g., school success, community involvement, recreation and leisure, social skills development, etc.)? Are the tasks well suited to the ages, interests and abilities of the children? Do the tasks reflect the cultures of the families served and introduce the children to new cultures? Â· Are the children involved in planning their tasks? Do tasks develop in response to children's interests? (For example, drum playing leads to the formation of a band; clay activity leads to a pottery

After-School Enrichment
class; an interest in baseball cards leads to learning about statistics.)
Â· Do the materials support the mission of the program? Are there enough materials so children are not waiting a long time to do an activity? Is there a range of materials to suit the ages and abilities of all the children? Are materials and equipment adapted for children with special needs?

Academic Activity Ideas for Your Program: Links to Learning: After school programs operating in the 21st century are continuously required to connect what happens during the school day with what takes place in the after school program.
School administrators around the country, as well as here in Louisiana, demand such linkages.
To help after school programs meet these demands, The National Institute on Out-of-School Time (NIOST) has developed a training for after school providers called "Links to Learning".
This training is built around the findings of Richard Murname of Harvard University and Frank Levy of MIT.
Their research suggests there are six basic skills children need to possess to succeed in today's world.
After school activities should help build the six skills.
These six skills are: Â· Literacy: Effectively Talking/Speaking, Drawing/Writing, Reading Text and Data, Listening, Locating information, Creating information Â· Numeracy: Understanding how numbers represent objects and amounts of objects Â· Written and Oral Communication Skills: Sharing thoughts or ideas with others in many forms Â· Problem Solving and Critical Thinking Skills: Not just math based, but everyday problems or situations Â· Knowledge of and comfort with Technology: Use of computers, electronic messaging, as well as machines and devices Â· Ability to Work with Diverse Groups of People: Comfort, skill and a desire to get along with and work collaboratively with people representing different ethnic, intellectual, philosophical, spiritual and experiential backgrounds
Louisiana Division of Administration 21
After-School Enrichment
In order to help children acquire these six skills, after school programs must: Â· Create an atmosphere that promotes experimentation.
After school programs that provide this type of environment involve the children in the arrangement of the furniture and materials.
Â· Provide adequate and appropriate materials and supplies.
Materials should be developmentally appropriate for the children in the program and in good repair.
Having the materials readily available for the children to use is also important.
Â· Offer a project-based approach to learning.
Project based activities suggest a long-term nature.
It is important that the after school program provides storage areas to accommodate these ongoing projects.
Â· Maintain a staff-child ratio that allows for meaningful and frequent interactions.
The National School Age Care Alliance suggests a ratio between 1:8 and 1:12 for children under the age of six.
For children aged six and older, The National School Age Care Alliances suggests a ratio of 1:10 to 1:15.
These ratios allow for meaningful and frequent interactions.
Â· Encourage children to apply their school-day learnings to their after school activities.
Communication between the after school staff and the school day staff allows for this reinforcement of learning.
To help you create links to learning in your after school program, a variety of activities has been included in pages 86-110 of the appendix.
Let's try one of those activities now.

A Problem Needing Solved...
One day a man leaves his island in a rowboat and goes to the market.
Once there he buys a panther, a chicken and a bag of grain for the chicken to eat.
He carries them back to his boat.
(This is the boat the man uses to row back and forth to the island on which he lives.)
The problem is that he can only fit one of the three things he bought in the boat at a time.
So, the man has to think about what to take, when to take it, and what to leave behind.
He realizes that if he takes the panther first, leaving the chicken and grain behind, the chicken will eat the grain.
He also is aware of the fact that if he leaves the panther and chicken together the panther might eat the chicken.
What should he do? Help him determine the best strategy for getting all three items safely to the island in his boat.

Enriched Learning Opportunities: The Louisiana Department of Education has identified the following as approved curricula choices for use in after school programs.
More complete information on each of these curricula is included in the appendix.
Â· Foundations Â­ "Discovers" and/or "Invests" These are theme-based curricula for after school programs.
The themes are designed to reinforce academic skills.
These materials also have a strong multi-cultural component.
Â· Voyager After School These materials are designed to address the academic and social needs of children, as well as help to develop leadership skills.
They are theme-based and designed to be implemented in four and a half to five hours per week.
Â· Benchmark Education Company "Pathfinders" and/or "Trailblazers" This series is designed for one-on-one or small group use.
It focuses on literacy reinforcement and success.
Each lesson plan consists of a five-step format.
The materials are broken down into two groups, those suitable for grades K-2 and those suitable for grades 3-8.
Â· Fast ForWord Basic and Reading This is a learning and reading series designed to help boost children's skills in phonics, phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
It uses computer software to individualize programs for students.

Other Activity Ideas for Your Program As indicated earlier in this manual and in The National School Age Care Alliance Standards for Quality School-Age Care many different types of activities need to be offered to children in after school programs.
Programs must take care to ensure that the activities they offer reflect the program's mission, but at the same time offer children a balance and some choice in their after school hours.
The following list is meant to serve as a reference point for you as you plan your daily and weekly schedules.
Review the list.
Are these activities you currently offer or plan to offer? If not, why not? What steps can you take to make sure children have frequent opportunities to experience most of these types of activities? Remember including these types of activities is important to help children with their academic achievement.
Active physical play, both indoors and outdoors Nature walks or studies Arts and Crafts Dramatic play Music Dance Cooking Life Skills Quiet time with friends Time to be alone Board Games Pleasure Reading Long Term Projects Community Service Projects Nutritious Snack Remember these activities are in addition to the academic or tutorial component of your program.

Step Four: Recruitment and Retention of Children Whether you are designing a brand new program or merely adding a component to an existing program, the need to recruit customers is there.
Recruiting well can make a tremendous difference.
Recruitment efforts should not be limited to fliers and brochures.
Word-of-mouth testimonials are very effective.
Often the program designers and leaders are some of your best recruiters.
Their wordof-mouth message is critical to recruiting and keeping children in the program.
Other helpful strategies are listed below.
Feel free to add your ideas to this list.
Â· Phone calls or visits to those who indicated a need for the program to elicit support Â· Posters displayed around town announcing the new program Â· Newsletters or bulletins Â· Newspaper ads Â· TV and radio announcements (public service announcements are typically free of charge) Â· Announcements made at civic meetings or from church pulpits Â· An open house where parents and children can come and meet the staff, take part in activities reflective of those offered by the program and have a snack similar to those the program offers Obviously recruitment is only half of the battle.
Retaining children in your program is critical.
Successful after school programs often involve the children in the planning of the activities.
Additionally programs that retain qualified and dedicated staff also are better able to continuously meet the needs of the children and families they serve.
As we will discuss in Section Five of this handbook, evaluation plays a key role in the retention of children and staff.

Louisiana Division of Administration 35
After-School Enrichment
The NSACA Standards for Quality SchoolAge Care The NSACA Standards for Quality have six cornerstones.
They are referred to as categories.
Those six categories are Human Relationships, Indoor Environment, Outdoor Environment, Activities, Safety, Health and Nutrition, and Administration.
Each category has keys that support it and each key has four related standards.
Let's spend a few minutes looking at the pamphlet you have been given to understand the format of the standards a little better.
Review the pamphlet; discuss it with a partner.
What do you like about the pamphlet? What is confusing about it? Remember these are indicators of a high level of quality and something that may take a program several years to achieve.
Jot down a few thoughts below.
Louisiana Division of Administration 36
After-School Enrichment
THE ELEMENTS OF QUALITY To run a great program takes thought and skill.
It takes creative team effort and constant, gradual change to create the best possible after school opportunities for children.
Refer to these pages as you go about constructing quality after school programs:
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS "The staff here is really cool.
They do stuff with us and talk with us and we have a lot of fun.
It makes me really want to come here."
What we are talking about here is at the very heart of any school-age program.
If staff members respond to children sensitively, you will have the main ingredient for a great program.
If the emotional environment is one of acceptance and understanding for children, families and staff, the program will be a positive experience for everyone.
These questions will help you to check on the emotional climate of your program:
Â· Does the staff make children feel welcome and treat them with
respect? Is the staff compassionate about the children's many feelings? Does the staff have time to talk with individual children and get to know each child's interests, abilities and talents? Is the staff culturally responsive?
Â· Is the staff actively involved with children? Do they work with the
children everyday to build positive relationships and model communication? Do they help children make informed and responsible decisions? Does the staff have realistic expectations of children? Does the staff help children without taking control?
Â· Does the staff model cooperation and respect? Does the staff set
appropriate limits for children? Do they help children learn how to solve their conflicts? Do the children cooperate and show respect for each other? Louisiana Division of Administration 37
After-School Enrichment
Â· Are families welcome at the program and do they feel well informed? Do the staff and families work together to make this a positive experience for the children? Are the diverse needs of families recognized and viewed as strengths? Is the staff responsive to issues affecting the children's lives outside of the program?
INDOOR ENVIRONMENT "I like being able to move around to different places.
Some days I like going to the gym and some days I like working with the computers.
Sometimes I just like to go to the loft to read.
The best part is that I can pick where I want to be."
A good program has space that feels cozy and comfortable and has interest areas.
Every space can be improved with imagination and enthusiasm.
Those who run programs located in "dedicated" space are free to shape that space as they wish.
Programs that share space can make the curriculum mobile.
Stackable containers, large pillows, moveable storage cabinets and moveable furniture will help mobility.
Design the space around the needs of children and the goals of the program.
Look for the following to see if your program has a quality indoor environment: Â· Are the space, furniture and equipment organized to support a wide range of program activities? Are there areas for active play, quiet work and play, messy activities, eating and various social groupings? Can several activities go on at the same time without disrupting one another? Â· Is there adequate storage? Is there a place where children and staff can store their personal belongings? Can children get materials out and put them away on their own with ease? Â· Are there soft, comfortable spaces for relaxation and privacy for children who have been in large-group settings all day? Does the space reflect the work and interests of the children? Louisiana Division of Administration 38
After-School Enrichment
Â· Is the space comfortable for everyone? Can children do their activities without feeling crowded? Can people with disabilities get around the space? Can they use the equipment?
OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT "The first month I was here I met my friends and we played hopscotch every day.
That was the best.
Now I'm building a clubhouse with some wood and recycled material.
When it's finished, we're going to make a club."
To promote healthy development, children need time outdoors to move, run and play.
They need a full range of outdoor experiences, including opportunities for sports and games, gardening, camping, exploring, climbing, running and jumping.
Ideally, there will be as many outdoor choices as there are indoor choices.
There should also be places for quiet play.
Programs in urban areas may not have an outdoor play area.
Even if there are outdoor spaces, they may not be safe.
Staff and families may need to work together to find an outdoor play area that is safe, and use transportation to take the children there.
Â· Does each child have a chance to play outdoors for at least 30 minutes each afternoon? Â· Is there large motor space indoors when the weather is bad? Â· Is the space suitable for a wide variety of activities? Can various activities take place at the same time without crowding?
Â· Does the equipment allow children to be independent and
creative? Is it appropriate for the interests and abilities of all children? Does the space provide safe challenges for children of all ages, including those with special needs?
Louisiana Division of Administration 39
After-School Enrichment
SAFETY, HEALTH, AND NUTRITION "They have the best food here.
I especially like it when I can help with cooking projects.
Also, if I've missed snack and I'm hungry at the end of the day, they always let me have an apple."
School-age children like to eat! With many programs open until 6 p.m., children need a substantial, nutritious snack to keep them going until they can eat dinner at home.
Children who seem to present behavior problems may be lacking a healthy diet.
Sometimes the way to a child's heart is through her or his stomach.
It is also natural for school-age kids to take risks.
It can be a struggle to look out for their safety and health and still provide a program that allows them to explore the world in a way that is natural to them.
Children need to be supervised by staff members that are trained to reduce the risks and handle emergencies.
Â· Does the program serve healthy foods? Is there enough food to meet the needs of children of all ages and sizes? Is food available at times when children are hungry? Do the children seem to like the food? Â· Are steps taken to protect and improve the health of children? Is the facility clean? Is food served under sanitary conditions? Are hands washed frequently and sick children cared for separately to help prevent the spread of germs? Are children protected from health hazards including toxic or allergic substances? Â· Are the safety and security of the children protected? Are arrivals and departures carefully supervised? Does the staff know the people the children are released to? Are entrances and exits supervised? Are there any observable safety hazards? Is all play equipment safe for active play? When accidents do happen, are the staff trained to handle emergencies and equipped with first-aid materials?
Louisiana Division of Administration 40
After-School Enrichment
Â· Does the staff know how to spot signs of child abuse and know how to report it? Are they prepared to identify other issues related to health and development such as eating disorders, malnutrition and depression? Â· See appendix page 120 for some healthy snack suggestions.
ADMINISTRATION You will not hear kids saying, "I really like the budget this quarter; I are adequate resources, low staff turnover and professional development for staff.
really like your staff-hiring decisions; I'm glad Mary has been here for three years..." but you can be sure the children will benefit if there
At the core of a quality program are leaders who have experience working with children and strong administrative skills.
Good administrators struggle every day to build and maintain programs that are accessible and affordable.
The director plays a key role in supporting staff and developing relationships with families and the community.
The director also manages program finances and maintains records.
It is usually the director who supervises support services such as transportation.
Â· Do staff-child ratios and group sizes allow staff to meet the children's needs? Are children given enough staff time so that they are not rushed? Is there enough staff to handle both an emergency and regular childcare? Â· Do the leaders encourage families, host, and community to become partners in making this the best possible program? Is there good communication with families and are they involved in setting goals for individual children and the program? Is the host engaged in supporting the program and setting policies that work for both organizations? Are community resources tapped to support the program and provide activities for children?
Louisiana Division of Administration 41
After-School Enrichment
Â· Are policies and procedures in place to protect the health and safety of the children? Â· Does staff know what these policies and procedures are? Do you meet state and local guidelines for safety and health? Â· Do family and personnel policies work toward making this a great program? Do you hire staff that is qualified to work with schoolage children? Are staff salaries adequate to reduce turnover? Are program fees affordable for families? The answers to these questions often reveal a delicate balancing of resources.
Â· Are there adequate supports to staff? Are they given an orientation to the job before working with children? Are staff members asked about their training needs? Do they receive at least 10 hours of training per year to meet these needs? Does staff receive appropriate support (benefits, wages, discussion time, input into the program) to make their work experience positive? Â· Does the management of the program support the program goals? Does the budget support program goals? Do you evaluate the program annually and work on continuous improvement?

After-School Enrichment
Four Scenarios Scenario A: Situation: The Somewhere in Louisiana After School Program recently hired a new staff member.
The young man hired has after school experience and a strong educational background.
He is one of four staff members.
He has been with the program for three months.
He was off to a great start, but for the past four to five weeks the director has noticed that he is arriving late several times a week.
Additionally he has not turned in his weekly planning sheet for the last month and he has not been conducting the portion of the playground safety inspection for which he is responsible.
The director has yet to address the situation.
She is aware of his tardiness and she knows that some of the other staff members are completing his planning sheets and safety checks for him.
Director's Perspective: I know our new group leader is going through a rough time.
His mom has been sick and he and his girlfriend just broke up, I feel sorry for him.
The last thing I want to do is add to his troubles.
Besides the other staff members seem happy to pinch-hit for him, and that is what teamwork is all about.
I think I will just lie low for a while and hope things improve soon.
Other Staff's Perspective: Boy does our director ever play favorites.
She is not doing one thing to the new guy.
He is always late; I remember when the director used to dock our pay for being late.
And we have to do all of his paperwork.
I know he does a great job with the kids, and the parents love him, but this is not fair!

After-School Enrichment
Scenario B: The Situation: The Somewhere in Louisiana After School Program just enrolled a new family in their program.
The family has a son, a large, aggressive third grader.
The staff members have come to the director with their concerns about the new boy.
He has been namecalling and starting fights with other boys and girls in his group.
He bullies other children into letting him have his way.
Upon hearing this, the director promptly scheduled a conference with the parents.
The staff members were not informed of the conference until after it took place.
Rumor has it the director talked during most of the conference; he too has a son who went through a similar phase.
The director told the parents what he did to remedy the situation and suggested they do the exact same thing.
After the conference the director told staff that he had fixed the situation and there should be no more problems.
Director's Perspective: I know how hard it is to have an aggressive son who is perceived as a bully by his teachers.
I remember so clearly the troubles I went through with my own son.
I read a book about how to deal with aggressive behavior in children and I went to a seminar on the subject.
I fixed the situation with my son.
I know these parents can do it too.
I told them what to do and gave them a list.
Now I just need to make sure they follow through.
There is no need for my staff to worry; I have it all under control.
Staff's Perspective: Well I guess our director doesn't care what we think about this situation.
I could not believe he didn't tell us about the parent conference he scheduled.
I guess he thinks that if he spends 15 minutes in a classroom then he has seen it all and knows exactly what is going on.
I know I shouldn't have agreed with those parents when they called our director "Mr. Know it All", but that is sure how he is acting!
Louisiana Division of Administration 54
After-School Enrichment
Scenario C: The Situation: The Somewhere in Louisiana After School Program has just hired a new director.
She is excited about her new job.
She knows how important it is to have the children like you.
She spends at least 90 minutes a day playing games with the kids, doing projects with the kids, and playing outside with the kids.
She is a very active, energetic young woman.
Sometimes the play turns into roughhousing and the children get so excited that they do not remember the program rules.
When this happens the director quickly leaves the area and depends on the staff to remind the children of the rules and take any disciplinary action needed.
Director's Perspective: Wow, am I nervous.
I was so excited to get my first job as a director.
Everything will go just fine as long as the kids like me and everyone has fun.
I just really want the kids to think our program is cool and then they will tell their parents, their friends, their teachers and anyone else they know.
That would be great! Staff's Perspective: We all really like the new director.
She seems enthusiastic, creative and full of energy.
However, she is always playing with the kids.
We can never find her in her office when we need to talk to her about problems we are having with the program.
About four weeks ago we asked her to talk to a parent that is consistently late picking up her child, but she still has not spoken to that parent.
In the meantime, we have to stay late every night until that parent comes.
And she gets the kids so riled up; it takes forever to calm them down.
She doesn't seem to enforce the rules, but then she talks about the importance of effective behavior management techniques at our staff meetings.
We don't know what to think.
Louisiana Division of Administration 55
After-School Enrichment
Scenario D: The Situation: The Somewhere in Louisiana After School Program is currently located in a school building.
However, recently the church next door approached the director and asked her to move the program to their building.
They have offered a gym, kitchen and several classrooms free of charge.
The church sees this as part of their outreach ministry to the children of the area.
The director needs to respond to the church board in a timely manner, if she declines their offer then the church may open their own program.
The director is excited about the partnership with the church, but she is a cautious, analytical woman.
She wants to read more on churchbased programs, talk to other directors and make sure she is making the right decision.
Director's Perspective: Gosh, this is wonderful opportunity.
Our program could move and have much better space than we have now.
I feel sure that if the children have more room, the staff could plan a wider variety of activities.
However, I am nervous too.
Change is always hard.
What if this doesn't work out? I need to talk to other directors who are in similar situations.
I want to discuss it with my staff, the children and their parents, but that could take weeks.
The church needs their decision in 10 days.
What should I do? The Church's Perspective: We don't know what to make of all of this.
We offered our space to the after school program next door, but their director seems to be incapable of giving us an answer.
We know she runs a good program and we think this would be a good thing for us and for them.
What is her hold-up? We need to move on things quickly.

After-School Enrichment
Eight Great Ates for After School Leaders Create: Leaders of after school programs must be creative.
To lead well leaders must have a vision of where it is they want to go.
Often the vision is not of something that already exists, rather it is built on new ideas or concepts.
Creative thinking also comes into play for leaders when they demonstrate the ability to think outside the box or look at situations from a variety of perspectives.
Anticipate: Effective leaders plan well.
They look ahead and foresee potential problems and possible solutions.
This advance planning enables them to be more effective and better prepared in times of crisis.
Anticipatory leaders are often able to predict future trends that will impact the nature of their program, the needs of the families and children they serve and the needs of the staff.
Communicate: Great communicators often become great leaders.
Leaders need to be able to share their message in a clear way choosing words that convey meaning in a non-threatening and empowering way.
Effective communication involves the spoken and the written word as well as the ability to listen.
Louisiana Division of Administration 57
After-School Enrichment
Participate: Active participation in the day-to-day operations of the after school program is another hallmark of effective leaders.
Staff must believe that their supervisor is both capable of and willing to do that which they are asking of the staff.
Active participation by leaders also helps to ensure that the directors are taking the pulse of the programs.
Educate: Teaching staff and helping them grow professionally is a critical part of effective leadership.
Leaders who supply resources, materials and emotional support to their staff meet with much success.
Establishing policies and procedures that clearly stipulate what is to be done and by whom is an integral part of effective leaders' jobs.
Another part of educating staff is allowing them opportunities to spread their wings through appropriate delegation.
Motivate: Who among us cannot remember someone in their life who gave them an extra nudge, thereby helping them to succeed? Leaders need to give those gentle nudges.
After school leaders are charged with the task of empowering their staff to succeed and achieve the program goals.
Leading is part coaching.
Successful coaches build on a player's strengths and compensate for team or player weaknesses.
Louisiana Division of Administration 58
After-School Enrichment
Appreciate: Valuing staff members for their unique contributions is another duty of effective leaders.
Leaders who allow staff's individuality to shine through recognize the importance of appreciating staff members' individual talents and gifts.
Effective leaders praise staff's success and help the staff use their mistakes as opportunities to grow and learn.
Evaluate: Effective leaders provide their staff with objective, relevant and specific feedback.
After school leaders help staff when they explain what is expected of them, observe them to see how they are doing and then provide them with appropriate feedback that applauds their successes and helps pinpoint areas for growth.

Which Am I? I watched them tear a building down, A gang of men in a busy town With a mightily heave and a lusty yell They swung a boom, and a sidewall fell, I said to the foreman, "Are these folks as skilled, As those you'd hire if you had to build?" He just gave a laugh and said, "No indeed, Just a common laborer is all I need, And I can wreck in a day or two What it took the builder a year to do."
And I thought to myself as I went my way "Just which of these roles have I tried to play? Am I a wrecker as I walk the town, Content with the labor of tearing down? Or am I a builder, who works with care, Making the place better because I was there."

Characteristics of Effective Evaluations Timely Specific Accurate Relevant Objective Constructive Ongoing or Formative Summative Aligned with job description
Look back at the list we came up with together, how does it compare with this list?
Louisiana Division of Administration 68
After-School Enrichment
Two Types of Evaluation Formative Evaluation: Formative evaluation can be classified as feedback that is given on an ongoing basis.
Formative evaluation occurs frequently over a period of time.
Formative evaluation is designed to help us learn as we go, thereby quickly allowing us to implement new strategies.
Summative Evaluation: Summative evaluation is feedback given at the end of a project or some other specified time frame.
It summarizes and takes a look back at the project, course, or other event.
Summative evaluation enables us to review our experience and make general statements about what took place.
Louisiana Division of Administration 69
After-School Enrichment
Three Methods of Evaluation Participant Satisfaction: Member or participant satisfaction evaluation measures the perception of the people involved in the program.
Such methods ask a wide variety of people involved in the program for their feedback.
The methods for conducting this type of evaluation are varied.
They might include surveys, focus groups, questionnaires or interviews.
The questionnaires found in the self-study component of NSACA's ARQ Kit are examples of this method of evaluation.
Other less formal member satisfaction evaluations might include a survey for parents and families to complete.
Often after school programs survey their staff and the children to get their input.
There are several sample surveys in the Appendix; one dealing with gaining input from children, another from the families, and the third is designed to obtain feedback from staff.
Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance Methods demonstrate that a program is effective by showing it includes components proven to produce positive results.
Quality Assurance methods let a program demonstrate that it is consistently including critical components; components that scientific research has already shown to provide positive outcomes.
Typically this Louisiana Division of Administration 70
After-School Enrichment
type of evaluation is conducted by observing the program following a highly structured protocol.
The National School Age Care Alliance Observation Tool is an example of a Quality Assurance Evaluation.
This observation tool allows observers to rate after school programs using a four-point scale on each of the 144 standards.
Another example of a Quality Assurance Evaluation method is the Self-Assessment Monitoring Tool (SAM).
This instrument was designed by the Louisiana Department of Education to be used to self assess your program.
A copy has been included in the appendix on pages 124-133.
Let's turn to it now and briefly review it.
Performance Indicators/Outcome Objectives: This method of evaluation allows a program to select a specific outcome they hope to achieve and determine to what extent they have achieved it.
Programs use outcome measurements to determine how much change has occurred in a specific outcome.
They track specific behaviors such as attendance and contact hours with the after school program, retention rates, school grades, and scores on standardized tests such as LEAP and IOWA.
The collection of data in this type of evaluation ranges from test scores to percentage of students retained at a certain grade level to number of hours spent in after school on a weekly basis.
It is important to keep in mind that evaluations must: 1.
Put together data 2.
Be based on ongoing observations Louisiana Division of Administration 71

Involve communication between those being evaluated and those doing the evaluation.
In the after school arena those parties would include the after school staff, the school staff, the parents, the children and the program administrators.

"This Is In and This Is Not": A sorting game.
Using a clothesline, create a 6foot wide circle in the middle of the floor.
Around the outside of the circle, place different kinds of everyday objects.
The game leader thinks of a rule concerning the characteristic (i.e., RED things) that will allow an object to be placed in or excluded from the circle.
The leader writes this rule on a piece of paper turned face down on the floor.
Players start, taking turns.
One player at a time chooses one object he/she thinks will conform to the rule and be allowed inside the circle.
If the object chosen conforms to the attribute the leader had in mind (the rule is "RED" and the object is "red") the object can stay inside the circle.
If it does not conform (the rule is "RED" but the object is "blue"), it must be taken back out of the circle.
All the leader can say is "yes" or "no" in response to an object being placed in the circle.
The players must try to figure out, by looking at the characteristics of the objects that are allowed to remain, what the leader's rule must be.
Guesses will be answered by "yes" or "no" responses.
Once the rule has been guessed, a new leader is chosen, and the new leader comes up with a new rule.
Older children will enjoy a double or triple rule.

Right now she has occasional substitute teaching jobs.
While rooming together in an apartment they decide they should split their expenses proportionately until Josephine gets full-time work.
Sarah says that since she is earning three times as much as Josephine right now, Josephine should pay only one fourth of the expenses.
Josephine says, "Hey, I was going to pay one third of the expenses."

The Panther, The Chicken, and the Bag of Grain Problem One day a man leaves his island in his rowboat and goes to the market.
Once there he buys a panther, a chicken, and a bag of grain for the chicken to eat.
He carries them back to his boat.
[the one he used to row from the island he lives on] The problem here is he can only fit one of the three things he bought in the boat at a time.
So, the man has to think about what to take and when to take it, and what to leave behind for the next trip.
He realizes that if he takes the panther first, leaving the chicken and the bag of grain behind that the chicken will get into the grain and get sick because he will eat too much grain.
If he takes the bag of grain, the panther might eat the chicken while the man is gone.
So what should he do? Your task is to solve the problem of which purchase to take first, second, and third, so that all of them will survive, long enough to get them to the island in his "One thing at a time" boat.

The Mathematics of Living [Related to looking at everyday life through a mathematical lens, using the language of math to describe what you see]
An Example of This: Your decision to smoke cigarettes from age 13 until you die mathematically looks like this: $300,000 price tag [average] on the life long purchase of cigarettes, with a 3 to 4 year shortening of your lifetime.
Mathematics, calculating, and problem solving, especially for school age children, is often separated from anything personal or real.
Mathematics is really just a specialized language for describing, finding out about, or communicating what is known about the world.
The Mathematics of Living experiences ask students to look at everyday life in general, and articulate what is seen using the language of math.

There are 21 handshakes.
If I am one of the seven people, I will make six handshakes, because of course I do not shake my own hand.
The second person in turn will make five new handshakes, because we do not count the handshake he or she has already made with me.
The third person generates four new handshakes, since we do not count the handshake with me and the handshake with the second person.

Answers will vary according to the differences in foot and doll size.
You could lay a transparent grid with equal-sized squares over the footprint.
Each square would represent some standard numeric unit.
You would then count the number of squares that overlap the footprint.
You would multiply this number by the number of units they represent.
For example if each square represented 2 cm^2, and the footprint contained 60 squares, the surface area would be 120 cm^2, (60 x 2= 120.)
For the doll, one would need to wrap it tightly in a long string.
Then unwrap it and lay the string down to make a 2 dimensional shape, (rectangle.)
Then multiply the length of the rectangle by the width to get the surface area.
(If the length is 8 cm and the width is 10 cm, the surface area would be 80 cm^2, 8 x 10 = 80.)

Have children explain his or her reasoning behind their answer.
The length of the shelves must be 46550 feet.
If each shelf was 4 feet long, and had three separate rows, and each book was 1 inch thick, there would be 144 books per shelf.
(4 feet x 3 rows = 12 feet.
12 inches in each foot = 12 books in each foot; 12 x 12 = 144 books.)
In this case there would be a total of 11640 shelves, 46550 feet total / 4 foot shelves = 11640.
There would be a total of 1,676,160 books, because 11640 shelves x 144 books each = 1,676,160.
So the answer to the problem would be no since 1,676,160 is less than 2 million.
If the shelves each had 6 different rows, there would be 288 books per shelf, 6 rows x 4 feet = 24 feet.
24 feet x 12 inches = 288, since each book is one inch thick.
There would be 3,352,320 books total since there are 11640 shelves x 288 books each = 3,352,320.
The answer would then be yes because 3,352,320 is greater than 2 million.

Fifty Nifty Literacy Activities Literacy Activities in the context of Non-School Time Supporting Literacy development in a non-school setting will look different than the more familiar "Language Arts, Reading, and Literacy" periods that schools create as they teach reading, and writing to students.
That should not be taken as meaning that supporting literacy development is not intentional, planned, or formalized somehow.
It is.
All of us who spend time with children and youth have an important role to play in modeling literacy, expecting literate responses by others, and provoking or encouraging the development and expansion of children's and youths' abilities to read, write, and speak.
Any opportunity, planned or not, to model, inform, correct, suggest, encourage, provoke, or challenge language use and learning should always be grasped by adults who want to take an active role in fostering children's literacy development.
Think of the times, when you were a kid, a well intentioned adult challenged something you said, and suggested alternative words or phrases for you to use; times when an adult read out loud from a book just to pass the time; or wanting to participate in delicious, interesting games or activities, but participation required you to carefully read, write, or speak something.
Your own literacy development is due in part to your having been a part of these occurrences.
The Fifty-Nifty Literacy Activities which follow were written to "fit" into after school programs without necessarily setting up a "literacy time" to do them.
Most of them are done in association with the everyday kind of activities one thinks of when they think "out-of-school time".
They add to, supplement, or extend typical after school activities.
Some of them, however, can be done as "stand alone" activities, not connected to another activity.
Do them because you think they might be fun to try out as new choices for children and youth to make.
Mystery Boxes (placed on the sign-in counter); Who Am I or Wanted Posters (hung up in the hallways); or Shiny, Tiny, Straight and Crooked (done in the Art Room); Stone Soup (the snack for the day) are examples of activities that stand alone, don't compromise an existing program, and support kid's literacy development.
