Introduction This publication has been prepared for seafood product manufacturers.
It contains instructions on how to apply for and obtain approval of a label with a Child Nutrition (CN) label statement.
It also gives directions for calculating the contribution that seafood products make toward meeting meal pattern requirements for the Child Nutrition Programs.
These procedures supersede all other instructions, written or oral, that the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) may have given prior to publication of this revision.
Inspection Requirement The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC), Seafood Inspection Program operates voluntary inspection services.
All CN labeled seafood products must be produced under the USDC Type I Inspection options.
The Type I inspection options include: Continuous inspection, the Integrated Quality Assurance (IQA) program and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program.
The website for the Seafood Inspection Program can be found at: http://seafood.nmfs.noaa.gov/publications.htm CN Label Application Materials What to Submit Â· Â· Â· Â· NOAA Form 89-819 with specifications Product label Â­ five copies Alternate Protein Products (e.g., soy flour) documentation Samples (upon request by FNS)

Â·
When claiming bread alternate credit for battered and/or breaded products, submit the following information: a) Percentage of the whole-grain, enriched flour, meal, bran, or germ in the batter/breader b) Percentage of water or other liquid used in the batter/breader
Product Label
For sketch approval, submit a legible draft of the label as it will appear on the package.
Submit five copies.
For final approval, submit the label exactly as it will appear on the package.
Submit five copies.
The following information must be printed on the product label: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Federal inspection legend and establishment number Net weight Name and address of manufacturer or distributor Ingredient statement CN label statement which must be an integral part of the product label and must include: ! Logo ! Child Nutrition identification number (assigned by FNS) ! Statement of credit ! Authorization statement ! Approval date (the month and year the label is approved in final) The statement of credit identifies the contribution a specific portion of a seafood product makes toward the meat/meat alternate, bread/bread alternate, and/or vegetable/fruit component of the meal pattern requirements.
The following criteria apply: Â· All seafood products must provide a minimum of 0.50 ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate per serving.
Ounce equivalents should be expressed as a decimal in increments of 0.25 ounce, such as, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, etc., ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate.
To receive bread/bread alternate credit, a product serving must provide a minimum of 1/4 serving.
Larger servings must be expressed in increments of 1/4 serving of bread/bread alternate.
4
Â·
Â·
To receive vegetable/fruit credit, a product must provide a minimum of 1/8 cup serving.
Larger servings must be expressed as a fraction in increments of 1/8 cup serving.
Since only a very limited number of seafood products provide vegetable/fruit credit, the calculations and yield data for the vegetable/fruit component are not given in this publication but are available upon request from FNS.
The CN statement must accurately reflect the product.
For example: Â· Â· A product with only seafood would state "provides ___ oz equivalent meat."
A product with seafood and a meat alternate would state "provides ___ oz equivalent meat/meat alternate."
Alternate Protein Products
Alternate Protein Products (APP) may be used to meet part or all of the meat alternate component of the meal pattern requirements, provided that the APP meets requirements of USDA regulations as indicated below.
For each APP that will be credited toward the meal pattern requirements, attach a copy of the APP label to each of the specifications.
Write the manufacturer's name, product name, and identification number, and "no substitutions" on all copies of the specifications.
For each APP used, attach a letter from the APP manufacturer verifying ALL of the following criteria: a) A statement that the APP meets the requirements found in Appendix A of 7 CFR Parts 210, 220, 225, and 226 b) Show that the product has been processed so that some portion of the non-protein constituents has been removed c) Provide the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS).
The PDCAAS is required to be greater than 80% of casein.
Be prepared to show how the PDCAAS was determined d) Show that the protein level is at least 18% by weight when fully hydrated or formulated e) Provide the protein level of the APP on an "as-is" basis for the as-purchased product.
Protein is often provided on a moisture free basis "mfb" which is not the information FNS requires Additional information about APP is available from FNS.
5
Enriched Macaroni With Fortified Protein
Enriched macaroni with fortified protein, when made and used according to USDA regulations, may be used to meet part of the meat/meat alternate component.
Attach one copy of the label of each enriched macaroni with fortified protein product that will be credited toward the meal pattern requirements.
Write the manufacturer's name, product name, and identification number, and "no substitutions" on all five copies of the specifications.
Attach a copy of the approval letter from FNS for that product.
Additional information about enriched macaroni with fortified protein is available from FNS.
Samples
FNS may request a product sample as part of the review process.
If a sample is requested, FNS may delay final label approval until it receives and reviews the sample.
Label applications must pertain to products that have been made and tested in a pilot plant or on an assembly line.
Submit all label applications to:
Where to Submit
Approving Officer U. S. Dept of Commerce Seafood Inspection Program Documentation Approval and Supply Service Section P.O. Drawer 1207 Pascagoula, Mississippi 39567-1207 Or call (228) 762-1892 Procedures for Reviewing CN Labels
Queuing System
The USDC Approving Officer reviews the label application and then forwards it to FNS.
When FNS receives the application, FNS dates it and places it in a queuing system.
FNS reviews each label in turn based on the date received.
FNS will not grant exceptions to the queuing system except in extreme emergencies.
The review time in FNS will be approximately 3 weeks, however, this will vary depending on the volume of labels.
In addition, label approval for products that are complex may take longer.
After FNS approves a label, FNS returns it to the USDC Approving Officer who in turn notifies the company.
An automated data system will be used to assign a six-digit identification number to all labels.
Using this system, FNS keeps track of label approvals and provides this information to regional, State, and local Child Nutrition Program staff.
FNS will also use this data to notify manufacturers when a new regulation requires them to resubmit labels.
When a label is submitted in sketch, FNS assigns the identification number when it is received.
When a label is submitted in final without prior sketch approval, manufacturers must call FNS for an identification number before printing the label.
If a sketch approved for printing is not submitted as a final label for approval within one year, each final label application must be assigned a new identification number.
6
Identification Numbering System
Label Applications Returned
Label applications that are incorrect, illegible, or lacking appropriate information will be returned to the Approving Officer, with notations of the errors.
FNS will keep one copy of every label application submitted for review.
Label Applications Resubmitted
Labels that are resubmitted for review will be placed in the queuing system based on the date of resubmittal.
Labels should be resubmitted and receive a new six digit CN identification number when there is a/an: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· change in establishment number change in the listing of ingredients addition of quality or nutritional claim change in the product formula change in the product name change in portion size change in the CN statement change in policies, regulations, or crediting standards

How to Determine Ounce Equivalent Meat/Meat Alternate The unit of measure for the meat/meat alternate component is "ounce equivalent."
To be CN labeled, a serving of a product must provide a minimum of 0.50 ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate and credit must be expressed in 0.25 ounce increments.
Any of the following can contribute to the meat/meat alternate component of the Child Nutrition meal pattern requirements: lean meat, poultry, fish, seafood, cheese, eggs, cooked dry beans and peas, peanut butter, alternate protein product, cheese substitute, or any of these combinations.
Enriched macaroni with fortified protein may also be used to meet part of the meat/meat alternate component.
The four steps for determining the total ounces of equivalent meat/meat alternate in a serving of a product are: Step 1.
Step 2.
Determine which allowable meat/meat alternate(s) is/are used in the product being labeled.
Calculate the ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate contributed by each category.
Procedures are on the following pages.
Never round up for any of the following calculations.
If more than one allowable meat/meat alternate is used, total the ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate calculated under each category.
Round down to the nearest 0.25 ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate.
SEAFOOD CALCULATIONS 1.
Multiply the raw portion size by the percent raw seafood: oz raw portion x % raw seafood = oz raw seafood/portion 2.
Multiply the ounces of raw seafood per portion by the cooking yield in the FBG: oz raw seafood/portion x FBG cooking yield = oz equivalent meat/portion ALTERNATE PROTEIN PRODUCT CALCULATIONS 1.
Multiply the raw portion size by the percent dry APP: oz raw portion x % dry APP = oz dry APP/portion 2.
Determine the hydration factor of the APP by dividing the percent protein on an asis-basis by 18: REMINDER: The percent protein on an as-is basis must be presented in the documentation from the manufacturer, see page 5 for documentation requirements.
8
Step 3.
Step 4.
APP must be credited based on hydrating the product to an 18 percent protein level according to USDA regulations.
Percent protein of APP (as-is-basis) = hydration factor 18 3.
Multiply the ounces dry APP per portion by the hydration factor for the APP used: oz dry APP x hydration factor = oz equivalent meat alternate/portion CHEESE/CHEESE SUBSTITUTE CALCULATIONS Multiply the raw portion size by the percent cheese and/or cheese substitute to determine the ounces of cheese and/or cheese substitute per portion.
oz raw portion x % cheese/cheese substitute = oz cheese/portion or equivalent meat alternate/ portion NOTE: Items labeled as cheese product or imitation cheese are not creditable towards the meat alternate component for CN programs.
Natural hard cheeses credit 1:1, ricotta and cottage cheese credit at 50%.

How to Determine Servings of Bread/Bread Alternates The unit of measure for the bread/bread alternate component is "serving."
The product must provide a minimum of 1/4 serving, and credit must be expressed in 1/4 serving increments to state bread credit on the CN label.
A product must meet the following criteria to be counted as a bread/bread alternate in the Child Nutrition Programs: 1) The product must be served as an accompaniment to or an integral part of the main dish of the meal.
2) The product must contain a creditable grain - Whole-grain, enriched flour or meal, bran, and/or germ.
Bread items are categorized into different groups according to the amount of creditable grains typically used in each type of product.
The FCS Grains/Breads Instruction 783-1; Rev 2; Exhibit A (see pages 13 and 14 of this manual) show how the bread items are grouped.
Based on the grains/breads instruction, Â· Â· Â· Breading is in Group A (1 serving = 20g/0.7 oz) Batter (cooked or dry weight) is in Group B (1 serving = 25g/0.9 oz) 1 serving of bread/bread alternate is the amount of product to provide 14.75 grams of enriched flour/whole grain, meal, bran, or germ.
There are several acceptable ways to calculate the bread/bread alternate component using the Grains/Breads Instruction information.
Please note the components required for each different method.
METHOD 1.
Monitor the total batter/breader weight.
(For CN labeled products only) Use this calculation when the total batter/breading weight is monitored.
Note: the percent of enriched flour/whole grain/bran/germ must be greater than the total liquid (which is generally, but not always, water) in the batter/breading composite.
1.
Check to make sure that the breader and batter are each made from enriched flour/ whole grain and that the combined enriched flour/whole grain/bran/germ components are greater than the water (total liquid).
This can be confirmed by a composite listing or a calculation if the amount of creditable grain(s) and water is known.
2.
Calculations for Grains/Breads contribution: unrounded (oz of breading/ serving + oz of wet/raw batter/ serving) = serving of 0.9 ounces per serving bread alt. 11
3.
Round down to the nearest 1/4 serving of bread alternate.
METHOD 2.
Monitor the batter and breading weights separately.
1. Use this calculation if the batter and breading weights are monitored separately and each are made from enriched flour/whole grain.
(oz of dry batter/ serving) + (oz of breading/ serving) = unrounded servings of 0.9 ounces per serving 0.7 ounces per serving bread alternate per portion 2.
Round down to the nearest 1/4 serving of bread alternate.
METHOD 3.
Grams of Enriched Flour/Whole Grain per serving.
You may calculate the contribution of bread alternate by using the grams of creditable grains Â­ whole grain, enriched flour or meal, bran, and/or germ - contained in the batter/breading.
One bread alternate serving = 14.75 grams of creditable grains.
1.
Calculate the grams of creditable grains per portion for each bread component such as breading and/or dry batter.
Multiply the ounces per portion of each component by the percent creditable grains in that product and then multiply by 28.35 to convert ounces to grams Breading oz breading x % creditable grains x 28.35 = grams of creditable grains/ per portion in breading portion from breading Batter (dry) oz dry batter x % creditable grains x 28.35 = grams of creditable grains/ per portion in dry batter portion from dry batter 2.
To get the total grams of creditable grains per portion, add the grams of creditable grains from each component (breading and dry batter). grams of creditable grains/ + grams of creditable grains/ = total grams of portion from breading portion from dry batter creditable grains/portion 3.
Divide the total grams of creditable grains per portion by 14.75 grams: total grams creditable grains/portion = unrounded servings bread alternate/portion 14.75 grams 4.
Round down to the nearest 1/4 serving of bread alternate.

BREADED SHRIMP NUGGETS Meat/Meat Alternate Component: Step 1.
Step 2.
Determine which category(ies) of meat/meat alternate(s) is used in the product.
This product is made with 52% minced Shrimp and 8% Textured Soy Flour.
Calculate the ounces equivalent meat/meat alternate contributed by each category.
Minced Shrimp 1.
Determine the ounces of minced shrimp per portion by multiplying the ounces raw portion by the percent minced shrimp: oz raw portion x % minced shrimp = oz raw minced shrimp/portion (6 x 0.50) oz x 0.52 = 1.56 oz raw minced shrimp/portion 2.
Determine the ounces equivalent meat by multiplying ounces of raw minced shrimp/portion by the cooking yield in the FBG: [minced shrimp, frozen, raw Â­ 58 percent yield]
Determine the ounces of dry APP per portion by multiplying the raw portion size by the percent dry APP: 23
oz raw portion x % dry APP = oz dry APP/portion (6 x 0.50) oz x .08 = 0.24 oz dry APP/portion 2.
Determine the hydration factor of the APP. Divide the percent protein as-is-basis of the APP by 18: Percent protein of APP (as-is-basis) = hydration factor 18 50.0 = 2.77 = hydration factor 18 NOTE: The percent protein on an as-is-basis is part from the APP manufacturer(s).
See page 5 for APP USDA regulations require APP to be credited based this is why the percent protein as-is-basis is divided of the required documentation documentation criteria.
The on a level of 18 percent protein; by 18.
3.
Multiply the ounces dry APP per portion by the hydration factor for the APP used: oz dry APP x hydration factor = oz equivalent meat alternate/portion 0.24 oz x 2.77 = 0.6648 Step 3.
Total the ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate calculated under each category.
Minced Shrimp Textured Soy Flour Step 4.
0.9048 0.6648 1.5696 oz unrounded equivalent meat/meat alternate
Round down to the nearest 0.25 ounce equivalent meat/meat alternate.
This product provides 1.50 oz equivalent meat/meat alternate.
Bread/Bread Alternate Component (Batter/Breading) Method 3, which uses grams of creditable grains Â­ whole grain, enriched flour or meal, bran, and/or germ Â­ will be used to calculate the servings of bread alternate per portion.
1.
Calculate the grams of creditable grains per portion for each bread component such as breading and/or dry batter.
Multiply the ounces per portion of each component by the percent creditable grains in that product and then multiply by 28.35 to convert ounces to grams.
24
Breading oz breading x % creditable grains x 28.35 = grams of creditable grains/ per portion in breading portion from breading (6 x 0.09 oz breading) x 0.91 x 28.35 = 13.93119 grams Batter (dry) oz dry batter x % creditable grains x 28.35 = grams of creditable grains/ per portion in dry batter portion from dry batter (6 x 0.04 oz dry batter) x 0.84 x 28.35 = 5.71536 grams 2.
Add the grams of creditable grains from each component (breading and dry batter) to get the total grams of creditable grains per portion.
13.93119 grams + 5.71536 grams = 19.64655 grams/portion 3.
Divide the total grams of creditable grains per portion by 14.75 grams: total grams creditable grains/portion = servings bread alternate 14.75 grams 19.64655 grams = 1.3319 unrounded servings of bread alternate 14.75 grams 4.
Round down to the nearest 1/4 serving of bread alternate.
This product provides 11/4 servings of bread alternate.
