S TONE , DIMENSION responded, which represent 86% of the estimated tonnage.
(See table 1.)
Of the producers surveyed, 33 were reported or estimated to be idle in 1997.
In 1997, compared with 1996, stone production tonnage was about 3% higher at 1.18 million tons but value was almost 4% lower at $225 million.
Exports of dimension stone, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, increased about 11% in value to $54.8 million.
Excluding slate, for which tonnage is not fully reported, export tonnage increased about 14% to 225,000 tons, and value increased about 7% to $46.5 million.
Imports for consumption increased about 19% in value to $548 million, almost 2 Ã¯Â¿Â½ times the value of domestic production.
Legislation and Government Programs The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule for 1998 shows that during 1997, in accordance with various international agreements, effective on January 1, 1998, many U.S. import duties on dimension stone were substantially reduced.
However, the schedule's General Notes indicate that because of such agreements, imports of dimension stone from most "Most Favored Nation" countries and some others were already free of duty in 1997 and continue to be free in 1998 despite the listed "General" import duties.
(See table 2.)
Production Rough stone blocks split or cut from a quarry face are transported to processing plants, frequently located at the quarry site, at least for preliminary sizing.
Further dressing, including final sizing and finishing operations such as polishing, edging, and decorating, may also be done at the quarry site.
Of the total reported and estimated dimension stone production (i.e., stone sold or used by quarries) in the United States during 1997, by tonnage, 38% was granite, 29% was limestone, 16% was sandstone, 3% was marble, 2% was slate, and 12% was miscellaneous stone.
Of total value, granite was 49%; limestone, 23%; sandstone, 11%; marble, 4%; slate, 6%; and miscellaneous, 7%.
Production was reported in 33 States and Puerto Rico.
In descending order of tonnage, Indiana, Vermont, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Georgia, and New York were the largest dimensionstone-producing States, together contributing more than 50% of the U.S. total tonnage.
In decining order of value, Indiana, Vermont, Minnesota, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Wisconsin represented 50% of domestic production value.
(See table 3.)
Leading producing companies, according to survey responses, were, alphabetically, Cold Spring Granite Co., principally in California, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Texas; Fletcher Granite Co., Inc., in Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Indiana By Lloyd E. Antonides1 Dimension stone can be defined as any rock that has been removed from its natural place of origin for ultimate use in construction and monuments where the three dimensions of size--width, length, and thickness--together with shape and usually various other elements of appearance, such as color, grain texture and pattern, and surface finish are normal requirements.
Durability (essentially based on mineral composition and hardness, and past performance) and strength are other important selection criteria.
This is in contrast to crushed or broken stone and sand and gravel where overall particle size, general shape, and chemical composition are important factors, as well as durability, hardness, and strength, when used as construction aggregate or fill.
A variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock is used as dimension stone, but the principal rock types are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Other dimension stone normally considered special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc) and various articles fashioned from natural stone.
However, as with many of the terms used in the industry, various organizations and authors have included additional or special characteristics in their definitions and names.
In addition, terms are not always used consistently, particularly in different geographic localities, and they often differ from scientific usage.
Domestic data in this report cover rough crude quarried, irregular-shaped and rectangular blocks, as well as processed stone sold or used by quarries from their own production.
A number of terms are used to describe processing, such as worked, dressed, finished, and manufactured.
In recent years, the major share of U.S.-produced dimension stone has been construction stone.
A large portion of construction stone was for flagstones and curbing, and a somewhat smaller portion, termed building stone, was mostly for ornamental, rather than structural, applications, such as blocks, slabs, panels, veneers, and other architectural components.
Monumental stone has been the other major use and includes memorials of various kinds.
The principal producing countries for the past several years, in descending order, were China, Italy, India, Egypt, and Spain (Napoli, 1998).
In 1996, the latest year having complete data, these five countries contributed more than two-thirds of the 53 million metric tons of total world production from 37 countries.
The U.S. production was ranked 11th in the world.
Dimension stone production data for the United States are developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from a voluntary survey of U.S. quarry producers of rough and dressed dimension stone on a sold or used basis.
No adjustments are made in the data to account for the sometimes substantial losses in processing rough stone into dressed stone.
Sold or used data are considered to be equivalent to production because changes in stocks are not surveyed.
Of the 273 producing dimension stone operations included in the survey for 1997, 209 or 77% 1 Deceased.
STONE, DIMENSION--1997 74.1 Limestone Co., Inc. in Indiana; Victor Oolitic Stone Co. in Indiana; Rock of Ages Corp. in Georgia, New Hampshire, and Vermont; Valders Stone and Marble Inc. in Wisconsin; and Williams Stone Co. in Massachusetts.
Those 7 companies together produce more than one-third of U.S. total production in tonnage and value, and together with another 7 companies , the 14 leading companies produce more than one-half the domestic tonnage and value.
Granite.--Dimension granite includes all visibly coarsegrained igneous and some similiar metamorphic rocks.
Finergrained igneous rock is termed traprock and is not normally included.
Granite production in 1997 had a value of $110 million that was comparable with 1996 levels, but the quantity of 444,000 tons was 11% lower.
Granite was produced by 38 companies at 73 quarries in 1997, compared with 39 companies at 74 quarries in 1996.
Cold Spring Granite, Fletcher Granite, and Rock of Ages were the leading producers and accounted for more than one-half of U.S. production in tonnage and value.
As in 1996, 18 States had operating quarries.
Massachusetts was the leading producing State, producing almost one-fourth of the tonnage and more than 17% of the value of the U.S. total.
Georgia, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Vermont were the other largest producers in tonnage or value in 1997.
(See table 4.)
Limestone.--Dimension limestone, composed mainly of calcite, includes dolomitic and siliceous limestones.
The term also includes travertine (a crystalline, layered variety) and other porous and clastic-granular types of calcareous rock.
Varieties that can be polished are optionally classified as marble by many producers and users.
Production in 1997 of 345,000 tons was comparable to that of 1996, but value decreased 9% to $52.3 million.
In 1997, limestone was produced by 25 companies from 29 quarries, versus 29 and 39, respectively, in 1996.
The major companies were Buechel Stone Corporation, B.G. Hoadley Quarries Inc., Indiana Limestone Co. Inc., Victor Oolitic Stone Co., and Valders Stone and Marble Inc., which together produced about one-half the total U.S. tonnage and value.
Quarries were operated in 10 States in 1997, down from 12 in 1996.
Indiana, again the leading State, produced 55% of the U.S. tonnage and 48% of the value, followed by Wisconsin with 26% and 20%, respectively.
Kansas and Texas were other large producers.
(See table 5.)
Marble.--Marble covers a variety of calcareous rocks in addition to those with the primary metamorphic crystalline carbonate composition and includes serpentine (a greenish hydrated magnesium silicate commonly veined with calcareous material), all of which must be capable of taking a polish.
For 1997, production was 40,800 tons with a value of $10.2 million, which, as compared with 1996, is a 46% tonnage increase but a 49% decrease in value.
Six producing companies operated eight quarries versus six companies and twelve quarries in 1996.
Vermont Quarries Co. was the largest producer, followed by Tennessee Marble Co. and Georgia Marble Co.
Five States and Puerto Rico produced marble in 1997.
Additional company and State data are withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary information.
Sandstone.--Dimension sandstone includes calcareous- and siliceous-cemented sandstones, conglomerates (rounded pebbles and cobbles cemented in a matrix of sand), or breccia (cemented angular particles), as well as siltstone (fine quartz and clay particles).
Quartzite, also included, may be described as any metamorphosed siliceous-cemented sandstone that fractures conchoidally through the grains.
In 1997, the total U.S. production of sandstone increased in tonnage by 24% from 1996 levels to 187,000 tons and increased in value by 19% to $24 million.
These figures are based on dimension sandstone production by 31 companies at 33 quarries, compared with 26 companies at 47 quarries in 1996.
The producers that together contributed about one-half the U.S. total tonnage and value were Blaser Corp., Finger Lakes Stone Co., Herb Kilmer and Sons, Johnston 
As in 1996, 15 States continued to have operating quarries.
The leading producing State was New York, providing 27% of the tonnage and 32% of the value.
Arizona, Ohio, and Pennsylvania were the other largest producers in tonnage and value.
(See table 6.)
Slate.--Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock derived from shale or siltstone that readily breaks or splits into thin layers along micaceous surfaces parallel to bedding planes and is composed mostly of quartz, chlorite, mica, and clay minerals.
In 1997 production of 25,000 tons was practically the same as in 1996, but the approximately $14 million value was 18% lower.
The survey is based on 14 companies operating 18 quarries versus 15 companies and 19 quarries in 1996.
The leading companies, together producing roughly two-thirds of the total tonnage and value, were Anthony Dally 
Six States had production.
Additional data are withheld to avoid disclosing company propriety information.
Consumption Apparent consumption of dimension stone is calculated as production plus imports for consumption less exports, because no separate accounting of changes in industry stocks is available.
Since only value data are available for all three components, on that basis apparent consumption in 1997 was $718 million.
Reported and estimated data for 1997 on quantity of material sold or used by producers, including exports, indicates rough stone represented 55% of the total U.S. tonnage and 41% of the value.
The largest uses for tonnage of rough stone were in construction (47%) and monumental (20%).
Dressed stone represented 45% by tonnage and 59% by value of the total stone sold or used.
By tonnage, the largest uses of dressed stone were in flagging (25%), curbing (23%), and ashlars and partially squared pieces (22%).
(See table 7.)
Primary uses of granite sold or used in 1997, by tonnage, were in monumental applications (rough stone, 27%, and dressed stone 7%), curbing 28%, and rough blocks for construction 17%.
Primary uses of limestone, by weight, were in rough blocks for building and construction (58%), and dressed stone ashlars and partially squared pieces (14%).
Publishable data on uses of marble are limited to avoid disclosing company confidential information.
Primary uses of sandstone, by weight, were in dressed stone for flagging (57%) and dressed stone for ashlars and partially squared pieces (18%).
Dimension slate sold or used by 74.2 STONE, DIMENSION--1997 producers in the United States in 1997 was principally for roofing (44%), by weight.
(See tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.)
Prices The average 1997 value for dimension stone of $191 per ton, based on the USGS survey, was a decrease of almost 6% from that of 1996.
However, price data that are available show considerable variation.
Prices are substantially different, not only for the kind of stone, but also for appearance of the same kind of stone.
Color, grain structure, and finish contribute significantly to price and marketability.
Foreign Trade Exports.--Total exports of dimension stone types included in table 13 increased in value by about 11% from that of 1996 to $55 million; 64% of that total was for granite.
The largest share of granite (35%) went to Italy.
(See table 13.)
Imports.--The value of imports for consumption of dimension stone types covered in tables 14, 15, and 16 increased about 19% from 1996 to $548 million.
Italy continued to be the major single source of granite with 43% of total granite imports listed.
Brazil, Canada, and India each accounted for about 14% of granite imports.
Italy is also a significant source of a number of other dimension stone imports.
(See tables 14 - 16.)
Outlook Demand is expected to grow for dimension stone during the next 5 or more years because of improved technology and variety and the increased costs of alternate construction materials.
Additionally, for residential and office building construction, growth in use of dimension stone is expected in new prestige markets as well as in renovations to attract and keep tenants.
