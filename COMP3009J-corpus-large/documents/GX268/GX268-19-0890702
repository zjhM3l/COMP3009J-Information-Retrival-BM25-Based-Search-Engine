Bullying Prevention Program I. Overview Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) Secretary Jane Perlov is committed to ensuring that children are provided with a safe and violence-free school environment.
Secretary Perlov, as Chairperson of the Governor's Council on Youth Violence, is supporting a variety of prevention and emergency response initiatives.
Secretary Perlov has designated $1 million of federal Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Formula Grant Program (Byrne Program) funds for school violence prevention.
The Byrne Program, authorized by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, is a grant program originating from the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance.
The Byrne Program provides leadership and assistance to reduce and prevent crime, violence, and drug abuse.
One school violence prevention method that EOPS is pursuing is the Bullying Prevention Program (BPP).
The BPP is a comprehensive, school-wide effort that is designed to reduce bully/victim problems among primary and secondary school children.
It aims to increase knowledge and awareness of the problem, to achieve active involvement on the part of teachers and parents, to develop clear rules against bullying behavior, and to provide support and protection for the victims of bullying.
Interventions are implemented at the school-wide level, at the classroom level, and with individual students.
Thus, the BPP is not a typical curricular approach to violence prevention.
The interventions are designed to help change the norms within a school environment.
The BPP has been successfully implemented in a variety of cultures and school contexts.
After thorough program evaluations, the BPP has revealed reductions in bullying behavior of up to 50 percent or more.
The BPP has shown to result in: Â· Â· Â· A substantial reduction in boys' and girls' reports of bullying and victimization, A significant reduction in students' reports of general anti-social behavior such as: vandalism, fighting, theft, and truancy, and Significant improvements in the "social climate" of the class, as reflected in students' reports of improved order and discipline, more positive social relationships, and a more positive attitude toward schoolwork and school.
This innovative approach to school safety is now being offered by EOPS for implementation in the 2000-2001 school year.
The EOPS-sponsored BPP will be geared specifically toward elementary schools only.
Applicants must agree to a two-year commitment.
The anticipated timeline consists of providing the BPP training in the Fall of 2000 and program implementation in the Spring of 2001.
Interested communities must complete the attached application for funding consideration.
The EOPS Programs Division will be subcontracting for training and technical assistance services for the grantees.
This Technical Assistance Coordinator will maintain regular contact with each grantee.
2
The Governor's Council on Youth Violence, chaired by Public Safety Secretary, Jane Perlov, will review all submitted applications and select ten sites based on a competitive application process for the implementation of the BPP.
A site shall consist of one elementary school (i.e., grades K through 6) within a school district.
In addition, a school district may submit only one application.
Ten schools will be funded, and each selected site will be allocated a total of $100,000 over a two-year period with a 25% required match each year ($50,000 in federal funds per year, with a $17,000 local hard cash match each year).
II.
Core Program Elements A. General Prerequisites: Awareness and Involvement Two general conditions are crucial in realizing the goals of the Bullying Prevention Program: 1.
That the adults at school and, to some degree, at home, become actively involved in assessing the extent of bully/victim problems in their own school.
2.
That the adults commit themselves, with a high degree of seriousness, to changing the culture/environment within the school to eliminate existing bully/victim problems and prevent the development of new problems.
B. Program Requirements by Levels of Commitment 1.
School Level a.

b. Formation of a Bullying Prevention Coordinating Committee at each school that will be comprised of eight-to-ten members who will have an on-going commitment to plan the implementation of the program.
The Committee should meet bi-monthly and be willing/able to make a two-year commitment to the project.
Committee members should include the following: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· representatives of the school faculty (including a school administrator, a teacher representing each grade [or every few grades], a guidance counselor and/or school-based mental health professional), a representative from the non-professional staff (e.g. food services worker, janitor, bus driver, etc.), a student representative, a parent representative, and a community representative (e.g. a school resource officer, DARE, or juvenile officer; a community religious leader; a representative of youth sports/recreation services; etc.).

c. Members of the Coordinating Committee from each school will attend a mandatory one-to-two days of training sponsored by the EOPS Programs Division.
d.
One person from each school's Coordinating Committee will be required to spend approximately 15-20% of his/her time for overall BPP administration and act as a single point of contact to the EOPS-subcontracted technical assistance personnel.

This will be achieved by administering an anonymous questionnaire (provided by EOPS) to all students, in grade three and above, at the beginning of both project years.
Schools should propose means of gathering information from younger students (e.g., focus groups or guided discussions).
Each school will be expected to provide a staff member to enter and analyze data obtained from the surveys/questionnaires.
EOPS will also provide the accompanying computer program (to be used with Windows 95 or 98) for evaluating the questionnaire results.
