Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY "The need to coordinate efforts among state, local, and private criminal justice entities remains a priority for the EOPS Programs Division.
To meet this need the EOPS Programs Division continuously makes every possible effort to ... consider a variety of complex problems that fall with in the twenty-eight legislatively authorized purpose areas that govern the Byrne Formula Grant Program."
I.Executive Summary A Centralized Grant Resource for Massachusetts In 1987, the Massachusetts Committee on Criminal Justice (MCCJ), now known as the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) Programs Division, was charged with the responsibility of administering the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program (Byrne).
While the Byrne Program is the largest federal grant that the EOPS Programs Division conducts, there are several additional state and federal criminal justice grants administered by this office.
These grant programs are centralized under this one agency in order to provide a more unified and coordinated approach to the criminal justice needs of the Commonwealth.
State funded grants actively overseen by the EOPS Programs Division during the FFY2000 reporting period of July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001, include: the Community Policing Grant Program, the Bullet Proof Vest Reimbursement Program, the Fire Fighter Safety Equipment Grant Program, and the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit Program.
During the FFY2000 program period, there were ten other initiatives overseen by this office.
They include: the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) Formula Grant Program, the JJDPA Title V and Challenge Programs, the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant (JAIBG) Program, the S.T.O.P.
Violence Against Women Grant Program (VAWA), the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) Program, the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP), the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) Program, the Federal Bulletproof Vest Reimbursement Program, and the Watch Your Car Program.
Statistical Analysis Center For purposes of determining the success of all identified Byrne subgrant programs, as well as other federal and state efforts, the Massachusetts Statistical Analysis Center (the SAC) is an integral part of the Programs Division's ability to measure progress for each grant program.
The SAC is organizationally located within the EOPS Programs Division and is fully staffed with individuals possessing expertise in research and development.
A major role of the SAC is to provide Byrne Subgrantees with technical assistance for the evaluation of their projects.
For example, statewide initiatives, such the Cops and Kids Program and the Multi-jurisdictional Counter Crime Task Force Program, are monitored throughout the funding period and evaluated by the SAC to determine programmatic effectiveness.
Some of the specific activities that were conducted by the SAC during FFY2000 to assist the Massachusetts Byrne Formula Grant Program included: the preparation of survey tools, on-site assessment, collection and compilation of extensive data for the development of the Massachusetts Statewide Strategy Update for the Byrne Program, and the revision of the Annual Reporting Forms and the accompanying instructions for the accuracy and completion of this report.
The SAC is also instrumental in assisting Byrne Subgrantees on the development, implementation and completion of their individual evaluation plans.
Members of the SAC are also available to consult with EOPS Programs Division staff to establish the most efficient and accurate methods of demonstrating project accomplishments for both state and federal initiatives.
Innovative Programing During the FFY2000 reporting period several new and innovative programs while several continuation projects were expanded or enhanced.
All of justice needs throughout the Commonwealth.
In FY1993, the Community Massachusetts.
This practice of policing has been embraced throughout 6 under the Byrne Program commenced which responded to specific criminal Policing philosophy was introduced in the Commonwealth and the positive 2000 Annual Report Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY impact that the police departments have achieved has been endorsed by the State Legislature with its decision to continue this effort year after year.
Once again the legislature has refunded Community Policing by appropriating over $21 million for state fiscal year 2001 to continue the positive spread of the Community Policing philosophy throughout Massachusetts.
Several new projects were awarded in FFY2000 with Byrne Formula Grant funds.
Those included the Attorney General's Life Skills Program, the Attorney General's Drugs, Gangs, Organized Crime Task Force, the Essex County Sheriff's Department's Women's Pre-Release Center, the Department of Youth Services (DYS) Teen Substance Abuse Program, the Parole Board's two Reintegration Projects for Male and Females, the city of Lynn's Life Skills Program, city of Springfield's Life Skills Program, the MA District Attorney's Association's Partnership for Person's with Disabilities, the Norfolk County SMART Program, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's Grief Counseling and Center of Innovation, the Plymouth County District Attorney's Family Assistance Liaison Program, the North Suffolk Response Team, the MBTA's Explosive Devices Detection Program, the Bristol County Sheriff's Mobile Warrant Management Program, the University of MA at Lowell Police Warrant Management Training Program, six Bullying Prevention Programs, and the Lowell Police Department's Leadership Institute.
The impact of these innovative projects, as well as existing projects' accomplishments are highlighted throughout this report.
As concern regarding potential acts of terrorism in this country increases, several new and continuation Byrne funded programs were validated, in some cases enhanced while their efforts took on greater importance in light of the recent catastrophic incidents.
Most of the project activities revolved around appropriate training for potential attacks, bomb detection and dteonation equipment, K-9 Units, the accessibility of Emergency Responders, etc.
Another crucial component during an instance of a terrorist attack is immediate assistance in many forms as well as available grief counseling services for victims, witnesses, families, and other loved ones.
Massachusetts is prepared to respond to the potential of terrorist attacks with initiatives that maintain the ability to provide the appropriate services if and when these instances occur.
Increasing Criminal Justice Coordination and Collaboration The need to coordinate efforts among state, local, and private criminal justice entities remains a priority for the EOPS Programs Division.
To meet this need, the EOPS Programs Division continuously makes every possible effort to respond to not only the most obvious gaps and resource needs facing the criminal justice system in Massachusetts, but to also consider a variety of complex problems that fall with in the twenty-eight legislatively authorized purpose areas that govern the Byrne Formula Grant Program.
Funding from the Byrne Program enables the Commonwealth to continue its commitment to supporting new and continuation programs that focus on the prevention of violence in so many venues, substance abuse treatment, offender reintegration services to curtail recidivism, the improvement of law enforcement capabilities, up-to-date technology advancements for the justice system, and many other projects that promote the protection of its population.
In FFY2000, Byrne programs encompassed 11 of the 28 purpose areas set forth by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
The page number where a detailed description of each individual program and their achievements can be found are located in Section V of this report.
While responding to project goals, programs funded in FFY2000 continued to reflect successful collaborations Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 8 EXECUTIVE S UMMARY between state and local agencies, as well as community-based organizations.
Project accomplishments, that were proposed within the FFY1999 Statewide Strategy and Three-Year Plan are highlighted in the individualized program descriptions in Section V. Successful Initiatives The information that follows describes several program initiatives that have improved the criminal justice system in Massachusetts and have contributed to the enhancement of public safety and the quality of life for all citizens of the Commonwealth.
COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT Ã¯Â¿Â½ As a subcontractor of the Brockton Safe Neighborhood Initiative (SNI), the MASS Jobs Training Program provides services to residents from the SNI neighborhood including academic and vocational counseling, life skills training and employment assistance.
Recruitment was an on-going process and Massjobs provided job readiness training, job search, job development, and job placement to over 83 individuals throughout the project period.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Since commencement of the Youth Empowerment Services (YES) Project in Dorchester, Massachusetts, over 80 volunteers from the Attorney General's Office have participated in the program.
In total, 20 volunteers from the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office contributed over 450 hours as tutors, mentors, and trainers.
PARTNERSHIPS Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Dorchester Health Collaborative, working in conjunction with the Boston Police Department District C-11, have succeeded in reducing juvenile criminal behavior and other risks, particularly for truant youth by facilitating their return to school.
The police officers coordinated with school officials and, combined with home visits, have raised the level of parental involvement in the lives of truant youth.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The city of Lynn's School Department worked in conjunction with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's Blueprint Program to provide lifeskills training to 450 sixth graders throughout the city.
Members of a regional drug task force confiscated 2,000 ecstasy pills, $30,000 in cash, three guns, and two vehicles on August 9, 2001.
This was a significant drug arrest for Worcester County and was conducted by the members of the Regional Drug Task Force for the Middle District of Eastern Worcester County.
The Joint Boston Drug Task Force seized approximately 36 kilos of cocaine, from an established cocaine trafficking organization that maintained ties overseas.
The two top figures in this organization have been indicted in Boston Federal Court for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and money laundering.
Further, the Brookline DEA Task Force concluded a major heroin distribution investigation in the South Boston, Worcester, and Roxbury areas.
Nineteen subjects have been arrested so far and are facing federal heroin distribution charges.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Regional Drug and Counter Crime Task Force for the Middle District Eastern Worcester County was 2000 Annual Report Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 9 EXECUTIVE S UMMARY able to purchase a 5X10 enclosed utility trailer that is being outfitted as a Regional Crime Scene Services resource.
This trailer allows the formation of a regional crime scene team to handle major cases within the Task Force's jurisdiction.
This Task Force conducted a detailed drug sweep and was successful in seizing 100 hits of LSD, 30 grams of crack, and 1,100 bags of heroin during one reporting period.
ELDERLY CITIZENS AND PERSONS WITH DISABLITIES Ã¯Â¿Â½ In December of 2000, participants of the Newburyport Youthful Diversion Program provided a lead clean-up service for elderly members of the Newburyport community.
These youth worked with members of the Newburyport Council on Aging to create a list of elderly residents who were incapable of performing manual labor and were in need of help around their homes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Made possible with the Byrne Formula Grant funding, training curricula was developed to target law enforcement officers, civil investigators, assistant district attorneys, victim witness advocates, and others who are providing services to disabled persons who have been abused or are in danger of such an occurrence.
The Massachusetts District Attorneys' Association, in collaboration with the Disabled Persons Protection Commission, has provided training to approximately 1,700 individuals who work with this population.
DOMESTIC AND FAMILY VIOLENCE Ã¯Â¿Â½ The training program for the SAFEPLAN effort continued and took shape in many forms.
Regionally, SAFEPLAN advocates participated in the 40-hour training facilitated by the SAFEPLAN Regional Coordinator (SRC).
The SRC also provided additional training for advocates beyond the initial training in areas of advocacy surrounding domestic violence probate issues, working with gay and lesbian victims, transitional assistance for victims of domestic violence, and pro bono legal services for victims.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Trauma Intervention Program (TIP) in Methuen reports that since the receipt of the Byrne Grant Funds, the number of calls for emergency response has continued to increase by over 300%.
This is largely attributed to the enhanced exposure of the program from community activities such as: critical incident debriefings, training programs, and the Emotional First-Aid Course.
YOUTH Ã¯Â¿Â½ The FLASHPOINT: Life Skills through the Lens of Media Literacy Program, under the direction of the Essex County District Attorney's Office, has developed a unique curriculum for the prevention of negative behaviors such as violence and substance abuse among adolescents.
This curriculum uses commercial media, which is often cited as a cause of negative behavior, to build critical thinking and social skills among its participants.
This program has been recognized nationally and invited to conduct workshops at many criminal justice-orientedconferences.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ During the second year of operation, the Springfield Lifeskills Training Program reported an additional 22 teachers taught the Lifeskills Training Curriculum that was designed by Dr. Gilbert Butvia and is touted as a Blueprint Program by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A workshop entitled "Recognizing and Responding to Teen Dating Violence" was presented to 15 staff 2000 Annual Report Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 10 EXECUTIVE S UMMARY members at the Paul R. McGlaughlin Youth Center, site of the Youth Empowering Skills (YES) Program.
This presentation discussed the dynamics of domestic violence among teenagers, in addition to resources that are available to them if they are involved in such an incident.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ During its second year of funding for the Students Civil Rights Team Project, additional high schools were recruited during the spring and summer school vacations to form student civil rights teams.
Teams included 2-4 students from each high school grade, and were selected to cite the greatest possible diversity in a composition.
Faculty and community advisors provided adult supervision and assistance.
A subcontracted initiative, under the Dorchester Health Collaborative, entitled the "After-School Literacy and Homework Program," provided a structured environment where children ages 6-16 can complete their homework and enhance their literacy and social skills.
At the same time, parents are given assurance that their children are involved in safe and productive after-school activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ ANTI-TERRORISM AND FIRST RESPONDER Ã¯Â¿Â½ Specialized training was delivered to the law enforcement officials in the Barnstable County area by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency's (MEMA) Terrorist Incident Preparedness Training Program.
One of the intended outcomes was to ensure that the participants were able to assess their own department's readiness to respond to a terrorist incident, identify strengths and weaknesses within their organizations, and list actions such as: training, resources, and equipment needed to achieve full emergency readiness.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ During the past year, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Police Department has provided anti-terrorism training for each member of the MBTA Police, Massachusetts State Police, the Boston Police Department, the Boston Fire Department, the Boston EMS, the National Guard, and other related federal, state, and local agencies.
The Hazardous Devices Anti-Terrorist Preparedness Program, in conjunction with the Office of the State Fire Marshal, continues to provide sufficient resources for necessary training and safety equipment for the nine Certified Bomb Technicians.
With this training and equipment, these individuals are able to safely and effectively respond to bomb related calls for service throughout the Commonwealth.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ CULTURAL DIVERSITY Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor's Task Force on Hate Crimes was responsible for the creation of a State Police Investigative Team that lead investigations into potential hate crimes occurring throughout the Commonwealth.
The team, consisting of 18 State Troopers, was assigned to District Attorneys' Offices throughout the State, and each has attended 10 hours of specialized hate crimes training.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR OFFENDERS Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Dorchester Youth Collaborative, a subgrantee of the Dorchester Health Collaborative, continues to provide outreach to and services for engaging many of the community's most at-risk youth.
This past year, the program has successfully recruited 300 youth away from area drug gangs and took them into the Center's safe haven during the hours of 2:00PM-9:00 PM.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Drug and Alcohol Diversion Program at the Essex County Sheriff's Department has demonstrated 2000 Annual Report Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 11 EXECUTIVE S UMMARY advancement over the past year.
Increased staff has made it possible to create a multi-phased treatment approach and to begin working with the offender in the post-incarceration phase of an offender's sentence.
Since the model's inception, group and individual sessions in substance abuse and anger management increased 22%.
Additionally, the program was able to develop reintegration plans for all inmates leaving the department's custody.
The development of internal and external linkages with communitybased agencies in regards to aftercare has increased placement referral to over 7%.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Cold Case Unit at the Massachusetts State Police investigates old and closed homicide cases that were discarded due to time constraints, insufficient technology, and no leads.
Over the past year, approximately 15 unsolved homicide investigations began.
Updated technology enables this Unit to reopen old, unsolved cases with a better chance for success.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ To facilitate the Commonwealth's transition toward fingerprint-based supported records, the EOPS Programs Division awarded live-scan devices and necessary software enhancements to eligible Sheriff's Departments using the FY2000 Byrne 5% set-aside funds.
Sheriffs' departments supplied with this electronic fingerprinting system now have the capability to electronically forward ten-print fingerprint cards to the state's Store and Forward System.
The Massachusetts State Police Troop E provides patrol for the 135-mile long Massachusetts Turnpike which spans Massachusetts from West Stockbridge on the New York border to Interstate 93 in downtown Boston.
It is anticipated that Troop E will be provided with a live-scan device.
The EOPS Programs Division has also devised plans to award the MSP Identification Section funds to procure and distribute the electronic fingerprinting equipment.
The EOPS Programs $83,000 for software sole source electronic through the Store and Division awarded the Massachusetts State Police State Identification Section (SIS) modifications relating to the workflow of fingerprint processing to accommodate submission of criminal and applicant cards to the SIS as well as to the FBI Forward System Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION "The Massachusetts FFY2000 Strategy Update, which guided the dissemination of funds under the Byrne Formula Grant, continued to focus on five priority areas: Prevention and Violence Reduction, Anti-Terrorism, Substance Abuse Treatment, Law Enforcement, and the Improvement of Technology for the Criminal Justice System."

III.Program Coordination The EOPS Programs Division worked in collaboration with a wide range of criminal justice agencies, private organizations, citizens groups, community leaders, and elected officials to facilitate the coordination of program activities.
All groups communicated their concerns about crime and the criminal justice system.
They identified common problems and issues.
In essence, the Statewide Byrne Strategy was a coordinated and collaborative effort, drawing on the concerns expressed by these diverse groups to set funding priorities for the fiscal year.
Fostering Collaboration and Program Coordination The EOPS Programs Division engaged in numerous additional activities designed to foster multi-agency collaboration and program coordination.
For example, reintegration programs for males and females on parole began during this funding period and its direction is consistent with the priority goals set forth by the Byrne Program and other Department of Justice initiatives.
These two programs were mutually planned and developed and drew together various professionals with expertise from public and private agencies.
EOPS Programs Division staff chaired or participated in the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Criminal Records Improvement Task Force Firearms Violence Control Task Force Massachusetts Violence Prevention Network Community Coordinating Committee State Executive Steering Committee Juvenile Police Officers' Association Massachusetts Chiefs' of Police Association National Coalition of Juvenile Justice Specialists The Governor's Commission of the Prevention of School Violence The Governor's Task Force on Hate Crimes The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services: Mass Call The Massachusetts Summit Task Force The Governor's Commission on Domestic Violence The Governor's Commission on Domestic Violence Research and Evaluation Subcommittee The Governor's Commission on Domestic Violence Uniform Enforcement Subcommittee 16 In addition, the EOPS Programs Division fostered coordination and collaboration between multiple agencies through advisory review boards and special interest groups.
These collaborations brought together experts from public and private agencies to provide periodic feedback and guidance to program personnel.
The EOPS Programs Division participated in coordinating the following statewide initiatives that were similiar to Byrne Formula Grant funding efforts : Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.)
Advisory Board The Governor's Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee Community Policing Advisory Review Board Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 17 PROGRAM COORDINATION The EOPS Programs Division participated in coordinating the following efforts that linked FFY2000 Byrne Formula Grant funding to statewide initiatives: LAW ENFORCEMENT The Cold Case Task Force This Task Force assisted the State Police Detective Units and local police in the investigation of unsolved murders in which their manpower and caseload did not allow them to commit the many hours that these long-range investigations required.
The North Suffolk Crisis Response Team Developed policies regarding incidents that would require a crisis team to respond.
The team was also properly trained and equipped specific to this task.
FEMALE OFFENDERS The Halfway House for Women Program The Women in Transition facility provides for the care, custody, and security for sentenced female inmates of Essex County while simultaneously preparing them for reintegration into society.
STATE POLICE The Anti-Terrorist Preparedness Program Activities set forth by this project have enabled the capability to procure necessary equipment, provide safe storage of hazardous materials, to transport and dispose explosives, volatile chemicals, pyrotechnics and military or ordinances, conduct effective bomb related crime scene investigations, collect and preserve evidence, train and certify personnel in explosive and terrorist related skills, and provide public awareness and training to other public and private venues.
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS DIVISION Electronic Fingerprinting The Programs Division worked in conjunction with Sheriffs' Departments in order to facilitate the Commonwealth's transition toward fingerprint-based supported records by awarding live-scan devices and necessary software enhancements to eligible Sheriffs' Departments.
Departments were supplied with electronic fingerprinting systems that provided the capability to electronically forward ten-print fingerprint cards to the state's Store and Forward System.
The Student Civil Rights Team In conjunction with priorities set forth by the Executive Office of Public Safety, the Byrne Grant has made it possible to re-launch "stopthehate.org" web site (www.stopthehate.org ).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EVALUATION PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EVALUATION PLAN AND ACTIVITIES AND ACTIVITIES IV.
Evaluation Plan 
With regard to the Byrne Program, major evaluation activities include the creation of tools to retrieve programmatic data, the review of such tools to determine project development, and the oversight of impact studies that measure project success in meeting stated goals and objectives.
20 In addition to the existing monitoring and process evaluation methods employed by the EOPS Programs Division, several subgrantees have implemented more rigorous data collection and evaluation practices designed to measure the efficacy of their specific programs.
Individual programs assume the cost for these studies in many ways.
Certain grantees solicited alternate funding to support an evaluation study.
Others include a budget item in the Byrne Subgrant Application or commit matching funds to perform this work, and some provide these services by utilizing research staff already located within the subgrantee's agency.
The findings and status of these evaluations are described below.
Increasing supervision of children at school; Rewarding children for good social behaviors; Holding school-wide assemblies on violence; and Making use of videos, books, and other resources on bullying.
Appendix A provides detailed information regarding the BPP, as well as preliminary process evaluation findings.
Life Skills Violence Prevention Springfield Public Schools The Life Skills Violence Prevention curriculum aims to decrease risk factors for drug use and violent behavior by enhancing personal and social competence and other protective factors among all sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students in the Springfield Public School system.
Students in grades six through eight received the Life Skills Violence Prevention Curriculum for the past two academic years.
During FFY2001, students in the sixth grade received the 15-session curriculum, while students in the seventh and eighth grade received the 10 and 5-session curriculum, respectively.
On June 21 and 22, 2001, 35 new staff in the middle schools received 10 hours of Life Skills training by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence.
In August 2001, the Center also provided an additional 10 hours of technical assistance for the Director of the Life Skills project and the five middle school coordinators, to assist with planning and implementing the program for an additional 2,000 students (eight graders).
Teachers reported that 92% of the sixth grade students participated in the lessons and that positive changes occurred in seventh grade students' behaviors and attitudes.
Massachusetts State Police Anti-Terrorist Preparedness The Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad Unit responds to hazardous situations in the 14 counties in the Commonwealth.
The Unit provides safe storage, transportation, and disposal of explosives, volatile chemicals, pyrotechnics, and military ordinances; conducts effective bomb-related crime scene investigations; collects and preserves evidence; trains and certifies personnel in explosive and terrorist-related skills; and provides seminars to enhance public awareness and training.
Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 21 EVALUATION P LAN AND ACTIVITIES As indicated by Table 1, during FY2001, the Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad responded to a total of 448 incidents.
The Bomb Squad conducted 40 instructional seminars with over 1,800 people in attendance.
To enhance law enforcement and fire departments' response to possible hazardous device scenes, a 71-page operational guideline was developed.
The guideline addresses such issues as selection of a bomb technician, certification retention, bomb threat incidents, building threats, vehicle searches, and general on-scene operation procedures.
The Unit also provides educational programs for local communities and schools, such as "Explosive Recognition and Bomb Threat Protocols," for academic and corporate environments, and "The Dangers of Fireworks," for elementary school children, which included a live demonstration of a fireworks detonation attached to a plywood hand.
For public facilities, including schools, the "Site Assessment Survey" was offered.
This survey includes the identification of potential targets or weak points within the facility and its security protocols.

The Building Partnerships for the Protection of Persons with Disabilities project is an initiative spearheaded by the Massachusetts District Attorney's Association in collaboration with law enforcement, social service agencies, and the DPPC to combat abuse and crimes committed against persons with disabilities.
The informational training activities implemented through the Building Partnerships initiative has resulted in an increase in the number of reports made to the DPPC Hotline, the number of reports investigated by law enforcement and the number of criminal complaints filed.
In FY2001, there was a 10 percent increase in hotline reports to the DPPC from the previous year, and a 25 percent increase from FY1999.
In FY2001, 460 cases were referred to law enforcement for criminal investigation; a 43 percent rise from FY2000, resulting in 70 criminal charges filed.

Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 23 EVALUATION P LAN AND ACTIVITIES Governor's Task Force on Hate Crimes Statewide Initiative The Governor's Task Force on Hate Crimes Statewide Initiative is a multifaceted program, which offers training and technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, schools, and communities in the areas of hate crime, harassment, and civil rights.
The Task Force's mission is to prevent hate crimes and improve responses through awareness and education.
The Governor's Task Force on Hate Crimes offered training events for law enforcement, community members, and school personnel, and collaborated with the Massachusetts State Police to create the first of its kind State Police Civil Rights Investigative Unit.
In November 2000, members of the unit received eight hours of specialized hate crime investigative training from the Department of Justice.
A hate crimes workshop was provided for community members and stakeholders at a Massachusetts Neighborhood Crime Watch Commission training and at the annual Massachusetts D.A.R.E. conference.
Additionally, the Task Force collaborated with the Anti-Defamation League on their hate crimes response card promotion which is designed to educate law enforcement officers about hate crimes.
Over 11,000 cards were distributed statewide.
Also, the Student Civil Rights Director engaged in extensive outreach to school administrators, at-risk students and student groups, visiting 55 schools to provide support in dealing with diversity and hate issues.
The 4th Annual "Stop the Hate" week was proclaimed for April 20 - April 27, 2001.
A number of events were held that included the Terezin Chamber Music Foundation providing a lunchtime concert in the Statehouse featuring musical works which were first created in the concentration camps during the Holocaust.
On Yom HashoahNational Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Task Force participated in a State House event recognizing the events of the Armenian Genocide.
Importantly, the Task Force sponsored a community forum at Springfield Central High School in Springfield, Massachusetts, which featured Mark Potok from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Other honored guests and sponsors included the Jewish federation of Greater Springfield, the NAACP of Springfield, and the Interfaith Alliance.
During the second half of FFY2001, The Task Force contracted a web design service to redesign, update, and relaunch the stopthehate.org web site.
The web site was expanded to include comprehensive resources to assist law enforcement officers, school personnel, students, and community members in their efforts to eradicate hate and hate crimes.
The site also contains areas for discussion and exchanging ideas, as well as online hate crimes training tutorials which enable visitors to customize their training needs.
The relaunch of the site has led to positive increases in usage; in June 2001, there was a 75 percent increase in site visits over June 2000.
In February 2001 (prior to relaunch), almost 70 percent of users viewed less than three pages of the site before leaving.
In June 2001, (after relaunch) approximately 70 percent of users viewed more than three pages, with 26 percent of users viewing between 10 and 14 pages.

Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROGRAM SUMMARIES EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROGRAM SUMMARIES "The need to coordinate efforts among state, local, and private criminal justice entities remains a priority for the EOPS Programs Division.
To meet this need the EOPS Programs Division continuously makes every possible effort to ... consider a variety of complex problems that fall with in the twenty-eight legislatively authorized purpose areas that govern the Byrne Formula Grant Program."
V. Program Summaries 30 Executive Office of Public Safety Bullying Prevention Program In September 2000, the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) began to administer the Bullying Prevention Program (BPP) based on the Olweus model.
The BPP is a comprehensive, school-wide effort that is designed to reduce bully/victim problems among primary and secondary school children.
It aims to increase knowledge and awareness of the problem, to achieve active involvement on the part of teachers and parents, to develop clear rules against bullying behavior, and to provide support and protection for the victims of bullying.
Interventions are conducted for students at the school-wide level, classroom level, and on an individual student basis.
Thus, the Olweus BPP is not a typical curricular approach to violence prevention.
The interventions are designed to help change the norms within a school environment.
The Olweus BPP model has been scientifically proven to reduce victim/bully problems among primary and secondary school students, and studies show that the frequency of bully/victim problems decrease by fifty percent (50%) or more.
These results apply to both boys and girls, and to students across all grades studied.
In addition, school climate improves and antisocial behavior, such as theft, vandalism, and truancy, decline.
Number of Sites: 6 Six elementary schools throughout the Commonwealth were selected to implement the Bullying Prevention Program (BPP) during the 2000-2001 school year.
The sites include: the Samuel W. Mason Elementary School in Boston, the Lynn Community Charter School in Lynn, the Salemwood Elementary School in Malden, the Jordan/Jackson Elementary School in Mansfield, the Lillie B. Merrill Elementary School in Raynham, and the Barrows Elementary School in Reading.
Each site agreed that all involved school personnel would make a two-year commitment to the program.
Most sites were provided an award amount of $50,000 for the first year, with a match of $17,000.
The extremely large student population at the Malden site resulted in the award amount equaling $100,000 for the first year with a match of $33,333.
Approximately 3,800 students participated in the BPP during the first year of implementation.
It should be noted that the Lynn Community Charter School received an award amount of $75,000 with a match amount of $25,000.
In its first year of funding, the Lynn Community Charter School was viewed as two separate sites.
One consisted of students in grades K-6 and the second served as a pilot program for students in grades 7 and 8.
Future plans for the BPP involve expanding the program to middle-school students, so this site provides an excellent opportunity to learn what methods are the most effective in decreasing bullying behavior among students in this age group.
Program Activities: All sites addressed the issue of bullying throughout the entire school, within individual classrooms and with individual students.
This was accomplished through staff training, a kick-off event for students and parents, weekly class meetings and discussions, and monthly discussion groups for school personnel.
In addition, a Bullying Prevention Program Coordinating Committee was created at each site.
The BPP Coordinating Committee consists of a Coordinator and approximately ten other members including a teacher from each grade level, a parent, a non-professional staff member, guidance counselors, and a student representative.
The members Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2001 Annual Report 31 P ROGRAM S UMMARIES of the BPP Coordinating Committee are committed to continually oversee the implementation of the program.
During the first two weeks of November 2000, technical assistance providers Nancy Mullin-Rindler, of Wellesley College, and Susan Limber, Ph.D., from Clemson University, conducted a training for all BPP Coordinating Committee members.
The training discussed the BPP model, the effects of bullying, classroom/school-wide strategies, strategies for individual students, and the site's plan to address bullying within their school community.
The training provided the Coordinating Committee members the background information necessary to train all staff, perform a schoolwide kick-off event for both students and parents, and begin the process of classroom meetings and staff discussion groups.
The training also provided the Coordinating Committee with the necessary tools for administering the "Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire", which is described in greater detail below.
Goals and Objectives: According to the "Blueprints for Violence Prevention: The Bullying Prevention Program", by Dan Olweus and Susan Limber, the goals of the program are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ to reduce, if not eliminate, existing bully/victim problems among elementary, middle and junior high school children in and outside of the school setting; Ã¯Â¿Â½ to prevent the development of new bully/victim problems; and Ã¯Â¿Â½ to achieve better peer relations at school and create conditions that allow, in particular, victims and bullies to get along and function better in and outside of the school setting.
The document states that the goals could be summarized in one general statement: "the school should be a safe and positive learning environment."
Performance Indicators : In order to assess the extent of bullying at each school, the Olweus BPP model requires the administration of an anonymous student survey.
This survey, which is administered to students in grades three and higher, includes questions on the amount of bullying behavior the students encounter.
The survey also evaluates the students' attitude towards bullying behavior and their perception of how the teachers react to situations of bullying.
A separate survey to be administered to children in grades K-2 was created by technical assistance providers, Nancy Mullin-Rindler and Susan Limber.
All sites successfully processed the surveys and used the results to better address bullying behavior within their particular school.
For example, the Lillian B. Merrill Elementary School in Raynham reported using the survey results as a way to target specific "hot spots" where bullying behavior is more likely to occur, such as the playground and the bus.
As a result, the Coordinating Committee held training at night for the bus drivers and added volunteer monitors to the playgrounds.
Accomplishments/Evaluation Results : Although each site successfully implemented the BPP during the 2000-2001 school year by completing the required program components, the sites of Malden, Boston, and Reading added other aspects that further enhanced the program.
Malden Throughout the application process, members from the Malden community demonstrated a strong desire to assist in the efforts to decrease bullying behavior within the Salemwood Elementary School community.
As a result of an increased amount of community interest, this site served as a pilot program for community involvement.
In addition to the school-based Coordinating Committee, Malden has a community-based BPP Coordinating Committee that Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 32 P ROGRAM S UMMARIES is working to find and implement methods to be used in the outside community that could positively effect bullying behavior in the school.
A staff member from the Malden YMCA serves as the Coordinator for the BPP Community Coordinating Committee and acts as a liaison between the school-based committee and the community-based committee.
The community-based Coordinating Committee includes individuals that have an interest in working to decrease bullying among Malden elementary school students.
Both Coordinating Committees worked in collaboration to provide an educational evening for parents regarding the BPP.
A parent workshop was also filmed and is scheduled to air on community access television.
Also, many members within the greater community, such as those who provide after school programs, were provided with BPP materials.
Publicity was enhanced even further through the distribution of "Be a Buddy" pins and stickers at numerous school and/or community events.
Boston The Coordinating Committee at the Samuel W. Mason School in Boston has created many innovative ways to decrease bullying incidents within its site.
First, the Coordinating Committee worked with other school personnel to implement the "Helping Hands" component.
This involves posted hands on the wall with the names of children who have been recognized for their efforts in decreasing the level of bullying behavior at the Mason School.
Second, the school has also implemented a "Buddy System" to help monitor student behavior.
This component includes an older child supervising the activity of a younger student at times when bullying is more likely to take place, such as dismissal time.
The Coordinating Committee has stated that this has encouraged friendships among students of different age groups.
Third, during the first year of funding, a parent representative provided homemade anti-bullying cookies for use during classroom meetings.
These cookies were distributed between two and three classes each week during their classroom meetings.
The cookies were also dispersed during a school-wide anti-violence assembly, which was attended by then-Governor Paul Cellucci.
Future plans of the Coordinating Committee include the creation of a web page and a parent newsletter.
Reading The Coordinating Committee at the Barrows Elementary School spent the first year of the BPP working on a plan that would provide students with slips for either participating in bullying behavior or for terminating acts of bullying.
The slips contain happy and frown faces, which are circled to indicate the type of behavior being recognized.
During the second year of funding, the Coordinating Committee will continue to finalize details, such as using different colored slips to indicate the type of behavior of the student and whether or not the parents would be required to sign the slips for all types of behavior.
Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report 33 P ROGRAM S UMMARIES Local Police Departments Cops and Kids Program The Cops and Kids Program is a community-based initiative designed to reduce the incidence of youth substance abuse and criminal gang involvement by providing at-risk middle school students with after-school programs between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.

Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report APPENDIX APPENDIX Appendix 1 BULLYING PREVENTION PROGRAM INTRODUCTION What is bullying? When are comments simply teasing and incidents excused merely as a joke? How does one determine that comments and/or actions are mean-spirited and meant to make the recipient feel uncomfortable? Should an adult be informed of these incidents or is this tattling? How should bystanders who witness a bullying situation respond?
These are a few of the questions the Bullying Prevention Program (BPP) endeavors to address.
The definition most frequently used to identify bullying behavior is attributed to Dan Olweus, a pioneer in bullying research at the University of Bergen, Norway.
"A person is bullied when he or she is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons, ...and it occurs in an interpersonal relationship that is characterized by a certain imbalance in strength or power" (Olweus, 1999: 12).
The negative actions "may be physical or verbal in nature-for example, hitting or kicking, teasing or taunting-or they may involve indirect actions such as manipulating friendships or purposely excluding other children from activities" (Limber and Nation, 1998: 4).
Overview The BPP is a comprehensive, school-wide effort that is designed to reduce bully/victim problems among primary and secondary school children.
It aims to increase knowledge and awareness of the problem, achieve active involvement on the part of teachers and parents, develop clear rules against bullying behavior, and provide support and protection for the victims of bullying.
Interventions are implemented at the school-wide level, at the classroom level, and with individual students.
Thus, the BPP's approach to violence prevention entails interventions designed to help change the norms within a school environment.
The BPP has been successfully implemented in a variety of cultures and school contexts.
After thorough program evaluations, the BPP has been found to reduce bullying behavior of up to 50 percent or more (Olweus, Limber, and Mihalic, 1999: 1).
The BPP has shown to result in: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A substantial reduction in boys' and girls' reports of bullying and victimization.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A significant reduction in students' reports of general anti-social behavior such as vandalism, fighting, theft, and truancy.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Significant improvements in the "social climate" of the class, as reflected in students' reports of improved order and discipline, more positive social relationships, and a more positive attitude toward schoolwork and school (Ibid.).
History of the Bullying Prevention Program Interest in addressing bullying prevention began in Scandinavia in the late 1960s and early 1970s when bully and victim problems were identified as serious concerns.
However, it was not until the suicides of three 10 - 14 year old boys in 1982, most likely in response to "severe bullying by peers," (Olweus, Limber, and Mihalic, 1999: 2) that a concerted effort by school authorities to address this issue unfolded.
Massachusetts Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program 2000 Annual Report Between 1983 - 1985, a Bullying Prevention Program was revised and evaluated in 42 schools in Bergen, Norway involving 2,500 students, and subsequently, a nationwide campaign was integrated across the country.
Instituting a comprehensive approach to reduce bullying behaviors in the school environment resulted in a change of students' behaviors and attitudes, decreased other antisocial behaviors, and improved teachers' commitment to anti-bullying efforts.
The program resulted in 50 percent or more reductions in students' self-reports of bullying and victimization (Ibid. 1).
The Bullying Prevention Program was replicated in the United States, specifically in South Carolina.
The Institute for Families in Society of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina has provided Olweus' anti-bullying model to 6,388 rural elementary and middle school students in the state.
Prior to the implementation of the bullying prevention program, 23 percent of the students reported "they had been bullied by other students 'several times' or more frequently during past three months.
Approximately 20 percent reported that they had bullied other students with the same frequency" (Ibid. 5).
An evaluation of this program revealed "significant decreases in students' self-reports of bullying in the intervention schools compared to control schools" (Ibid. 15).
The Effects of Bullying Behavior Current research underscores the need for bullying prevention and intervention programs in the nation's elementary and middle schools.
In a study that appeared in the April 2001 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development researchers surveyed 15,686 students in grades 6 through 10, in public, parochial, and other private schools throughout the United States regarding bullying experiences.
In total, 29 percent of the respondents reported some involvement with bullying, either as a bully, a victim of bullying behavior, or both.1 A total of 10.6 percent of the children replied that they had "sometimes" bullied other children, a response category defined as "moderate" bullying.
An additional 8.8 percent said they had bullied others once a week or more, [which is] defined as "frequent" bullying.
Similarly, 8.5 percent said they had been targets of moderate bullying, and 8.4 percent said they were bullied frequently.2 There are numerous short-term and long-term consequences of bullying behavior that impact both the victim and the bully, reinforcing the need to address these behaviors before they escalate.
In the short-term, victims of bullying experience unhappiness, distress, anxiety, insecurity, and poor self-esteem.
Their academic standing may suffer due to poor concentration or their refusal to attend school.
They may also develop psychosomatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach pains, and in the most extreme cases, suicide is perceived by the youth as the only option.

Bullying Widespread in U.S. Schools, Survey Finds.
Retrieved July 2, 2001, from the National Institutes of Health Web site: http://www.nichhd.nih.gov/new/releases/bullying.htm 2 Ibid. 2 Research conducted by Olweus (1993b) indicates that victims of recurring bullying may suffer long-term negative consequences that extend beyond their school years.
"As young adults (age 23), former victims (who were bullied primarily in grades six through nine) tended to be more depressed and had poorer self-esteem than their non-victimized peers" (Olweus, Limber, and Mihalic, 1999: 7).
Bullying behavior should not be viewed as an isolated act by the perpetrator, but rather a "generally antisocial and rule-breaking (conduct-disordered) behavior pattern" (Ibid.).
Olweus contends that students, specifically boys, who bully are more likely to participate in antisocial and delinquent behaviors including vandalism, shoplifting, truancy, and frequent drug use (Ibid.).
This negative behavior pattern often is exhibited in young adulthood.
Approximately 60 percent of boys who were characterized as bullies in grades 6-9 . . . had been convicted of at least one officially registered crime by the age of 24, compared to 23 percent of boys who were not characterized as bullies.
. . .
[A]s many as 35-40 percent of the former bullies had three or more convictions by this age, while this was true of only 10 percent of the control boys (those who were neither bullies nor victims in grades 6-9) (Ibid.).
The level of discomfort and tension created by bullying behaviors in the classroom resonates throughout the social climate of the school.
As a result, students do not feel safe and become disillusioned with school life.
BULLYING PREVENTION PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION What Does the BPP Model Entail? The BPP encompasses the following three levels of intervention: Ã¯Â¿Â½ School-wide interventions.
An anonymous student survey to assess bullying problems at each school, increased supervision, school-wide assemblies, and teacher in-service training to raise the awareness of children and school staff regarding bullying.
Ã¯Â¿Â½
Classroom-level interventions.
The establishment of classroom rules (consistent with school-wide rules) against bullying, regular class meetings to discuss bullying at school, and meetings with all parents
.
Ã¯Â¿Â½
Individual-level interventions.
Discussions with students identified as bullies and victims (Limber and Nation, 1998: 4).
The BPP is a violence prevention program that requires participation from all school staff (e.g., teachers, cafeteria workers, custodians, teacher's aides, bus drivers, etc.), students, parents, and other community members.
School efforts to reduce bullying and other forms of violence include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identifying bullies and victims of bullying to address their individual problems and needs; Ã¯Â¿Â½
Establishing school-wide rules and applying consistent sanctions against bullying; 3 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Holding regular classroom meetings to discuss problems of bullying and violence with children;
Increasing supervision of children at school; Rewarding children for good social behaviors; Holding school-wide assemblies on violence; and Making use of videos, books, and other resources on bullying.
Bullying Prevention Program On-Site Coordinator and Coordinating Committee The Bullying Prevention Program Coordinator and Coordinating Committee are responsible for spearheading the efforts to implement a bullying prevention program at each school.
This is best achieved through their efforts to involve school faculty, staff, and administrators, parents, students, and the community in a process that addresses bullying behavior as a school-wide problem.
Some of the methods utilized to accomplish this goal are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ To use student surveys to find out more about the type of bullying behaviors that occur at the school;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ To examine existing supervision at the school (in light of students' reports of bullying "hot spots"), and make adjustments where needed; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To establish school-wide rules and procedures to deal with bullying; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To provide ongoing classroom meetings about bullying for all students; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To offer individual help and support for students at risk to be bullied or to bully others; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To provide training for all school staff and parents about the Bullying Prevention Program; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To plan and coordinate the Bullying Prevention Program kick-off event.
Each school is also responsible for establishing a Bullying Prevention Coordinating Committee that is comprised of eight-to-ten members who have an on-going commitment to plan and implement the program.
Committee members collectively determine on what day and time the committee meetings will be held and the role of respective committee members.
Ensuring information and feedback occurs between the Coordinating Committee and teachers and staff is crucial to program success.
The Coordinating Committee and the on-site Program Coordinator meet once or twice a month, for approximately two hours, to administer the school's bullying prevention endeavors.
The Program Coordinator regularly meets with faculty during their staff meetings to apprise them of program objectives, and also distributes information through school mail and e-mail.
Likewise, Coordinating Committee members, who are the liaisons for specific grades, hold monthly teacher discussion groups to inform their colleagues of Bullying Prevention Program initiatives and to solicit comments and suggestions.
Coordinating Committee members include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ representatives of the school faculty (including a school administrator, a teacher representing each grade [or every few grades], a guidance counselor and/or school-based mental health professional); Ã¯Â¿Â½ a representative from the non-teaching staff (e.g., food services worker, janitor, nurse, librarian, bus driver, etc.); Ã¯Â¿Â½ a parent representative; and 4 Ã¯Â¿Â½ a community representative (e.g., school resource officer, DARE, or juvenile officer, a community religious leader, a representative of youth sports/recreation services or an after-school program, etc.).
Development of Rules/Sanctions/Positive Consequences (Interventions) The Coordinating Committee is required to formulate consistent school rules against bullying that are visible and available to all students and staff.
These rules are established in conjunction with each individual school's existing behavior plan.
In addition to creating rules against bullying behaviors, each school is working to establish positive or negative consequences for following or violating the anti-bullying rules.
In conjunction, the schools are expected to establish a formal tracking system to monitor bullying behavior.
The rules against bullying should be similar to the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ We will not bully other students.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We will try to help students that are bullied.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We will make it a point to include ALL students who are easily left out.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We will report incidents of bullying to an adult.
Classroom Meetings Following the requisite training and kick-off events, teachers conducted weekly classroom meetings on the topic of bullying and peer relations.
The classroom meetings are designed to help students build a sense of class cohesion and community, and positive peer social control.
It is during these meetings that teachers and students establish and clarify rules against bullying behavior and the subsequent consequences for engaging in this negative behavior.
Strategies for the classroom meetings include having the students sit in a circle, follow ground rules for discussion (e.g., raise hands to speak, don't interrupt, avoid saying names--focus on events), and role play about bullying situations.
Teachers utilized resource materials to incorporate role playing activities, literature, and class activities to reinforce bullying prevention.
Activity Workbook3 The Coordinating Committees are required to complete an Activity Workbook outlining the tasks that are considered important for effectively implementing the Bullying Prevention Program.
The workbook is designed to help the Coordinating Committee develop the school's strategy for program implementation.
This document enables committee members to review and evaluate, throughout the school year, the extent to which plans are being carried out, examine whether strategies are effective, and make needed modifications to the strategies.
The tasks outlined in the workbook are not inclusive, as committees are encouraged to examine additional tasks that may be important for their school's effective implementation of the Bullying Prevention Program.
MASSACHUSETTS BULLYING PREVENTION PROGRAM In FY01, the Executive Office of Public Safety Programs Division implemented the BPP at six Massachusetts elementary schools in the communities of Boston, Lynn, Reading, Malden, 3 Susan Limber Ph.D., from the Institute for Families in Society at Clemson University, and Nancy Mullin-Rindler M.Ed., from the Center for Research on Women at Wellesley College, designed the Activity Workbook.
5 Mansfield, and Raynham.
The six schools selected to participate in the BPP commitment.
The timeline for the first year entailed providing BPP training with full program implementation beginning in the second year.
In addition components described above, the following areas are instrumental to ensure program and are being implemented in Massachusetts.
agreed to a two-year to key school staff, to the core program a successful Technical Assistance The Senior Technical Assistance Providers for the BPP are Susan Limber Ph.D and Nancy Mullin-Rindler M.Ed.
Dr. Susan Limber is currently Director of the Center for Youth Participation and Human Rights at the Institute on Family and Neighborhood Life at Clemson University in South Carolina.
She is, with Dr. Dan Olweus, one of the developers of the Blueprints for Violence Prevention: The Bullying Prevention Program.
She has conducted research about the Bullying Prevention Program, has developed anti-bullying lessons for older elementary and middle school students, and is a designated Blueprints trainer of the Bullying Prevention Program for the US Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
Nancy Mullin-Rindler is the Director of the Project on Teasing and Bullying at Wellesley College Center for Research on Women.
She regularly provides training about bullying prevention to school districts and parent groups across the country and is a co-author of Quit It!: A Teacher's Guide on Teasing and Bullying for Use With Students in Grades K-3 and a selected bibliography of children's books about bullying and teasing.
She has also conducted research on gender-based bullying as part of a federally funded collaborative study.
Individualized technical assistance has been accomplished through: regular monthly phone contact with BPP Coordinators; face-to-face meetings and site visits to all 6 sites (in conjunction with either staff training or kick off events); informal telephone contacts and email (e.g. to follow-up or reinforce points discussed during TA calls; or to provide additional information or clarifications related to planning events).
In addition, sites have periodically (approximately monthly) received informational memos ("Site Letters") to address topics of common concern or interest across the sites (e.g. conducting and interpreting student surveys; ideas for training or kick-off events, etc.).
The Senior Technical Assistance Providers are also responsible for submitting to the Executive Office of Public Safety Programs Division, quarterly progress reports detailing the progress of each school.
These progress reports describe recent BPP activities, any issues a particular program site may be experiencing, and future BPP plans.
Training To enhance the success of the BPP, all members of each school's BPP Coordinating Committee and the on-site Program Coordinator participated in a two-day training session.
The training, held in November 2000, discussed the BPP model, the effects of bullying, classroom/schoolwide strategies, strategies for individual students, and the site's plan to address bullying within their school community.
The members of the BPP Coordinating Committee subsequently trained their respective school staff regarding the philosophy and goals of the program.
6 Student Bullying Survey In the fall 2000, the BPP Committees at each participating school administered a school-wide anonymous survey of students regarding their experiences with bullying behavior.
Each school designated a staff member who was responsible for collecting the survey data and entering it into the database for analysis.
This analysis provided program staff with an account of bullying occurring within their school, as well as the types of bullying and the location in which it occurs.
This information assisted the BPP Coordinating Committees in conceptualizing, implementing, and evaluating their respective Bullying Prevention Programs.
To obtain an account of students' experiences with bullying behavior, two grade-specific questionnaires were utilized.
Students in grades K-2 were administered an informal questionnaire developed by Nancy Mullin-Rindler M.Ed., and Susan Limber Ph.D.
This questionnaire comprised five questions that are presented in a "Question of the Day" format.
Questions were asked one at a time over the course of a week or, over the course of a day or class period.
Without altering the format or wording, each question is written on a large sheet of paper (easel pad) in a chart format.
Student responses were recorded using different color stickers or markers to distinguish between boys' and girls' responses.
Students in grades 3-7 were administered the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire.
The Olweus survey is a multiple-choice paper and pencil survey that asks students about their experiences with bullying behavior.
Students were asked 39 questions regarding what they have experienced, how often, where bullying occurs, who has participated (general, not providing names).
It also asks them what their role has been (target, bully, or bystander) and how they have responded.
Results from the K-2 students were recorded on the School-Wide Tabulation Chart and combined with those of the Olweus survey conducted with older students.
The Coordinating Committee used the survey results to assist with program planning and staff training.
For example, the findings enabled Coordinating Committees to identify and target bullying "hot spots" at their respective schools, and respond with appropriate measures to address the problem.
Kickoff Event In January and February 2001, each school held a kick-off event to introduce the Bullying Prevention Program on a school-wide basis.
In addition to students and teachers, non-teaching staff and parents were invited to participate in this event.
The kick-off event provided an opportunity to discuss bully/victim problems, introduce everyone to the BPP, reinforce the school rules against bullying behavior, and engage all participants in the program activities.
Interventions In April 2001, many schools began implementing school-wide interventions for students who engaged in both positive and negative behavior.
Many schools have implemented creative methods to acknowledge pro-social behavior, in addition to bullying behavior.
However, many Bullying Prevention Programs are still establishing a protocol for responding to bullying behavior and administering discipline.
7 PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS BPP Coordinator and Coordinating Committee As a result of the BPP training, the principal at a participating site recognized that school dismissal was a "hot spot" that required a supervision plan.
Students are now escorted out of the building to their parents.
Teachers shake hands with their parents/guardians and "hand over" their children.
Likewise, teachers escort students to their respective buses.
Requiring school staff--instead of student teachers and volunteers--to escort the students to the playground also reinforced supervision during recess.
This enabled staff to pay closer attention to behavior dynamics and problems that may be occurring in the classroom and carrying over into recess.
Kickoff Event The kickoff event at one school focused on literature.
All the staff were asked to attend the event dressed as a different character from a bully related story.
The stories were then acted out with the help of the students.
Another school began their Bullying Prevention Program by encircling the entire school building with students, parents, and teachers holding hands and chanting "No more bullies allowed at our school!" Some students had handmade sandwich board signs that proclaimed their school a bully-free zone, and advocated "bully proofing."
Approximately 50 parents also participated in this kickoff event.
The Bullying Prevention Program commenced at another school with 7th grade YMCA Peer Leaders demonstrating, through role-playing exercises, what constitutes bullying and how to make behavior and attitude changes.
The theme of the performance, "Who Wants to be a Buddy?"--based on the game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"--was performed for students in grades K-7, teachers, and school administrators.
The peer leaders demonstrated different types of bullying and how bullying can be harmful to individuals, to the school, and to the community.
They illustrated how bullying behavior includes put-downs, isolating individuals or groups from activities, spreading gossip and rumors, and physical violence.
The peer leaders then displayed resolutions to bullying situations, portraying how an individual can make a decision, regardless of the situation, to both support and respect other people and to not put them down.
To further support the messages of the bullying presentation, "Be a Buddy" buttons were distributed for students in grades 4-7.
Teachers also gave "I'm a Buddy" stickers to students in grades K-3 who demonstrated "buddy" behaviors.
At a later date, the BPP Coordinating Committee also hosted a parent kickoff event to inform parents of the program, raise community awareness, and to gain support of both the parents and community-at-large for the program.
The YMCA 7th grade Peer Leaders again participated in this event, performing two role-playing presentations that were followed by a discussion.
Audience members were given printed materials explaining the Bullying Prevention Program, including "School Rules Against Bullying" and "Conversation Starters: Talking With Your Children About Bullying."
Following the performance, parents and community members joined teachers and school administrators at the Parent-Teacher meeting in the cafeteria.
To encourage parent attendance at the kickoff, the Coordinating Committee provided an ice cream party for the class that had at least one parent or guardian for each student in the class attending the "Parent Kickoff."
The YMCA 7th grade Peer Leaders also performed "Who Wants to be a Buddy?" at a Family Literacy Event held at an Immigrant Learning Center.
The immigrants, who are learning 8 English, were given written materials from the program discussing bullying issues and prevention methods.
At another school-wide Bullying Prevention Program kickoff, the Superintendent served as moderator and teachers and administrators participated in role-playing skits demonstrating how bullies behave and how victims and bystanders should respond.
These bullying scenarios included a student being picked on by another as they rode the bus to school, a student being excluded from sitting at a table, and a girl having her CD taken away from her on the playground.
With each skit, the performers modeled both the right and wrong ways to behave, and discussed reasons and solutions with the students.
Students were also given two forms to sign both containing a big "B" in the middle with a slash through it.
One declared "I Promise Not to Bully" and the other stated "I Have the Right to be Safe."
Classroom Meetings At one program site, a parent representative provided homemade anti-bullying cookies (the cookie has the letter "B" on it with a line through it-denoting the anti-bullying symbol) for classes to eat during the meetings.
These cookies were distributed to two to three classes each week.
Interventions One school gives students slips that have either a "frown face" or a "happy face" for either participating in bullying behavior or for terminating acts of bullying.
Other programs have instituted logbooks that enable teachers to identify and track students who engage in bullying behavior.
By documenting a student's bullying behavior, closer monitoring of the student and intervention with the school counselor is facilitated.
Another school has implemented the "Helping Hands" component, which involves posting hands on the wall with the name of a student who has been recognized for assisting in decreasing the level of bullying behavior.
This same school also uses the "Buddy System" to help monitor student behavior.
This component involves an older student supervising the activity of a younger student at times when bullying is more likely to occur, such as at dismissal time.
Another participating school has "bully busters" in each classroom that are responsible for reporting bullying behavior to the teacher.
This reinforces the importance of students intervening in bullying behavior situations, while eliminating the impression of being a tattletale.
Community Outreach Many schools utilized their local newspapers or cable access television stations to inform the community about their bullying prevention efforts.
One program coordinator was interviewed on the cable access program, "Positive Parenting" to discuss the BPP.
At another school, the BPP is coordinated with other violence prevention programs such as the D.A.R.E. program.
The Coordinating Committee at another site publishes a weekly article in the school journal that is distributed to parents entitled "Enhancing Your Child's Personal Safety" and "Tips from the BPP."
Another community was able to publicize their bullying prevention efforts by using Tshirts.
A contest was held throughout the school for the best T-shirt design and two students were selected as winners.
All classes were given a T-shirt, pins and the T-shirts are given away at both school and community events--hence publicizing the BPP to the larger community.
9 Another school has partnered with the YMCA to launch a Community Committee to increase the involvement of community professionals in the prevention of school-based bullying.
A YMCA staff person works part-time to coordinate the Community Committee program activities and serves as a liaison between the Community Committee and the school-based Coordinating Committee.
Linking out-of school programs with the endeavors of the Bullying Prevention Program during school hours will help to integrate bullying prevention efforts, and serve to reduce bullying behavior in the school.
CONCLUSION All schools participating in the first year of the Bullying Prevention Program are to be commended for their hard work and dedication for enhancing the social and learning environment of their students.
All program participants showed a high level of motivation and enthusiasm, and a great deal of creativity implementing the BPP.
The foundation for ensuring program success is attributed to the Program Coordinators and Coordinating Committees.
They met their responsibilities to plan, administer, and analyze the student surveys, implement school rules and the supervision plan, and provide the BPP training to all school staff.
The Program Coordinator also ensured weekly classroom meetings were held, and that BPP information was discussed at the monthly staff discussion meetings.
July 2001 began the second year of the BPP for the six continuation schools, and the first year of the program for eight new schools.
The new school participants are located in the communities of Chatham, Gloucester, Hull, Littleton, Pelham, Reading, and Springfield.
The new programs are required to hire members of the BPP Coordinating Committee, train all school staff, participate in training for Coordinating Committee members, and administer and analyze the student surveys.
The continuing programs are expected to hire any new members of the BPP Coordinating Committee, train all new school staff, participate in booster training for Coordinating Committee members, as well as re-administer and analyze the student surveys.
