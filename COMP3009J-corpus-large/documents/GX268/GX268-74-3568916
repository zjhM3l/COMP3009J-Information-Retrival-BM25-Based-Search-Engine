INTRODUCTION
During the fall of 2001, Indiana students in Grades 3, 6, 8, and 10 participated in the administration of the ISTEP+.
The test administered in Grade 10 is the Graduation Qualifying Exam (GQE).
This test is also given to other students attempting to qualify for graduation.
The test for ISTEP+ Fall 2001 consisted of two parts: (1) a basic skills section and (2) an applied skills section.
For the fall testing, the basic skills section, which consisted of multiple-choice questions, was machine-scored.
The applied skills section, which consisted of open-ended questions, was hand-scored in Indiana during October and November 2001.
The results of both the basic skills section and the applied skills section were returned to the schools in November 2001.
Copies of imaged student responses in the applied skills section were returned to the schools in January 2002.
It is the Indiana Department of Education's expectation that schools will take this opportunity to invite students and parents to sit down with teachers to discuss the results.
To help in this process, the Indiana Department of Education has prepared the following Teacher's Scoring Guide.
The purpose of this guide is to help teachers Â· understand the methods used to score the ISTEP+ Fall 2001 GQE Applied Skills Assessment, and Â· discuss and interpret these results with students and parents.
In order to use this guide effectively, you will also need the Applied Skills Report and the imaged copy of the student's work.
For the GQE, there are two scoring guides: English/Language Arts and Mathematics.
In this guide, you will find Â· an introduction, Â· a list of the Mathematics Grade 10 (GQE) Essential Skills, Â· rubrics (scoring rules) used to score the items, Â· anchor papers or examples of actual student work (transcribed in this guide for clarity and ease of reading), and Â· descriptions of the ways in which the response meets the rubric criteria for each of the score points.
When you review the contents of the scoring guide, keep in mind that this guide is an overview.
If you have questions, write via e-mail (istep@doe.state.in.us) or call the Indiana Department of Education at (317) 232-9050.

INTRODUCTION TO THE MATHEMATICS PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
The performance-assessment tasks that students took this past fall in Grades 6, 8, and 10 allowed them to demonstrate their understanding of mathematics in a variety of ways, such as using a ruler, explaining a solution, drawing a picture, or making a table or graph.
In Grades 6, 8, and 10, the students completed two sessions consisting of a series of constructed-response items and one performance-assessment task.
STRUCTURE The constructed-response items for Grade 10 are divided into two sessions and are organized as follows: Â· Session 1 contains nine constructed-response items, all of which consist of a single part.
Five of the nine items (items 2 through 6) comprise a performance-assessment task in which all items are related to a single topic.
The task includes an introductory narrative and/or graphic that sets the topic, with items relating to this topic immediately following the narrative or graphic.
Â· Session 2 contains nine constructed-response items that are not related to each other by topic.
Each item consists of a single part.
SCORING Each constructed-response item is scored according to its own rubric.
A rubric is a description of student performance that clearly articulates the requirements for each of the score points.
Scoring rubrics are essential because they ensure that all papers are scored objectively.
Each rubric for the Grade 10 ISTEP+ Fall 2001 (GQE) test has a maximum possible score of two score points.
NOTE: Images of the items and student work have been reduced to fit the format of this guide.
As a result, actual measures of items will not be reflected.

Rubrics describe the requirements for each score point level.
The number of score point levels possible varies according to the requirements of each activity.
The performance criteria (requirements) comprising the rubrics were established prior to testing to ensure that all responses are judged objectively.
1.
Students should not be penalized for omitting Â· degree symbols Â· dollar signs ($) or cent signs (Â¢) Â· zeros for place holders; for example, either 0.75 or .750 could be used Â· labels for word problems; for example, miles 2.
Students should not be penalized for Â· spelling or grammar errors Â· using abbreviations; for example, ft or feet would be acceptable 3.
Students should be given credit for Â· entries in the work space that indicate understanding of a complete process even if the response on the answer line is incorrect (i.e., the student would receive partial credit for items with rubrics that allow for scoring the work). Â· answers not written on the answer line; for example, an answer could be given in the work space or in the explanation (however, in some cases, because of the multiple calculations in the work space, placement of an answer on the answer line is necessary to determine which result the student intended).
4.
Graphs Â· Bar graphs may be horizontal or vertical.
Â· The order in which the data in bar and circle graphs are shown is NOT important.
Â· Line graphs are acceptable with or without lines connecting the points.
Â· Any width of a bar in a bar graph is acceptable.
CONDITION CODES If a response is unscorable, it is assigned one of the following condition codes: A B C D Blank/No response/Refusal Illegible Written predominantly in a language other than English Insufficient response/Copied from text

MATHEMATICS GQE ESSENTIAL SKILLS
Select and apply problem-solving methods in a realistic context (Problem Solving)* Communicate orally and in writing mathematical ideas, as well as their power and usefulness, as they apply to the real world (Communication)* Use inductive and deductive reasoning to solve problems (Reasoning)* Develop an understanding of basic algebraic concepts and skills, and apply those skills requiring algebraic manipulation to solve equations and inequalities (Algebra) Develop an understanding of elementary functions, their graphs, and their applications to the real world (Functions) Develop an understanding of two- and three-dimensional geometric figures as they apply to realistic problems (Geometry) Develop an understanding of descriptive statistics (Statistics) Develop an understanding of probability (Probability) Use computational skills and concepts with appropriate technology and/or paper and pencil to solve simple word problems (Computation) * NOTE: For ISTEP+ assessment purposes only, the Essential Skills marked with an asterisk have been combined into one category called Problem Solving/ Communication/Reasoning.

11/16/01, 7:33 AM
Three Essential Skills -- Problem Solving, Communication, and Reasoning--are identified as Process Skills in the Indiana Academic Standards.
To ensure that the ISTEP+ items that assess these Process Skills are grade-appropriate and that the items use skills that are contained in the standards, these items are developed by also including one of the Content Skills (such as Computation, Geometry, Algebra, or others).
NOTE: For the Process Skill items, score points are awarded only for Process Skills, not for the Content Skill associated with the item.
The Content Skill used for each of the Process Skill items in the GQE Applied Skills Assessment is shown in the following chart.
