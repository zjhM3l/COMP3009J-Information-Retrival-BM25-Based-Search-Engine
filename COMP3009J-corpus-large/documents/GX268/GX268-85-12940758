COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STAFF BRIDGE BRIDGE DETAIL MANUAL Chapter: Effective: Supersedes: 6 April 12, 2000 September 19, 1980 GENERAL LAYOUT 6.1 PURPOSE This drawing is to be a general layout in plan, longitudinal section, and typical transverse section of the structure, showing the physical aspects and features of the structure and surrounding terrain.
6.2 RESPONSIBILITY
This drawing shall be prepared and checked in the design unit.
The graphic presentation of information on this drawing shall be the responsibility of the individual preparing the drawing.
6.3 SCALES at the correct Dview and twist plan view for Elevation view w.
General Layout shall be drawn to full scale in model space, project coordinates on a copy of the roadway electronics file.
in floating model space can then be utilized to rotate the illustration, without affecting the project coordinates.
The shall be drawn to full scale, and illustrated below the Plan vie
Suggested zoom scales for presenting the Plan and Elevation views in paper space are as follows: 1:5, 1:10, or 1:20.
The Typical Section shall be drawn to full scale in model space.
Suggested zoom scales for presenting the typical section in paper space are as follows: 1:10 or 1:20.
6.4 GUIDELINES FOR LAYING OUT STRUCTURES file and make file
When detailing the General Layout, start by opening the electronic provided by the Region.
Before doing anything, use the command save as save the drawing with another name like Genlay.
After doing this you can all the changes and rotations that are needed, but the original Region with the original project coordinates are preserved.
Either of the following two procedures will allow you to manipulate the Regions file without losing the project coordinates.
Set your Angle Click on Click on Angle = Angle Pr Click OK Procedure 1 Find the angle of the Control Line or if you need to, develop a Layout Line.
This is the line of your Y axis for the Bridge Geometry.
Find the angle of the Control Line or Layout Line at the location of the structure and write it down for future reference.

This is the angle you are going to use to twist the drawing so that the Control Line or Layout Line of the structure will sit horizontally on the screen heading in the Ahead Station direction, with a 0.00000000 angle in the XY Plane.
After finding this angle, twist the drawing: Command: DVIEW Select Objects: Hit Enter (to select everything) Type in: TW (for twist) New view twist 
The angle will be negative if rotating to horizontal is in the clock-wise direction.
Hit Enter Hit Enter to get out of the command.
At this point, your drawing will have been twisted to get the Control Line or Layout Line sitting horizontally to your vision with Ahead Stationing to the right.
The drawing will still retain the correct State Plane Coordinates of the original Roadway electronic file.
The UCS (User Coordinate System) at this point is World.
Your crosshairs may be sitting at an angle to horizontal on the screen.
Any distances or coordinate ID you take at this point will still be related to the World coordinates.
In order to set Command: Type in: Rotation up your project specific User Coordinate System: UCS Z (for ZAxis) Angle About Z Axis 
Hit Enter Your crosshairs should now be straight and any distance taken horizontally should show a 0.00000000 angle in the XY Plane.
Command: UCS Type in: O (for Origin) Origin point 
Command: UCS Type in S (for Save) ?/Desired UCS name: Type in Plan To toggle to World coordinates and back to User coordinates: If you type in UCS, then W for World, you will go back to the World coordinate system.
Then if you type in UCS, then R for Restore, then Plan, you go back to the user coordinate system that you setup for the Bridge Geometry coordinates.
If you type in UCS, then R for Restore, then ?, AutoCad will ask you UCS name(s) to list

Procedure 2 Type in: UCSFOLLOW 
This should be the 0,0 point or reference point for the bridge geometry.
POINT ON POSITIVE PORTION OF THE X-AXIS: Click on the end of the tangent.
Those two points set up the x-axis of your system.
POINT ON POSITIVE Y PORTION OF THE UCS XY PLANE: Click some arbitrary point on the positive side of the xaxis.
Hit Enter to exit the command With UCSFOLLOW on, the drawing will rotate itself to your user coordinate system.
Save your UCS: UCS: S for save.
DESIRED UCS NAME: type in a name such as Plan.
You can now toggle back and forth between World Coordinates and your saved user coordinate system.
To toggle back to World Coordinates, once you have saved your user coordinate system: UCS: Hit Enter since 
The drawing reverts back to the World Layout and the World Coordinate System.
