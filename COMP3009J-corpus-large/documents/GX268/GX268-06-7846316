Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Ã¯Â¿Â½ Department of Environmental Protection Fact Sheet Acid Rain In Pennsylvania Overview Acid rain is an environmental problem that has attracted global attention.
Its most visible effect is the acidification of thousands of lakes and streams throughout North America and Europe, and many more are vulnerable to its continuing destructive effects.
No one is sure exactly how much damage acid rain does to the environment.
Scientists argue over how serious the problem is and what should be done about it.
Some experts say action needs to be taken immediately in order to control the problem, while others feel more research is necessary.
Since acid rain crosses state, regional and international boundaries, there is disagreement on who should be responsible for solving the problem.
How Is Acid Rain Measured? Scientists can measure the amount of acidity in water by using the pH scale.
This scale runs from 0-14.
The lower the number on the scale, the stronger the acid, with the value 7.0 being neutral.
For example, " pure" rain, which is slightly acidic, has a pH level of 5.6, lemon juice has a pH level of 2.0, and battery acid has a pH level of 1.0.
Precipitation with a pH lower than 5.6 is considered acid rain.
The pH scale is logarithmic, which means that there is a tenfold difference between one number and the next.
For instance, rain with a pH level of 4.0 is ten times more acidic than that with a pH of 5.0, and one hundred times more acidic than that with a pH of 6.0.
Studies in recent years have shown that the pH of Pennsylvania rainfall averages 4.1 to 4.3, which is nearly 1,000 times the acidity of neutral water.
Pennsylvania receives one of the highest concentration of acid deposition in the world.
How Is Acid Rain Produced? Acid rain, more properly called acid deposition, is caused by the emission of various pollutants to the air.
The principle sources are the smokestacks of fossil fuel power plants, other industrial facilities and automotive exhausts.
These emissions contain sulfur dioxide (SO2), the major contributor to the problem, and nitrogen oxide (NOx).
These gases combine with oxygen and water vapor in the air to form sulfuric and nitric acids.
The acids fall to the earth in two forms of deposition.
When precipitation such as rain, sleet or snow containing dissolved sulfuric or nitric acid falls to the ground, it is termed wet deposition or " acid rain."
If the acids descend as sulfate or nitrate particles, it is labeled dry deposition.
What are the Effects of Acid Rain? According to many scientists, acid rain causes problems in almost every aspect of the environment.
When acids enter lakes and streams, the effects on aquatic life can be devastating.
Organisms ranging from fish and frogs down to microscopic plankton cannot survive in highly acidic waters.
The low pH level can halt or disrupt the reproductive cycles of these organisms.
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission warns that acid rain poses a threat to over 5,000 miles of streams it stocks annually.
Experts also believe that acid rain contributes to the reduction of crop and forest yields.
Instead of adding nourishment to fields and forests, acid rain leaches nutrients that cause sensitive trees and plants to grow slowly or even die off.
Scientific reports suggest widespread forest damage in the northeastern United States and Canada.
Acid rain also contributes to the deterioration of buildings and monuments.
The acid slowly wears away at certain types of stone causing billions of dollars in damage.
Finally, acid rain can affect human health by releasing the lead in pipes that carry water supplies.
Where Does Acid Rain Fall? These acids, suspended high above the earth, may be carried hundreds of miles by the wind before they eventually drop or wash down.
That' why acid rain is a s problem that has no borders or territories.
Compounding the problem is the fact that emissions are not spread out evenly.
In the United States, almost half of all SO2 and NOx emissions produced come from seven states in the coal-burning Ohio River Valley and Missouri and Tennessee.
The wind carries the gases in a northeasterly direction toward the Mid-Atlantic states, New England and Canada.
Acid Rain and the Clean Air Act Amendments Acid rain is one of the many air pollution issues addressed by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
The amendments require a 10 million ton reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by industry from 1980 baseline levels.
This reduction is accomplished in two phases
.
The first phase, effective January 1, 1995, requires 110 U.S. power plants -- including nine facilities in Pennsylvania -- to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.
Statistics compiled from 1995 data show, as a result of Phase I, acid rain concentrations have decreased by as much as 25 percent in Pennsylvania.
The second phase, effective January 1, 2000, will require 32 more facilities in Pennsylvania to also reduce their emissions.
Affected sources are required to install systems that continuously monitor emissions in order to track progress and assure compliance.
The utilities can reduce emissions by switching to low sulfur fuels, installing air pollution control equipment and/or purchasing emission allowances from plants that achieve more reductions than required.
The flexibility to purchase pollution credits, or emission allowances, from other sources will enable companies to achieve reductions at lower costs.
Sources that release less than the amount of regulated emissions can sell pollution credits to other sources.
They can trade credits within their systems and/or buy or sell credits to and from other affected sources.
Each source must have sufficient credits to cover its annual emissions.
Plants that fail to meet the federal requirements are subject to a $2,000 per ton excess emission fee and a requirement to offset emissions the following year.
DEP works with companies to help them comply with regulations and enforces laws to control emissions which cause acid rain
.The department requires the placement of sophisticated electronic in-stack monitoring equipment to continuously monitor emissions of pollutants from industrial stacks.
Since 1980, this regulatory approach has resulted in a 22 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emitted from coal-fired generating plants.
What Can You Do To Reduce Acid Rain Formation? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conserve electricity.
Most of our electricity comes from high-sulfur coal-burning power plants.
If we use less electricity, we burn less coal.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use automobiles less.
Instead, car pool, use mass transit, walk or bike.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Collect water/snow samples locally and test them for pH.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Contact local environmental groups about their involvement in the acid rain issue.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Study historical sites, buildings or monuments in your area and determine how they are being affected by acid rain.
Acid Rain Facts Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nationally, 120,000 tons of SO2 and NOx are emitted into the air each day.
Pennsylvania contributes 7,000 tons of the pollutants each day.
Ã¯Â¿Â½
The National Academy of Science estimates damage from acid rain to be at least $5 billion a year in the eastern United States alone.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In Gettysburg, civil war memorials are being destroyed by acid rain.
Throughout Pennsylvania, acid rain is affecting buildings, gravestones and house and car paint.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acid rain seriously American streams.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Pennsylvania that 100 streams trout species, and miles of the state' s threatens 60,000 miles of DEP' Efforts to Decrease Acid Rain s Because of the importance of studying acid precipitation in the Commonwealth, DEP and the Pennsylvania State University established a monitoring network in 1981.
The objectives of the network are: 1. to determine the magnitude and distribution of acid rain in Pennsylvania; 2. to assess potential environmental impacts; and 3. to determine yearly trends in the chemistry of precipitation in the state.
Fish and Boat Commission states are too acidic to support certain studies indicate that 6,500 square trout streams are " critically acidic."
