5 Â· Educational Service Delivery While the Lake County School District generally offers efficient and effective educational services and programs to its students, it could improve in several areas.
The district should ensure that all major programs operate from strategic plans and are periodically evaluated so that critical decisions are based on information linked to program goals and objectives.
Conclusion
____________________________________________________
The Lake County School District (the district) generally offers students efficient and effective educational services and programs, and has had several notable accomplishments, as noted in Exhibit 5-1.
At the same time, throughout this chapter, ValienteHernandez P.A. has identified a number of improvements that, if implemented, will improve educational service delivery.
ValienteHernandez P.A. examined the district's educational programs based on best practice standards established in the following four broad areas: operations of K-12 instructional programs;
Â· Â· Â·
acquisition, replacement and disposal of instructional materials; analysis of performance data and evaluation of educational programs; and library media and support services.
-1 Exhibit 5-1
The District Has Had a Number of Notable Accomplishments in the Educational Service Delivery Area in the Past Two Years Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Under the state's accountability system, most of the district's schools are graded "B" and for two consecutive years, none has been graded as an "F" school.
The district increased in the number of A and B schools from 6 in 1999 to 14 in 2000, to 18 in 2001.
In 2001, 18 of 34 schools received grades at an A or B level.
FCAT Reading scale scores increased from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 in elementary, middle and high schools.
FCAT Mathematic scale scores increased from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 in elementary, middle and high schools.
FCAT Writing/Florida Writes! Combined scale scores increased from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 in elementary, middle and high schools.

Overall, ValienteHernandez P.A. found that: Operations of K-12 Instructional Programs Â· District administrators use academic and nonacademic data to a certain extent, but need to define a more structured student performance review function and refine the process that addresses test results and strategies for educational improvement.
(Page 5-8) The district would benefit from targeting and disseminating effective instructional practices to improve student performance.
(Page 5-26) The district generally provides effective Exceptional Student Education (ESE) programs.
The programs could be further improved by refining the procedures to evaluate program performance.
(Page 5-28) The district's English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program is presently being restructured and therefore striving to improve.
(Page 5-38) The district provides effective and cost-efficient secondary vocational and adult/technical education program that could be further improved by seeking employer feedback more formally.
(Page 5-51) The district's curriculum framework is aligned to the Florida Accountability Standards and to the Sunshine State Standards.
This framework can be improved by developing a more formal system to methodically guide curriculum development and implementation.
(Page 5-57) The district has adopted a plan for the progression of students from kindergarten through grade 12 that maximizes student mastery of the Sunshine State Standards and that could be further improved by strengthening the long-term effects of helping students that do not meet expectations.
(Page 5-69) The district's School Improvement Plans should translate identified needs into activities with measurable objectives more clearly.

Acquisition, Replacement and Disposal of Instructional Materials Â· Â· The district's process for selecting instructional materials ensures that instructional materials meet the needs of teachers and students.
(Page 5-78) Each student has current appropriate instructional materials in core courses that are aligned with the Sunshine State Standards and the district's pupil progression plan.
However, the district should seek feedback from different stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of instructional materials.
(Page 5-79) While the district has procedures for acquiring, maintaining, and disposing of instructional materials.
However, the district could further improve by raising general consciousness to preserve books.
(Page 5-83)
Â·
Analysis of Performance Data and Evaluation of Educational Programs Â· Â· The district needs to implement accountability mechanisms to ensure the overall performance, efficiency, and effectiveness of its major educational programs.
(Page 5-86) The district regularly reviews its organizational structure and the staffing of the central office and schools to minimize administrative layers and processes.
However, the district's staffing formula has been repeatedly circumvented in the past.
(Page 5-87) The district does not clearly report on the performance and cost-efficiency of its major educational programs to ensure accountability to parents and other taxpayers.

Library, Media and Support Services Â· The district has sufficient school library or media centers to support instruction.
The district can improve by expanding the library services at all schools to be accessible at all times.
(Page 5-90) The district provides necessary support services (guidance counseling, psychological, social work, and health) to meet the needs of its students in a cost-efficient manner.

Fiscal Impact of Recommendations
________________________
Most recommendations in this chapter have little or no fiscal impact as they can be implemented utilizing existing resources of the district.
There are two action plan items that have a fiscal impact as indicated in Exhibit 5-2.
One of these action plans includes costs related to adding two program specialists positions to K-12 Curriculum and Instruction department that will help the district gain operative effectiveness.
Another recommendation will bring additional funds to the district by filing for Medicaid direct services reimbursement.

Educational Service Delivery
The Lake County School District has a total of 47 schools distributed throughout the county's 954 square miles as of April 2001.
Appendix B shows the geographic location of the campuses.
Of the 47 schools, 23 are elementary, 9 are middle, 7 are high schools, and 8 are special schools and centers.
Two of the schools are magnet schools and three are charter schools (in conversion charter and two private charter).
The district does not operate any of its schools on a year-round schedule and high schools operate under block schedules.
For the Fiscal Year 1999-2000 the operating costs (defined as the per-student cost for school operations) was $4,363 and within peer district average.
Under the authority of s. 229.592(9), Florida Statutes, 26 of Lake County's campuses have requested waivers from those statutes that relate to instruction and school operation.
Mostly, the waivers awarded pertain to dress code (10 schools) and to instructional materials (9 schools).
In Lake County, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction heads the delivery of educational services.
As shown in Exhibit 5-3, this sector of the organization is made up of six departments --Basic Pre-K-12 Curriculum and Instruction, Exceptional Student Education, Federal Compensatory Education, Vocational-Technical Education, Student Services and Media and Staff Development.
At the time of this review, school principals reported to the Superintendent (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3-5).

Delivery of K-12 Educational Programs The district's K-12 programs can be divided into four main areas: Â· Â· Â· Â· basic education, exceptional student education (ESE), compensatory education (alternative education/dropout prevention), and vocational education.
Subsequent paragraphs provide a brief overview of each of these areas.
Basic Education Basic education refers to a wide-array of through 12th grade students who do not curriculum including the core academic reading, as well as fine arts and physical curriculum and instruction that is offered to pre-kindergarten require special educational services.
Schools offer a total areas such as English, mathematics, science, social studies, and education courses.
Exceptional Student Education An exceptional student is any child or youth enrolled in or eligible for enrollment in a district public school that requires special instruction or special education services.
In Lake County, the programs are provided in the schools and through contracted services and there is at least one ESE program in each school.
The district currently serves close to 5,900 ESE students, which is about 20% of the total student population.
Currently, the district providing special education services under 17 of the 19 existing categories of exceptionalities.
Exhibit 5-4 shows the detail of the exceptional population of students in Lake County.

Educational Service Delivery
Compensatory Education The Lake County School District provides programs and services that are federally funded.
These funds are allocated to provide opportunities and assistance to students so they can achieve the standards in the local curriculum and acquire the educational skills developed for all children.
These programs include Title I, Title I Migrant and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).
Title I provides ancillary support services to students who need extra assistance in reaching academic and social goals.
The children that the program serves reside in school attendance areas with high concentrations of children from low income families.
The federal government provides funds for the program in addition to the funding provided by the district.
For a Lake County school to qualify for Title I services, 35% or more of its students must meet the criteria for free and reduced lunch.
Thirteen (13) of the district's 24 Title I schools have school wide programs that serve all students in the school.
The remaining school is a targeted assistance school that serves only students in the school who meet eligibility criteria.
The district's ESOL program serves approximately 970 students, which represents 3% of the student population.
ESOL is carried through English immersion in which the students are mainstreamed.
Vocational Education The Vocational Â­ Technical, Adult and Community Education department is aligned under the following sections: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· K-12 Vocational and Technical Education; Workforce Development Education that includes: Postsecondary Vocational Education, Adult General Education; and Community Education.
The K-12 Vocational and Technical program serves approximately 11,000 seventh through twelfth grade students with various program areas such as health assistance, automotive technology, culinary arts, digital publishing, television production, web design, veterinary assistance, etc.
The Postsecondary Vocational program serves approximately 650 full-time and 2,000 part-time students at any given time and the various programs are operated through a state-of-the-art technical center.
Through the Adult General Education program the district offers free, individualized or self-paced instruction to individuals who do not have a high school diploma and are not enrolled in a regular day school.
Community Education is 100% self-supported and offers courses designed to meet nonacademic needs in the community with special focus on life long learning needs of society.
Student Support Services In Lake County, the Student Services Department provides the services below.
Â· Â· Â· Psychological Services Social Work Services Guidance Services

Â·
School Health Services
Guidance services are provided to help students who are facing problems that interfere with their health, social skills, or educational development.
Examples of guidance services are career planning and education, teen pregnancy education, teen suicide, truancy, abuse, etc.
As required by the School Health Services Act, Florida Statutes 402.32, the school district and the Lake County Health Department jointly develop a school health services plan to appraise, protect, and promote the health of students.
County health nurses periodically review student health records for compliance with state statutes and complete a records review form indicating any non-compliance issues.
The nurses also provide health services to schools.
There is a School Health Committee and Health Plan as required by the State Department of Health.
The services of the school psychologists in the district focus the delivery of services to students based on the needs of each individual school.
Instructional Support Services Instructional Support Services in the district is organized under the Supervisor of Media/ Staff Development/Instructional Materials.
With respect to instructional materials and media, this supervisor is responsible for overseeing the districts instructional program for selecting, processing, and evaluating textbooks and materials; for providing a professional library of books and periodicals for district-wide use and maintains a library of county adopted textbooks and related teaching aides; and for supervising overall aspects of the district's instructional media program to include multimedia (audio, visual, print and television services) In an average school year, the district's central media center provides monitoring, technical assistance, and personnel for 42 school libraries, circulates approximately 2,115 videos to the district's schools (checkouts), and provides approximately 231 staff development hours specifically to media specialists.
Methodology
___________________________________________________
ValienteHernandez P.A. used different methods in assessing the district's performance related to the best practices for educational service delivery.
ValienteHernandez P.A. reviewed the self-assessment instruments completed by seven staff members and conducted interviews with the supervisor of the educational programs (Exceptional Student Education, Vocational/Technical and Adult Education, PK-12 Curriculum and Instruction, Federal Compensatory Education, Media and Staff Development, and Student Services) and made inquires with the superintendent and assistant superintendent, key staff members and the five members of the school board.
Associated evidence was examined and analyzed.
Compliance with rules and regulations was assessed through revisions of existing policies and procedures and consultation with related organizations such as the Florida Department of Education and the Florida School Boards Association.
ValienteHernandez P.A. also obtained information from the group of peer districts chosen for this project (Alachua, Charlotte, Okaloosa, Osceola, St. Johns, and Santa Rosa County School District).
Organizations that guide and rule the administration of different educational programs were also contacted.
Examples are the Office of Multicultural Student Language Education (OMSLE), Florida

Education 
To obtain program input from school administrators and district staff ValienteHernandez P.A. designed and administered surveys to Principals and Assistant Principals, Teachers, School Advisory Council (SAC) members, Parents and District Administrative Staff.
The questions varied from group to group and the survey results have been incorporated in different sections of this chapter.
Findings and Recommendations
_____________________________
Operation of K-12 Instr uctional Programs Goal A:
___________________________
The district operates effective and efficient K-12 educational programs.
1
District administrators use academic and nonacademic data to a certain extent but need to define a more structured student performance review function and refine the process that addresses test results and strategies for educational improvement.
The highest priority of a school district is to improve performance of all students.
To accomplish this objective, school districts must consider overall academic performance as well as the academic progress of specific subcategories of students.
Effective use of performance data assists districts in making sound decisions concerning programming and instruction.
To utilize data effectively school districts should adhere to the following process: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· disaggregating data by school, program, and subpopulations of interest; tracking cohorts of students over time; disseminating results to stakeholders; using data to plan programming and instruction; comparing with peer districts; and re-evaluating.
The degree to which the Lake County School District adheres to this process is analyzed in the subsequent pages.
5-8
ValienteHernandez P.A.
Educational Service Delivery
The District Has Processes in Place to Analyze the Results of State and District Student Academic Assessment Tests Gain By May of each year, the district receives data for test results on Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) and High School Competency Test (HSCT) from the Department of Education (DOE).
For each assessment, the district prepares summary reports that are presented to the individual schools and curriculum staff.
At the individual school level, each principal receives a printed copy of the reports issued by DOE.
Principals share the data with the instructional staff and to the extent possible, principal and staff analyze the scores at the school level.
At the classroom level, each teacher receives hard copy score sheets for the school and for their students.
This data is jointly analyzed with the school principal to then proceed to change instruction accordingly.
According to instructional staff, the reporting structure utilized by DOE (Florida Department of Education) makes it difficult for school administrators to analyze the scores at the school and the individual student level.
Additionally, instructional staff manifested that FCAT does not provide information at the benchmark level, which makes it difficult to zero in on specific items.
In an effort to overcome the limitations and the volume of the reports presented by DOE, the district designed PACE (Performance Achievement through Curriculum Enhancement) as its own process for test results analysis and management.
PACE is a two-fold process.
Part of it consists on a summer workshop held each year where instructional teams from each school undergo training on test results analyses.
The training is administered by outside consultants although district personnel support the instructional teams with hands-on analyses.
The other part of PACE is an actual assessment software developed by the district using some products provided by DOE plus some customization.
This software is the tool instructional teams utilize to manipulate and analyze the data.
The ultimate goal of the summer workshop is that each school develops the PACE Plan.
During the PACE workshop analyses of the test results must be summarized through a status statement for each problem area identified.
The status statement includes strategy, goals, objectives, resources, etc. necessary to address each problem area.
At the conclusion of the workshop each instructional team must put together the blueprint to build the PACE Plan.
The instructional teams take this blueprint to their schools and with input from school instructional staff, finalize the PACE plan.
Schools are encouraged to translate and tie the plan into goal 3 of their annual School Improvement Plan.
The PACE Plans are examined by the Basic K-12 Curriculum and Instruction department.
The curriculum from each subject area is analyzed to determine if additional materials or additional instruction need to take place.
If there are "holes" in the curriculum, these are addressed with individual schools to make sure that what is being tested is being taught at the appropriate grade levels.
This includes looking at textbook and supplemental materials adoptions.
The extent to which data is analyzed and disaggregated however, ultimately depends on the individual approach of each principal and his/her instructional team.
The use of additional information made available by DOE is also the discretion of individual campuses.
While some schools and programs are effective in using this information to evaluate educational programs other schools and programs may need more direction in using these data to make sound instructional decisions about educational programming.
To improve this process the district should refine the results evaluation and accountability components of the student performance review mechanism.
The district should to adopt a policy that requires the district
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-9
Educational Service Delivery
to evaluate educational programs based not only on student assessment linked to the Sunshine State Standards, but on the results of the PACE Plan designed by individual schools.
Current board policy contains no references to evaluation of educational programs.
To accomplish this, the district must also expand training of school administrators and increase its curriculum technology base.
Generally, the Information Presented to the District and to the Schools Does Not Include Peer Comparisons or Assessments for Cohorts of Students Useful in Evaluating and Improving Student Performance The Testing and Evaluation unit is responsible for producing summary reports of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT), High School Competency Test (HSCT) and Stanford Achievement Test (SAT9).
These reports show the current overall results of the district and a comparison of these against the state standards for the current year plus, a historic outlook of the results.
These summary reports however, do not contain data to allow comparisons against peer districts or within schools that have similar resources, or have students with similar social and economic characteristics.
This type of information is key in establishing benchmarks, setting strategies for improvement and facilitates giving proper curricular assistance to schools.
Additionally, district and school administrators do not examine test achievement information by cohorts of students or by student subpopulations on a consistent basis.
1 The main obstacle to this is the limited technology capacity the district has to report data to schools, as is further discussed on pages 5-10.
Tracking this information is useful to the district in improving student performance.
The district can provide decision makers and stakeholders key information by including peer information in the reports using data available in DOE database or school accountability reports.
And as technology becomes available, the district can begin tracking information for cohort analyses useful is tracking student performance.
The District Should Make More Extensive Use of Disaggregated Student Assessment Data to Improve Performance of Subgroups of Students and to Evaluate Effectiveness of Educational Programs The district has not concentrated on data analyses through disaggregated reporting and has rather focused on identifying low performing blocks of students.
As a result, school and district administrators are unable to examine test achievement information by subpopulations on a consistent basis.
District staff expressed that the reason for using this approach are the timelines and the reporting structure utilized by DOE. DOE makes disaggregated reports available for all academic assessments, but according to district administrators, these do not arrive at a timely manner.
2 Typically FCAT assessment occurs in February and March with the bulk of results arriving by the middle of May.
Disaggregated reports typically arrive in August and by then the district has already produced its summary reports.
Cohort analysis consists on observing the test results of a group of students that stay together as they advance through school.

Currently DOE does not include Mobility and Free or Reduced Lunch data in the disaggregated reports.
5-10
ValienteHernandez P.A.
Educational Service Delivery
The district must provide thorough accessibility to disaggregated data to improve performance of subgroups of students and evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs on a more consistent basis.
This can be accomplished by first modeling the analysis process district-wide and secondly, providing the schools with an additional electronic component to the assessment review tool.
The PACE assessment review tool can have a component added that helps analyze and track disaggregated data and the district has plans to do this in the year 2002-03.
Additionally, district can utilize FIRN (Florida Information Resource Network) disaggregated data to incorporate peer group information.
Examples of subgroups of students are: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· minority students; students in dropout prevention programs; students in free or reduced lunch programs; students with high mobility rates; ESE gifted students; and ESOL students.
District Administrators Should Use Nonacademic Data More Extensively to Further Improve the Educational Programs Different programs within the district track and utilize nonacademic data to improve student performance.
The use of nonacademic data however, needs to be expanded and linked to a district-wide accountability mechanism to improve effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the educational programs.
Examples of nonacademic data and their status in the district are: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· attendance and absenteeism rates, tracked by Student Services; graduation rate, tracked by Student Services department; disciplinary actions data is tracked by SAFE Schools program; dropout rate, tracking could not be verified; mobility rate, tracking could not be verified; and class size, tracking could not be verified.
Comparison of additional nonacademic data for Lake County and the peer districts is presented in Chapter 4 of this report.
We recommend that the district determine what nonacademic data currently tracked can be of use by other departments within the districts and that the district begin tracking those variables that currently are not being monitored.
There are other resources available that should be used more intensively by the district such as FIRN (Florida Information Resource Network) and the School Indicators Report produced by DOE.
The District Needs to Expand Its Curriculum Technology and Integrate All the Information Systems The Lake County School District's management information system maintains performance data from various sources, which are reported to schools as they become available.
The district does not currently have the technology necessary to report data to schools in additional formats that make useful student
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-11
Educational Service Delivery
performance information more accessible to schools and district administrators.
Several district employees stated that they have to request performance data or that they have to manipulate the data themselves.
The district does not have an interoperable electronic tool for curriculum management and planning.
Because of this, the district and its instructional staff are unable to readily link its curriculum to the Sunshine State Standards, the National Content Standards and any locally defined district or school-based standards.
The absence of such a tool also limits the district's capacity to track, collect and analyze student performance, make projections of future performance and conduct comparative analyses.
Additionally, the district would benefit from a mechanism that centralizes the monitoring of student performance, evaluates progress made by individual schools in a comprehensive manner and emphasizes accountability for improvement.
The district relies on individual schools to evaluate student progress and provides the PACE instrument as a district-wide process to evaluate test results and establishing strategies for improvement.
Integrating all the information systems currently in place and adopting a curriculum management tool will greatly contribute to refining of the accountability component of the student performance mechanism and allow the district gain added consistency in tracking student performance.
It is noted that as another effort to expand its curriculum and instructional technology, the district has contemplated building an Access database in the future that makes available query processes as needed.
Results of Student Academic Assessments Indicate the Overall Performance of the Lake County School District Is Comparable to Its Peers Analyses conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. generally reflected that the scores achieved by the district are in line with its peers and within state averages.
Furthermore, overall performance is rising.
Lake County administers a series of tests to its students throughout the year to measure their performance against the Sunshine State Standards.
The main tests are the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) and the High School Competency Test (HSCT).
Other tests administered in Lake County are the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT9), the Otis-Lennon Ability Test (OLSAT) plus another nine optional tests.
On the whole, Lake County Schools scored at a higher level than the state on four out of the six tests.
However, when compared to average scored by the peer districts, all but one of the scores of Lake as a whole, are below the peer average.
Exhibit 5-5 illustrates the most recent results of FCAT for students in Lake County and its peer districts.
Â· Â· FCAT measures students' proficiency in reading and mathematics in grades 4,5, 8 and 10.
The results are reported in terms of five achievement levels: Level 5 indicates that students have success with the most challenging content of the Sunshine State Standards.
Students at this level answer most of the questions correctly, including the most challenging questions.
Level 4 indicates that students have success with challenging content of the Sunshine State Standards.
Students at this level answer most of the questions correctly, but have only some success with questions that reflect the most challenging content.
Level 3 indicates that students have partial success with the challenging content of the Sunshine State Standards but performance is inconsistent.
Students at this level answer many questions correctly but are generally not successful with questions that are most challenging.

1998 - 2001 FCAT Results.
Lake County's Scores on the FCAT Writing Test Are Generally Comparable to State Average The FCAT Writing test also known as the Florida Writing Assessment Program (FWAP) is an assessment that measures student writing proficiency in Grades 4, 8, and 10.
The test requires students to write responses to assigned topics in a single testing period.
Prior to the year 2000, writing was assessed separately through a test called Florida Writes! The characteristics of Florida Writes! were carried into FCAT and the students are currently scored holistically by two raters on a 6-point scale ranging from 1, the lowest score to 6, the highest score.
As shown in exhibit 5-7, the most recent results of Lake County Schools are similar to the state average.
Lake's scores are below to those of its peers in the fourth and eighth grades.

Lake County's Percentage of Students Passing the High School Competency Test Is Comparable to That of the Peers Florida students who entered high school in 1998-1999 or earlier must pass the High School Competency Test (HSCT) in order to be eligible for a regular high school or adult school diploma.
The test was administered to students in communications and mathematics in eleventh grade and if they didn't pass, they must retake it during twelfth.
As the state guidelines were modified, students that were ninth graders starting year 2000-01 must take the FCAT for graduation purposes.
The High School Competency Test (HSCT) measures the extent to which the state student performance standards in reading, writing, and mathematics have been achieved.
Exhibit 5-9 shows that Lake County students had a passing rate higher than the state and equal to the peer districts.

School Accountability Report 2000-01.
Recommendations Â·
____________________________________________
We recommend that the district strengthen the evaluation and accountability components of the student performance review mechanism currently in place.
To accomplish this, the district needs to adopt a policy that requires the district to assess educational programs and to evaluate school administrators based not only on student assessment linked to the Sunshine State Standards, but on the end results of the PACE Plan designed by individual schools.
As an integral part of this strategy, we recommend that the district increase its curriculum technology capacity and expand training of school administrators (see Recommendation 6 below).
Â·
We recommend that the district include peer information in the summary reports currently issued, especially for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).
Peer groups should not be limited to similar school districts.
Comparisons should also be made within Lake county schools that have similar resources, or have students with similar social and economic characteristics.
The district should use the resources available in DOE databases for this purpose.
As technology becomes available and data is generated, we further recommend that the district begin tracking information to conduct student cohort analyses.
We recommend that the district take the necessary steps to provide thorough accessibility to disaggregated data needed to improve performance of subgroups of students and to evaluate

Educational Service Delivery
the cost-effectiveness of educational programs and/or of instructional practices.
This can be accomplished by first modeling the analysis process district-wide and secondly, providing the schools with an additional electronic component to the assessment review tool.
The PACE assessment review tool can have a component added that helps analyze and track disaggregated data and the district has plans to do this in the year 2002-03.
Additionally, the district should consider implementing the following steps: collect student performance data for selected subgroups and document in report form; disseminate reports on selected subgroups to interested stakeholders; and plan to develop, modify or enhance instructional programs for selected subgroups as
needed
Once disaggregated data procedures are instituted, we further recommend that the district methodically identify specific strategies for improving student performance, especially of schools with the highest percentage of economically disadvantaged (eligible for the federal free or reduce price lunch program) students.
Staff should look for and identify interrelated characteristics that can be replicated by other schools.
At the same time, schools should continually seek innovative ways of meeting the needs of diverse populations.
This can be accomplished by developing its specific strengths through a collaborated effort including strong leadership from principals and assistant principals.
Strategies for improving performance among economically disadvantaged students can include: frequent staff training, small class sizes, strong parent/school partnerships, successful grant writing efforts by a school-based team positive attitudes, and good relationships among principals and faculty.
Â·
We recommend that the district determine what nonacademic data currently tracked by certain departments can be of use by other shops within the district to improve student performance.
Additionally, we recommend that the district begin tracking those variables currently not being monitored such as dropout rate, mobility rate and class size.
For this purpose, the district should use the resources available in FIRN (Florida Information Resource Network) and the School Indicators Report produced by DOE.
We recommend that the district further expand its curriculum technology capacity by adopting an interactive and interconnected curriculum management tool.
An electronic curriculum management tool is an excellent resource for strategic planning and has the capacity of tracking student performance collecting, analyzing, and making projections about future student performance for each school.
Through its use and by the individual school progress profiles and analyses that report FCAT scores, the district should adjust teaching techniques and curricula to address weak areas in the educational program on a consistent basis.
Â·
Action Plan 6-8 Chapter 6 shows the necessary steps to implement this recommendation.
Â·
We recommend that the district integrate all the formal and informal information systems currently in place to create a district-wide student performance review mechanism.
This mechanism centralizes the monitoring of student performance, evaluates the progress made by individual schools, emphasizes accountability for improvement and can be used to establish the cost-effectiveness of the educational programs.
This mechanism should be the responsibility of the newly created office of Program Evaluation and Accountability.

ValienteHernandez P.A.
Educational Service Delivery
The district's Curriculum and Instruction department in conjunction with the newly created office of Program Evaluation and Accountability (see Action Plan 3-4 Recommendation 2) should be responsible for creating individual school progress profiles and analyses of the scores for previous years as well as projections.
The projections can be based on FCAT passing rates and involve a comparison between projected passing rates and the district's goal.
The analysis should be completed for all areas tested, for different ethnic groups, and for economically disadvantaged (eligible for the federal free or reduce price lunch program) students.
After that, principals and teachers can use the data and other information identified to adjust teaching techniques and curricula and to address areas of identified weaknesses.
As the process develops, school administrators can be trained to overtake the process.

The district would benefit from targeting and disseminating effective instructional practices to improve student performance.
Successful educational practices are somewhat disseminated informally by some school administrators.
However, there are no widespread mechanisms to consistently capture and disseminate successful instructional practices.
The District Should Explore Innovative Methods to Provide Incentives to Outstanding Teachers Presently there are no formal mechanisms in place to recognize schools or teachers for identifying and using methods to challenge high performing student or to bring students requiring remedial instruction up to standards.
Through the survey conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. a majority of teachers (74%) indicated that there are no incentives to identify and effectively use successful instructional practices.
Refer to Exhibit 5-12.
The district has written policies to reward employees whose work performance is above average or outstanding.
According to school administrators however, the district it is unable to fully implement these policies due to fiscal constraints, The district would benefit by exploring and implementing a variety of mechanisms to show appreciation for outstanding teachers and/or teachers using exemplary practices.
Their most widely known recognition is the Teacher of the Year award; educators are also recognized if they accomplish the National Board classification.
These teachers of outstanding merit are presented at a board meeting as a special time of recognition.
Exemplary Practices Need To Be Communicated More Effectively As shown in Exhibit 5-12, school principals feel that school administrators communicate exemplary practices somewhat informally.
Additionally, some administrators expressed that a history of poor communication between the schools and the administrative staff has been an obstacle for effective spread of good practices.
The new administration, however, is working to improve communication.
There are several ways that successful practices can be shared amongst curriculum and instructional staff and communicated district-wide.
These include regular meetings among the assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, and directors, as well as monthly or weekly publications that can be distributed to principals and district administrators on relevant information on district events, changes in procedures, etc.
Another forum for sharing best practices are the monthly curriculum contact meetings.
These meetings are also a great opportunity for low-performing schools be paired with successful schools and encouraged to visit them to identify strategies that might be suitable for their operation.

Recommendations dations Â·
____________________________________________
We recommend that the district provide incentives to and recognize exceptionally successful teachers.
These can include regular meetings among the assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, and directors, as well as monthly or weekly publications that can be distributed to principals and district administrators on relevant information on district events, changes in procedures, etc.
Another forum for sharing best practices are the monthly curriculum contact meetings.
These meetings are also a great opportunity for low-performing schools to be paired with higher performing schools and encouraged to visit them to identify strategies that might be suitable for their operation.
As an integral part of this strategy, we recommend that the district continue to improve communication between key areas to promote and contribute to the diffusion exemplary practices.
For example, the district should explore the methods of creating a unit or lesson plan data bank to share best practices.
Action Plan 5-2 shows the steps needed to implement this recommendation.

The district generally provides effective Exceptional Student Education (ESE) programs.
The programs could be further improved by refining the procedures to evaluate program performance.
The Exceptional Student Education (ESE) programs are provided in the Lake County schools throughout the district.
There is at least one ESE program in each school and there are approximately 6,000 students in Lake County who receive services through the special programs.
Some highlights about the Exceptional Student Education programs administered in Lake County include those below.
Â· Â· Â· Students are served who are ages three (3) through twenty-one (21), based on the Individual Educational Plan.
Each student has an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) developed with the teacher, the parent and other professionals who have information about the student.
The Cooperative Consultation Model provides support for exceptional students in a mainstream class through systematic identification of modifications and adaptations to instruction in order for the student to be successful.
Training is provided for schools through the district office.

The Co-Teaching Model is an educational approach in which a regular education and a special education instructor teach together in a classroom with both regular and exceptional education students.
Students who are identified as severely emotionally disturbed (SED) are served through a contract program with LifeStream Behavioral Center.
The program provides both educational and therapeutic components.
The district takes advantage of community and social services programs to supplement district programs.
There is an Interagency Agreement that is signed each year for services for specific populations (such as ARC, the Association of Retarded Citizens that serves students who have graduated and are mentally handicapped; Vocational Rehabilitation works with appropriate referrals for transition).
An emphasis on increasing Parent Education participation by offering training, support and services.
A Parent Education Program Specialist has been employed to implement this initiative.
Parent workshops will be scheduled throughout the 2001-02 school year.
A fast growing Pre-K program for students with disabilities now located at several sites throughout the district.
These services have been instrumental in providing eligible children a quality learning intervention program.
Efforts to recruit and retain ESE teachers are implemented such as using ESE Clerical Assistants to help ESE teachers and school personnel with the necessary paperwork requirements and the use of a computerized forms process to increase efficiency.

The District's Procedures Related to ESE Students Are Consistent With Federal and State Laws The exceptional education programs are subject to federal and/or state rules and regulations that guide the delivery of educational services.
Examples of these laws are Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) also referred to as Public Law 105-17, s. 612(a)(5)(A).
To ensure that the procedures are up to date and consistent with the laws, the ESE department completes the Special Programs and Procedures document annually and submits it to both the school board and the Department of Education, as specified by DOE.
School board policies and procedures are adopted as needed based on the latest legal advice.
The supervisor of the department is responsible for this process.

The District Has Incorporated Performance Standards for ESE Students and These Have Been Incorporated Into the Curriculum.
The district's ESE program uses the Sunshine State Standards for awarding a Special Diploma as the high school level academic standards.
At the elementary and middle school levels, the regular Sunshine State Standards are incorporated in the curriculum with appropriate modifications on an as needed basis for each exceptional student.
Regular and special education staff meets regularly to plan curriculum objectives and develop cooperative activities.
There is a Curriculum department staff meeting held two times per month, where the Supervisors communicate and coordinate activities and there are also Staff Development meetings where ESE is included.
Another practice to increase effectiveness include "cross training" of individuals in the ESE program.
The following takes place: Â· Â· Â· Â· regular education staff receive training in Special Education; special Education staff receive training offered for regular education; principals and other administrators receive training in Special Education; and to a limited extent, regular staff receives training in gifted and talented education.

Placement of ESE Students in the Regular Classroom Is Higher in Lake County Than Most of Its Peer Districts in the Year 2000-01 The district has in place detailed procedures to guarantee that that the least restrictive environment is provided and there are various alternatives to accomplish this.
On the Staffing Committee Report (MIS 52B009), the placement options are considered according to the continuum of services.
The Least Restrictive Environment Guide (MIS 52B029) is used with each student as deemed appropriate.
Lake County uses the least restrictive environment (LRE) to determine appropriate educational placement for each student with a disability.
According to Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), each local education agency shall ensure that "To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate school, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational, environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be reached satisfactorily."
The LRE concept is supported by a continuum of placements ranging from the general education classroom to home/hospital care.
The decision-making process concerning placement decisions for students with disabilities is unique for each student and is based on his or her need for instructional accommodations and related services.
The LRE issue is not a simple issue for school districts.
Decisions about how and when to include students with disabilities into regular education must consider equitable allocation of resources, effective and efficient service, vulnerability to legal challenges based on current court rulings, and philosophical beliefs about how best to balance meeting the needs of students with disabilities with those of non-disabled students.
According to district staff, most of the students with disabilities spend some part of the week in a classroom with non-disabled students.
The amount of time individual students spend in the regular classroom, in resource rooms or in other education settings is determined based on the needs of the individual student.
Exhibit 5-15 shows the variety of placements for students with disabilities for Lake and its peer districts.
The district has made significant progress in serving its students with disabilities in less restrictive environments.
Students with disabilities spend increasing amounts of time in the regular classroom.
For example, during 1999-2000 53% (2,446) students with disabilities were in the regular classroom and by 2000-01, this number increased to 2,525 or 54% (refer to Exhibit 5-15).
Principals and Teachers Generally Believe That the Assessment and Placement of ESE Students Is Not Timely Results of a survey conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. indicate that most responding principals (60%) and teachers (77%) believe that the assessment and placement of ESE students is not timely, shown in Exhibit 5-46.
Assessment and placement of ESE students are two different components of a process that occurs in three steps (Pre-ESE, ESE, Student Services) and that involves two departments: ESE and Student Services.
These two components however, are viewed as one and the district needs to take steps to better the constituents' perception and understanding of the process as a whole.
Further discussion on this issue can be found on page 5-84.
Recommendation to improve how constituents perceive the process is presented in Action Plan 5-11.

Lake County's Gifted Students Population Is Below Its Peers and the State The percentage of gifted students in Lake County is below both its peer districts and state's average, as illustrated in Exhibit 5-16.
In Lake County, gifted and talented programs are offered at the elementary and middle school levels.
At the high school levels, there are options such as dual enrollment with the community college, honors and advanced placement courses.
The process to identify gifted students is described in the Special Programs and Procedures document.
Basically, the screening occurs using a variety of referral sources and group achievement or IQ tests.
The evaluation includes the Checklist of Characteristics, the individual intelligence test, and the statement of need for a special program.
There has been a Plan B approved for use in the district for culturally different students.
See the Special Programs and Procedures book.
Through the use of Plan B the district's gifted program criterion support student diversity.

Profiles of Florida School Districts 1999 - 2000
The District Could Increase Medicaid Reimbursement Medicaid Reimbursement in the State of Florida The Federal Government allows school districts that serve children with special needs to be reimbursed for part of the cost of these services.
Reimbursement can be claimed for two major but separate functions.
The first function requires the identification of Eligible Children.
This is called Administrative Services or Administrative Outreach.
The second function is providing the special instructional programs that these children are entitled to receive.
This is called Direct Services or Fee for Services.
To identify eligible children, school districts must employ the services of people such as Guidance Counselors, Social Workers, School Psychologists, Nurses, and Transportation Route Coordinators.
The time that these persons spend in identifying, screening, and placing these children into special educational programs can be billed as Administrative Services.
Most if not all of Florida's 67 school districts are billing for administrative services reimbursement.
A few school districts are billing directly themselves.
Most other districts, however, are contracting this billing work with two major consulting

Educational Service Delivery
firms, MAXIMUS and Deloitte and Touche.
School staff is in charge of gathering the preliminary data needed to submit for administrative services reimbursement while the technical and analytical part of the submittal is performed by the consulting firms.
Billing for direct services is a more complex function.
For this reason all school districts that are billing for this services have utilized consulting firms.
Seminole County has developed a program methodology that may allow school districts to perform their own analysis of data needed for filing for reimbursement.
Recently the state has sanctioned a group of school districts to pilot this program methodology to determine if it will pass Medicaid requirements.
Some of Florida's small school districts and other districts with a small incidence of Medicaid eligible student population have chosen not to file for direct services reimbursement because the small amount of revenue gained would not justify the cost of submitting the claim.
The direct services that school districts can claim reimbursement for are the following: Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech and Language, Social Work Services, Behavior Modification, Guidance Services, Psychological Services, Nursing Services, Teen Parenting, Migrant Education, and Transportation.
In some districts the revenue earned from Administrative Services and from Direct Services reimbursements are placed in the district's general revenue account.
In other districts, a portion of this revenue is given back to the departments that help to complete the paperwork needed to submit the reimbursement applications.
Returning a portion of the reimbursement funds to the departments that assist with the filing of the applications is believed to serve as an incentive for a more complete and accurate data collection procedure maximizing the reimbursement that is attained.
Medicaid Reimbursement in the Lake County School District The Lake County School District has been filing only for Medicaid reimbursement of Administrative Services.
The district has contracted with MAXIMUS Consulting Firm for filing this Medicaid claim.
In Lake County, the total revenue earned from the reimbursement of administrative services has been placed in the district's general revenue fund.
District supervisors involved in the Medicaid reimbursement process believe that a portion of the revenues generated should be returned to the departments to purchase materials and supplies for classroom use.
This incentive could encourage more accurate and complete documentation that the district could recover an even higher rate of reimbursement in this administrative services area.
Direct Services reimbursement has never been claimed by Lake County because there is a strong feeling among staff that the district does not have the time or personnel needed to collect the information and for filing the reimbursement claim in this area.
For the period of June 30, 2000, to March 31, 2000, the total amount reimbursed by Medicaid for Administrative Services was $440,513.
According to a representative from MAXIMUS interviewed by ValienteHernandez P.A., the Lake County School district could realize as much as $256,000 (net) annually (50% in the first year) and approximately $1.15 million over a five-year period (Exhibit 5-17) for Direct Services reimbursement by billing for Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech, and Behavioral Modification services.
At this time Lake County does not claim any reimbursement for Direct Services.
Although the district presently bills and receives reimbursement for Administrative Services, it could increase its earnings in this area if they also billed for the screening and evaluative work performed by their 31 Speech and Language Pathologists, 3 Autistic Teachers, 17 teachers of the emotionally handicapped, 6 teachers of the Profoundly Mentally Handicapped, 5 teachers of the Visually or Hearing Impaired, and 16 teachers of Pre-K Handicapped.

Recommendations Â·
___________________________________________
We recommend that the district go further in the use of nonacademic measures in the Exceptional Student Education Program such as tracking the number of students with disabilities placed in the least restrictive environment.
We recommend that the Student Services department in conjunction with the ESE department carry out an awareness program that facilitates the understanding of the required process for the identification and assessment of ESE students and thus improving the generalized perception that the process is too lengthy.
Action Plan 5-11, Recommendation 2 shows the necessary steps to implement this recommendation.
Â·
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-35
Educational Service Delivery
Â·
We recommend that the district find alternative and innovative methods to boost the number of children identified as gifted.
At the elementary level, screening of all students should be required utilizing the group test results.
Also, the district can form an advisory committee to examine different program delivery methods.
We recommend that the district start filing for Direct Services Reimbursement.
Since this process is much more difficult, the district should either contract the work with a consultant or join a pilot program like the one currently being sanctioned by the state and lead by Seminole County.
Additionally, we recommend that the district return a portion of the reimbursement for administrative services back to the Exceptional Student Education and Student Services child programs that earn these special revenues to be utilized to purchase materials and supplies.
This incentive could encourage staff to document reimbursement data more accurately and more completely so to maximize the dollars that are secured.
Also, we recommend that the district continue to file for Administrative Services reimbursement.
Further, a comparison should be made after data from other districts is gathered in order to ascertain if contracting out or direct filing it is more cost effective and audit proof for the district.
The district has already joined a pilot study lead by Seminole County regarding the administrative services portion of the reimbursement.

The district's English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program is presently being restructured and striving to improve.
Lake County has an English immersion program for the students identified as speakers of other languages or having Limited English Proficiency (LEP).
In the setting of the immersion program, LEP (or ESOL) students are mainstreamed; classes are offered in English for Speakers of Other Languages and ESOL services are provided and accommodations are made within the context of the regular classroom.
The concept of ESOL is not only to teach English to students, but rather to deliver instruction in all areas in a comprehensible manner.
A second option given by the state to provide services to students that speak another language is to make funds available through grants to run a bilingual--dual language--program, where all classes are taught in the second language.
However, districts must have at least 25% of their pupil population classified as Limited English Proficient (LEP) to opt for this alternative.
Lake County, where the LEP population is just 3% (Exhibit 5-20) does not qualify and does not have any plans in place to offer dual language instruction.
Schools with more than 15 students who speak the same second language are assigned a teaching aide who speaks the second language.
By law, teachers who teach these classes must have ESOL training in the instruction and use of ESOL strategies.
Training for ESOL teachers include 300 hours of in-service in ESOL instructional strategies, linguistics, and multi-cultural issues.
The district's LEP Plan requires that, on the elementary level, instruction in Language Arts Through ESOL will be provided by certified teachers who either have the ESOL endorsement or are in the process of acquiring it.
On the secondary level, courses in ESOL Listening and Speaking and ESOL Reading and Writing are offered as needed.

Once classified as LY, the district automatically receives three years of funding for the ESOL program.
If the student has not met the exit criteria after the three years expire, another three years of funding can be awarded.
These cases are not very common, and they require committee meetings to make the determination.
No additional funding is available after the six years, and if the student still doesn't meet the exit criteria, it is the district's responsibility to continue to provide ESOL services.
Students are exited from the ESOL program based on test scores of 33% or above in both reading and writing.
The test utilized for LEP students is the IDEA Proficiency Test (ITP).

District Has Implemented the Recommendations Made by the Office of Multicultural Student Language Education (OMSLE) Mandated by s. 229.565 (Educational evaluation procedures) and s. 233.058 (English language instruction for limited English proficient students) of the Florida Statutes, the state's Office of Multicultural Student Language Education (OMSLE) conducted a review of the Lake County ESOL program during the school year 1998-99.
The main purposes of the review were first, to determine compliance with state law, State Board of Education Rules, and the 1990 League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) et al. v. the State Board of Education Consent Decree; and second, to assist the district in targeting their deficiencies to operate more efficiently.
There were two sensitive issues for which the district's ESOL program was cited.
First and foremost, the district did not offer students an opportunity to remain at the home school site.
Prior to the 2000-01 school year, the district had magnet sites for LEP students.
The students were bused to the appropriate magnet site.
The main inconvenience of the set up was that students would spend extremely long periods of time riding from their homes to their home schools and from there to the magnet site.
The district was also cited for not having bilingual personnel to assist the students with classroom assignments.
As a result, the district decided to eliminate the ESOL magnet sites and started to run the program at the home school level.
This action created much confusion among school based staff that did not have ESOL certification.
It also generated a lot of bad press, because the generalized perception was that the district had eliminated the ESOL program.
The district should present to its stakeholders the improvements that are continually made with the purpose of bettering the public's perception of the ESOL program.
The Number of Teachers That Have the 300 - Hour ESOL Certification Is Comparable With the Peer Districts In order to teach English to limited English proficient students by Florida law, primary Language Arts teachers must be ESOL certified.
Language Arts teachers who do not have the endorsement are declared out-of-field when an LEP student is placed in his/her classroom and consequently are given a time frame of up to six years to obtain the endorsement.
As shown in Exhibit 5-22 presently the number of teachers with this endorsement is in line with the peer districts and has a ratio of certified teachers to LEP students that is within the peer average.
As a result of the changes originated by carrying out the ESOL program

from the home school level, intensive training took place for Language Arts teachers to obtain the required endorsement.
Because the LEP population is small, the district does not make the ESOL endorsement a condition of employment.
As a result of the changes originated by running the ESOL program from the home schools, there was a powerful and unforeseen need for ESOL certified teachers.
The Staff Development department started to offer each of the five required components for the ESOL endorsement each semester and during our summer academy providing teachers three opportunities during the year to take one of the components.
The district should take additional measures for unforeseen circumstances and guarantee that in case the LEP population boosts, and there is a high demand for certified teachers, the district can respond immediately.
Such actions could include: making provisions for having immediate training availability or establishing the goal of having at least one certified teacher in each school.
The district should also bear in mind that in case of unexpected demand OMSLE is a resource that can be used to initiate training for ESOL certification.

The Average Length of Time A Student Must Spend in the ESOL Program Is Within State Average but Could Be Improved LEP students of Lake County remain in the ESOL program 3.11 years which is close to the average of 2.97 years registered for the entire state.
However, students in Lake County stay in the ESOL program almost twice as long as the peer average (1.62 years).
As illustrated in Exhibit 5-24, the average length of time in the program by grade is higher in Lake County for all grades (grades 1 through 12) when compared against the peer districts.
Comparison against the state, reflect that averages of Lake County are higher for five grades (grades 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10) and lower or close to the state average for the remainder seven grades (grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12) There is no minimum or maximum time a student must spend in ESOL and both very short and very long times are flags that bear closer inspection.
Tracking the length of time in the program is an excellent indicator of the effectiveness of the program and periodically compare against peer districts can provide with insight of best practices utilized outside of Lake County what is happening in the local program.
The district could target reasons how ESOL students could meet the ESOL exit criteria quicker.
The District Provides Opportunities for Meaningful Integration Into All-English Instructional Environments ESOL teachers' assistants work with students on an individual basis under the direction of certified teachers.
A variety of text and software materials are provided in cooperation and conjunction with individual schools and other programs.
ESOL works collaboratively with Title I, Migrant, Guidance, and ESE as there is frequent overlap or congruence with those programs.
Supplemental materials coordinated with the currently adopted textbooks in the core courses are acquired on a continuing basis and provided for use by the classroom teachers, teaching assistants, and individual students.
The Rosetta Stone Intensive English CD-ROM courses I and II are being provided for use during the 2001 Â­ 2002 school year.

Accountability Mechanisms For The ESOL Program Can Be Further Improved ESOL is a program that is largely and extensively monitored by the state's OMSLE.
The district largely relies on these evaluations and does not have its own mechanisms.
The ESOL program does not have formal mechanisms in place that use disaggregated data on LEP standardized test scores to evaluate student achievement over the years and of comparison against its peers.
There is room for a process that would help the district gain efficiencies and increase effectiveness by closely monitoring the LEP students' progress in academic achievement as well as in non-academic performance measures.
The district's ESOL core curriculum and instructional design includes detailed benchmarks that correlate a variety of ESOL strategies with specific Florida Language Arts Curriculum Framework benchmarks.
These benchmarks indicate in detail, the outcomes that can be expected from the students in the areas of Reading, Writing, Listening, Viewing and Speaking, Language and Literature.
In addition to this, LULAC issues and makes available to each district an annual status report that includes student performance.
Exhibits 5-25 and 5-26 are a compilation of academic data for Lake Schools and its peer districts.

District's Assessment of Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency of the ESOL Programs Could Be Improved The supervisor of the department receives a monthly budget report on ESOL expenditures by cost center and this as close as they get to a true cost analysis.
Measures such as cost per pupil for bilingual education and cost of assessment per bilingual student that would help the district increase productivity and be more effective, are not tracked by the district.

Recommendations Â·
___________________________________________
We recommend that the district establish comprehensive procedures for collecting and analyzing data for ESOL program evaluations.
Data can be obtained from the Office of Multicultural Student Language Education (OMSLE) from its Annual Status Report on the Implementation of the 1990 LULAC, et al. v. State Board of Education, et al.
Consent Decree.
The analyses conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. can be used as a guide for such data collection and analyses.
The reports produced should provide summary information by grade level, school and district concerning performance of Language Enriched Pupils (LEP's).
An example of comprehensive analysis is the district's identification of LEP students who are considered in the "danger-zone."
"Danger-zone" students are those who have not progressed in oral English proficiency.
Such analyses will be provided to principals and other affected personnel and is based on the number of years the student spent in the program and the level of achievement.
Â·
We recommend the district take additional measures for unforeseen demands for ESOL services and guarantee that in case the LEP population boosts, and there is a high demand for certified teachers, the district can respond immediately.
Such actions could include making provisions for having immediate training availability or establishing the goal of having at least one certified teacher in each school.
The district should also bear in mind that in case of unexpected demands OMSLE is a resource that can be used to initiate training for ESOL certification.
The district should present to its stakeholders the improvements that are continually made with the purpose of bettering the public's perception of the ESOL program.

In addition, Community Education offers programs through the extended learning centers at 21 elementary schools and 6 middle schools.
These programs are offered before and after school and focus on enhancing academics and promoting the fine arts.
The district mainstreams the majority of special needs students into the regular vocational programs.
By serving these students, the department meets a primary goal of serving and preparing all students to become productive citizens.
The percentage of special needs students enrolled in vocational programs varies year-to-year between 15% and 25% The department has a district-wide advisory council, a School-To-Work Focus Committee and an advisory committee for each program area, involving over 300 individuals people throughout the district.
The District Continually Updates Courses and Equipment to Meet the Level of Experience Needed by Employers The Vocational Curriculum Frameworks and Student Performance Standards are continuously updated by the Department of Education.
This process includes vocational teachers, administrators and related business/industry members.
The district has a process to guarantee that courses are routinely updated to meet the needs of students and employers.
Each year before the beginning of the new fiscal school year, local educational agencies are given these updated standards.
Additionally, in August of each year there is a district-wide in-service meeting of all vocational-technical teachers, each teacher is given the new years standards for their individual programs.
Vocational and adult/technical education staff continuously the Vocational Enrollment Report (VER) data, visit programs, meet with teachers, administrators and advisory committee members to assure programs are at local industry standard.
Additionally, staff upgrades the Vocational-Technical section of the local district-wide Course Code Directory.
As far as equipment update, the department issues an annual request for equipment needs prioritized by program and completed out by each vocational teacher.
Subsequently, the school administrator takes all program list in his/her school and prioritizes them school wide.
The teacher, principal and the program advisory committee chair must sign these lists.
The most recent advisory committee minutes of each program area must be attached.
These school level equipment needs lists are then sent to me for district wide prioritizing budgeting.
The District Would Benefit From Seeking Employers' Feedback Information More Extensively The programs offered by the district are added, dropped or changed as the skills required by employers evolve as technology evolves.
For example, what was previously called Business-Office Education has now been expanded to be Business Technology Education, with an emphasis on providing information services skills and thus, a filing clerk program is now offered in a broader context under the Information and PC Support program.
Input from business and industry is a key element the district utilizes to make decisions on programmatic modifications.
To make this an effective process, the district has established a committee for 17 different 5-52 ValienteHernandez P.A.

programmatic areas.
The membership of each one of these committees varies from 4 to 22 business individuals engaged in related areas of expertise and together they make up a group of almost 300.
The district does not have a formal process by which input is obtained from employers that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs offered by the district that could demonstrate that students are obtaining the required academic, vocational, and technical skill proficiencies.
The district has an informal process through which they seek feedback and that can be used to build up a formal process.
Such a process can be very useful in assessing program effectiveness.
For example, it can help detect whether former students are making use of the training they received in other words, was the training they received appropriate.
Refer to Exhibits 5-28 and 5-29 for benchmarking results based on follows up carried out by DOE.
The district should conduct an employer survey and the most effective way would be to not obtain feedback on specific students but rather ask broad performance-based questions such as "How do you feel about graduates preparedness that you have hired from the Health Science Education program?"

State Level Data Reflects That Lake County Has Been Carrying Out Its Vocational Programs Successfully When Compared Against Its Peers When looking at the FETPIP data it is clear that the Lake County vocational secondary programs have considerably high consolidated enrollment along an equally high number of completion points.
3 Similar results were found for the postsecondary vocational programs and the adult general education programs.
See Exhibit 5-30.
According to the program supervisor, much of the success achieved is due to their accessibility to data necessary to make effective program decisions.

WEOIS Report (WDIS 1030).
The District's Vocational Education Program Has Been Particularly Successful in Its Efforts to Evaluate Program Effectiveness As reflected in the previous analysis, the vocational programs in Lake County are generally successful.
According to the program supervisor, much of the success achieved has to do with the support rendered by the district's MIS department in making useful data available upon which effective program decisions can be made.
Having the data readily available has expanded their ability to base decisions affecting vocational programs on an analysis of data.
The program supervisor knows at any time the number of students in each programmatic area by looking at the VER (Vocational Enrollment Report), which is generated at minimum four times a year.
Most importantly, the VER report guarantees the integrity of the program by allowing the program specialists to confirm that students are following and staying within their career plans, the sequential set of courses that make up the vocational program.
The department also conducts a detailed cost analysis once a year for the major programmatic areas to justify the teacher unit ratio set for a school to generate a vocational unit.

The district's curriculum framework is aligned to the Florida Accountability Standards and to the Sunshine State Standards.
This framework can be improved by developing a more formal system to methodically guide curriculum development and implementation.
A well-defined curriculum that is aligned to the Sunshine State Standards4 is essential as a systematic and logical means of constantly improving student performance.
A school district must have in place a curriculum that provides focus, identifies what is essential, and connects learning to mastery within and across grade levels and schools.
The curriculum must determine what students learn at each grade level and should include long and short-term goals, a description of instructional strategies, suggestions for instructional materials, textbooks and supplemental materials, and the assessments that will be used to measure progress toward learning content.
The curriculum should also provide scope and sequence.
Scope and sequence represent the hierarchy of skills and the order in which these skills should be taught.
Scope and sequence should also describe what teachers should teach and how they should teach it.
At the district level, the PK-12 Curriculum and Instruction department is in charge of curriculum planning and implementation and this function is carried out by one supervisor and four program specialists, as illustrated in the organizational chart in Exhibit 5-31.
At the school level, 20 of the 22 elementary schools have a Primary Program Specialist in charge of curriculum development while in the secondary levels there is not a specific position in charge of monitoring curriculum alignment.
Principals and various instructional staff jointly carry out the function in the secondary levels.
The school principals play a very important role in assuring that the teaching/learning process is carried out appropriately.
According to the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction, principals in Lake County are empowered and responsible for classroom instruction.
Principals check teachers' lesson plans on a regular basis, even daily in some cases.
By doing so, principals confirm that teachers' instruction is Â· Â· Â· in alignment with state and local standards, grade specific, and providing enriching curriculum.
The District's Curriculum Guides and Instructional Materials Are in Alignment with the Sunshine State Standards The district has adopted curriculum guides, textbooks, and other instructional materials that are aligned with the Sunshine State Standards and the district's grade level benchmarks.
The district's curriculum guides, curriculum frameworks, benchmarks, and pupil progression plans are in alignment with the Florida Standards since they are a direct adaptation of the State's Sunshine and Accountability Standards.
The Florida Sunshine State Standards identify what students should know and be able to do at certain stages throughout PreK-12 grade levels.
Districts, schools and classroom teachers then identify what students should know and be able to do at certain grade levels within the broader timeframe.
Standards that are clear, useful, verifiable statements of student learning outcomes contain at least three ingredients.
First, they specify the learner; second, they describe an unambiguous and observable action; third, they specify the conditions under which these outcomes will be assessed.

The Curriculum and Instruction department provides assistance to school principals and subject area teachers to help them design instruction to meet the Sunshine State Standards.
When the state benchmarks were first adopted all school administrators and subject area teachers were required to attend workshops and seminars to help them understand how to interpret the curriculum guides, apply the instructional strategies, and meet the grade level and subject area benchmarks.
As changes and revisions are made to the state standards, teachers are provided refresher workshops and seminars.
Subject area teachers and school administrators are provided with specific resource documents such as the curriculum frameworks, the adopted grade level benchmarks, pupil progression plan, and the state standards, to help them implement the standards and benchmarks.

A process is in place to validate that the district is making progress toward total implementation of the Florida Sunshine State Standards and the State Accountability Standards.
The district designates the school principal as responsible for monitoring the progress made by teachers in teaching the standards.
Teachers are required to maintain a record of each student's progress in meeting the benchmarks appropriate to their grade level.
These records are kept in check sheets and made part of the teachers planning book.
The school principal and his/her administrative instructional staff periodically monitor teacher lesson plans to ensure that teaching strategies designed for meeting the standards and benchmark are being taught.
The validation of progress made in meeting the standards and benchmarks is seen when test scores are reviewed and a determination is made as to which standards are not being met.
A review of curriculum guides and frameworks, teacher lesson plans, teaching strategies, time on task, and other indicators are considered in making changes and revisions designed to improve student achievement.
Alignment of curriculum and instruction is crucial to success in improving education.
It encourages teachers to focus on high-order, integrated skills, to communicate goals and standards, and to design

avenues to help students achieve them.
When curriculum and instruction are aligned, everyone (students, teachers, parents, administrators, school boards) has a clear method for measuring progress.
While the Curriculum Guides Clearly Show Strands and Benchmarks, Clear Teaching Strategies Were Not Detected While the district's curriculum guides clearly show strands and benchmarks, specific teaching strategies were not detected.
Through the establishment of teaching strategies, the system makes available a plan of action that sets directions and guides the allocation of resources to achieve educational goals.
One fundamental goal of teaching for example, is to learning is intrinsically rewarding and is based on te To accomplish this goal, districts formulate teaching students and promote learning.

The district should formulate meaningful teaching strategies for the delivery of educational service as part of the curriculum guides.
By doing so the district will go a step furthering the educational process and reinforces their highest priority, student learning, with attention focused on students' engagement in meaningful learning activities.

Lake County School District revises its curriculum guides and frameworks and pupil progression plans annually to ensure that they conform to any changes or revisions to the state standards.
Each year, the district hires writing teams of teachers and district educators to examine and compare grade level and subject area instructional materials and textbook adoptions.
Recommendations for changes and or revisions are made, and the adopted changes are disseminated to schools and district level instructional personnel.
The District Needs to Expand and Realign the Basic K-12 Education Department to Be Able to Provide Effective Curricular and Instructional Support to Schools The primary role of the district-based curriculum staff is to provide leadership and support for empowering schools to maximize resources and provide quality learning programs and activities for students.
However, school level staff feels that this support is not optimal and their activity could be better supported.
This sentiment was corroborated by the teachers' survey response, where a large 46% (391 respondents) felt the district's curricular assistance is insufficient, as shown in Exhibit 5-33.
According to the supervisor of the Basic K-12 Curriculum and Instruction department the situation is largely due to having a staff too small to provide effective support to schools.
Refer to organizational structure of this department, Exhibit 5-31.

To provide appropriate curricular and instructional support to schools the district needs to expand the department to adequate levels.
Based on the staffing levels in the peer districts (Exhibit 5-33), priorities established by school administration and as moneys become available, the Lake County district must bring the curriculum and instruction function to par.
Additionally, ValienteHernandez P.A. concurs with the recommendations made by the FADSS study conducted in October 2000 relating the need to revamp and expand the Curriculum and Instruction department to enhance the delivery of educational services.
5 The main recommendations for the optimal reorganization and functioning of the instructional team made by FADSS included those below Â· Â· Â· Â· Establish a position of Director of Pre K-12 Curriculum, to provide leadership and direction for district curriculum development initiatives.
Establish a Coordinator for PK-5 Programs to support and oversee district PK-5 curriculum development.
Establish a Coordinator for Middle and High School Programs to support and oversee district's secondary schools curriculum development.
Establish Program Specialists positions as needed to provide content or program area expertise and work with school-based personnel on the development and implementation of curriculum, identification and adoption of instructional materials to support instruction, integration of technology to enhance learning activities and opportunities for students, and planning for program evaluations.
Program Specialist report to one or more of the leadership positions in the department.
Given the existing budgetary constraints and reductions however, we recommend that the district initially expand the Curriculum and Instruction department by two (2) Program Specialists, one to coordinate elementary school programs and support and oversee district K-5 curriculum development, another to coordinate middle school programs and support and oversee district's middle schools curriculum development.
The current Program Specialist in charge of elementary, middle and high school programs would be left to coordinate and oversee district high school curriculum development and support.
We estimate that expanding the curriculum and instruction resources would cost approximately $386,000 over the next five years, as illustrated in Exhibit 5-35.
This cost includes salary and benefits.
This calculation is based upon the average full time salary of two Program Specialists of $69,900, a benefits package of one-third of the salaries, $21,000, and a 4% contractual increase in salary every year.
Because

we recommend that the position would be added by July 31, 2002, there are no costs incurred in the first year.
By adopting this recommendation the district should improve student outcomes and enhance learning activities and opportunities for scholars by putting to work a strong district-level instructional team that is able to provide directives to teachers regarding the successful implementation of the Sunshine State Standards.
In the future and as more funds become available, the district should reassess its needs to further expand the Curriculum and Instruction function (based on remainder FADSS recommendations).

Middle and High Schools Need to Build the Capability Necessary for the Adequate Implementation of Curricular Standards and Frameworks While most elementary schools (20 out of 22 schools) have a Primary Program Specialist in charge of curriculum development, there is not a specific position that exercises this role in the middle and high schools.
In the secondary levels, various instructional staffs perform this function.
As indicated in Exhibit 5-36 however, the situation of Lake is not atypical.
Santa Rosa schools also places the responsibility under the school principal and two of the six peers place the assistant principals as the lead curriculum and instruction person.
The primary function of the Primary Program Specialists assigned to each elementary school is to assist subject area teachers in meeting the state standards and benchmarks.
In the district's middle and high schools the principal is the school curriculum leader that, in conjunction with other administrative instructional staff, has the responsibility for providing assistance to the subject area teachers.
Five district based curriculum specialists are also available to schools in providing assistance in helping teachers learn about and implement the State Standards.
According to the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction, at the elementary level the Primary Specialists are doing an acceptable job in providing teachers the assistance that they need.
In the middle and high schools, however, the instructional staff needed for implementation of the curriculum standards and frameworks is lacking.
The school principal is primarily the instructional leader responsible for helping teachers meet the standards and benchmarks because other administrative instructional staff at the school does not have the time necessary to help teachers achieve the desired outcomes due to their many other assigned duties, the assistant principal said.
Without adequate support at the secondary school levels it is difficult for the district to do an optimal job in curriculum alignment and provide directives to teachers regarding the successful implementation of the Sunshine State Standards.
The district should explore different alternatives to better support curriculum and instruction at the middle and high schools.
For example, the district could maximize the

curriculum and instruction capacity of principals and/or assistant principals through effective training This strategy is utilized and proven to be successful in Okaloosa and St. Johns school districts, where the goal is to develop principals and assistant principals to be effective instructional leaders at the secondary level.
Currently there is inservice, but according to the Supervisor of Staff Development, often the participation rate is low and many school administrators do not attend.
We recommend that the district consider developing a top-down directive to ensure that school administrators attend established training sessions.

The District Would Benefit From Utilizing an Electronic Curriculum Planning/Instructional Management Tool As mentioned earlier, the district does not have an electronic tool for curriculum planning.
This type of tool allows the district and its instructional staff to link its curriculum to the Sunshine State Standards, the National Content Standards and any locally defined district or school-based standards.
In addition an electronic tool lets principals and teachers monitor and report on student performance as individuals or in groups.
Approximately two years ago the district acquired and partially trained staff on the software NCS AbacusTM.
But during the second fiscal year, the district made a decision to abandon its use due to what was described by several managers during interviews as "implementation failure".
As a result this software is no longer being maintained or operated by the district's staff and its customer support agreement has expired.
Some administrators and instructional staff interview felt that this decision was premature.
The district's total costs incurred in its use were $1,280,825 and are still licensed to use the software.
On the other hand, the state's Department of Education also has a planning tool available: the Interdisciplinary Curriculum Planning Tool v 2.1 (CPT) that similar to NCS AbacusTM, contains all the benchmarks for all the content areas in the appropriate grade clusters.
CPT can benefit the teachers as a planning tool to support standards for the Florida System of School Improvement and Accountability, HSCT skills, connections to careers, and major learning themes.
The district however, has not imparted any training on CPT.
The district needs to have an electronic curriculum planning tool in place and for this purpose, district management must evaluate different alternatives including a wide-range reassessment of its decision to
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-63
Educational Service Delivery
abandon NCS AbacusTM as its instructional management software.
Further, the system should be reevaluated to determine whether it should be re-implemented on a pilot project basis.
Action Plan 6-8, Chapter 6 of this report shows the steps necessary to accomplish this recommendation.
Further information on the NCS AbacusTM issue can be found on Chapter 6, pages 6- 34 through 6-36.
The District Would Benefit From Developing a Formal Instructional Management System That Encompasses an Electronic Planning Tool The district is addressing many of the components of a sound management system in an unofficial manner.
It would be helpful for the district to develop an Instructional Management System that would methodically guide instructional leaders responsible for curriculum development and implementation and could be applied across the district by all instructional leaders.
This system would include the following specific steps: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Is there consistency in the curriculum across the district? Are decisions made in a systematic way? Is student performance evaluated? Is there a schedule of implementation? Are specific roles and responsibilities assigned? Is there long range planning? Is the delivery of instruction monitored? Are decisions for improving based on verified data?
As part of establishing the Instructional Management System, the district needs to assure the written policies regarding curriculum and its evaluation are expanded to specify Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· how or when the evaluations of curriculum will occur; specific roles and responsibilities for curriculum; processes for long-range planning; monitoring of curriculum delivery; and requirement for data-driven decisions for the purpose of increasing student learning.
Additionally, the management system would be supported by the use an electronic curriculum planning and instructional management tool.
Recommendations Â·
___________________________________________
We recommend that the district formulate specific meaningful teaching strategies for the delivery of educational service as part of the curriculum guides.
By doing so the district will go a step further in the educational process and reinforce their highest priority, student learning, with attention focused on students' engagement in meaningful learning activities.
As an example, the district should explore the methods of creating a unit or lesson plan data bank to share best practices (see Action Plan 5-2, Recommendation 1).

Â·
We recommend that the district strengthen the PK-12 Curriculum and Instruction department by hiring additional district level curriculum staff.
By realigning and expanding the department to adequate levels, the district will be able to provide appropriate curricular and instructional support to schools.
Compared to other peer districts, Lake has the lowest (5 compared to an average of 18) number of district-based specialist in charge of training and assisting teachers in meeting the state standards.
Because curriculum specialists are hired with soft money and job security is volatile, it is difficult to keep continuity in this position.
Therefore, the district should make a financial commitment not only to hire additional instructional specialists but also make the position permanent to encourage stability and continuity.
Additionally, ValienteHernandez P.A. concurs with the proposals made by FADSS relating to the need to realign and expand the Curriculum and Instruction department.
Given the existing budgetary constraints and reductions however, we recommend that the district initially expand the Curriculum and Instruction department by two (2) Program Specialists, one to coordinate elementary school programs and support and oversee district K-5 curriculum development, another to coordinate middle school programs and support and oversee district's middle schools curriculum development.
The fiscal impact of this action would be approximately $386,000 in additional costs over the next five years.
In the future and as more funds become available, the district should reassess its needs to further expand the Curriculum and Instruction function (based on remainder FADSS recommendations, staffing comparisons (Exhibit 5-33), and staffing priorities established by school administration).
The current Program Specialist in charge of elementary, middle and high school programs would be left to coordinate and oversee district high school curriculum development and support.

One common practice is to maximize the curriculum and instruction capacity of principals and/or assistant principals through effective training.
This strategy is utilized and proven to be successful in Okaloosa and St. Johns school districts, where an existing is to effectively develop principals and assistant principals to be successful instructional leaders at the middle and high schools.
As a step necessary to accomplish the recommendation, the district should consider developing a top-down directive to ensure that school administrators attend established training sessions.
Â·
We recommend the district adopt an electronic curriculum planning and instructional management tool.
For this purpose, district management must evaluate different alternatives including a wide-range reassessment of its decision to abandon NCS AbacusTM as its instructional management software.
The system should be reevaluated to determine whether it should be re-implemented on a pilot project basis Action Plan 6-8, Chapter 6 of this report shows the necessary steps to implement this recommendation.
Â·
In line with its highest priority, the district should develop plans of action at both the district and school levels to formalize its curriculum management system to be used systematically and uniformly by all instructional leaders and staff.
Immediate steps should be taken to ensure that the commitment to the instructional program would be such that systemic planning becomes a reality.
Such steps must include involvement of all stakeholders in embracing a clear and compelling shared vision of schooling for the students of Lake County

The district has adopted a plan for the progression of students from kindergarten through grade 12 that maximizes student mastery of the Sunshine State Standards and that could be further improved by strengthening the long-term effects of helping students that do not meet expectations.
(the plan) is consistent with Florida laws.
Although the plan does not promotion, the published plan states on page 19 that "students who statewide reading assessment test in grade 4 must be retained unless page 68 of the published plan.
The district's Pupil Progression Plan specifically prohibit the use of social continue to score at level one on the there is good cause" as described on
The Pupil Progression Plan incorporates the Sunshine State Standards and provides for the evaluation of each student performance against the standards.
The plan is divided into three major sections: Elementary, Middle School and High School.
The plan further establishes specific levels of performance for each grade in all subject areas.
The district's Pupil Progression Plan provides for the evaluation of students' reading level in grades 1 and 2.
When students are deficient in reading the district provides intensive reading instructions and, if not remedied by grade 4, the student is retained.
The district annually reports to parents their student's progress toward meeting the district's expectations, standards, and benchmarks.
The district's Pupil Progression Plan further provides for accelerated graduation, and dual enrollment at post-secondary institutions.
Parents are notified of these options.
Effectiveness of Activities to Remediate Students Should Be Examined The district's Pupil Progression Plan attempts to assist all students who do not meet established expectations by providing them with intensive remediation assistance.
The plan lists several school and district level programs of remediation, intervention and alternative education.
Griffin Middle School provides such remediation to students who qualify and meet criterion.
Education of Teen Parent Program (ETP) and GED options are also listed as remedial programs.
District staff members have indicated that although many schools have creative programs for remediation, the data is weak on the long-term effectiveness of the programs.
Additionally, a majority of the surveyed believed that the remedial activity could be improved, as shown in Exhibit 5-37.

Enhance Existing Remedial Programs Recommendation 1 Strategy Action Needed Systematically evaluate the long-term effects of all remedial programs.
Step 1: The Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and the supervisors of Curriculum and Student Services develop a research model that collects information on the effectiveness of school based remedial plans to be used by individual schools.
The Supervisor of Student Services and the Supervisor of Curriculum and Instruction collaborate to design a mechanism to evaluate the longterm effects and impact of the existing programs of remediation, intervention and alternative education.
Consultation with external sources such as peer districts is made as needed.
The mechanism can be focused on monitoring three or more of the following elements: test results, AIPs (Academic Improvement Plans), promotion of students from grade to grade, graduation and dropout rates.
Remedial programs are evaluated and when the most effective programs are identified, consideration should be given to institute effective programs more widely.

The district's School Improvement Plans should translate identified needs into activities with measurable objectives more clearly.
School Advisory Councils (SACs) Meet the Statutory Membership Requirements School Advisory Councils assist schools in preparing and evaluating school improvement plans.
State law requires all SACs to include the principal, teachers, educational support employees, students, parents, and business and community members.
The variety of groups specified for SAC membership helps provide an appropriately balanced and broad-based approach to school improvement.
State law also requires SACs to reflect the ethnic, racial, and economic community served by the school.

After conducting a needs assessment, effective councils identify long and short term goals with objectives and strategies for implementation that are aligned to the school vision.
Clearly stated objectives and taskoriented strategies give the council a sense of purpose and direction which create a sense of fulfillment at the end of the school year.
Each council member must be aware of his or her responsibility.
Results of a survey conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. indicate that most responding SAC members (84%) feel the district provides assistance in developing School Improvement Plans (SIPs), shown in Exhibit 5-38.
SAC members also believe SIPs are based on analyses of student outcomes, include clear explanations of how students needs were identified, and generally contain measurable objectives and clear implementation strategies.
Notably, while 79% of the SAC members responding to the survey acknowledge a follow-up procedure for implementing SIP strategies, only 54% agree that the district enforces said procedure.
The district meets the statutory requirements and has a composition review process in place to monitor the makeup of the School Advisory Councils (SACs) and assure that they meet statutory requirements as described below.
One practice implemented in other school districts to further enhance SAC activity is to publicly recognize School Advisory Council.
It is important that people know they are appreciated; hence, they are more willing to give of their time and continue to serve the school in this vital role.

School Improvement Plans (SIPs) Can Be Enhanced Every school in Florida is required to write a School Improvement Plan (SIP) stating goals, objectives and strategies designed to meet those objectives.
These goals and objectives should be related, in part, to student performance data and should state how the school intends to evaluate the extent to which the goals and objectives are met.
The Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) has developed criteria to review the adequacy of School Improvement Plans.
Three of these criteria follow.
Â· Â· Â· Is there evidence that the SIP is based on the school's needs? Does the goal generally contain measurable objectives? (Are indicators of results/outcomes defined in measurable terms?) Does the goal generally contain clear implementation strategies (action steps)?
While most SAC members responding to the survey generally were comfortable with the quality of SIPs (Exhibit 5-38), an analysis conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. showed that there is room to further improve the process.
ValienteHernandez P.A. randomly selected and analyzed the SIPs of nine (9) schools.
We found that most of the documents were based on school needs assessments and while most included all the elements of an improvement plan (goals, objectives, strategies, resources, timelines, responsible persons and monitoring/evaluation procedures), many of these elements were inadequate.
All SIPs analyzed included objectives but in many cases the objectives were not written in measurable terms or presented solid rational for the chosen targets.
For example, one objective was "To improve Math skills at all grades levels as measured on FCAT Math", which lacks specificity.
An example of lack of rationale for chosen targets is "Fifty percent of students will score Level 3 and above on FCAT Math".
The weakest area found however, related to the SIPs implementation strategies.
Only one of the nine documents analyzed (Tavares High) presented adequate implementation strategies.
Exhibit 5-39 illustrates the analysis of the school improvement plans.

Another improvement that can be made is that the district strengthens the SACs reporting progress towards implementing strategies and meeting SIP goals.
Seventeen percent (17%) of responding SAC members disagreed with the statement "The school district enforces this procedure (for implementing SIP strategies)" and 30% said they did not know, as shown in Exhibit 5-38.
These results suggest that there is not enough clarity of the results evaluation process.
Moreover, the district should consider linking the results of the SIP as part of the annual evaluation of school principals (refer to Action Plan 5-1, Recommendation 1 for further detail).
Additionally, future SIPs should incorporate the PACE Plan under Educational Goal No. 3 (refer to Action Plan 5-1 Recommendation 1, for further detail).
Also, a section should be added where from year to year, it is explained what or how much was accomplished from the previous year.

The district's process for selecting instructional materials ensures that instructional materials meet the needs of teachers and students.
The District Has a Detailed Plan in Place That Assures Adoption and Purchase of Instructional Materials Are in Accordance With Florida Law The district's process for selecting instructional materials ensures that students' and teachers' needs are appropriately met.
This process is described in the administrator handbook section on purchasing information.
All instructional materials purchased by the Lake County School District have met all the provisions of the Sunshine State Standards.
The district adheres strictly to the requirement that all materials purchased are listed in the state adoption schedule.
In line with state law, the district developed and approved the Lake County Instructional Materials Plan with the purpose of aligning the operation with Ch.233, Florida Statutes, expediting the adoption of instructional materials and ensuring the effective use of funds.
The plan is summarized below.
Â· The Supervisor of Instructional Materials/Media and Staff Development (herein "the Instructional Materials Supervisor") receives a list of state-recommended materials and proceeds to arrange committees to review materials and recommend adoptions for local use.
Curriculum staff reviews the materials selected by the committees to assure they meet state guidelines and reports to the Instructional Materials Supervisor areas that may be controversial.
Once the list is finalized, the Instructional Materials Supervisor recommends the materials to the Superintendent who in turn submits to the school board for approval.
At this point, the school or district committee proceeds to order the materials.
School principals receive the list of adopted materials, requests the materials and submits the order to the Instructional Materials Supervisor.
The Instructional Materials Supervisor compiles the requests of all schools, considers availability of funds, and places the order.
Materials are received at a central warehouse and then distributed to the schools.
Detailed procedures exist at the school and district level to dispose of surplus or outdated instructional materials.
Â·
Â·
Â· Â·
The district clearly identifies the flexibility schools have to make decisions regarding instructional materials.
Under the authority of s. 229.592(9), Florida Statutes, there is a waiver process in place by which schools can request a waiver from these procedures.
Currently, nine schools have a waiver for instructional materials.
The Textbook Managers' Manual and purchase order records on file in the Learning Resource Center (LCR) office validate that the district annually budgets for the cost of replenishing instructional materials and consumables.

Each student has current, appropriate instructional materials in core courses that are aligned with the Sunshine State Standards and the district's pupil progression plan.
However the district should seek feedback from different stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of instructional materials.
The District Involves Teachers and Other Stakeholders in the Review and Selection of Instructional Materials As described earlier, the procedures contained in the Lake County Instructional Materials Plan assure that all students have current state-adopted textbooks and other appropriate current instructional materials in core courses.
This procedure is activated each year and it starts at the state level through the Department of Education.
The district requires that all reviews and the selection of instructional materials involve teachers and all other appropriate stakeholders.
This is accomplished to a great extent through the committees appointed to review and recommend adoptions for local use and supported by school board policies.
The committees selecting textbooks must include at least three members, two of which must be classroom teachers of three years experience who are actively teaching in the subject area.
Larger committees selecting basal texts in major subject areas of reading and mathematics must have at least one lay citizen.
One-half of each district committee must be composed of teachers who must be currently teaching and certified to teach in the subject area being reviewed.
A survey conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. in April 2000 confirmed that the existing process for adopting instructional materials captures the input from teachers and other stakeholders.
The survey results also pointed out that principals, teacher and School Advisory Council members feel the district should seek feedback as to the usefulness of the adopted instructional materials more formally.
For example, approximately two-thirds of teachers indicated that he district does not adequately obtain formal feedback on the usefulness of instructional materials, use feedback in future purchasing decisions or seek our suggestions on how to decrease instructional materials costs.
See Exhibit 5-40.
The district should establish a procedure to seek formal feedback especially from teachers and principals as to the usefulness of the instructional materials adopted locally and use this feedback in future decisions.
Discontinuing the purchase of materials that teachers indicate are not useful has the potential to save district money.
In addition, using teacher feedback should enable the district to make better decision on which instructional materials to purchase.
Additionally, the district should increase the awareness of existing flexibility regarding the acquisition and use of instructional materials.
As mentioned earlier, there is a process in place by which schools can request a waiver from the adoption of instructional materials.
Increased flexibility is important because it helps schools in their efforts to raise student achievement by providing the opportunity to customize instruction and resources according to specific needs.

The district has procedures for acquiring, maintaining, and disposing of instructional materials.
However, the district could further improve by raising general consciousness to preserve books.
The District Has a Detailed Process in Place to Dispose of Materials That Are No Longer Useful According to district procedures, when the new materials are delivered to each school, it is the responsibility of the school administrator to exchange all outdated materials for the new ones.
The Textbook Manager's Handbook explains in detail the steps necessary for disposal of materials.
For any outdated materials remaining in the school, the principal has to justify the reasons in writing but under no circumstances shall the principal allow outdated materials to the basal adoption.
According to Step 15 of the Instructional Plan cites that instructional materials that are unserviceable, surplus or no longer on state contract will be returned to the central warehouse where they will disposed according to Ch. 233.37, Florida Statutes.
The district does not sell but trades instructional materials that are no longer useful.
The district's main book distributor offers the option of trading surplus books for a credit toward future purchases of used textbooks and other instructional materials.
In the past, the district's practice has been to post moneys received for the sale, recycling, loss, damage, or unreturned instructional materials as an expense abatement which has the practical effect of adding to the appropriation for instructional materials.
The district provided documentation that demonstrated that the collections being receipted are posted as expense abatement under the instructional materials project number.
For the 2001-02 fiscal year, accounting changes have been made that will better and more clearly reflect that said collections are posted to the appropriation for instructional materials.
The District Could Substantially Increase Collection for Lost or Damaged Books The school district has a policy in place that rules what students and their parents will be charged for lost, damaged, or unreturned instructional materials.
Item four (4) of school board policy 4.23 stipulates:
A student who loses or damages a book beyond normal usage shall be assessed the cost for replacing the damaged or lost book.
This payment schedule shall pertain to lost or damaged books: "A" "B" "C" "D" Condition Condition Condition Condition (new) Â­ full price (less than two years in use) Â­ 75% of list price (more than two years in use) Â­ 60% of list price (more than four years in use) Â­ 20% of list price
This payment schedule demonstrates that the money collected for lost, damaged or unreturned instructional materials represents an appropriate value of the loss or the damage.
An analysis of the current annual textbook inventory report and the documentation regarding annual credits to the district's textbook account indicated that there are too many books that are lost and/or damaged and that the district is only recuperating a little over 10% of the loss.
For the school year 2000-01,
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-83
Educational Service Delivery
$17,425 dollars was collected from lost and damaged books whereas the total textbook loss to the district was over $150,000 for the same period.
The amounts reimbursed by the schools are far from the actual number of lost and damaged books declared through inventory.
For example, Leesburg High paid $3,000 in lost and damaged books which would equal about 60 books ($3,000 divided by an average of $50 per book); the inventory however, unaccountably shows that Leesburg High claimed a total of 855 of lost and damaged for the same period.
The actual textbook loss of Leesburg High was calculated as $39,750.
The district should explore different options to increase awareness among students, parents, and teachers of the value of textbooks and the importance of preserving instructional materials for future users.
In addition, the district should consider alternatives to strengthen accountability at the school level for lost and damaged books.
Assuming the district could recuperate 75% of the lost and damaged books as a result of effective communication and increased accountability, the district could receive at least $95,000 (75% times $150,000 minus $17,400) in additional revenue annually.
The District Needs to Improve the Process It Uses to Obtain Suggestions on Decreasing Materials' Costs The district has mechanisms in place to obtain suggestions on how to decrease the costs associated with instructional material purchases and implements practical suggestions.
For example, the Supervisor of Instructional Materials recently met with school principals and determined that for school based management purposes, it is more cost-effective to order materials centrally than school based, thus taking advantage of bulk order rates, discounts and bonuses.
The Supervisor of Instructional Materials also meets frequently with other district's Instructional Materials supervisors and directors, with the district's Warehouse Supervisor and with purchasing agents to discuss and look for most cost-effective practices.
However, as stated in the previous finding, the district should do more to include teacher feedback on the usefulness of instructional materials and suggestions on how to decrease instructional materials costs.

Analysis of Per formance Data and Evaluation of Educational Programs ______________________ Goal C: The district ensures accountability to its constituents by analyzing performance data and by evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of its major educational programs.
12
The district needs to implement accountability mechanisms to ensure the overall performance, efficiency, and effectiveness of its major educational programs.
6
Increased Evaluation of Specific Educational Programs Is Needed Although the district has made some effort to evaluate the overall effectiveness of its education programs and to evaluate the effectiveness of individual schools through the school improvement planning process, there are many opportunities for improvement.
Overall, ValienteHernandez P.A. found that: Â· Â· while the district has stated goals that address the major aspects of each major educational program, it needs to refine the related objectives and strategies; the district does not use appropriate performance measures and benchmarks for evaluating the overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its educational programs and uses these to make management decisions; the district has not implemented a schedule to formally evaluate major educational programs using regular assessments, legal requirements, and other reasonable criteria as factors in selecting programs for evaluation; and the district has not implemented strategies to assess the reliability of program performance and cost data for its major educational programs.

The district regularly reviews the organizational structure and the staffing of the central office and schools to minimize administrative layers and processes.
However the district's staffing formula has been repeatedly circumvented in the past.
7
The district has clear procedures for the allocation of instructional and administrative staff and is in the process of developing formulas for the support staff.
Overall, ValienteHernandez P.A. found that Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· the new administration has committed to regularly review the central office's organizational structure and staffing levels for its education programs to minimize administrative layers; analyses of the organizational structure and staffing levels indicated that the number of district level staff is inadequate compared to benchmarks; the district reports organizational structure and administrative staffing review findings to school board members; the district implements changes to the program's organizational structure and staffing levels and processes when necessary and as budget allows; and formal organizational charts at the departmental level need to be updated.
Detailed recommendations and action plans to address the above-mentioned disadvantages and improve the organizational structure and staffing levels are presented in Action Plans 3-2, 3-4, and 3-5, Chapter 3.
Reductions And Increases in School Staffing Levels Reflect Enrollment Changes, and Teacher/Pupil Ratios Are Comparable With Peer Districts An analysis of the student to teacher ratios for four consecutive years conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. indicates that the district's staffing levels has generally been in agreement with changes in student membership.
Additionally, the district's ratio has remained in line with that of its peers over the same period.
As shown in Exhibit 5-41, for the year 1999-2000, Lake had the fourth lowest ratio of total K-12 students to total classroom teachers (17.3 students to one teacher).
The peer average for that same period was 18.3 to 1.

While the district provides performance data of individual schools to the public as required by Florida law (School Improvement Plan and School Accountability Report), it should provide additional information on the performance and cost of major educational programs.
Overall, ValienteHernandez P.A. found that: Â· The district could improve by publicly reporting on the performance and cost-efficiency of its major educational programs.
This information should be presented through timely reports to school advisory councils, parents, and other taxpayers in a manner that is clear and understandable and does not require undue assistance to interpret its meaning or significance.
The district can improve by providing more means to receive and respond to feedback from parents and other taxpayers as an avenue of accountability to improve poor performance and inefficiency.

The district demonstrated that school libraries and/or media centers have sufficient up-to-date resource materials to support school instructional needs.
The district periodically reviews library and media services to ensure that resource materials are accessible to all students and represent current research.
The district uses some informal procedures to reduce library and media costs such as coordinating orders to take advantage of bulk discounts.
Also, instructional materials' budget shows items acquired through a district license, which presents a better rate.

The primary objective of the libraries and media educational centers is to implement, enrich, and support the educational programs of the school.
In the district, the media centers make available a wide range of materials that take into consideration the diverse interests, skills and age level of the students served, and are representative of the many ethnic, religious and cultural groups.
The district also has detailed criteria and standard operating procedures in place for the selection of educational media materials in line with Florida Statutes.
In selecting media materials, the media specialist must consult among others, with reputable publishing companies, faculty, students and the media committee appointed by the school principal.
Operation of the media centers is supported by School Board Policy 4.22.
All Media Centers in the District Are Automated All the media centers in the district are automated and frequent in-service is provided through staff development to keep media specialists up to date in technology.
A technology supervisor meets regularly with media specialists to discuss and address technology issues.
On average, the district has 13.4 modem computers for each media center, which is the second highest ratio when compared to the peer districts as shown in Exhibit 5-43.

In the district, a school media specialist operates libraries and media centers.
In the elementary schools, however, the media specialist is a teacher that is assigned classes and as a result, the media center is closed to the rest of the student population during those periods of time.

The district provides necessary support services (guidance counseling, psychological, social work, and health) to meet the needs of its students in a cost-efficient manner.
Student support services in the district are provided under the Student Services department.
The main functions carried out by the department are Attendance Services, Psychological Services, Social Work Services, Guidance Services, School Health Services, and Home Education.
The department is also in charge of preparing the district's Pupil Progression Plan.
At this level, the functions and responsibilities held by the department are typical when compared to those of the peer districts s shown in Exhibit 5-45.
The list of functions presented in the exhibit however is not all-inclusive.
In addition to the listed functions, the Student Services department in Lake County is also in charge of student records, s. 504 of the American with Disabilities Act, Underage Waiver for GED, and takes stock in the Children Scholarship Program.
Health services are offered in cooperation with the Lake County Health Department.
Central Florida Health Care Development Foundation Grant from Leesburg Regional Medical Center provides funding for six school-based registered nurses in their service area.
Lake County Public Health Department contracts full service funds to the school district for five school-based licensed practical nurses.
Student Services contracts with the Health Department for vision, hearing, and scoliosis screening.
Jeppesen VisionQuest, Inc., provides free eye exams and glasses for students that fail vision screening.
Comprehensive social services are provided by eight school social workers to 42 schools (3 of which are center/alternative schools).
Job assignments are made primarily by geographic area.
Work calendars are submitted on a monthly basis with a weekly schedule of school visitations.
For the center/alternative schools, the assigned school social worker provides all on-site services and distributes the referrals requiring home visits to the School Social Worker who serves the geographic area in which the student lives.
The district's Dropout Prevention program was reduced after August 2000.
Mainly, the Drop Out Prevention (DOP) program lost its weighted funding at the state level thus many of the district's dropout prevention programs were discontinued, significantly reduced or modified.
Additionally, prior to the ValienteHernandez P.A. 5-93
Educational Service Delivery
1999-2000 school year procedures were in place to track and monitor students who have dropped out of school and with the changing role of the Career Specialist these procedures have become inefficient and ineffective.
Presently, Student Services is looking at ways to carry out procedures in a more effective manner, by streamlining the process using technology to provide a better tracking system.
In addition to this, the district should carry out a thorough re-evaluation of the Dropout Prevention program.
Action Plan 15-4, Chapter 15 presents the steps necessary to carry out this recommendation.

The District Could Improve Its Process for Ensuring Student Support Services Are Cost-Efficient and Effective The administration of the district's student services is generally well planned and organized.
The plan for the provision of services is based upon assessment of needs.
When evaluating students' needs the Student Services department considers many factors such as graduation rates, attendance, early leaver rates, college placement test scores, graduate follow up data, and placement/ promotion data.
The evaluation of these factors is used to determine areas of strengths and weaknesses.
District-wide meetings, at least five 5-94 ValienteHernandez P.A.

times a year, with school principals and guidance counselors provide valuable information, which is also considered when developing programs and procedures.
Planning of services also includes the identification of, and coordination with, community agencies and programs.
The following cooperative agreements are currently in place: Lifestream, for mental health counseling; Arnette House, a provider of Children in Need of Services (CINS) and Families in Need of Services (FINS); Dual Enrollment agreements with Lake Sumter Community College, Lake Technical Center, and Adult Education; and a cooperative truancy plan, cooperatively administered with the States Attorney Office, County Judge, Juvenile Justice and local law enforcement.
The department also takes specific actions to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the delivery of student support services.
Evaluation of effective services are monitored through dialog at district-wide meetings with principals and guidance counselors at least five times a year, the Annual Accountability of Services Form for Psychologists and Social Workers, and results of related Department of Education reports.
The results of the evaluations are used to make improvements.
All analysis of data is shared with all stakeholders who in return are encouraged to use data in the school improvement process.
The district has the capacity to monitor expenditures for selected program.
Information provided by the department indicated the per-pupil cost for psychological and social work services are currently $22.25 and $8.92 respectively.
District staff indicate they often review staffing and compare staffing levels against state and national benchmarks.
To further improve the efficient use of resources, the district should formally compare expenditures and staffing levels to comparable districts, to state or national benchmarks and/or to benchmarks of national professional associations on a regular basis, and present the results to the school board.
This formal assessment will better ensure that student support services are both effective and efficient.
The Ratio Of Students To Guidance Counselors In Lake Is Adequate An analysis by ValienteHernandez P.A. based on the last comparable data available indicated that for the school year 1999-2000, the ratio of students to guidance counselors in the district compared favorably against peer districts for the school year 1999-2000, as shown in Exhibit 5-46.

A Large Number of District Constituents Believe That the Assessment and Placement of ESE Students Is Not Timely Results of a survey conducted by ValienteHernandez P.A. indicated that different constituents believe teachers and other student services support staff are well trained to identify students with special needs.
ValienteHernandez P.A.
5-95
Educational Service Delivery
Many school administrators however, expressed that the process of assessment and placement of students with special needs takes too long.
Exhibit 5-47 shows that most responding principals (60%) and teachers (77%) believe that the assessment and placement of ESE (Exceptional Student Education) students is not timely.
Forty-eight percent (48%) of teachers also feel there is room to improve the effectiveness of Student Services in meeting the needs of its students.
Assessment and placement of ESE students are two different components of a process that occurs in three steps (pre-referral; referral and assessment; and eligibility determination and placement) that involves two departments: ESE and Student Services.
The constituents, however, view the two components as one and the district needs to take steps to better the constituents' perception and understanding of the process as a whole.
According to the Student Services Supervisor from the beginning to the end, the process usually takes over six to eight weeks and no placement should take more than six months.
Also, an analysis of the backlog of student assessments in the Student Services department was found to be reasonable at the time of this review.
The Lake County School District has a set of procedures in place for the different phases steps (prereferral; referral and assessment; and eligibility determination and placement) of the process.
The process begins with the teacher determining that a student is experiencing difficulty in the regular education classroom.
For example, the student is Â· Â· Â· Â· functioning below ability level; manifesting a behavior detrimental to his/her own or others learning; functioning above grade level and needs stimulation or challenge beyond those provided in the regular education curriculum; or displaying problems that may be medically linked.
Each school has a Student Intervention Team (SIT) that meets on a regular basis to review available data on students and makes recommendations to meet student's needs.
The SIT process is coordinated by the department of Student Services and ESE is typically not involved, unless requested.
The intervention team may consist of an administrator, guidance counselor, school psychologist, mainstream consultant, ESE teacher(s), speech/language pathologist, and others as needed.
During the pre-referral phase the SIT members conduct observations to gather information and document evidence of the student's academic difficulty.
Next, the School Intervention Team meets with the student's parents and develops and initiates interventions in the regular classroom.
After interventions have been implemented, SIT members have a follow-up conference during which the intervention and their successes or failures are reviewed.
If the problem is resolved no further action is taken.
However, if the problem persists the SIT members refer students for psycho-educational evaluation.
After evaluation, the staffing committee meets with the parents to determine appropriate education services and programs available for the student.
The district will benefit by carrying out an awareness program that facilitates the understanding of the required process for the identification and assessment of students.
An added benefit of an awareness program is that it will help understand the importance of doing quality interventions and appropriately identifying students for special programs and protect students that should not be labeled as disadvantaged or handicapped.
In addition, the district should take steps to improve the existing assessment personnel accountability system.
Presently, the district monitors the productivity of assessment personnel on a monthly basis.
The system could be further improved by presenting these results to school administrators also on a monthly basis.
The report should include summary of the number of evaluations and meetings assessment staff

attended and report the evaluations that are initial referrals, three-year evaluations, re-evaluations, etc.
Presenting the results of student services activity to schools will further help improve constituents' opinion on the effectiveness of the assessment and placement processes.

Recommendations Â·
___________________________________________
We recommend that the district consider evaluating expenditures and staffing levels of selected services against comparable districts and/or to state or national benchmarks on a regular basis.
The information gathered will be used to further improve the efficient use of resources.
We recommend that the Student Services department in conjunction with the ESE department carry out an awareness program that facilitates the understanding of the required process for the identification and assessment of ESE students and thus improving the generalized perception that the process is too lengthy.
To further improve constituents' opinion on the effectiveness of the assessment and placement processes, we recommend that the district take the existing assessment personnel accountability system to the next level.
The system could be further improved by presenting these results to school administrators also on a monthly basis.
The report should include
