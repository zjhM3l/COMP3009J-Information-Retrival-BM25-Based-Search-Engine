A substantive amendment to this systematic review was last made on 01 April 1999.
Cochrane reviews are regularly checked and updated if necessary.
Background: Renal disease is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus.
Objectives: To examine whether the progression of early diabetic renal disease to end-stage renal failure may be slowed by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for reasons other than their antihypertensive properties, so that they have value in the treatment of normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria.
Search strategy: Medline was searched for English language reviews and randomised controlled trials.
Personal reference lists, and reference lists of retrieved studies were also used.
Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials with separate identifiable results for initially normotensive diabetic patients, who received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least one year and were compared with controls.
Data collection and analysis: Meta-analyses were performed on the results of 12 randomised controlled trials with a variety of patient inclusion and exclusion criteria.
One further study met all conditions for inclusion but did not provide data in useable form for metaanalyses.
Main results: Albumin excretion rate fell for patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 12 of the 13 studies but did so for only two of the 13 groups on placebo.
Treatment provided a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate in both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Treatment with either captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with control patients.
A significantly greater lowering of blood pressure was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group.
Average glycosylated haemoglobin fell a little in the treated patients and rose in the controls, the difference being just significant.
The difference in changes in glomerular filtration rate did not reach statistical significance.
Reviewers' conclusions: Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can arrest or reduce the albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric normotensive diabetics, as well as reduce or prevent an increase in blood pressure.
But, given the drop in blood pressure in patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, it is not certain that the reduction of albumin excretion rate is due to a separate renal effect.
A direct link with postponement of end-stage renal failure has not been demonstrated.
There appear to be no substantial side effects.
Background GLOSSARY Albustix positive proteinuria: Albustix testing uses a 'stick' that is dipped into a sample of urine to test for protein.
It is only positive when there is much more protein than usual.
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: Drugs that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
Diabetic nephropathy: A type of kidney disease that may occur in people with diabetes.
End stage renal failure: A deficiency of renal function which is fatal without transplantation or dialysis.
Glomerulus: The filtration unit of the kidney.
Glomerular filtration rate: Rate at which the kidney filters out waste products, usually 125 ml/minute, although it decreases in renal failure.
Glomerular filtration rate is therefore used as a measure of renal failure.
Heterogeneity: A measure of the extent to which studies vary.
Homogeneous studies are in accord; heterogeneous studies differ from each other.
Meta-analysis: Statistical techniques which combine the results of several trials to produce a joint estimate.
Microalbuminuria: Higher than normal amounts of protein in the urine but not enough to be detected by albustix.
Once persistent, is a sign of early renal disease.
Normotensive: Having normal blood pressure.
Renal: Relating to the kidney.
MICROALBUMINURIA A patient is said to have overt proteinuria if urine tests show more than 300mg/l of albuminuria.
Sensitive assays have shown that levels of albuminuria too low to be detected by conventional dipstick urinalysis can be present for months or
years before reaching the 300mg/l level.
This phenomenon is termed microalbuminuria and is defined as an excretion rate of 20 to 200 micrograms/min (30 to 300mg/day).
Assuming an average daily urine output of one to 1.5 litres, this gives concentrations of 20 to 300 mg/l (Liou 1995).
DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY About 20-35% of diabetic patients develop persistent proteinuria, a decline in glomerular filtration rate, and increased arterial blood pressure, which collectively constitute the clinical syndrome of diabetic nephropathy (Andersen 1983; BorchJohnsen 1985; Krolewski 1985; Parving 1989; Bilous 1995).
The relationship between arterial blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy seems to be a complex one: nephropathy increasing blood pressure and blood pressure accelerating the course of nephropathy (Parving 1993).
The presence of nephropathy is closely associated with the increased morbidity and mortality in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Knowles 1971; Andersen 1983; BorchJohnsen 1985; Krolewski 1985; Parving 1988).
The high mortality is due to an excess of cardiovascular mortality (Borch-Johnsen 1987) and to end stage renal failure (Knowles 1971; Andersen 1983; Borch-Johnsen 1985; Krolewski 1985).
Albuminuric diabetics may be 20 times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than are non-albuminuric diabetics (Borch-Johnsen et al 1985).
On average, death occurs five to 10 years after the start of persistent proteinuria (Knowles 1971; Andersen 1983; Krolewski 1985).
Long term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment of insulin dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy has been associated with a low rate of decline in kidney function (Lewis 1993; Mulec 1994).
PREDICTION OF NEPHROPATHY The insulin dependent diabetes mellitus subpopulation at risk of developing nephropathy may be identified fairly accurately by the detection of microalbuminuria (Parving 1993).
Microalbuminuria is also a strong predictor of all causes of mortality, particularly cardiovascular ones, in non insulin dependent patients (Parving 1993).
Incipient diabetic nephropathy is considered to be
present if persistent microalbuminuria is found in two of three urine samples collected consecutively, preferably within six months (Parving 1993).
POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITOR ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT Non-insulin dependent diabetic patients with early nephropathy and mild to moderate hypertension demonstrate a progressive increase in urinary protein excretion.
Administration of captopril has resulted in prompt control of hypertension and reversal of the increase in urinary protein excretion (Vora 1996).
Antihypertensive treatment prevents overt proteinuria in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients with microalbuminuria (Passa 1992).
It may be that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors contribute to a slowing of progression by contributing an antiproteinuric effect not necessarily related to the effects of systemic blood pressure (Marre 1988; Mathiesen 1991; Valentino 1991; Liou 1995).
If so it may be advantageous to use them before the patient has become hypertensive.
One meta-analysis, of studies lasting at most one year, showed that the treatment of diabetic patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors not only effectively reduced high blood pressure but also reduced microalbuminuria/proteinuria and, in addition, exhibited an antihyperglycaemic effect by improving blood sugar levels (Bergemann 1992).
Another metaanalysis, of studies lasting four or more weeks, concluded that as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert a specific antiproteinuric effect even without a change in systemic blood pressure, they are superior to other agents in treating microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria in initially normotensive or mildly hypertensive diabetic patients (BÃ¶hlen 1994).
In a study (of both normotensives and hypertensives) designed to determine whether captopril was associated with an effect independent of its role as an antihypertensive agent, Lewis et al concluded that the beneficial effect of captopril was not explained by small differences in the level of blood pressure control between captopril and placebo groups (Lewis 1993).
They concluded that
captopril slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy by a mechanism that is independent of its antihypertensive properties.
In proteinuric diabetic patients with normal blood pressure and normal renal function, captopril acutely lowered albuminuria without lowering blood pressure (Elving 1992).
Parving et al (Parving 1994) concluded, from a meta-analysis based on randomised controlled trials lasting more than one year, that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition arrests the progressive rise in albuminuria in normotensive insulin dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy (Parving 1989).
But mean arterial pressure fell by 3 (SE 2) mmHg in the captopril treated group and rose by 6 (SE 1) mmHg in the controls.
Albuminuria declined by 11% in the captopril group and rose by 55% in the controls.
The glomerular filtration rate declined by 3.1 (SE 2.8) ml/min/1.73 m2 with captopril and by 6.4 (SE 3.1) ml/min/1.73 m2 in the controls.
No severe side effects occurred.
They concluded that, the crucial question, requiring longer term follow up, had not been answered - namely can the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate be reduced or even prevented in normotensive diabetic nephropathy by captopril or other hypotensive regimens? SIDE EFFECTS Known side effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are persistent dry cough (EUCLID 1997), in some 5% to 20% of patients (Israili 1992; Molyneaux 1996), and exacerbation of inflammation (Vane 1995).
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may affect potassium levels and should not be used in combination with potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements (British Nat For 1997).
Objectives It may be possible to slow or halt the progression of diabetes to end-stage renal failure by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition for reasons other than their antihypertensive properties.
If so, it may be desirable to treat normotensive diabetics exhibiting microalbuminuria with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
This has been investigated by examining published randomised controlled trials on initially normotensive patients.
Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Randomised controlled trials of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, lasting for at least one year.
Types of participants Initially normotensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or overt albuminuria.
Types of intervention The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril were each used in six studies.
Lisinopril was used in one study.
The meta-analyses exclude one of the captopril studies.
Types of outcome measures Study changes in blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, and albumin excretion rate.
Longer term outcomes were not available.
Search strategy for identification of studies See: Collaborative Review Group search strategy MEDLINE was searched for English language reviews and randomised controlled trials using the terms 'diabetes 
Interest was confined to randomised controlled trials in which normotensive diabetic patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least one year.
Reference lists of retrieved papers were checked.
Personal reference lists were also used.
A draft of the first version of this review was presented to a scientific meeting of the Scottish Study Group for the Care of the Young Diabetic which, inter alia, provided an opportunity to check comprehensiveness of retrieved studies.
Readers are invited to suggest studies, particularly in other languages, which should be considered for inclusion when this report is next updated.
Methods of the review
Where publications included appropriate raw data, means and variances were recalculated.
Otherwise a measure of location could be either mean or median or midpoint of a confidence interval or range.
Variances were sometimes calculated from standard deviations, standard errors, confidence intervals or ranges.
In the latter case this involved a, sometimes questionable, assumption of distribution symmetry.
Not all publications specify whether 'Â±' is followed by a standard deviation or standard error.
Some papers, or groups of papers contained conflicting figures.
For some study variables, published standard errors and standard deviations were reconciled by assuming that not all patients contributed to the given data.
Data from Hansen et al (1994) were used to supplement those of Viberti et al (1994), but only when there was no risk of double counting.
Generally, meta-analyses were carried out using inverse variance weighted, rather than standardised, means but the latter were employed to reduce heterogeneity and logarithmic transformation to counteract skewness.
In order to assess changes, an 'effect' is defined as the difference between study duration increment for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and control groups.
Unless raw data were available, the standard deviation of change has been calculated assuming (questionably) that start and end measures of location are independent.
This was necessitated by the summary nature of the data examined and leads to a conservative estimate of standardised average change.
Since data may be a mixture of arithmetic mean, geometric mean and median using two units of measurement, caution is advisable.
Description of studies See: Tables of studies Twelve studies were found to satisfy the criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis.
Data and descriptions may have been extracted from more than one publication but without multiple counting.
The Ahmad 1997 and Laffel 1995 studies were not included in the previous review and that of Sano 1995 now includes extended data.
Ravid 1994 has also been extended but only the first five years met our criteria for inclusion.
Usual diabetic diets were specified with only Bakris 1994 mentioning salt restriction.
The control group for Hallab 1993 was given a diuretic, otherwise controls received no treatment or an inert placebo unless there was more than one control group, in which case only the placebo control group has been included here.
If patients became hypertensive, antihypertensive therapy was sometimes added.
Definitions of normotensive varied for the studies included in this report, although none had blood pressure exceeding 160/95 mmHg, which is the World Health Organisation definition in the absence of multiple risk factors.
Most studies explicitly excluded comorbidities but the presence of diabetes could make the lower WHO guideline blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg inappropriate.
See table 1 for the definitions of 'normotensive' used in the different trials.
Both insulin dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients are included in randomised controlled trials usually of captopril (25 to 100 mg/day) or enalapril (5 to 20 mg/day).
Lisinopril was used in one study, the dosage being
chosen to reduce glomerular filtration rate to at most 140 mL/min.
Sample sizes in individual studies were often small.
The numbers on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and placebo who completed their respective courses were 237 and 234 out of a total of 538 patients admitted to studies in the meta-analyses and 304 and 304 out of 681 patients overall.
Most patients initially had microalbuminuria but some had overt albuminuria.
When the age of onset of diabetes was specified, it was always less than 41 years.
Methodological quality See: Table of included studies The 12 studies had a variety of inclusion/exclusion criteria but all were randomised control studies in which normotensive diabetics received an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for at least one year.
Randomisation was reported to have been concealed in only two of these trials.
Blinded outcome was mentioned for most but the use of intention-to-treat analyses were less in evidence.
Six studies reported steps taken to establish compliance.
No study continued until patients experienced end-stage renal failure.
Reasons for withdrawal were generally given but in three studies it was not possible to identify the treatment group of patients withdrawing prior to the end of the study.
The reported reasons for dropouts show little difference between treated and control patients.
The quality of studies was assessed using a score with seven components, based on Kleijnen 1991.
This allocates 30 of the available 100 points for the numbers of patients in the groups compared.
Only the study excluded from the meta-analyses and one other were large enough to obtain more than ten of these and most scored zero.
Maximum scores available for other aspects were patient characteristics (10), randomisation (20), intervention descriptions (5), double blinding (20), relevance and description of outcomes (10), and checkability of analysis (5).
The average score of meta-analyses studies was 55 (range 34-78).

List of comparisons Additional tables
Except where otherwise stated, these results refer to studies included in the meta-analyses.
BASELINE DATA The proportions of males were not significantly heterogeneous and overall, at 54% and 58% did not differ substantially for the treatment and control groups.
Duration of diabetes was not significantly heterogeneous or different for the 11 studies with estimates, the treatment and control means being 12.3 and 12.7 years, respectively.
Age on admission to the 12 combined studies varied because of patient selection criteria used but, if it were considered reasonable to perform a test, overall the studies would not be found to be significantly heterogeneous.
Less surprisingly, because of de facto within study matching, the average ages of all those receiving and those not receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition were the same, at 41 years.
Body mass index was available for eight of the studies, some of which stated an upper limit for trial acceptance.
Most studies had a (baseline) lower average body mass index in their treatment group; pooled mean body mass indices being 23.8 and 23.2 for patients on placebo and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, respectively.
The difference has a 95% confidence interval from 0.4 to 0.9 and is highly significant.
Those studies that provided data on baseline insulin dose exhibited no significant heterogeneity or difference between treated and untreated groups.
The studies do not exhibit significant heterogeneity in initial mean systolic, diastolic or arterial blood pressures even though the latter may have been the subject of varying definitions.
The pooled mean initial blood pressures were nonsignificantly higher for those treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (130/78 mmHg) than for those on placebo (128/78 mmHg).
But the five mean arterial pressures of those assigned to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had a significantly higher average (96.7 compared to 95.4 mmHg), the excess having 95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9 mmHg.
The ten studies for which adequate estimates were available did not have significantly heterogeneous or different initial glycosylated haemoglobin, means
being 8.9% and 8.7% for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and control groups, respectively.
Glomerular filtration rates could be compared for patients entering seven studies.
Again there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies and the pooled means were not significantly different for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and control groups, at 125 and 128 ml/min/1.73m2, respectively.
Baseline albumin excretion rates that had been measured in mg per day were not significantly heterogeneous or different, averaging 134 and 129 for treatment and control.
But those measured in microg per minute (treatment mean 96; control mean 115) were significantly heterogeneous.
After logarithmic transformation, to counteract distributional skewness, neither heterogeneity or difference between treated and untreated groups remained significant.
END OF STUDY DATA The seven studies with estimates for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were very highly significantly heterogeneous, as were the five with end of study arterial pressures (p 
This reflects different policies on blood pressure targets and the addition of other antihypertensive treatments.
Pooled mean blood pressures for the treated group were lower than for the untreated group for all three types of pressure (127/76 and 97 mmHg for treated; 129/79and101 mmHg for control), but mean blood pressures for individual studies did not all follow the same pattern and the heterogeneity renders the differences nonsignificant.
End of study glycosylated haemoglobin showed significant heterogeneity between ten studies (Hansen et al (1994) being used vice Viberti et al (1994)).
(Chisquared was 20 with nine degrees of freedom; p 
Values for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (8.8%) and placebo (8.7%) groups were, however, very close.
End of study glomerular filtration rate was homogeneous for five studies compared, also with no significant difference between the two groups of patients (treatment 121; control 119 ml/min/1.73m2).
End-of-study albumin excretion rates measured in microg per minute were very significantly heterogeneous but this was entirely removed by (skewness and
variance reducing) logarithmic transformation.
The overall treatment mean (98 mg per day; 71 microg per minute) was significantly lower than the corresponding control group mean (285 mg per day; 187 microg per minute).
STUDY CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE The studies for which initial and final systolic and diastolic blood pressure were available did not have homogeneous data (p 
Estimated mean changes in systolic and diastolic pressures during the course of trials were downward for those on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (130/78 to 127/76 mmHg) and upwards for controls (128/78 to 129/79 mmHg) despite the use of other antihypertensives in some cases.
Mean arterial pressure rose little for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor group (96.7 to 97.0 mmHg) and not as much as for the controls (95 to 101 mmHg).
Thus overall a significantly greater antihypertensive effect was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group.
The relatively large study excluded from meta-analysis (Laffel 1995) had results consistent with the above.
STUDY CHANGES IN GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN Where beginning and end of study data were available, the differential effect on glycosylated haemoglobin was not significantly heterogeneous.
The pooled mean effect was just significant with an average fall from 8.89% to 8.85% for the treated groups and a rise from 8.71% to 8.74% in the control groups.
Glycaemic control did not differ between treatment and control groups in Laffel 1995.
STUDY CHANGES IN GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE Where beginning and end of study data were available, the differential effects were not significantly heterogeneous and pooled mean effects were not significantly different for glomerular filtration rate.
STUDY CHANGES IN ALBUMIN EXCRETION RATE The 12 studies were extremely heterogeneous with regard to the differing effects
of placebo and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on albumin excretion rate ( chisquared with 11 degrees of freedom = 120; p 
This is partly because albumin excretion rate has a very skewed distribution.
Logarithmic transformation reduces but does not eliminate the heterogeneity overall (chisquared with 11 degrees of freedom = 30; p 
Albumin excretion rate fell for patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 11 of the 12 studies but did so for only two of the 12 groups on placebo.
The estimated effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was highly significant (p 
The pattern of effects is the same and significant in both measurement subgroups.
In seven studies the patients were exclusively described as type 1 or insulin dependent and in four as solely type 2 or non-insulin-dependent.
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition provided a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate in both groups as well as in the remaining study, which included both types of diabetic patient.
Captopril, enalapril and lisinopril were used in five, six and one of the combined studies, respectively.
All three angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting drugs significantly reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with controls.
Captopril was prescribed for insulin dependent subjects in Laffel 1995, where albumin excretion rate increased at an annual rate of 11.8% (95% confidence interval -3.3% to 29.1%) in the placebo group while it declined by 17.9% (95% confidence interval -29.6% to -4.3%) in the captopril group (p=0.004); results consistent with those of the meta-analyses.
Discussion There appears to be a rise in blood pressure associated with the change from normoalbuminuria through microalbuminuria (Mathiesen 1991) to macroalbuminuria.
Patients may start and some remain normotensive, although with higher pressures than normoalbuminurics (Viberti 1984) and an increased proportion of hypertensives (Parving 1993).
This is true of both insulin dependent and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients (Parving et al 1993).
Eventually diabetic patients become hypertensive and hypertensive diabetic patients benefit from the use of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, since reduction of blood pressure slows the progression to end-stage renal failure (Mogensen 1982; Parving 1983; Parving 1987; Mathiesen 1989).
When systemic blood pressure can be lowered by 20%, as is desirable and achievable in more severely hypertensive patients, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, conventional therapy, and several calcium antagonists all have a reported antiproteinuric action (BÃ¶hlen 1994).
Intraglomerular hypertension may exist whether or not systemic hypertension is present (Anderson 1988).
Assuming that intraglomerular hypertension is an independent contributor to progressive renal injury, drugs that specifically lower intraglomerular pressures independent of their effect on systemic blood pressure might prove especially beneficial in reducing the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are such a group of drugs.
The proposed beneficial effect in renal disease is predicated on their ability to predominately alter efferent arteriolar tone and consequently decrease intraglomerular pressure independent of their effect on systemic blood pressure (Sirmon 1991).
The EUCLID study (EUCLID 1997) found that lisinoplil had scarcely any effect on the albumin excretion rate of those starting with normoalbuminuria but considerable effect on the albumin excretion rate of those with microalbuminuria.
The purpose of treating microalbuminuric diabetic patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is not to reduce albumin excretion rate or to prevent its progression per se, but to prevent a future decline in glomerular filtration rate which otherwise would be expected in the majority of these patients (Mogensen 1995) and lead to end-stage renal failure and cardiovascular death (Passa 1992).
In the natural history of diabetes the decline in glomerular filtration rate usually occurs with the development of overt proteinuria.
At the stage of normo- or micro-
albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate is generally well preserved and may even be at the supranormal level (Mogensen et al 1992).
A meta-analysis of controlled and noncontrolled studies, lasting at least 6 months, on diabetics and nondiabetics found that, in addition to the long-term beneficial effects of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate that are independent of blood pressure reductions (Maki 1995).
Definitions of normotensive varied for the studies included in this report (see description of studies), but reduction of albumin excretion rate associated with lowered blood pressure appears to be no respecter of thresholds.
Albuminuria, like hypertension, is defined with reference to an underlying continuous variable.
Microalbuminuria was defined either as 30 to 300 mg/day or as 20 to 200 microg/min, usually found in at least two out of three determinations.
Albumin excretion rates were obtained by differing techniques, recorded sometimes as mg/24h and sometimes as microg/min, and reported as arithmetic or geometric means or medians, perhaps after transformation.
But the beneficial effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in limiting its rise is clear.
None of the studies lasted long enough to establish a relationship with end-stage renal failure, but after an open follow-up extension of their study Ravid et al (Ravid 1996) concluded that treatment with enalapril resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 42% for nephropathy to develop during seven years (95% confidence interval 15% to 69%; p 
It has been suggested that treatment at the onset of microalbuminuria is an extremely cost-effective therapy (Rodby 1996).
Reviewers' conclusions Implications for practice
Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can arrest and even reduce the albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric normotensive diabetics.
This is accompanied by some reduction or prevention of increase in systemic blood pressure and it is not possible to be certain that reduction of albumin excretion rate is due to a separate renal effect.
There appear to be no substantial side effects.
A direct link with postponement of end-stage renal failure has not been demonstrated.
Implications for research Studies which are sufficiently longterm to examine directly the relationship between early use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and end stage renal failure are still desirable.
Ideally these should be carried out in representative groups of patients with both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Notes This update was done quite a while before the establishment of the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group, but never published.
As two new studies are included in the review we feel that it is appropriate to include the new version.
Readers should realise, however, that a new update is due now and that further work will be necessary on this review in the near future.

Table of excluded studies Study Reason for exclusion Anonymous To avoid double counting.
This is a reanalysis of the Laffel and Viberti studies which have been included.
1996 EUCLID 1997 This study included some patients with normoalbuminuria.
Also results were in diagrams rather than useable tables and correspondence did not elicit further data.
Heinemann The study lasted less than a year.
1996 Melbourne This study used both hypertensive and normotensive patients.
It was excluded because the numbers of normotensive patients randomised to 1991 perindopril and nifedipine are not given and so data for the normotensives could not be separately identified.
Mogensen 1992a Only an abstract was available and this provided insufficient information.
Molyneaux treatment lasted less than a year and not all patients were normotensive.
1996 Trevisan 1995 This study lasted less than a year and included some mildly hypertensive patients.
