Archived Information Annual Report on School Safety 1998 October 1998 D E A R C O L L E A G U E: Following the tragic shooting at West Paducah High School in December 1997, Pr esident Clinton dir ected the U.S. Depar tments of Education and Justice to pr epare, for the first time, an annual r epor t on school safety.
The first Annual Repor t on School Safety provides parents, schools, and the community with an over view of the scope of school crime, and describes actions schools and communities can take to address this critical issue.
The recent tragedies experienced by the communities of Springfield, Or egon; Edinboro, Pennsylvania; Jonesbor o, Arkansas; West Paducah, Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi; and others have made an indelible mark on the minds and hear ts of all Americans.
Yet, it is impor tant to remember that ninety percent of our schools ar e free of serious, violent crime.
While our schools ar e among the safest places for students to be on a day-to-day basis, any school crime is too much.
School violence is a complicated societal pr oblem.
It is not, however, insur mountable.
Many schools have cr eated safe and sound envir onments, overcoming the influences of violence in their communities.
Many schools have developed successful compr ehensive school safety plans that incor porate effective, research-based programs and strategies; zer o-tolerance policies for dr ugs and weapons; and community collaboration.
School safety must be a priority not only for schools, but for the entire community as well.
In particular, it is imperative that we work toward three priorities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Improving data collection and identifying data gaps at the Federal, State, and local level will help impr ove prevention activities and the allo cation of scar ce dr ug and violence pr evention resources.
Schools and communities cannot develop ef fective strategies without a thor ough understanding of the natur e and extent of youth dr ug use and violence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Community leaders and or ganizations must be involved in the development and implementation of school safety plans.
Active par ticipation from parents, teachers, students, law enfor cement, elected of ficials and business leaders, to name just a few, is needed to help cr eate and maintain schools in which students and educators alike feel safe and secur e, and where they can confidently pursue the primar y business of schools--education.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ No single program or strategy can ef fectively meet the needs of all students.
Successful school safety plans will involve a variety of br oadbased strategies, policies, and pr ograms that focus on impr oving the overall quality of the school envir onment.
We hope that this r epor t will encourage schools, families, and communities ar ound the countr y to adopt these priorities and take action against crime and violence in their own schools and communities.
This first Annual Repor t on School Safety is dedicated to all of the students and teachers who have lost their lives at school.
We must never for get them.

In fact, a child is mor e likely to be a victim of a violent crime in the community or at home than at school.
In par ticular, homicides in school ar e extremely rare events.
However, violence does occur in schools, endangering students and teachers and compr omising the lear ning environment.
We must not tolerate any school violence.
This r epor t provides a description of the natur e and extent of crime and violence on school proper ty, and presents infor mation on how schools and communities can work together to pr event and address school violence.
The data in this r epor t show a decline in school crime and a r eduction in the per centage of students car r ying weapons to school.
At the same time, the data indicate a substantial amount of crime, including violent crime, against both students and teachers.
It is also ver y impor tant to note that students are more fear ful at school today than in the past.
These conditions highlight the impor tance of accurately measuring incidents of school crime so that we can impr ove our school envir onments and make them safer places.
Schools are responding to the challenge posed by school crime in many ways.
They ar e implementing zer o-tolerance policies, incr easing school secu rity, and implementing for mal school violence pr evention or reduction programs.
Many schools ar e working with communities to successfully r educe school crime and violence by adopting a strategy that takes into account the specific safety pr oblems experienced by the school and then identifies appropriate inter ventions.
This pr oblem-solving appr oach requires the school and community to collaborate to develop and implement a compr ehensive school safety plan.
Steps for developing and implementing a compr ehensive school safety plan ar e described in this r epor t: (1) establish school-community par tnerships; (2) identify and measur e the problem; (3) set measurable goals and objectives; (4) identify appr opriate research-based programs and strate gies; (5) implement the compr ehensive plan; (6) evaluate the plan; and (7) r evise the plan on the basis of the evaluation.
The r epor t also provides infor mation on what schools, students, par ents, business leaders, law enfor cement and juvenile justice agencies, and elected of ficials and gover nment agencies can do to contribute to the cr eation of safer schools.
Despite recent tragedies that r eceived national attention, schools should not be singled out as especially danger ous places.
Rather, schools should be the focus of community collaborations that cr eate safe lear ning environments for all students.
iv INTRODUCTION The vast majority of America's schools are safe places.
Two decades of comprehensive research support this conclusion.
Yet, reports of gun-, gang-, and drug-induced violence sometimes create the impression that such violence is per vasive in our Nation's schools and instill fear in the minds of parents, students, and teachers.
While this fear is understandable, it is not based on fact.
It is tr ue that some schools do have serious crime and violence pr oblems and that these pr oblems both compr omise the lear ning environment and endanger our childr en and educators.
These pr oblems urgently need to be identified, analyzed, and addr essed.
All childr en deser ve to have a safe, orderly school envir onment in which to lear n and grow.
The first Annual Repor t on School Safety pr esents a description of the natur e and extent of crime and violence on school pr oper ty.
It shows what measures some schools have taken to pr event or addr ess school violence and pr ovides parents, students, and educators with infor mation and resources to evaluate and enhance their own school's level of safety.
The repor t is divided into four chapters: The Natur e and Scope of School V iolence, What Communities Can Do Thr ough Collaboration, Model Pr ograms, and Resour ces.
Chapter 1 pr esents the natur e and scope of school violence in the United States.
A national perspective on school crime and safety issues is pr esented by examining data on crimes against students, violent student deaths at school, crime at public schools as r epor ted to police, crimes against teachers, gangs at school, weapons at school, the r elationship between school crime and dr ug availability, student perceptions of school safety, and effor ts by schools to incr ease school safety.
More detailed presentations of these and other r elated national data can be found in Indicators of School Crime and Safety, 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bur eau of Justice Statistics (see Refer ences).
State and local data on school crime and safety ar e also presented in the for m of student risk behavior data (such as self-r epor ted weapon car r ying).
Chapter 2 describes steps that communities can take to develop a compr ehensive plan to r educe school crime and violence.
It also highlights what schools, students, par ents, police and juvenile justice authorities, businesses, and elected of ficials and gover nment agencies can do to cr eate a safe lear ning environment for all students.
Chapter 3 presents summar y infor mation on model pr ograms that have demonstrated success or ar e promising in addr essing the problems and issues related to school crime.
Communities can consider these pr ograms in developing and implementing their compr ehensive plans.
The chapter is or ganized by the types of pr oblems schools encounter: aggr ession/fighting, bullying, family issues, gangs, racial and other bias-r elated conflict, sexual harassment/sexual violence, substance abuse, tr uancy/dropout, vandalism, and weapons.
Chapter 4 lists r esources for more infor mation about school safety and crime issues.
These r esources include or ganizations, Web sites, listser ves, videos, Federal r esources, and publications.
Throughout the r epor t, school pr ofiles highlight several schools that ar e doing an exemplar y job of creating and maintaining safe envir onments.
The highlighted schools have developed and implemented compr ehensive approaches for school safety that will be continued or enhanced in the futur e.
These schools have put in place a combination of pr ograms and strategies that include school security, schoolwide education in violence pr evention, counseling, and specialized student ser vices such as alter native educational appr oaches for high-risk students.
v vi CHAPTER 1: THE NATURE AND OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE SCOPE The recent school shootings have drawn heightened public attention to school crime and safety.
Unfor tunately, public perceptions of school safety are often fueled by media accounts that play up sensational events and fail to pr ovide a real understanding of the accomplishments of schools or the problems they face.
The heightened public attention does pr ovide an oppor tunity to closely examine what is happening in schools today.
As we lear n more, we can use that knowledge to fashion rational policies and strategies for pr eventing crime and incr easing school safety.
Assessing the safety of our schools, on both national and local levels, is a complex under taking.
This repor t brings together, in one document, crit ical infor mation gleaned fr om numerous sur veys and repor ts.
While we do not know as much about thr eats to school safety as we might like, this document is a star ting point fr om which an initial assessment of school safety emer ges.
As more schools and jurisdictions collect data on school crime and safety issues, we will be able to eliminate infor mation gaps.
Readers should note that this r epor t specifically addr esses intentional injuries and crimes against students and teachers.
School-r elated accidents and unintentional injuries, which far exceed the amount of school crime, wer e purposely excluded.
The first section of this chapter presents national data on school crime and youth violence.
Data on specific school policies and practices designed to increase school safety follow.
The chapter concludes with selected data for individual States and localities.
A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE This section provides a national picture of American schools and the amount of crime experienced by those who work and learn there.
It attempts to answer those questions that are at the heart of the school safety issue.
How much crime is occurring in our Nation's schools? Are schools more or less safe than in the past? Do students feel safe at school? What kinds of crimes are occurring? How likely is it that students or teachers will become the victims of school crime? What other conditions seem to be associated with an unsafe school environment? The answers to these questions present a mixed story.
We are given hope by data showing declining school crime and a reduction in the number of guns being carried to school.
At the same time, there remains a substantial amount of crime, including violent crime, against both students and teachers in too many schools.
It is also very important to note that students are more fearful at school today than in the past.
These conditions highlight the importance of accurately measuring incidents of school crime so that we can improve our school environments and make them safer places.
Data used in this chapter are drawn from several different studies conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Sur vey Research Center of the University of Michigan.
A complete list of the studies is included in the References section of this report.
All studies used nationally representative samples, except for the data source on school-associated violent deaths, which tracked all school-associated violent deaths in the countr y. Data sources for the different studies varied.
Some sur veyed different populations of students, another sur veyed teachers and yet another sur veyed schools.
Definitions of crime, age groups analyzed and time periods can var y from indicator to indicator.
The reader should also note that definitions can var y across studies.
For example, "at school" and "away from school" may have different meanings, depending upon the study.
The same is true for urbanicity ("urban," "rural," "suburban").
For a more complete understanding of the data in this report, see Indicators of School Crime and Safety, 1998, or the original studies, listed in the References section.

Note: Number of students (public and private) are projected data from 1996-97.
Number of public schools are from 1996-97; number of private schools are from 1995-96.
1 Due to the small number of private middle schools, they are not counted as a separate category.
2 For private schools, these are combined schools that cross the elementary/secondary boundary.
Despite recent occurrences, schools should not be singled out as especially dangerous places in the community.
Most school crime is theft, not serious violent crime.
While students were victims of about the same number of crimes in and out of school in 1996 (about three million at either location), the nature of crime outside of school is far more serious than in school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Students ages 12 through 18 were more likely to be victims of serious violent crime away from school than at school.
In 1996, about 26 of every 1,000 students (ages 12 to 18) were victims of serious violent crimes away from school (a total of 671,000 serious violent crimes).
In contrast, about 10 of every 1,000 students were victims of serious violent crimes at school or going to and from school (255,000 total).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In 1996, there were 79 thefts for every 1,000 students (age 12 to 18) at school.
Theft accounted for about 62 percent of all crime against students at school that year.

Serious Violent Crime Against Students At and Away from School Number per 1,000 40 30 20 10 0 Students in school today are not significantly more likely to be victimized than in previous years.
Since 1993, the overall school crime rate for students ages 12 to 18 declined, as did rates of crime outside of school for this group.
The percentage of 12th graders reporting intentional injuries with a weapon has not changed significantly during the past 20 years.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The overall school crime rate between 1993 and 1996 declined slightly, from about 164 school-related crimes for every 1,000 students ages 12 to 18 in 1993 to about 128 such crimes in 1996.
Crime victimization outside of school declined from about 140 crimes for every 1,000 students in this age group in 1993 to 117 such crimes in 1996.

While the number of multiple homicide events at school has increased, there exists a less than one in a million chance of suffering a school-associated violent death, but even that is too much.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fewer than 1 percent of the more than 7,000 children who were murdered in 1992 and 1993 combined were killed at school.
In the 1992-93 and 1993-94 school years combined, 63 students ages 5 through 19 were murdered at school and 13 committed suicide at school.
Nationwide, during roughly the same time-frame, a total of 7,357 children ages 5 to 19 were murdered and 4,366 committed suicide, both in and out of school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Preliminary data indicate that school-associated violent deaths have decreased in the past two years.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The number of multiple-victim homicide events at schools has increased, from two in the 1992-93 school year to six in 1997-98.
The number of victims in these events has also increased (from four in 1992-93 to 16 in 1997-98).

Any school crime is too much, and violence in schools is especially disturbing.
A small minority of public schools reported one or more serious violent crimes to the police during the 1996-97 school year.
Of crimes reported to police in 1996-97, the most common types of middle and high school crimes were physical attacks and fights without weapons.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Of crimes reported to police, during the 1996-97 school year, 10 percent of all public schools reported one or more serious violent crimes to the police or other law Injuries at School, With a Weapon Percentage of 12th graders who reported that someone had injured them with a weapon at school during the past 12 months, by sex: 1976 1996 Male Total Percent Female 10 8 6 4 2 0 '76 '77 '78 '79 '80 '81 '82 '83 '84 '85 '86 '87 '88 '89 '90 '91 '92 '93 '94 '95 '96 Schools Reporting Crime to Police Percentage of public schools indicating the seriousness of reported crimes occuring at the school: 1996 1997 At least one serious violent crime Note: Examples of weapons are knives, guns, and clubs.

Another 47 percent of public schools reported at least one less serious or nonviolent crime to police (but did not report any serious violent crime).
The remaining 43 percent of public schools did not report any of these crimes to the police.
3 Students are more vulnerable to crime at certain ages and in certain school environments.
Students in upper grades are more vulnerable to crime, and crime of a more serious nature, than students in lower grades.
In addition, students in larger schools experience higher rates of crime at school than students in smaller schools.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ During the 1996-97 school year, about 21 percent of all public high schools and 19 percent of all public middle schools reported at least one serious violent crime to the police or other law enforcement representatives.
Four percent of all public elementary schools did the same.

This translates into a rate of 30 violent crimes for every 1,000 teachers and a rate of 46 thefts for every 1,000 teachers.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ One-third of schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more reported at least one serious violent crime, compared with less than one-tenth of schools with fewer than 1,000 students.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Schools in cities were at least twice as likely to report serious violent crime as those in towns and in rural locations, although city schools were not significantly different from urban fringe schools.
Seventeen percent of city schools and eleven percent of schools in urban fringe areas reported at least one serious violent crime, while 8 percent of rural schools and 5 percent of schools in towns reported any serious violent crime.
Teachers' concerns about their own safety are not without foundation.
As with students, most crime at school against teachers is theft.
Teachers in urban schools and high schools are more vulnerable to crime at school than are rural or elementary school teachers.
Although most teachers are female, male teachers had a considerably higher likelihood of being victims of crime.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ On average each year, from 1992 to 1996, about four out of every 1,000 elementary, middle, and high school teachers were the victims of serious violent crime at school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Teachers in urban schools (39 for every 1,000) were more likely to be victims of violent crime than were teachers in suburban and rural schools (20 for every 1,000 teachers in suburban schools and 22 for every 1,000 teachers in rural schools).
A smaller percentage of students are bringing weapons to school.
The presence of deadly weapons at school creates an intimidating and threatening atmosphere, making both teaching and learning difficult.
Contrary to public perception, the percentages of students who report carrying a weapon or a gun to school has declined in recent years.
Carrying a Weapon, Grades 9 12 Percentage of students in grades 912 who reported carrying a weapon on school property on one or more of the past 30 days, by race-ethnicity: 1993,1995, and 1997 1993 1995 Percent 1997 15 dents (on average, about 2 percent of female students took weapons to school during this time period).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ About 3 percent of high school seniors reported carrying a gun to school at least 1 day during the previous 4week period.
This percentage remained fairly stable from 1994 to 1996.
There are consequences for students who carry firearms to school.

While the school crime rate is decreasing, students feel less safe at school.
Crimes involving students and teachers, no matter how infrequent, contribute to a climate of fear that erodes the quality of any school.
Although student victimization rates have remained relatively stable over the past few years, more students feel unsafe while they are at school or traveling to and from school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In 1989, 6 percent of students ages 12 through 19 feared they were going to be attacked or harmed at 12th Graders Carrying a Weapon to School Percentage of 12th graders who reported carr ying a weapon to school at least one day in the past four weeks, by sex: Selected years 1992 to1996 Male Female Percent Total 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Note: Examples of weapons are knives, guns, and clubs.

5 school.
In 1995, the figure was 9 percent.
Looking at the same two time points, the percentage of students fearing they would be attacked while traveling to and from school rose from 4 to 7 percent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of students ages 12 through 19 who avoided one or more places at school for fear of their own safety increased from 5 to 9 percent.
Some conditions make students more vulnerable to school crime.
The presence of street gangs and drugs is related to increased school crime and victimization of students.
Gang activity at school has increased sharply.
Violent victimization of students often co-exists with reported availability of drugs in school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of students who reported that street gangs were present at their schools increased from 15 to 28 percent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In 1995, urban students were more likely to report that there were street gangs at their schools (41 percent) than Whatever the approach, it is important to recognize that acting in isolation will not bring about meaningful change in school safety.
Instead, research indicates that school safety is best enhanced by schoolwide policies and practices that systemically address needs of students, school personnel, the community, and the physical plant of the school.
Examples of successful schoolwide efforts to enhance school safety and successful programs are found in chapter 3 and the descriptions of model schools interspersed throughout the report.
In 1996-97, most public schools reported having zero-tolerance policies toward serious student offenses.
A "zero-tolerance policy" was defined as a school or district policy that mandates predetermined consequences or punishments for specific offenses.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ At least nine out of 10 schools reported zero-tolerance policies for firearms (94 percent) and weapons other than firearms (91 percent).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Eighty-seven and 88 percent of schools have policies of zero-tolerance for alcohol and drugs, respectively.
Seventynine percent of schools also had zero-tolerance policies for Street Gangs at School Percentage of students ages 12 through 19 who reported that street gangs were present at their school, by place of residence: 1989 and 1995 Urban Suburban Percent Rural 50 40 30 20 10 0 Zero-Tolerance Policies Percent of public schools that have adopted zero-tolerance policies for various student offenses: 1996 1997 Percent 100 80 60 40 20 0 1989 1995 Violence Tobacco Alcohol Drugs Source: US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Sur vey, 1989 and 1995.

were suburban students (26 percent) or rural students (20 percent).
Between 1989 and 1995, reports of gang presence increased across all three residence categories.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In 1995, students who reported that they had been the victim of a violent crime at school were more likely to report that drugs were available at school than students who reported that they had not been violently victimized at school (73 percent compared with 65 percent). violence and for tobacco.
In 1996-97, public schools reported that they used a number of measures to increase security: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ninety-six percent required visitors to sign in before entering the school building.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Eighty percent had a closed campus policy that prohibited most students from leaving the campus for lunch.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fifty-three percent controlled access to their school buildings.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Twenty-four percent controlled access to their school grounds.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nineteen percent conducted drug sweeps.
PUBLIC SCHOOL POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATED TO SCHOOL SAFETY Schools respond to the challenge posed by school crime in many ways.
They are implementing zero-tolerance policies, increasing school security, and implementing formal school violence prevention or reduction programs.
6 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Four percent of schools performed random metal detector checks on students.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ One percent of public schools used metal detectors daily.
In addition to the security measures described above, schools reported using other types of approaches: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Six percent of public schools had police or other law enforcement representatives stationed 30 hours a week or more at the school in a typical week during the 1996-97 school year.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ One percent of schools stationed police or other law enforcement personnel from 10 to 29 hours per week, and three percent had them stationed from one to nine hours a week.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Twelve percent did not have police or other law enforcement representatives stationed during a typical week.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seventy-eight percent did not have any such persons stationed during the past year.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A majority of public schools (78 percent) had some type of formal school violence prevention or reduction programs in 1996-97.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Four percent of all public elementary schools required students to wear uniforms during the 1996-97 school year.
from having information about their students' health risk behaviors to use in planning and monitoring programs.
YRBS data are collected every two years.
In 1997, 12 States did not conduct the survey.
CDC provides technical assistance to States interested in conducting the YRBS.
States that want assistance should contact CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health at 770-488-3259.
More information about the YRBS may be found at www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dash.
Eleven States and seven cities have data that can be used to compare 1993 and 1997 results to determine whether student behaviors changed.
Between 1993 and 1997, several States and cities experienced significant decreases in student risk behaviors.
These changes are similar to the national trend.
National data are presented for comparison.
The national data are collected independently and are not a compilation of State and city data.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In two of the 11 States, the percentage of students who carried a weapon on school property on at least one of the 30 days preceding the survey decreased significantly from 1993 to 1997.
In the other nine States, there were no significant changes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In three of the seven cities, the percentage of students who carried a weapon on school property on at least one Carrying a Weapon on School Property, by State A STATE AND LOCAL PERSPECTIVE While national data contribute significantly to our understanding of school safety, they may not be the most useful source of information for States, districts, or schools in assessing the frequency and scope of school-related crime, identifying their specific school safety needs, and developing strategies to address those needs.
Data collected at the State and local levels are more useful in identifying problems and monitoring the progress of interventions.
Most State and local data related to school safety fall into two categories: student risk behavior data (such as self-reported weapon carrying) and incident data (such as violations of school policies).
Data on Student Risk Behaviors Many children and adolescents behave in ways that put them at risk for intentional injury.
Reducing these risk behaviors is a critical step in preventing injury and promoting school safety.
To monitor student risk behaviors, many States, territories, and cities conduct the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The YRBS, which includes questions about weapon carrying, physical fighting, and victimization on school property, is administered to students in grades 9-12.
States that conduct the YRBS benefit Percent of students in grades 912 who reported carrying a weapon on school property on one or more of the past 30 days, by State: 1993 1997 1993 1995 Percent 1997 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 AL HI MA MS MT NV SC* SD UT WV WI* US Total* * Significant difference between 1993 and 1997 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Youth Risk Behavior Sur veillance System Carrying a Weapon on School Property, by City Percent of students in grades 912 who reported carrying a weapon on school property on one or more of the past 30 days, by city: 1993 1997 1993 1995 Percent 1997 25 20 15 10 5 0 Boston Chicago Dallas Ft.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ The percentage of students who carried a weapon in any location on at least one of the 30 days preceding the survey decreased significantly in two cities, but there were no significant changes within any of the States or in the other five cities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property within the 12 months preceding the survey did not change significantly within any of the States or cities.
Improving Data Collection on School Crime Incidents Monitoring the number of violent and/or criminal incidents helps States and local organizations understand their school safety needs.
Uniform data collection is critical for monitoring problems across locations and determining where the greatest need for resources exists.
Some States do not collect incident-based data.
For this reason, significant gaps exist in Carrying a Weapon, by State Percent of students in grades 912 who reported carrying a weapon on one or more of the past 30 days, by state: 1993 1997 1993 1995 Percent 1997 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Threats/Injuries with a Weapon on School Property, by City Percent of students in grades 912 who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property one or more times during the past 12 months, by city: 1993 1997 Percent 20 15 10 5 1993 1995 1997 AL HI MA MS MT NV SC SD UT WV WI US Total 0 Boston Note: No significant differences between 1993 and 1997 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Youth Risk Behavior Sur veillance System Chicago Dallas Ft.

Currently, about half of all State education agencies (24 States) collect some type of crime and violence data from all local education agencies.
Information on major disciplinary actions and criminal/prohibited incidents is most commonly collected.
Only five States require local education agencies to report on both types of occurrences.
States whose efforts are of particularly high quality are Delaware, Florida, and South Carolina.
These States have implemented data collection systems that include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A comprehensive list of incidents.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Clear definitions of incidents.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Data used by multiple levels of the education system (state, district, and school).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Accurate tracking of data.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Staff training on data entry and use.
Several activities are under way at the State and local levels to address the need for collecting uniform data on violent and/or criminal incidents in schools and to improve data collection and reporting.

The redesigned program, called the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), collects data on criminal incidents reported to police and arrests within 22 crime categories and includes information about victims, offenders, and types of incidents, plus information about the location where each incident occurs.
One location that can be reported is a "school/college."
NIBRS has been implemented in about 2,100 jurisdictions in 13 States (Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin).
The U.S. Department of Education has also launched a major initiative to improve data collection and reporting.
In 1995, the National Forum on Education Statistics established a Crime, Violence, and Discipline Task Force.
This Task Force developed a model process that State and local education agencies can voluntarily use to improve their system for collecting data on crime in schools, Recommendations of the Crime, Violence, and Discipline Reporting Task Force, NCES 97 581.
The Forum is currently updating the model.
The most current model can be found at www.ed.gov/NCES and includes recommendations for: Ã¯Â¿Â½ What incidents should be included in a reporting system.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to define incidents.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to classify incidents that occur on school buses and at school-sponsored events.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to define and classify the people involved in an incident.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to monitor special situations such as gang-related incidents, alcohol and drug incidents, and hate crimes.
9 10 CHAPTER 2: WHA T COMMUNITIES CAN DO THROUGH COLLABORA TION For the majority of American childr en, schools offer safe environments.
All too fr equently, however, community violence spills over into the schools.
The result is a compr omised lear ning environment that endangers students and teachers.
Many communities ar e successfully r educing school crime and violence by adopting a strategy that takes into account the specific safety pr oblem experienced by the school and then identifies an appr opriate inter vention.
This pr oblem-solving appr oach requires that stakeholders in the community collaborate to develop and implement a compr ehensive school safety plan.
This plan r eflects the needs of the community and employs the best pr ograms and strategies to meet those needs.
Schools, par ents, business leaders, law enfor cement and juvenile justice agencies, community or ganizations, students, elected of ficials, and gover nment agencies play an impor tant par t in preparing a compr ehensive plan.
This chapter pr esents steps for developing and implementing a compr ehensive school safety plan: (1) establish school-community par tnerships; (2) identify and measur e the problem; (3) set measurable goals and objectives; (4) identify appr opriate programs and strategies; (5) implement the comprehensive plan; (6) evaluate the plan; and (7) r evise the plan on the basis of the evaluation.
This chapter also describes what schools, students, par ents, police and juvenile justice authorities, businesses, and elected of ficials and gover nment agencies can do to ensur e the plan's success.
Pr eparing a comprehensive school safety plan is a complex pr ocess that does not end with develop ment and implementation.
It r equires the stakeholders to continue to work together, overcome bar riers, monitor their pr ogress, and evaluate the effectiveness of their strategy.
These effor ts can achieve impr ovements to the plan that will pr omote success.
WHAT COMMUNITIES CAN DO These recommendations are derived from reports provided by school staff and their program evaluators, other guides that summarize violence prevention experiences, and nationwide sur vey data.
Reports from schools have been compared to identify actions that have been effective in diverse settings and can be taken by schools across the Nation.
Several prevention and inter vention guides were examined, and two were particularly useful: Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools by the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice (1998); and Creating Safe and Drug-Free Schools: An Action Guide by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Elementar y and Secondar y Education (1996).
The recommendations have also been influenced by conversations with teachers, parents, students, and other community members.
Risk and protective factors that can be addressed through prevention were derived from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the Monitoring the Future Study, the Youth Risk Behavior Sur vey, and the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Sur vey. 1.
Establish school-community partnerships.
Schools function within the broader community.
Participation from families, faith communities, businesses, health and social service agencies, police, juvenile justice authorities, and civic organizations is necessary to successfully intervene and prevent school violence.
Individually and collectively, community organizations have a great deal to contribute.
They can share information with schools on: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Youth crime.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Systems for measuring the levels of violence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sources of funding.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Volunteers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Learning opportunities and materials.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Services and programs for youth.
Harnessing these resources and creating a successful partnership to reduce school violence require strong leadership from school officials.
A workable school-community partnership invites multiple perspectives and allows for the sharing of responsibilities and accomplishments.
11 Examples of Collaborators on School Crime Prevention District superintendents, school board members, principals, teachers, counselors, coaches, school nurses, security officers, students, peers, community residents, siblings, parents, police, probation officers, judges, mayors, city council members and other elected officials, volunteers, leaders from Parent-Teacher Associations, community/professional agencies and societies, local nonprofit groups, religious groups, State and Federal agencies, businesses, teachers' unions, colleges and universities, health and social ser vice agencies, media, sports/recreation/parks, city council members, Boys 
Sources of Data for Assessing School Crime Schools are part of an interagency team that works together to collect data to identify and measure the problem.
A collaborative data collection effort includes collecting information on: Ã¯Â¿Â½ School incidents (fighting, weapon-carr ying, threatening, sex or race bias crimes, robber y, extortion, assault; vandalism, drug possession, use, or sales).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Juvenile arrests (murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, other sex offenses, armed robber y, robber y, assault, aggravated assault, burglar y, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, terrorism threats, drug abuse violations, vandalism, arson, weapons charges).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Juvenile court case dispositions (arrested, detained, came to trial, sentenced).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Social ser vices data (child abuse and neglect, domestic violence).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ School injur y and hospital data (emergency room admissions, gunshot wounds, stab wounds, drug-related conditions, sexual injuries, bruises, cuts, abrasions).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mental health ser vices data (incidents resulting in treatment for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, substance abuse, or other conditions).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Student/parent/staff/police sur veys, inter views, focus groups, and obser vations.
2.
Identify and measure the problem.
School administrators and personnel, students, parents, and community leaders have different perceptions of school crime.
These different perceptions make it difficult to agree on the primary school crime and safety issues that need to be addressed.
Because perceptions of problems are not always accurate, it is important to know which problems are real and to act on them.
In developing a comprehensive school safety plan, communities and schools should seek consensus on the primary issues.
This occurs when people become more informed by examining information from several sources and sharing it widely.
The box below provides a list of data sources for assessing the nature and extent of school crime and identifying the problems.
A resource for assistance with data collection efforts is local universities.
Once the effort to collect data gets under way, it is important to establish a more systematic means of tracking multiple infractions by individual students, identifying problem areas, and examining trends over time.
One data collection technique is to conduct anonymous student surveys to assess infrequent or underreported incidents and to measure attitudes and beliefs about crime.
Another technique employs focus groups and interviews with students and staff.
3.
Set measurable goals and objectives.
Goals describe broad purposes of anticipated measurable accomplishments.
Objectives are the sequential, measurable steps needed to achieve each goal.
Setting an unrealistic goal, such as eliminating school crime, makes it difficult to attain, increases the likelihood of failure, and invites criticism.
A goal is more useful when it is reasonably specific and is supported by a fairly short list of objectives.
Goals and objectives are based on accurate data and the identification of school-specific problems.
Realistic and attainable goals lead to greater commitment and, ultimately, long-term success.
Partners find that goals are more readily achieved when specific, manageable tasks are assigned to small groups of dedicated individuals.
Objectives describe "who will do how much of what by when."
Often the objectives are written in sequential order, but multiple objectives are generally addressed in overlapping periods of time.
Measurable objectives convey the advantage of knowing when, or whether, they have been achieved.
They do not need to be so specific that every minor action is included.
Stating the primary objectives is sufficient to allow accountability and to monitor progress.
Goals and objectives need to be altered over time as experience and wisdom are gained.
Communicating the goals to all participants throughout the intervention is very important, particularly if experience dictates that they change.
12 Examples of Goals and Objectives for Reducing School Crime Goal: Decrease Physical Fighting on School Grounds Objective 1: Professionals from the community will train 90 parents in nonviolent problem-solving and social skills by April 24.
Objective 2: The security officers will teach all school staff proper techniques for intervening in physical fights by November 1.
Objective 3: A subgroup will be established to study and report to the principal by Februar y 2 on how well the school policy on fighting is being communicated and how consistently it is enforced.
Objective 4: The vice principal will notify parents of all students involved in physical fights as participants or as instigators as soon as possible after the fight.
All those involved will be provided an information sheet concerning access to due process within the school and courts.
Objective 5: The school will be divided into physically and administratively separate units of no more than 300 students each by June 15.
Goal: Establish a Crisis Response Team Objective 1: A subgroup will research the key components of a crisis plan and identify school leaders, elected officials, and community members to ser ve on the crisis response team by November 15.
Objective 2: Professional security experts will train members of the team to respond to crises (such as violent incidents, suicides, and natural disasters) as a well-organized unit by Januar y 15.
Objective 3: The principal will inform school staff, parents, police, hospitals, elected officials, and other community members about the crisis response team by Januar y 15.
Objective 4: A system for communication among staff in the school and among the crisis team and police, hospitals, mental.health professionals, parents, district officials, and elected officials will be established by Februar y 1.
Objective 5: A plan for rapid, orderly dismissal and evacuation of the school and transfer of students to parental super vision will be established by Februar y 15.
4.
Identify appropriate research-based programs and strategies.
Although some programs and strategies are more effective than others, no single program or strategy is effective in meeting the needs of all students.
The best approach calls for a mix of programs and strategies based on the goals, objectives, needs, and resources identified in the comprehensive plan.
The plan should offer some programs and strategies to the entire student body and direct others toward at-risk students.
Success is enhanced by keeping track of students from year to year, offering "booster" sessions at appropriate intervals, and using relapse prevention techniques.
When selecting programs and strategies, consider these features: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Evidence of past effectiveness.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The match between the program or strategy and the comprehensive safety plan's goals and objectives.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The reading level of educational materials included in the program(s).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The appropriateness of cultural images used by the program.
Chapter 3 describes examples of model programs that have proven effective or appear promising.
Several programs and strategies can be implemented either simultaneously or sequentially.
It makes sense to balance environmental and administrative strategies with educational and skills-training programs.
In choosing this approach, it is important to plan to assess its effectiveness because the combination of programs and strategies being implemented is new and untested.
5.
Implement the comprehensive plan.
Communities also differ in the way they implement their comprehensive plans.
However, certain basic steps need to be followed by all communities.
Phase I: Gearing Up Ã¯Â¿Â½ Obtain district approvals.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seek community support through a public awareness campaign.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Train staff.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Select students for participation in programs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seek parental approval for student participation in programs.
School district officials may have to approve the selection of programs as well as any evaluation instruments.
A broad campaign in the local community is appropriate for some program interventions, raising awareness of the school violence problem, introducing the intervention, explaining the 13 process, and inviting expertise, volunteers, and donations.
Staff development enhances the consistency and quality of program delivery and builds enthusiasm for the program.
In some interventions, student selection is based on criteria such as risk factors or needs.
Parents may need to give consent for their children to participate.
These elements are usually in place before students become involved in the intervention.
Phase II: Implementation Continuous monitoring and assessment are critical steps in implementing the plan.
Ask these questions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Have procedures been developed for monitoring the implementation of the plan? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Is there consistency between the plan and actual events? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Do budgeted costs match actual costs? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What is the initial response of students, staff, and parents to the plan? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Are there unforeseen barriers to implementation? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What are the unintended negative consequences of selected programs and strategies? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What changes in the nature of the problem have evolved over time? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What adjustments need to be made to the plan? Because careful replication of selected programs and strategies improves success, the quality of implementation needs to be monitored.
Communities should anticipate problems (barriers, consequences, changes, and need for adjustments) and view them as opportunities for collaborative resolution.
The time and attention given to each phase of implementation, the amount of training provided to staff, the consistency of support and delivery, and attention to individual student needs and progress are just a few of the quality issues to consider.
6.
Evaluate the plan.
Evaluation is a critical component of the comprehensive school safety plan.
It serves several purposes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ To increase the effectiveness of management and administration of the plan.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ To document that objectives have been met.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ To determine the overall effectiveness of the plan, its programs, and strategies.
Conducting an evaluation or a series of evaluations helps to ensure accountability, determines whether the plan is making a difference, and provides important feedback for improving the plan and its programs and strategies.
There are three kinds of evaluation: process, outcome, and impact.
A process evaluation describes and assesses the quality of implementation activities.
An outcome evaluation studies the immediate or direct effects of an intervention.
An impact evaluation looks beyond the immediate results of policies, instruction, or services to identify longer-term as well as unintended effects.
It also examines what happens when several programs and strategies operate in unison.
Ideally, an evaluation of the plan's programs and strategies compares groups before and after the plan is implemented.
Data from surveys, interviews, incident records, disciplinary referrals, and other relevant information need to be collected before and after the implementation of the plan's programs and strategies to assess whether the plan is having the desired effects on student attitudes, beliefs, and behavior.
In this way, the evaluation tells us whether anything has changed and whether the change is attributable to the specific intervention.
If improvements are greater in the intervention group than in a comparison group (one that did not receive the intervention, received it to a lesser extent, or received something different), the intervention is considered a success.
This type of evaluation effort requires careful selection of research design, methods, and instruments.
It makes sense to seek professional help from evaluation experts through local universities or evaluation research organizations.
7.
Revise the plan on the basis of the evaluation.
A well-designed evaluation yields useful information.
The results may suggest that changes should be made in the selection of programs and strategies, that additional training is warranted, or that other people need to be involved.
If a school administers a comprehensive school safety plan for several years with little impact on violence, perhaps an entirely new plan needs to be implemented.
Recommendations for improvement are identified through interviews with the stakeholders, surveys, or focus groups.
These assessments reveal which activities were most effective, what materials worked best, how barriers were overcome, and what type of students received the most or least benefit and why.
WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO 1.
Provide strong administrative support for assessing and enhancing school safety.
A comprehensive approach to school safety and security requires that school administrators and principals meet several challenges simultaneously.
These challenges include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Assessing the school's security needs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Monitoring the school facility to ensure it is a clean, safe environment.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Implementing policies that support and reward prosocial behavior.
14 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Implementing schoolwide education and training on safety and avoiding violence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Providing counseling and social services to students.
The direct involvement of top school leadership commits the necessary resources (including staff and classroom time) and supports the policies and strategy recommendations of work groups concerned with school safety issues.
School leadership also ensures that principals receive training on the development and implementation of policies and strategies.
2.
Redesign the school facility to eliminate dark, secluded, and unsupervised spaces.
A school's physical plant influences whether crime will occur.
Schools can be designed to limit access of unauthorized persons, increase the ability of school staff to visually supervise all areas of the school facility, and reduce crowding.
Schools should be built with security in mind, but existing schools can make changes to their buildings to increase safety.
Installing adequate lighting and breakproof door and window locks, minimizing private storage areas, and eliminating removable ceiling panels are important safety measures all schools can adopt.
The key is to make the school environment safer and to use space constructively without creating a restrictive environment.
3.
Devise a system for reporting and analyzing violent and noncriminal incidents.
Information cannot be effectively used if it is not regularly collected and examined.
An incident reporting system provides a systematic approach to monitoring rule infractions and analyzing problem areas.
Obtaining accurate records of violent incidents and injuries from year to year helps school officials identify overall trends in school violence.
Tracking individual student behavior patterns over time is a good way to identify students in need of additional assistance before their problems become more serious.
For a school crime data collection model, refer to chapter 4, Resources, for Recommendations of the Crime, Violence, and Discipline Reporting Task Force of the National Forum on Education Statistics.
4.
Design an effective discipline policy.
School rules must be clear and consistently enforced.
Serious and repeated violent infractions carry heavier penalties than less serious or infrequent infractions.
It is important that the school discipline policy be communicated periodically to students, parents, and staff.
A common practice at many schools is for students and parents to sign a document at the beginning of the school year indicating that they know and agree to follow school rules.
Discipline needs to be consistent for all students.
Due process involves more than one staff member listening to all parties, gathering and interpreting evidence, assigning sanctions where appropriate, and ensuring access to an appeal process.
5.
Build a partnership with local law enforcement.
Although a school may have its own security personnel, establishing a relationship with community law enforcement is essential.
Both groups play important roles in making schools safe.
School security personnel are familiar with the school facility, its security devices, and the student body.
Police officers are trained to deal with violent incidents.
Accurate reporting of criminal behaviors to the police sends a clear message that illegal acts will not be tolerated.
In many communities, police officers know the community and its residents.
They often have information about community and family problems that is useful to school personnel.
They promote school safety by interacting closely with students.
Police officers can teach special courses on substance abuse, kidnap prevention, and gun safety.
They often have access to or knowledge of community resources such as recreational facilities and organized athletic leagues.
If State and local laws allow, police can assist school administrators in identifying specific students who require additional supervision.
In some schools, probation officers work inside the school building where they have better access to the students assigned to them by the courts.
6.
Enlist school security professionals in designing and maintaining the school security system.
In some schools, obvious security measures are needed to ensure safety.
School security measures include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hiring security personnel.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Installing security devices.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conducting random inspections.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Providing students and staff with identification cards.
Security involves careful attention to training, searching for and closing any security gaps, improving communications, testing security devices and procedures, performing maintenance, and updating technology.
Relying heavily on security devices like metal detectors without adequate staffing, training, and other strategies will have limited impact.
School staff and consultants can assist in preventing and reducing crime by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conducting security assessments.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Providing staff development programs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Developing crisis preparedness guidelines.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identifying security equipment needs (such as metal detectors and surveillance cameras).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Designing enforcement and investigation techniques.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Enhancing links with community officials.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Providing safe activities for students.
15 7.
Train school staff in all aspects of violence prevention.
Training staff in enforcing discipline, handling disruptive students, and treating students with respect decreases the likelihood that students will become violent in the school setting.
Staff need to be trained to serve as models of nonviolent communication for students and to set the standards for appropriate behavior and communication.
Limiting the number of students assigned to each teacher increases the chances that training will have the desired results.
Staff need to be familiar with all school rules and policies dealing with violent behavior, and they must know how to use the alarm system, when to refer students for counseling or discipline, and what to do in a crisis.
8.
Provide all students access to school psychologists or counselors.
All young people have a variety of emotional needs that they bring to school.
Some needs may be met in school through encounters with peers and school staff (teachers, psychologists, and counselors), while other needs require proper assessment and referral to community services.
If these needs are handled effectively, students are less likely to engage in negative behavior.
9.
Provide crisis response services.
Serious but rare events, such as shootings, bomb threats, hostage situations, and other crises require quick and preplanned responses.
A comprehensive plan for dealing with a crisis situation includes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A crisis response team with clearly delineated duties.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A plan for evacuating the school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A plan for coordinating with and notifying police, elected officials, government agencies, and other proper authorities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A plan for notifying parents quickly.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A media/communications strategy.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Counselors available to deal with students in the aftermath of a traumatic event.
When resources are lacking in the local community, help is available from the State or Federal level.
Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools, published by the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice, provides detailed information for schools on how to respond to a crisis.
(See Chapter 4, Resources, for information on how to obtain a copy.)
10.
Implement schoolwide education and training on avoiding and preventing violence.
Many schoolwide programs are effective in preventing and reducing violent behavior in schools.
Schoolwide education 16 efforts can focus on common myths about violence and misperceptions about normative behavior.
Training might be offered on: Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to avoid dangerous situations, places, and people.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to get help when in danger.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ How to notify authorities about weapons.
Skills training can be offered in social interaction, problem solving, coping, communication, resisting peer influence, understanding values, respect for individual differences, countering bias, anger management, conflict resolution, and peer mediation.
Instruction and skills training can be effectively combined using interactive and engaging learning strategies.
11. Use alternate school settings for educating violent and weapon-carrying students.
Research tells us that a relatively small percentage of students account for most of the violent incidents at school.
Providing special services to this group of adolescents is essential for increasing school safety.
If a student continues to commit repeated acts of serious violence, the school administrators may be obligated to place this student in a separate educational setting to assure the safety of other students and staff.
Separating violent and weapon-carrying students from the general student body sends the message that school administrators have acted appropriately to preserve school safety and allows the special needs of these students to be met more effectively.
Alternative programs are preferred to suspension and expulsion alone because they avoid shifting violent students onto the streets with little supervision.
Common features of effective alternative schools include strong administrators, dedicated and well-trained staff, needs-based assessments of each child, a low studentto-staff ratio, and counseling for students and their parents.
12.
Create a climate of tolerance Fostering and maintaining a safe learning environment means creating a climate of tolerance in which all students are comfortable and secure.
Particularly in adolescence, youth have a strong need to be accepted by their peers.
However, because of stereotypes, ignorance, and intolerance, certain individuals and groups tend to be alienated from their fellow students.
A source of conflict in many schools is the perceived or real problem of bias and unfair treatment of students because of ethnicity, gender, race, social class, religion, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, physical appearance, or some other factorboth by staff and peers.
Schools can encourage students to be more accepting of diversity through school-wide awareness campaigns, policies which prevent harassment and discrimination, and offering support groups.
For students who bring firearms to school, the local chief administering officer of schools should keep in mind both the Gun Free Schools Act (GFSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
Under the GFSA, ever y State receiving funds under the Elementar y and Secondar y Education Act (ESEA) must have a law which (1) requires any student who brings a firearm to school to be expelled for not less than one year, and (2) allows the expulsion requirement to be modified on a case-by-case basis by the local chief administering officer.
The GFSA explicitly requires that the GFSA must be implemented in a manner consistent with the IDEA.
GFSA also makes clear that school districts do not violate the GFSA if they provide educational services in an alternative setting to a student who has been expelled from the student's regular school for bringing a firearm to school.
In addition, all local educational agencies receiving ESEA funds must refer any student who brings a firearm to school to the criminal or juvenile justice system.
Under the IDEA, school personnel may remove a student with a disability who carries a weapon, including a firearm, to school or a school function to an interim alternative educational placement for up to 45 days, which can be extended for additional 45 day periods of time if a hearing officer determines that it would be dangerous to return the student to the student's normal placement, although appropriate educational ser vices to the student must continue in that alternative site.
In addition, IDEA does not permit discipline that changes a student's placement, such as an expulsion, if the student's behavior was a manifestation of the student's disability.
Finally, IDEA makes clear that school personnel can report crimes committed by students with disabilities to appropriate authorities.
If a student with a disability brings a firearm to school, a school district can comply with both the GFSA and the IDEA by using the provision of the GFSA that permits modification of the expulsion requirement on a case-by-case basis and ensuring that the discipline of students with disabilities is handled consistent with IDEA. 14.
Actively involve students in making decisions about school policies and programs.
Students often know the strengths and weaknesses of school policies and programs as well as anyone, and they have unique insights to offer.
When students participate in the decision-making process, they are more likely to support the decisions that are made.
Students are an excellent resource for creative ideas, which can be collected from all students, student leaders, and students who are active in school safety programs.
15.
Prepare an annual report on school crime and safety.
School staff, parents, students, and other members of the community want to know how safe their school is and what progress is being made on school safety.
Schools can collect and tabulate incidents of crime and misbehavior, report the trends over time, compare school violence trends with similar trends in the local community, and outline how these trends have been used to alter policies and procedures.
This report can also be used to introduce school safety programs and strategies to parents and to the broader community.
WHAT STUDENTS CAN DO 1.
Behave responsibly.
School crime is made up of everyday occurrences and can be reduced through everyday actions.
Students can: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Resolve problems and disputes nonviolently.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Refrain from teasing, name calling, and other seemingly innocent behaviors that actually hurt others' feelings.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Respect other students, school staff, and family members.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Know and follow the school rules.
12.
Provide appropriate educational services to all students.
A schoolwide culture that supports positive learning opportunities for all children and youth is critical.
This entails assessing special needs among students who behave inappropriately, referring them to special educational and other services when appropriate, providing positive behavioral supports and interventions as needed, supporting the development of skills for future employment, and developing working relationships with parents, families, and communities.
13.
Reach out to communities and businesses to improve the safety of students.
Youth need to be safe all the time, not just at home or at school.
School personnel can take the initiative to work with businesses and other community partners to create safe places and safe corridors.
Such places include businesses, religious centers, museums, police and fire station activity rooms, and hospital and library meeting rooms.
2.
Report crimes and threats to school officials.
Students know better than anyone else what is going on in their school.
They need to tell their parents, teachers, and principal what kinds of crimes and threats occur and what can be done to stop them.
Some youth may not want to get involved, some may believe that upholding the code of silence and protecting their peers is the right thing to do, and some may be afraid that the students they report will find out and retaliate.
The fact is that reporting crimes and threats can protect students and sometimes even save lives.
Students need to take responsibility for sharing the information they have.
Administrators need to take responsibility for setting up an easy-to-use, anonymous reporting system.
3.
Get involved in or start anticrime programs at school.
Students can directly reduce school crime by becoming peer counselors or mediators, learning conflict resolution and problem-solving, hosting fun and safe weekend activities for 17 students, tutoring or mentoring younger students, and starting a teen court.
Students can assist school and community officials by serving on a safe schools committee, talking to school officials about gaps in security (places where weapons are hidden, drugs are sold, fights occur, and students are threatened), and suggesting ways for students to report crimes without fearing retaliation.
4.
Learn how to avoid becoming a victim.
No one chooses to be a victim and no one can control everything that happens.
However, students can significantly decrease their chances of becoming victims by doing simple things such as deciding to walk away from fights and avoiding dangerous places.
They can also decrease their chances of becoming victims by carefully thinking over with whom to associate, such as whether to join a gang.
Many students join gangs for protection, but gang members are much more likely to get into fights and be injured or killed than nongang members.
5.
Seek help.
Students can seek out adults in the community whom they trust and to whom they can talk about problems.
Often, adults provide the help and resources needed to resolve a troubling issue.
Discipline means more than punishment.
Involving children in activities that teach constructive skills such as responsibility, appropriate play behavior, self-control, and goal-setting is as important as sanctioning them for inappropriate behavior.
Parents can devise rewards and incentives for good behavior to prevent future rule violations and to urge constructive behaviors.
3.
Model prosocial behavior.
One of the best ways to teach a child is by demonstration.
Through their everyday actions, parents teach their children how to interact socially, handle competition and defeat, discuss differences, resolve conflicts, deal with frustration in solving problems, and cope with stress and anger, among other skills.
Children also learn from the other adults in their lives and may need help understanding different behavior responses to similar challenges.
Children's inevitable exposure to negative influences makes the parent's role as a model of behavior even more important.
4.
Get involved with school and community organizations and activities.
Becoming active in the child's school and community life brings many benefits.
It provides parents the opportunity to see more of what the child sees, therefore gaining a deeper understanding of the child's needs.
Situations arise that present opportunities for reinforcing what is taught in the home.
The presence of parents provides continuity for the student in moving from one setting to another.
Being involved also gives parents an opportunity to get to know teachers, childcare providers, and coaches, among others, and to work with them to ensure that the child's needs are met when parents are not present.
Here are a few examples of what parents can do in the school and community to promote good behavior and to make the most of learning opportunities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Make sure children attend class and complete assigned homework.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Get to know teachers and administrators.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage children to participate in extracurricular activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Read to children and help them practice reading.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Contact the appropriate school personnel or authority if a child expresses a concern or problem about school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Attend parent-teacher conferences, school board meetings, and community meetings and, when possible, volunteer to help in the school or community programs the child attends.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Serve on a school safety committee or the ParentTeacher Association (PTA).
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO 1.
Actively communicate with children.
Communication is an essential component of child-rearing and a constant challenge.
Being available and being approachable are as important as having the right answer to a question or providing the best guidance with a problem.
Consistency, honesty, and understanding are critical.
Talking with children shows that they are cared about; gives them an opportunity to share their concerns, interests, fears, and activities; and provides ideas about aspects of their school and personal lives that can be improved.
Everyday conversations also create natural opportunities for teaching children social skills, anger management, problem-solving skills, and ways to avoid becoming victims.
2.
Be clear and consistent in disciplining children.
When establishing rules for children, it is important for parents to communicate their views on crime, violence, weapons, and appropriate self-defense.
Children also need to know that parents support school discipline policies and any reasonable punishments that are administered by the school.
Children should understand the rationale for household, school, and other rules and behavioral expectations.
If a child misbehaves, punishments may be more effective if they are consistent and appropriate to the severity and frequency of the offense and administered with a gentle voice and with full explanation.
18 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Know the school's discipline policy and discuss it with the child.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Work with school staff when a child has been aggressive or victimized at school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Work with other parents and organizations to ensure that children are safe when going to and from school or community activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Actively continue the child's education in the summer.
5.
Keep guns and other weapons out of reach of unsupervised children.
If guns or other weapons are kept in or around the house, it is critical that they be locked away and completely inaccessible to unsupervised children and adolescents.
Guns should be stored unloaded whenever feasible, with ammunition locked in a separate place.
Firearms are not play things, but children may view them as such unless they are taught to handle and use them responsibly or to avoid them entirely.
less structured assistance.
Specific skills can be learned to reduce the stress and challenges of raising children, including problem-solving, communication, coping with anger and stress, and conflict mediation.
Training is often available through the school or faith communities or in the broader community.
Seeking help from friends or family members who are experienced parents is another way to better meet the needs of children.
WHAT POLICE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE AUTHORITIES CAN DO 1.
Establish a working relationship with schools.
Educators, police, and juvenile justice authorities all play an integral part in preventing school crime.
Educators are better equipped to teach students.
Police are more capable of intervening in a crisis situation involving a violent or potentially violent student.
Juvenile justice authorities can assign probation officers and social workers to schools, where they can better monitor and serve adjudicated students, design specific regimens for youthful offenders to influence their behavior, and provide stronger and broader sanctions for violent behavior.
2.
Patrol the school grounds, facilities, and travel routes.
The presence of police in or near the school and local neighborhoods deters crime and prevents troubling situations from escalating.
Police presence disrupts trouble spots that interfere with students traveling to and from school, prevents strangers from entering schools, reduces the ability of students to smuggle weapons into schools, deters gang activities, and identifies students who are selling drugs or under the influence of drugs.
Police can also conduct random searches for weapons or controlled substances, if appropriate.
In these and other circumstances, they add their broader authority to the supervision of students.
3.
Respond to reports of criminal activities in the school.
When police routinely patrol the school grounds, they are in a better position to act quickly in response to a request for help from school authorities.
The role of police in this situation may be to separate a violent student from potential victims, talk the student into giving up a threatening stance, subdue and transport a student from the scene, contact emergency services, assist in traffic control as emergency services arrive and as parents pick up their children during or after a crisis, collect evidence, or participate in other activities.
Rapid response is critical in a situation where many children are in harm's way.
4.
Consult with school authorities and parents regarding school security.
Both juvenile justice authorities and police have specialized training in working with youth.
They are aware of effective techniques for modifying the behavior of troubled students, the appropriate use of rules and sanctions for youth who Several cities and States have passed laws that make gun owners responsible for storing firearms in a manner that makes them inaccessible to children.
If an unsuper vised minor is found with a gun, the owner may be charged with a felony or a misdemeanor.
6.
Limit children's exposure to and experience of crime and violence.
Limiting a child's exposure to crime and violence is a difficult but important task for every parent.
Children are exposed to both real and simulated depictions of violence and other crime in many ways.
They find it on television, in movies, in newspapers, on the radio, on the Internet, in plays, in neighborhoods, in homes, in schools, at athletic events, in video games, in music, on the road, and in many other places.
Some children do not fully understand or successfully cope with their exposure to crime and violence.
Because of frequent and unrealistic media depictions, they may think that violent events are more common than they really are.
They may not fully appreciate the true consequences of violent behaviors.
As a result, children pretend to be violent in their play with little harm, yet when they become frustrated or angry, these behaviors may take a more serious form in some children.
7.
Participate in family management training or counseling opportunities.
Participating in formal training programs in family management is a good way to get extra help.
While family counseling is an appropriate option for some, others benefit from 19 are chronic offenders, techniques for avoiding violence and victimization, and optional programs and services for troubled students.
They are also able to consult more broadly on issues of school, home, and personal security.
Their information can be shared in school board meetings, community meetings, staff meetings, classrooms, assemblies, printed materials, and broadcasts.
5.
Work directly with youth to maintain a constructive relationship.
Police and juvenile justice authorities can become involved directly with students outside the police station, courtroom, or other corrections settings.
They often develop a good relationship with students as a means of preventing a confrontation in the future.
As the relationship builds, students see police and juvenile justice authorities as positive role models rather than judges or enforcers, assist them in their work rather than fleeing from them or hindering their work, and gain a greater understanding about the difficulties they face in their work.
Instilling a broader respect for authority is essential in preventing crime.
Opportunities for building constructive relationships between authorities and youth include bicycle registration drives, school carnivals, fundraisers, community policing partnerships, and sponsored recreational activities.
3.
Provide internships and employment opportunities.
Opportunities for meaningful experiences in the community can replace or prevent a certain amount of delinquent or criminal behavior.
Businesses provide experience and training in job skills to students through internships, school-towork programs, afterschool jobs, summer employment, and other work opportunities.
4.
Provide scholarships to deserving students.
Scholarships provide incentives to students that may be otherwise lacking.
They also steer youth toward jobs needing to be filled by the donor.
Scholarships may be distributed on the basis of need, performance, or some combination of both.
Scholarships are offered for college, technical training, seminars, and other educational or training experiences.
5.
Offer resources to local schools.
Businesses offer support for programs and services, facilities for events, safe havens for students as they travel to and from school, leadership and organizational support for administrators, strategic planning services, equipment, and many other resources.
The results orientation of business is very helpful to schools and can be shared between school and business staff through a variety of informal interactions.
6.
Provide release time to parents and volunteers.
WHAT BUSINESSES CAN DO 1.
Adopt a local school.
A long-term commitment to a specific school or group of schools provides the necessary continuity and trust to achieve lasting improvements in reducing violence and enhancing educational opportunities for children.
By adopting a local school, businesses become more familiar with local needs, develop an awareness of what works in reducing violence in that school, and build on past successes.
2.
Provide training in basic job skills.
Training in job skills can begin prior to employment and may occur in the schools as well as on the job site.
Participants include potential employees or youth who may later be employed in other settings.
Businesses are well suited to provide this training and can adapt their materials and presentations for younger participants.
Training can focus on interpersonal skills, computer training, participation in meetings, teamwork, steps involved in completing a work assignment, progress reports, and other standard job skills.
The social skills commonly used in the work setting are similar to those required to prevent violence in the school setting.
Older students can participate in simulations of starting and managing a business and other complex business functions.
Businesses provide flexible scheduling and/or release time to support parents and other volunteers in their participation in school activities.
Parents may need to attend parentteacher conferences, field trips, meetings, and other activities to strengthen their child's education.
Schools need responsible adults to serve as mentors, tutors, coaches, field trip supervisors, and in other capacities.
WHAT ELECTED OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CAN DO 1.
Provide leadership for school crime prevention.
As concern about school safety increases, elected officials are taking a leadership role in solving this pressing problem.
Elected officials can: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Introduce and/or support legislation that will promote school safety.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hold town meetings or conferences to raise awareness of school crime issues.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Attend school and community events for violence prevention.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Educate the public about crime prevention in speeches and press releases.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Endorse official reports and initiatives on school crime.
20 2.
Support school crime prevention research.
Unfortunately, a great deal of the information available on the potential impact of existing violence prevention strategies is unscientific and unreliable.
Quality evaluations need to be well designed and adequately financed.
Public officials can promote the conduct and use of evaluations by establishing national or regional research centers, allocating funds for research projects, and focusing research dollars on the most promising strategies.
3.
Encourage all schools to monitor and report crime.
Having a computerized monitoring and reporting system provides school staff with data on their own local needs to inform their choice of prevention strategies, build public support for crime prevention efforts, and identify troublesome areas on the campus which need to be redesigned or better supervised.
Elected officials can support this effort through their advocacy role, legislation, attaching requirements to the receipt of program funds, or other means.
4.
Begin a discussion of key legislative issues in school violence prevention.
These are the questions to consider when drafting new legislation: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Who should receive comprehensive risk screening and in what grades? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What type of data should be required of schools in a common reporting system? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What type of information should be shared between and among law enforcement agencies and schools? Ã¯Â¿Â½ What type of penalties should be assessed to a student who commits a crime or carries a weapon at school and should that student receive separate education services? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Should laws that require expulsion of firearm-possessing students include provisions for alternative educational placements and support services? 5.
Build collaborations between and among local, State and Federal agencies to pool resources and maximize the use of effective approaches to school safety.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Law enforcement officials at the Federal, State and local levels can work with each other and with schools to enhance approaches to school safety.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Social service agencies can provide support to schools to improve and expand mental health services for children.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Juvenile justice organizations and courts can work with school officials to ensure children are receiving proper service and to support at-risk youth.
San Diego Unified School District San Diego, CA School Safety Focus: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Comprehensive strategy composed of more than 15 programs and strategies ranging from Healthy Start to school police forces.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Partnerships with agencies such as the County and City of San Diego, YMCA, and Social Advocates for Youth to provide ser vices and after school programs.

In the last decade, the County experienced an increase in juvenile violence and crime, especially in weapons charges.
In response, the San Diego Unified School District developed a comprehensive approach to reduce youth violence and increase students' educational success.
The district provides a race/human relations team which proactively deals with discrimination and gang issues, the Life Skills Program to prevent substance use and teen pregnancy (for more information about the Life Skills Program, refer to chapter 3, Model Programs), counselors and nurses in ever y elementar y school, and multifaceted health, physical education, and wellness programs.
The district has one of the oldest zerotolerance policies in the countr y for guns and drugs in schools.
Police officers, juvenile judges, and probation officers work with the schools to ensure that youth who break the law are held accountable, but also effectively diverted from leading a life of crime.
Juvenile Court and Community Schools (JCCS) operate alternative educational environments for students who have been expelled for violence, weapon possession, and drug and alcohol violations.
The district also protects its students with a variety of security measures including: school police; closed campuses; undercover police to detect drug use; a crisis team; an emergency operations center connected to all sites by radio; and emergency plans at each school.
Positive outcomes include: less crime and truancy during the school day; students feel safe at school; tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use has decreased by 50 to 75 percent; use of multiple drugs has declined by as much as two-thirds; dropout rates have decreased; attendance has increased; and teen birth rates are down.
21 22 CHAPTER 3: MODEL PROGRAMS This chapter pr esents several examples of pr ograms that ar e well designed and can be implemented in combinations to for m a comprehensive school safety plan.
The pr ograms cited in this chapter wer e identified under a U.S. Depar tment of Justice grant to the Hamilton Fish National Institute on School and Community V iolence with assistance fr om Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy 1.
The examples cover a wide variety of pr oblems that schools face.
While r eviewing these pr ograms, keep in mind that pr oblems generally do not occur in isolation.
Cr eating a safe school r equires attending to the school's physical, social, and cultural envir onments.
A key component of incr easing school safety is selecting pr ograms that can be com bined as par t of an effective plan for addr essing local problems.
As the pr evious chapter on developing and implementing a compr ehensive school safety plan pointed out, pr ogram and strategy selection must be based on a thor ough assessment of each school's needs.
Community stakeholders must also be involved in cr eating and implementing the compr ehensive plan.
The models presented here have been designated as either demonstrated or promising.
Demonstrated models have been rigorously tested in the field and have solid evidence of their effectiveness.
In the evaluation of demonstrated models, two groups of youth were examined before and after an intervention; one group received the inter vention, while the other (the control group) did not.
The intervention group demonstrated a larger reduction in violence over time compared to the control group.
Promising models are well designed but have not yet been thoroughly tested.
Some promising models have been evaluated, but they need further testing with stronger evaluation designs to prove their effectiveness.
Other promising models have not yet been evaluated, but they are based on previous research.
While some models have effects in more than one area, they are categorized by their emphasis or demonstrated effects.
Some models have been developed, implemented, and evaluated in multiple sites, while others have been used only in a single school.

Clarifying and consistently enforcing the school rules, improving classroom management and organization, tracking student behaviors (good and bad), reinforcing positive behaviors, and increasing the frequency of communication with parents about student behavior are emphasized.
A multi-year, multi-site study found that classroom disruption decreased and attention to academic work increased significantly in the schools in which the program was well implemented.
The U.S. Department of Education has convened an Expert Panel on Safe, Disciplined and Drug-Free Schools to oversee a process for identifying and designating promising and exemplary school-based programs that strengthen prevention practices, so that practitioners can make better informed decisions in their ongoing efforts.
The results from the U.S. Department of Education's Expert Panel will be disseminated in Summer 1999.
23 1 AGGRESSION/FIGHTING Aggressors, Victims, and Bystanders: Thinking and Acting to Prevent Violence, for middle schools, is a demonstrated curriculum for high-risk students.
The curriculum is composed of 12 classroom sessions that deal with violence among peers and the separate but interrelated roles of aggressors, victims, and bystanders that youth play in potentially violent situations.
The backbone of this curriculum is the four-step Think-First Model of Conflict Resolution.
The model helps students to pause and keep cool, understand what is going on before jumping to conclusions, define their problems and goals in ways that will not lead to fights, and generate positive solutions.
The curriculum has been tested in urban, suburban, and small-city school districts and has made students more supportive of resolving conflicts without aggression.

Key elements include helping students define conflict, teaching three types of conflict resolution, and reviewing basic communications behavior.
Each session contains at least one skills-building exercise and lasts from 15 to 50 minutes.
This program has reduced violence and the frequency of fights resulting in injuries that require medical treatment.

Using videotaped vignettes and role playing, students learn social skills such as giving positive and negative feedback, accepting feedback, negotiation, problem-solving, and resisting peer pressure in small groups of 10-12.
Students who have been through PACT have exhibited 50 percent less physical aggression at school and more than 50 percent fewer violence-related juvenile court charges than a comparable group who did not receive PACT.

Peace Builders should be viewed as a way of life rather than a program because it attempts to change the characteristics of the school setting that trigger aggressive, hostile behavior.
This program seeks to increase the availability of pro-social models to enhance social competence and decrease the frequency and intensity of aggressive behaviors.
Researchers found that this program improved students' social competence (especially if students had two years of exposure to the program) and buffered expected increases in their aggressive behavior.

At the core of SIP is a schoolwide program that teaches self-awareness, social skills, decision making skills, as well as the harmful effects of substance use, and requires parental involvement.
The school also offers conflict resolution and peer mediation training; peer and adult tutoring; and involvement in community projects, school ser vice groups, and the Big Buddy/Little Buddy program.
For students in need of extra ser vices, Lunalilo has a Primar y School Adjustment Program.
The program relies on early identification, the support of a caring adult, and the involvement of a team of key personnel and parents in enhancing students' behavioral development.
In conjunction with school officials, the Honolulu Police Department and the McCully Neighborhood Watch notify school officials of any suspicious activities around the school area.
Data collected during the past 4 years reveal decreases in violent behavior and in the number of student referrals to the principal's office (no suspensions in 1998, compared with four in 1994).
In a 1997-98 sur vey of the Primar y School Adjustment Program, 78 percent of parents reported that their children behaved better at home, and 72 percent reported that their children had developed higher self-esteem.
Bully Proofing Your School, for elementary schools, is a promising comprehensive approach.
Components include staff involvement in deciding how to reduce bullying; a student curriculum that uses role-playing, modeling, and class discussions; victim support that emphasizes enhancing selfesteem and social skills; an intervention for bullies that teaches anger control and empathy; and interaction with the parents of both bullies and victims.
The focus is on shifting power away from bullies, not on punishing them.

After referral by an elementary school teacher, parents who have graduated from FAST make home visits to invite a child and his or her whole family to participate in the program.
25 Families are clustered in groups of 10 to 12 according to where their children attend school, and then attend eight weekly sessions of highly interactive and fun activities run by a team of professionals from the community.
Following this initial phase, groups of families run their own meetings for two years while continuing to receive support from the FAST team as needed.
FAST strengthens communities, schools, and families by reaching out to socially isolated families, creating support networks, and encouraging parents to take leadership roles in the program.
Of the families which come to one FAST meeting, over 80 percent remain at least to the end of the initial eight week phase.
Over the following two years, schools report dramatic increases in parental involvement (75 percent) and self-referral to family counseling (26 percent) and substance abuse treatment (8 percent).
In scientific studies, teachers and parents have re-ported behavior improvements among referred youth, increases in family cohesion, and decreases in social isolation.

In rigorous evaluations, FFT has consistently produced sustained reductions in juvenile recidivism and sibling entry into high-risk activities when compared to a variety of other individual and groupbased treatments.
These reductions in adolescent disruptive behavior disorders have been accomplished at smaller expense than alternative approaches.
FFT is a short-term change program that motivates families to deal with processes such as intense negative affect that prevent change.
Specific strategies are then individualized for families to produce positive changes in family communication and problem-solving, parenting, and the use of community resources.

It has been culturally modified and found effective with AfricanAmerican, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic families.
Parents and children attend 14 weekly sessions of two hours each.
Parents and children attend separate sessions during the first hour (during which time parents learn about family management and children focus on social skills), and during the second hour they come together for family skills training.
To increase participation, incentives such as snacks, transportation, and rewards are used.
Evaluations have found significant improvements in parenting skills, children's prosocial behavior, and family relationships.

Although the number of fights was not extremely high (55 fights and 27 suspensions) in that year, the staff felt that suspensions and detentions were not changing student behavior.
McNair borrowed from the Safe and Drug Free Schools strategy and initiated the Fight Free School Program 6 years ago.
It has since been adopted by schools in other areas.
The mission statement of the Fight Free School Program is "To teach the youth of today, the future leaders of our nation, appropriate interpersonal behavior skills.
The focus is to provide an improved school environment which will enhance the learning process and allow our children the optimum advantage to excel in their academic careers."
In order to fulfill this mission, the program sets clear expectations for students and parents, provides students with social skills training, and teaches students to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Offering daily positive reinforcement for good behavior through strategies such as declaring fight-free days over the public address system and flying a fight-free flag over the school when there are no fights is also central to the program.
McNair Elementar y School has reported a drastic decrease in fights and suspensions since the inception of the program: 55 fights and 27 suspensions in1991-92; 3 fights and 2 suspensions in 1992-93; and only 5 or 6 fights per year from 1993-94 through 1997-98.

30 The Stafford County Alternative Education Program, for high schools, is a promising initiative that gives students two options for successfully completing high school.
The first option is a regional education center for violent, weapons-carrying, or controlled-substance-carrying students.
It offers academic, counseling, family, and transportation services in order to help students complete the school year and successfully return to their regular schools.
Turning Point, the second option, is a school for members of the community (primarily those ages 17-21) who have not completed high school and for high school students with a very high risk of dropping out.
Program staff report that success depends upon providing students and staff choices regarding their placement, written expectations or contracts that students sign, teaching teams, a small student population, and flexibility with a focus on meeting student needs.
No evaluation data are available.

The key components include a clear and consistently reinforced code of conduct aimed at preventing teasing and small fights, which tend to lead to weapons assaults.
Environmental controls make it difficult to bring weapons to school and increase students' perceived safety (so that they do not feel the need to bring weapons).
The environmental controls include random searches conducted by police, routine checks of areas where weapons may be hidden, home searches to recover firearms and explosives before they are brought to school, visual screening techniques that enable police and school staff to spot students who are concealing weapons, and strictly enforced sanctions for weapons violations.
Students who have brought weapons to school can complete the academic year at an alternative school.
Staff reported that student weapons violations have decreased by 70 percent.

The goals are to provide access control, surveillance through physical design and mechanical devices, congestion reduction, defensible space, psychological deterrents to violence, user monitoring, and territorial identity.
Several of the design issues are focused on reducing the presence of weapons in the school and eliminating dark or hidden spaces where crimes can occur.
CPTED reduced a school's reported crime rate by 86 percent over a four year period.

Appropriate behavior is taught through classroom education using conflict resolution and anger management techniques that uphold six standards of conduct.
In addition, exposure education through trips to hospital trauma centers and juvenile detention facilities are part of the program.
General anti-violence campaigns and continuous mentoring by program staff through a youth's pre-adolescent and adolescent years are also included.
This program has been found effective in decreasing handgun (and other weapon) carrying and fighting.
31 VANDALISM The Constructive Discipline Model, for grades 4-8, of Los Angeles County, CA, is a demonstrated intervention that takes a multi-faceted approach to reducing violence and vandalism.
School staff are trained to reinforce appropriate behaviors, identify factors that contribute to violence and vandalism, and develop a schoolwide behavioral improvement plan.
In addition, school counselors are trained in the use of behavioral consultation methods.
One study of several schools found that vandalism fell by an average of 78.5 percent.

This program assumes that peers have great influence on each other and that peer influence can be positive.
The program also assumes that self-confidence may be gained by being of service to others and that adolescents who have learned to solve their own problems can help others by sharing their experiences.
Each class is conducted as a group counseling session in which problems are reported and resolved, and insight is provided by the trained group PCD counselor.
An evaluation found that PCD students showed a 44 percent reduction in police contacts, while the control group showed a 36 percent increase in police contacts for the same period.
All of the PCD schools also showed a reduction (55 percent and greater) in the number of property offenses (e.g., school vandalism, locker break-in), a reduction of about 66 percent in the number of personal offenses (e.g., robbery, physical assaults, rape, fights), and a 43 percent reduction in gang activity.

Sworn law enforcement officers (who are already well prepared to deal with weapons and violent behavior) are trained to counsel students on law-related problems and support services, teach classes on the law, and serve as role models for students.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the rising numbers of school resource officers in North Carolina has contributed to the falling numbers of firearms reported at school.

There are four curricula (pre-K to grade 2, grades 3 to 5, grades 6 to 8, and grades 9 to 12), and English and Spanish versions of all curricula are available.
For the younger children, the focus is on obeying rules, staying safe, and learning that guns are not toys.
In the middle grades, students explore media violence, reasons why people are violent, and strategies for coping with conflict.
The high school curriculum fosters discussions on the consequences of handgun violence, on gun violence and youth, and on stress as a potential cause of violence.
Students in grades 9-12 who have participated in STAR indicate that they are less likely to use a gun under a variety of circumstances.

In response, they held several meetings to establish goals for addressing the needs of at-risk students and the rest of the school population.
Staff members deliberately selected and implemented programs that had been carefully evaluated and were likely to reduce aggressive behavior while increasing pro-social behavior.
First the school implemented Second Step, a curriculum designed for schoolwide use.
(For more information about Second Step, refer to chapter 3, Model Programs .)
The Second Step Program addresses violence prevention through the development of empathy skills, problem-solving skills, and anger-management techniques.
Then the school adopted the Effective Behavior Support Program, an intensive inter vention program that addresses the needs of students with chronic behavior problems.
(The Effective Be-havior Support Program is a regional program developed by a local university in coordination with the school district.)
Plans for long-term implementation focused on establishing a priority for change; implementing team-based collaboration; creating visible administrative leadership and support; including all school staff and students in the implementation process; and providing intensive training for all school staff.
In addition, administrative procedures have been clarified for students and staff.
The data are encouraging.
In the first year of the program, 33 percent of students report using Second Step strategies in their lives.
Disciplinar y referrals have decreased by 25 percent.
Staff members confirm these changes in student behaviors and attitudes, and they report an increase in using problem-solving approaches to solving conflicts.

A few years ago, because of concern about high incidences of bullying at McCormick Middle School, school officials instituted an antibullying program.
The students named the program Students Against Bullying.
Start-up activities included staff meetings and in-ser vice training for all teachers, establishment of a steering committee including teachers and counselors, and involvement of parents through committee membership and communication sent home.
For two years the activity was intense; student training sessions occurred ever y two weeks, and administrative policy changes to support changed student behaviors were adopted frequently.
As an outgrowth of the anti-bullying focus, character education, conflict education, and a mediation program are now in place.
All students are involved in these activities.
The aspects of the program that focused solely on bullying are less intense, but follow-up on the original program continues.
The school's administrator reports that McCormick is a different school today.
The school's strict rules regarding students not touching each other inappropriately and showing respect to each other have cut out much of the shoving, pushing, and bullying behavior of the past.
Statistics show that bullying incidents have been reduced by 22 percent.U.S.

In 1994-95, this 5,200-student magnet school for mathematics, science, and engineering had 2,607 confrontational/violent or drugrelated incidents.
Deciding to take action, the Educational Excellence Committee created a multi-faceted School Improvement Plan (SIP) that aimed for a 5-percent minimum yearly decrease in such incidents.
Safety and anti-substance use lessons are infused in the basic curriculum and several electives.
Students may participate in reducing crime through a student court for conduct violations, a peer education program, and a program to increase safety and responsible behavior.
Transgression reports and information on referrals are kept in a computerized student record.
Two School Resource Officers provide counseling on drug use and law enforcement while improving relations between police and students.
(For more information on School Resource Officers, refer to chapter 3, Model Programs.)
There is an off-campus alternative school for students with special needs, a program for students at risk of dropping out, and a Juvenile Assessment Center that imposes alternative sanctions and treatment for first-time felony and misdemeanor offenders.
Braddock High School is also well supported by parents, community groups, and local businesses.
From 1994-95 to 1996-97, 1,000 fewer students were referred to the principal's office.
In the same period, incidents in six categories declined in number: disruptive conduct from 899 to 559, defiance of school authority from 1,204 to 938, vandalism from 36 to 14, fights from 165 to 113, and narcotic possession/use from 48 to 33.
After sur veillance cameras were installed in difficult-to-monitor areas in 1997 -98, vandalism dropped 95 percent, almost eliminating graffiti in halls and staircases.

During the spring of 1993, 25 percent of the school population received an out-of-school suspension for rule violations including fighting, weapons possession, assault upon teachers and students, and drug possession.
The school district contracted with the District and Schools Ser vices, Inc., consulting firm to implement a comprehensive and systematic program to eliminate school violence and disruption.
The Riverhead Anti-Violence Project focuses on establishing a structured environment for violence mitigation.
The model is built on three major components.
The interdiction or management-of-risk component addresses policies and procedures such as administrative practices, use of security staff, and facility analysis.
Inter vention efforts, including the alternative school, counseling, and mediation, focus on the students who are not conforming to school policies and regulations.
Prevention efforts consist of mentoring programs; anger management and bias reduction programs; career path education; and value, virtue, and justice curriculum units.
First-year results include the following reductions: fights by more than 68 percent, assaults by 66 percent, assaults on teachers by 100 percent, display and threat to use a weapon by 63 percent, refusal to follow teacher direction by 93 percent, and incidents of harassment by 42 percent.

Contact Information: James W. Hoebbel, Superintendent Westerly School Department 44 Park Avenue Westerly, RI 02891 Phone: 401-596-0315 In response to complaints about the education of students with disabilities, the Westerly school district conducted a needs assessment and implemented intensive, ongoing staff development and collaborative team teaching.
Using data-driven, consumer-oriented techniques, they restructured the schools' and district's policies and programs to reflect their commitment to meeting the needs of each student, providing prevention and inter vention when needed, and offering targeted inter ventions for students with more serious needs.
To ser ve their students with behavioral needs, the elementar y and middle schools established planning centers staffed by a counselor or teacher.
Any student may choose to go to a planning center for a class period to do academic work in its structured setting or to "cool off" and work through a problem.
The high school houses the Westerly Integrated Social Ser vices Program, which helps students and their families access community ser vices they need to be healthy and successful.
The Westerly Integrated Social Ser vices Program has paid off in a suspension rate nearly six times lower than the State figure (3.8 percent compared to 23.2 percent).
This integrative and comprehensive approach to educating students has also led to improved grades, achievement, and attendance of students with emotional or behavioral problems; and to decreased disciplinar y referrals.

Contact Information: Fay Day, Principal Roth Middle School 4535 Hoover Avenue Dayton, OH 45417 937-268-6754 Fax: 937-268-0864 In the Dayton, OH, school district, of which Roth Middle School is a part, violence has been a growing concern, along with the possession of weapons and high expulsion and suspension rates.
Since 1992, all middle and high schools in the district have installed metal detectors.
In 1989, the Positive Adolescents Choices Training (PACT) program, a violence prevention program directed at African-American middle school youth, was initiated.
PACT is just one part of Roth's comprehensive approach to school safety that includes specific administrative approaches, a strong student support system, and several other programs.
(For more information about PACT refer to chapter 3, Model Programs.)
The administrative approaches include an emphasis on shared decisionmaking and a team teaching structure.
A part-time social worker and the school psychologist provide high-quality support ser vices to students and their families.
PACT focuses on the development of social and anger management skills in order to provide students alternatives for solving interpersonal problems.
Teachers are asked to refer students to the program, which meets twice each week for one semester.
The sessions are scheduled in the special subject block so that students do not miss academic classes.
About 50 students are ser ved each semester.
Followup with these students is built in to the overall plan.
PACT has been regularly evaluated since its inception in 1989.
A 1992-93 study showed that PACT participants demonstrated a 50percent reduction in physical aggression at school, maintained behavioral improvements beyond participation in the program, and had 50 percent fewer overall and violence-related juvenile court charges than students in a control group that did not receive PACT. 40
