ATTORNEY GENERAL ISSUES ADVISORY ON PYRAMIDSCHEMES Carson City-- Attorney General Brian Sandoval advises Nevada consumers that when the economy slows, get rich quick schemes increase in number, often in the form of illegal pyramid schemes.
State law prohibits "pyramid schemes" under which an investment is made and the ability of the investor to receive a monetary return is conditioned on recruiting additional people to the scheme instead of the selling of an actual product.
A pyramid is distinguished from a true direct -sales or home business opportunity because there is no product to be sold or the sale of a product is secondary to the recruitment of new participants.
This is also distinguished from a gift, in which a person gives another person something of value with no expectation of profit or something in return.
In the more traditional home -based pyramid scheme, perpetrators will target close friends, relatives, neighbors, and persons they can trust to remain quiet about the pyramid scheme.
The recruiting material will contain statements that the pyramid scheme is a legal direct sales opportunity, business opportunity from your home or a gifting club.
Also, pyramid schemes are occurring more frequently on the Internet.
In this scenario, the perpetrators will make contact with potential participants through e -mails and use the same recruiting dialogue as the home based pyramid schemes.
Consumer Advocate Timothy Hay offers the following tips to avoid becoming a victim of this type of scam: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Before investing in anything, analyze the incentive structure.
If you receive significantly more income for recruiting people than selling products, the investment is probably a pyramid scheme.
If considering a gifting club, remember that a legitimate gift has no strings attached and is not an investment.
Beware if the start up cost is substantial.
Avoid being misled into thinking the opportunity is legitimate because the ads say it is legitimate.
This is an attempt to make an illegal transaction appear legal.
Resist the temptation to invest just because the people selling you the program are friends, family, or are part of organizations to which you also belong.
Beware of quick, easy, and unreasonably high profits.
Remember, simply participating in a pyramid scheme is illegal.
