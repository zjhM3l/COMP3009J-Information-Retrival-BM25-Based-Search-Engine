Minnesota Baseball/Football Stadium Debate 1996-2003 Stadium Stakeholders Next Generation Stadiums MEMBERS OF STADIUM SCREENING COMMITTEE DAN MCELROY, CHAIR Legislative members: 
The City of Minneapolis provided $22 million in land and infrastructure.
The Timberwolves were sold to Glen Taylor in 1994.
Taylor signed a 30-year lease with Target Center.
In 1995 Target Center was sold to the City of Minneapolis for $54.6 million.
Minneapolis issued bonds to raise money for the purchase of Target Center.
The bonds are being paid for with a mix of revenue streams: Target Center property tax, a 3 percent tax on concessions and ticket sales, parking revenue from nearby ramps, and an annual grant of $750,000 from the State of Minnesota in return for use of the arena for amateur events
The Timberwolves receive revenues from suites, advertising, and naming rights (Target Corp.).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Target Center is operated by Clear Channel Entertainment.
The Timberwolves are currently negotiating an agreement to take over operation of the facility.
Xcel Energy Center Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul was built with $130 million in public financing, a $65 million loan from the State of Minnesota and $65 million from the City of St. Paul.
The Legislature approved an interest free loan for $65 million in 1998.
$17 million was forgiven for allowing the arena to be used for youth sports.
St. Paul is paying the remaining $48 million with money from the Minnesota Wild.
The City of Saint Paul provided $65 million in bonding, which is being paid off via game-day parking revenues, rent revenues, and a half-cent city sales tax.
The Wild pay $3.5 million in annual rent to the city.
It also makes additional payments to the city in lieu of taxes, $2.5 million in 2001 increasing to $6 million by 2025.
The team was responsible for any construction cost overruns.
It paid $40 million for arena upgrades and improvements.
It also operates the arena and RiverCentre complex.
The Wild parent corporation collects any profits and absorbs any losses.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Metrodome The Metrodome was built in 1982 to replace Metropolitan Stadium.
The Dome represents the best return on investment of any public works project in Minnesota state history.
Built on time and under budget, the Metrodome is the country's only public stadium that does not rely on a continuing tax subsidy to finance operations, maintenance or debt payments.
Debt on the Metrodome was retired in 1998.
In its 21-year history, the Metrodome has lived up to the moniker of "Minnesota's Rec Room: The Metrodome is the only stadium to have hosted all of the following: the NFL Super Bowl (1992), Major League Baseball's All-Star Game (1985), two World Series (1987, 1991), and the Final Four of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship (1992, 2001).
Out of more than 300 event days per year at the Metrodome, less than 100 feature professional or major college sports.
The remaining event days consist of high school and small college games, concerts, community activities and other events.
The Metrodome is the only major facility in Minnesota big enough to host major motorsports events.
The Metrodome will continue to operate as the home for the Twins, Vikings, Gophers and high school sports championships until the next generation of sports facilities is constructed.
It will continue to be operated in a first class manner so that fans can continue to enjoy all the events that require a large-capacity venue.
The Metrodome's Challenges The Metrodome was the last major multi-purpose stadium built in the United States.
Many teams have since made the move to new or substantially renovated stadiums where they are the primary tenant and receive the bulk of the revenue generated by the facilities.
Following are areas where the Metrodome falls short in today's professional sports landscape.
Without construction of new stadium facilities, or substantial renovation of the Metrodome, these challenges will continue: 1.
Convenience and Entertainment Features for Fans The Metrodome concourses are more than 40 feet narrower than those found in many newer stadiums.
Concession service areas are limited.
Newer stadiums typically have at least double the number of concession service lines that the Metrodome offers.
Not enough restrooms exist.
Currently there are 16 men's restrooms and 16 women's restrooms; whereas the Tennessee Titans' Adelphia Coliseum has 26 men's restrooms and 40 women's restrooms.
The Metrodome does not have sit-down restaurants.
- - The Metrodome lacks large external and internal video screens that add to the "gameday experience" and provide additional advertising opportunities for the teams.
The Metrodome does not have the additional entertainment features found at newer ballparks and football stadiums.
These range from the "liquid fireworks" display on the centerfield wall at Detroit's Comerica Park to kids' play areas at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati.
2.
Increased Revenue Opportunities for Teams With three tenants (Vikings, Twins and Gophers), the Metrodome does not allow for each tenant to have exclusive control over the following revenue opportunities: - Suites - Stadium advertising - Concessions and food service - Parking - Team stores (no teams have space for team stores in the Dome)
In addition to stadium amenities, new facilities allow the opportunity for additional revenues through the sale of naming rights and Personal Seat Licenses
(PSL's) - 3.
Seating and Luxury Suites The Twins have the fewest number of quality seats in Major League Baseball.
Many of the seats are situated for football rather than baseball.
Whereas the Vikings may want to increase seating for fans, the Twins seek a baseball-only facility with fewer seats.
The Metrodome cannot deliver on those wishes and provide quality sight lines for fans of both teams.
Unlike many new stadiums, the Metrodome does not provide club seating and has 115 1970's design luxury suites.
Newer NFL stadiums have approximately 155 suites.
Major League Baseball stadiums generally have 60-80 depending on the market.
Metrodome suites do not have separate concourses, restrooms or access to a private lounge.
- - 4.
Locker Rooms and Field The Metrodome cannot accommodate a natural grass playing surface or provide a retractable roof.
The Metrodome cannot accommodate a team's desire for increased locker room space or meeting rooms.
Financing Summaries for the Twin Cities' Major Stadiums The Metrodome Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Metrodome was financed by a combination of government and private sources.
The stadium has been financially self-supporting since 1984 and debt-free since 1998 when the stadium's bonds were retired with proceeds from the sale of the Met Center's land.
In 1977, the Legislature passed a "no-site" bill that allowed for construction of a domed stadium for no more than $55 million.
In the end, the full cost of the stadium was approximately $124 million.
The bill mandated that if a city no cost.
Minneapolis business of land that was selected as the issued revenue bonds that were wanted the stadium it would have to provide land at leaders raised $15 million to purchase a 25-acre parcel site of the Metrodome.
The Metropolitan Council backed by the City of Minneapolis.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A 2 percent metro-wide tax on liquor sales was imposed for the no-site legislation.
It raised $8 million from 1977 to 1979.
After a site was selected the tax shifted to the City of Minneapolis.
The city applied a 3 percent tax on liquor sales and hotel accommodations from 1979-1983 and 2 percent in 1984 and raised $15.8 million.
Minneapolis has contributed over $5 million from a portion of revenues from cityowned parking ramps and parking meters since 1983.
In the end, the full cost of the stadium was approximately $124 million.
That includes investments by the Twins and Vikings for their exclusive space, infrastructure investments by the City of Minneapolis, donations by the business community for land, and other improvements.
Since the Metrodome opened in 1982, more than $40 million in capital improvements have been made to the stadium.
The Gophers, Twins, and Vikings each pay event-related costs for their use of the dome.
The teams also pay additional amounts depending on their respective use agreements.
The Commission pays all building operations costs.
The teams also receive a share of concession revenues.
The Vikings own the rights to the Metrodome's suites for which they pay rent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Historical Funding Structures Local Facility Funding Case Studies 1 Target Center - Initial Funding Case Study Team, City, State: General Description: Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA), Minneapolis, Minnesota The Target Center opened in 1990 and has a total seating capacity of approximately 19,100 for basketball, 70 private suites and a health club.
The arena was originally owned by the Minnesota Timberwolves, but purchased by the Metropolitan Community Development Authority to prevent the team from relocating to New Orleans.
The Metropolitan Community Development Authority (MCDA) issued $20.0 million in tax increment financing bonds.
The Timberwolves privately financed $80.0 million of the construction and development costs secured by arena and health club revenues.
In addition, the MCDA provided a $3.0 million loan secured by the same sources of revenue.
Public Participation: Private Participation: MDA T IF F unds $20.0 million T imber wolv es Ar ena 
The MCDA issued $12.65 million in revenue bonds and the City of Minneapolis issued $72.0 million in G.O. bonds.
The proceeds of the bonds were used to retire the existing MCDA debt ($22.1 million), acquire the arena ($54.0 million), pay financing costs ($2.3 million), fund a reserve fund ($5.6 million) and pay additional acquisition costs ($600,000).
Both bonds are repaid by the City revenues including: (i) the City's portion of property taxes attributable to the private uses of the arena and the tax increment revenues from the tax increment district in which the Target Center is located; (ii) Entertainment tax revenues derived from the arena; (iii) an annual appropriation from the Minnesota Legislature in the amount of $750,000 to be provided to the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission and transferred to the Agency in exchange for the use of the Arena for a minimum of 50 event dates per annum; and (iv) revenue derived from the City's parking fund in an annual amount of not in excess of the amounts described in the Indenture.

Along with the arena, the complex includes a convention center and an auditorium.
The new arena features a seating capacity of 18,064, with 66 private suites and 3,500 club seats.
The expansion Minnesota Wild commenced play in the Center in the 2000-2001 season.
The amended lease called for the City to fund $65 million of the total construction costs with the State providing an interest-free loan for the remaining $65 million, which is repaid solely by a portion of the annual team rent payments.
While there was no direct upfront funding for the Team under the amended lease, the Team is responsible for repaying a portion of the State loan and the City bonds.
The team is responsible for making annual rental of $3.5 million per year over the first 25 years.
The Team also pays the City annual PILOT payments instead of the ticket surcharges and marquee payments previously directed to the City.
The present value at the time of construction of the team's repayment of a portion of the State's loan and all of the City's loan was estimated to be $85.3 million.

Taxable bonds are sold at today's low interest rates (7.0%) Twins pay $120 million as a gift to the state.
Baseball Stadium Financing Plan 2002 Stadium Bill The Facts Interest earned on the gift (estimated at 8.5%) pays the principal at the end of 33 years and funds roughly one-half of the interest payments over the 33 years.
The local government makes annual payments that begin at $12 million each year to provide the rest of the interest payments.
The payments grow by 3% each year.
Baseball Stadium Financing Plan 2002 Stadium Bill The Plan $330 million in taxable revenue bonds sold at an estimated 7.0% rate of interest to pay for the design and construction of the stadium and are paid off at the end of 33 years.
The $330 million in principal on the bonds is paid at the end of the 33 years, with about $23 million in interest expense paid annually during the 33 years.
The $120 million Twins contribution is placed in the gift fund and invested.
Baseball Stadium Financing Plan 2002 Stadium Bill The Plan The gift fund has a long-term investment horizon of 33 years and assumes an average return on the investment of 8.5%.
The investment return is greater than the interest rate on the bonds sold, resulting in an investment profit that pays roughly one-half of the interest costs and the entire principal after 33 years.
Baseball Stadium Financing Plan 2002 Stadium Bill The Team's Role The Twins contribute $120 million of the project costs upfront as a non-refundable gift to the state.
The Twins assume the risk that investment returns are sufficient, along with the annual payments, to cover annual interest payments and the principal payment at the end of 33 years.
The Twins enter into a 33-year lease for use of the publicly owned stadium.
Baseball Stadium Financing Plan 2002 Stadium Bill The Team's Role The Twins select all investment advisors, giving the team more control over the gift fund's investment strategy.
At predetermined time periods of four years, the Twins are required to bring the gift fund up to the amount expected if investment returns are less than expected.
The Twins provide sufficient security or guarantees to ensure that state taxpayers hold no risk for future interest or principal payments.

The park is owned by the Wisconsin Professional Baseball District (WPBD) (64%) and the Brewers (36%).
The baseball-only stadium has a convertible roof, a natural grass playing surface, and has an approximate seating capacity of 42,000 with 75 private suites and 3,000 club seats.
The Brewers are responsible for operating the facility.
The WPBD issued tax-exempt bonds totaling $160.0 million backed by a 1/10 of a cent increase in the sales tax and a 1% increase in the room tax for Milwaukee County and the four surrounding counties.
The District also issued $78 million in certificates of participation that are backed by the sales tax revenues.
The funds were used to lease stadium equipment such as the scoreboard, utility equipment, and other operational items for the roof system and stadium.
Approximately $72 million in infrastructure costs were supported through public funds consisting of: $36 million from the State and $18 million each from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County.
The Milwaukee Brewers contributed $90.0 million toward the cost of the stadium.
Included in this is a $20.0 million low-interest loan from the Bradley Foundation, $1.0 million low-interest loan from the Helfaer Foundation, $14.0 million in private loans from various community lenders, $15.0 million loan from the City of Milwaukee, $30.0 from the sale of naming rights to Miller Brewing Company and upfront concessionaire payments to the team, as well as a $10 million MLB letter of credit.

Applicable sales taxes include a 5.0% State tax and a 0.6% Milwaukee County tax.
The sales tax in Milwaukee County and four other neighboring counties was raised by 0.1% (to the current 0.6%) to back the $160.0 million tax-exempt bond issue by the Wisconsin Professional Baseball District (WPBD).
As the majority of facility ownership will be controlled by the WPBD, property taxes are not applicable.
However, as the Brewers own approximately 36 percent of the ballpark, there is some debate over the taxability of this portion.
The Milwaukee Brewers will receive all stadium revenues and are responsible for all operating expenses.
The WPBD receives annual rent payments of $900,000, increasing after 10 years from the Brewers.
The WPBD pays the Brewers an annual operating subsidy of $3.85 million for facility repair and maintenance.
The District has the responsibility to deposit $700,000 annually into a segregated capital reserve fund.
The team has the responsibility to deposit $300,000 annually into the capital reserve fund.
To the extent the reserve funds are insufficient to pay the District's obligations related to major capital improvements, the District has the responsibility to pay the difference.
The District was responsible for any cost overruns.
Certain provisions have been modified since the original funding package was completed.

The District will be responsible for any expenditures in excess of the capital reserve.
Other Development / Lease Issues: Cost overruns for the facility development are the responsibility of the Pirates.
After the first 10 years of the term, the Pirates will be obligated to pay 1/3 of the States contribution unless the State has received $25 million over the term from a variety of State tax revenues including personal income, sales and use taxes.
The Pirates have the same obligations for each of the subsequent 10 year periods.
5 Safeco Field Funding Case Study Team, City, State: General Description: Seattle Mariners (MLB), Seattle, Washington The 45,000-seat retractable-roof stadium was completed during the 1999 baseball season.
The owner of the facility is the Washington State Professional Baseball Public Facilities District (PFD), a board of members appointed by King County, while the Seattle Mariners operate the stadium.
King County funded $150.0 and $71.0 million of construction costs through tax-exempt G.O. bonds supported by a 0.5 percent increase and a 2 percent increase in the County's food and beverage and car rental taxes, respectively.
In addition, 0.017 percent of the State's 6.5 percent sales tax collections were returned to the County to assist in the bond repayment and provide approximately $71 million.
Further, $50 million bonds secured by lottery revenue related to four newly created lottery games by the State also funded the public's portion of stadium development costs.
Interest income generated approximately $5.0 million.
Lastly, the County levied a 10 percent admissions tax on all events at the stadium.
Five percent of the admission tax is used by the PFD to fund the debt service associated with the $27.0 million parking garage.
The other five percent is used by the Mariners to fund a major building replacement reserve up to a maximum of $5.0 million.
The Seattle Mariners originally contributed $45.0 million plus $94 million revenues.

The other five percent is used by the Mariners to fund a capital replacement fund up to a maximum of $5.0 million.
Property taxes are not applicable since the facility will be owned by the PFD.
The Mariners also received an exemption from State leasehold excise taxes on the public areas of the facility.
The Mariners retain all revenues generated from the stadium and pay all operating expenses.
In return for complete operating control, the Mariners will pay the PFD $700,000 per annum, inflating by the Seattle area's CPI.
The lease extends for 20 years.
The Mariners were responsible for any cost overruns beyond the existing $422.0 million budget.
As of April 1999, the cost overruns were estimated to have increased the project cost by an additional $100 million.
In addition, if the five percent admissions tax does not cover the debt service associated with the $27.0 million parking garage, the Mariners will fund the difference.
Further, the Mariners agreed to pay any legal expenses incurred by the PFD, if the team breaks the lease agreement.
