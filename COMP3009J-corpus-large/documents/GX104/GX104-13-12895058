OPERATING EXPENSES (OE)
General
The budget request for Coast Guard operating expenses in fiscal year 2002 is $3.4 billion, an increase of $190 million, or six percent, over the fiscal year 2001 appropriated level.
Operating expenses account for about two-thirds of the Coast Guards budget and fund Coast Guard search and rescue, aids to navigation, marine safety, marine environmental protection, and law enforcement operations.
Two-thirds of the OE account, or $2.0 billion, is used for personnel compensation.
This includes funding for 35,132 military and 6,001 civilian personnel.
The Coast Guards operating expense request includes an additional $266 million for new Coast Guard personnel entitlements, annualizations for past personnel entitlements, and operational adjustments due to inflation.
The Presidents announced pay raises in fiscal year 2002 for Coast Guard military personnel, 4.6%, and civilian personnel, 3.6%, would cost the Coast Guard $63 million.
The President has also requested an additional $46 million during fiscal year 2002 to address current and projected increases in fuel and energy costs.
The President has requested $31 million to operate new Coast Guard facilities during fiscal year 2002.
This amount includes $9.8 million to operate three new seagoing buoy tenders, $5 million to staff, operate, and maintain the new 47-foot Motor Life boat fleet, $3.8 million for an aviation detachment to support increased deployment days for the Coast Guards new polar icebreaker, and $3.4 million to operate and maintain ten new 87-foot coastal patrol boats.
The President has further requested $8.4 million in new Coast Guard initiatives.
These include $5.5 million to improve the staffing at Coast Guard Search and Rescue Command Centers and Stations, and $0.6 million to mitigate the safety risks on passenger vessels.
The Presidents request also calls for operating expense reductions of $108 million.
These reductions include $4.0 million for the decommissioning four buoy tenders as part of the ongoing buoy tender replacement project, $15 million for the decommissioning of five cutters and eight law enforcement boats, as well as the removal of one 170-foot patrol craft from the Coast Guards vessel inventory.
In addition, the Coast Guard plans to save $43 million by retiring 13 HU-25 FALCON and 3 HC-130 HERCULES aircraft and by closing two air facilities in Long Island, New York, and Muskegon, Michigan.
ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENTS (AC
The Administration requests $659.3 million in acquisitions funding for fiscal year 2002, a $244 million increase over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2001.
This account is divided into six main program activities.
These activities include the acquisition, construction, renovation, and improvement of vessels, aircraft, other equipment, and shore facilities.
This account also funds the Coast Guards Deepwater Capability Replacement Project and the Coast Guard personnel responsible for acquisition.
In the vessels category, $70 million is requested for the continuing Seagoing Buoy Tender Replacement Project.
In addition, $5 million is requested for the Polar Class Icebreaker Reliability Improvement Project.
The Administration also requests $338 million to implement Phase II of the Deepwater Capabilities Replacement Project.
In August 1998, the Coast Guard awarded contracts to three industry teams to design an Integrated Deepwater System that maximizes operational effectiveness and minimizes total ownership cost.
Industry team proposals to design and construct the Deepwater project are due in July 2001.
The Coast Guard intends to award a Phase II contract in second quarter of fiscal year 2002, and to begin acquiring, constructing, or improving existing assets under the accepted proposal.
In the aviation category, $27 million is requested for repair and replacement of critical aviation parts and equipment.
In the other equipment category, $61 million is requested to support initiatives that will result in enhanced maritime safety.
These include $42 million for the Coast Guards National Distress and Response System Modernization Project which is a new coastal distress communications system critical to improving the ability of mariners in distress to notify the Coast Guard when they are in trouble.
The Administration also requests $12.5 million for the Ports and Waterways Safety System to improve safety in our Nations ports.
In the shore facilities category, $63 million is requested to support Coast Guard housing, facility improvements and aids to navigation projects.
Finally, $65 million is requested for personnel and core acquisition costs associated with these capital improvement projects.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND RESTORATION
For environmental compliance and restoration, funding of $16.9 million, $200,000 more than the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2001, has been requested to mitigate environmental problems resulting from the operation of former and current Coast Guard facilities, and to ensure that Coast Guard facilities are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
This funding would be used to clean up thousands of batteries disposed of by the Coast Guard in many locations.
Another part of this program is to continue to clean up hazardous waste sites in Kodiak, Alaska, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina.
ALTERATION OF BRIDGES
The Bridge Alternation program provides the Federal governments share of the costs for altering or removing bridges determined to be obstructions to navigation.
Under Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, (33 U.S.C. 511et seq.), the Coast Guard shares, with the bridge owner, the cost of altering railroad and publicly-owned highway bridges which obstruct the free movement of vessel traffic.
The Administration requests $15.5 million for necessary expenses of alternation or removal of obstructive railroad bridges.
RESERVE TRAINING
The Coast Guard provides qualified individuals and a limited number of trained Port Security Units for mobilization in the event of national emergency or disaster.
The reservists maintain readiness through mobilization exercises and duty alongside regular Coast Guard members during routine and emergency operations.
The fiscal year 2002 budget request proposes funding of $83.2 million for Coast Guard Reserve training to support the authorized strength of 8,000.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION
For research, development, test and evaluation, the Administration proposes to spend $21.7 million, a $400,000 increase above fiscal year 2002 appropriated level.
This account funds the development of techniques, methods, research, hardware, systems, and planning to improve the productivity of existing Coast Guard missions.
Priorities for fiscal year 2002 include drug interdiction surveillance, fuel cell vessel propulsion, as well as ballast water management and aquatic nuisance species neutralization research.
BOAT SAFETY
In 1984, the Wallop-Breaux amendments to the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 created the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund.
The Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund consists of two accounts, the Sport Fish Restoration Account and the Boat Safety Account.
Annually, up to $70 million of the motorboat fuel taxes paid by recreational boaters are deposited in the Boat Safety Account to fund state boating safety grant programs coordinated by the Coast Guard.
Subtitle D of title VII of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, P.L. 105-178, is the Sportfishing and Boating Safety Act of 1998.
This legislation amends the Recreational Boating Safety Program, administered by the Coast Guard.
Under these amendments, states receive $59 million without appropriation for boating safety programs.
An additional $13 million may be appropriated from the Coast Guards budget for boating safety programs.
This legislation also provides the Coast Guard with $5 million annually to coordinate and carry out the national recreational boating safety program.
The Administration does not request additional funding above the $64 million permanently appropriated for the boating safety program and Coast Guard administrative expenses.
RETIRED PAY
The Administrations fiscal year 2002 request for retired pay is $876.4 million, an increase of $98.4 million over the fiscal year 2001 level.
These funds provide annuities and medical care for retired military personnel and former Lighthouse Service members, their dependents, and survivors.
OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND
Established by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund provides a source of funds, not subject to appropriation, to pay oil spill removal costs and damages, including assessment of natural resources damages, and Federal expenses necessary to administer the Fund.
Each year, the Fund may provide up to $50 million for emergency response costs and pay all valid claims for oil spill damages resulting from oil spills.
The Administrations fiscal year 2002 request from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is $61.2 million, including $50 million for emergency response costs, $10 million for payment of claims, and $1.2 million for support of the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute in Cordova, Alaska
KEY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUDGET REQUEST
Coast Guard Readiness:
During the past several years, the Coast Guard has experienced budgetary shortfalls resulting from the enactment of new and expanded military entitlement programs.
In addition, the cumulative effects of streamlining, personnel shortages, inexperienced personnel and increased demands for services have reduced the Coast Guards overall readiness posture.
The Coast Guard has deferred maintenance on vessels and cannibalized aircraft to overcome readiness shortfalls.
However, the Coast Guard has deferred maintenance on its aircraft, vessels and shore facilities to the point that it is no longer able to sustain an adequate level of operations.
During fiscal years 2000 and 2001, the Coast Guard has diverted funds from law enforcement operations, thus reducing these operations, to pay for unbudgeted cost increases such as new and expanded entitlement programs, rising utility costs and critical spare parts.
While the Presidents budget request proposes a solid increase to the Coast Guards operating and acquisition accounts, the Coast Guard needs additional resources in the fiscal year 2002 budget to avoid the destructive cycle of budget shortfalls, operational cuts, and end-of-year supplemental funding bills.
The Coast Guard readiness problems, related to a sharp increase in military entitlements, personnel training needs, and new operational demands, leave the Coast Guard approximately $300 million short in operating expenses for fiscal year 2002.
The House version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2002 provides $5.3 billion for the Coast Guard, a $250 million increase over the Presidents budget request for the agency.
This increase is provided to eliminate Coast Guard vessel and aircraft spare parts problems, to improve personnel training, to fund new Department of Defense entitlements, and to operate drug interdiction assets at optimal levels.
Drug Interdiction
The fiscal year 2002 budget request includes $619.2 million in operating expenses for Coast Guard drug interdiction activities.
There is no funding for new drug interdiction strategies in the operating expense request.
The AC
The AC
While the Coast Guard expects to decrease its drug interdiction efforts, in comparison to fiscal year 2001 levels, by decreasing assets as well as vessel and aircraft operating hours, the Coast Guard does plan to expand the use of its Operation New Frontier capabilities.
Operation New Frontier forces include specially equipped and hardened airborne use-of-force helicopters, over-the-horizon cutter boats, and non-lethal technologies designed to stem the threat of go-fast drug smuggling boats.
In support of the Coast Guards use-of-force program, Agusta Aerospace Corporation of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has delivered the first two Agusta A109E helicopters to the Coast Guard for deployment as an integral component of Operation New Frontier.
Delivery of the six remaining helicopters is scheduled to take place by July 2001.
The Coast Guard expects to spend $24 million on this important program to stop drug smugglers.
The Coast Guard will continue to leverage its use of intelligence, law enforcement detachments aboard U.S. Navy and foreign vessels, interagency partners, and a cohesive international engagement plan in support of our National Drug Control Strategy.
Should Congress provide the agency with additional fiscal year 2002 operational funding, the Coast Guard would increase the number of vessel and aircraft operating hours devoted to drug law enforcement.
Deepwater Capability Replacement Project
The Coast Guards Deepwater Capability Replacement Project is intended to replace or modernize all assets used in the Deepwater missions, which generally occur more than 50 miles offshore.
Coast Guard activities in this zone typically require either extended on-scene presence, long transit distance to reach the operating area, forward deployment of forces, or a combination of these approaches.
The Coast Guard has identified fourteen missions in this zone, including alien migration interdiction operations, drug interdiction, and fisheries law enforcement.
The Coast Guard began planning for replacing assets in 1996 because Deepwater-capable assets are nearing the end of their service lives, are technologically limited for performing deepwater missions effectively, and are expensive to operate because of relatively high crew requirements.
Instead of proposing a traditional one-for-one asset-replacement program, the Coast Guard has hired three industry teams to develop competing proposals to develop a single, integrated package of ships, aircraft, and associated systems that will optimize performance of deepwater missions while minimizing life-cycle costs.
To date, the Coast Guard has spent $117 million for three industry teams to develop a plan for replacing or modernizing existing assets.
The winning team is to be selected the second quarter of fiscal year 2002.
The Administration has requested $338 million in fiscal year 2002 to begin acquiring, construction or improving existing assets under the accepted proposal.
The Coast Guard estimates the acquisition cost of the Deepwater project at $10 billion over the next twenty years, but this figure could change.
National Distress and Response System Modernization (NDRSM) Project
The National Distress System provides two-way voice communications coverage for the majority of Coast Guard missions in coastal areas and navigable waterways where commercial and recreational traffic exists.
The Coast Guards system monitors the international VHF maritime distress frequency (Channel 16) and acts as the primary command and control network to coordinate Coast Guard search and rescue response activities.
The secondary function of the system is to provide command, control, and communications for Coast Guard missions involving national security, maritime safety, law enforcement, and marine environmental protection.
The national distress and communication capability of the existing communications system, built in the 1970s, is inadequate.
The current system is unable to accommodate the significant growth in maritime commerce and recreational boating.
The Presidents request provides $42 million for validation and full-scale development of the selected alternative solution for the NDRSM project.
This project will fully modernize the existing VHF-FM National Distress System and provide improved distress alerting and response coordination capability, along with improved command and control for all Coast Guard missions.
The new system will include direction finding, asset tracking, digital selective calling, and multi-channel transmitting and receiving capability.
The future cost of the National Distress System project is estimated at $220 million.
The project is to be completed in fiscal year 2006.
There is concern that the implementation time for the project is too long, since there is a vast disparity between the communications capability that the public thinks is in place and the actual capabilities of the current communications system.
