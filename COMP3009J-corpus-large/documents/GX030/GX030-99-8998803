The crisis had an impact on the economy of the Western region and perhaps the entire country.
Chronology FERC Asked to Increase Refund of Energy Company Overcharges to California Jan. 9, 2003 - Rep. Waxman joined with 32 California Democratic colleagues to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to substantially increase the refund to California proposed by a FERC judge for energy company overcharges.
The judge had found that California was due $1.8 billion in refunds, but owed energy suppliers $3 billion.
Some energy companies have admitted that they manipulated energy markets during the 2000-2001 energy crisis, and evidence has consistently indicated that California consumers have been gouged tens of billions of dollars by the energy industry.

Flaws of the "Electricity Emergency Relief Act" May 1, 2001 - The "Electricity Emergency Relief Act" being drafted by Rep. Joe Barton is intended to help California address the current electricity crisis.
Unfortunately, the legislation, if enacted, would exacerbate California's problems by increasing energy costs, undermining state efforts to respond to the electricity crisis, and weakening important environmental protections.

Companies Profit from California's Energy Crisis April 25, 2001 - At the request of Rep. Waxman, the Special Investigations Division prepared a report which documents the extraordinary revenues and profits that out-of-state energy generators doing business in California recorded last year.
On average, their company-wide profits more than doubled from 1999 to 2000.
In some cases, operating income from their California subsidiaries or operating units increased tenfold or more.
