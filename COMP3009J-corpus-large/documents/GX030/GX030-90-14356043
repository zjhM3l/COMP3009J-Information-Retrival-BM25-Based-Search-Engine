The Caribbean Import Market for Juices Overview The Caribbean region consumes a wide variety of tropical and temperate fruit juices.
Popular varieties include citrus, apple, grape, pineapple, cranberry, mixed tropical blends, drinks such as fruit punch containing partial fruit juice, and vegetable blends.
A myriad of suppliers from the EU, South America, Canada, and regional producers supply juices throughout the region.
Jamaica and Trinidad, for example, export juices to their Caribbean neighbors while small independent producers sell products only within their countries.
The Caribbean import market for juices exceeds $40 million.
With a 66 percent share of the Caribbean import market (based on statistics of five supplying countries; see Table 1), the US is the main supplier of juices sold locally in the Caribbean.
The EU is the largest competitor, with smaller quantities also entering from Trinidad and Canada.
Jamaica, which has domestic production of its own, exports relatively little.
Table 2 provides a breakdown of US juice exports to the region by market and variety.
US exports to the region are dominated by apple, orange, and mixed juice varieties.
Table 3 shows that US juice exports to the region have remained relatively stagnant over the last four years.

Import requirements for juices tend to be minimal and permits are generally not required.
Labeling practices are typically equal or less demanding than US food labeling requirements, and products following US guidelines are widely accepted.
Bahamas
Current Suppliers.
The Bahamas is one of the largest juice markets in the Caribbean.
Imports in 1997 totaled $10.8 million according to official Bahamian statistics (see Table 4).
The bulk of juices were supplied by the US and consisted mainly of citrus, apple, and mixed juices.
Tropicana, Dole, Welch's, Ocean Spray and Minute Maid are the major US brands carried by local retailers.
Most juices are sourced from Miami-based consolidators that supply products of both US and international origin.
Local production, though relatively small, does exist with local juice makers based in the outer islands producing drinks not carried on the main islands.

Distribution and Sales Channels.
Nassau is the largest port in the Bahamas and handles most of the commercial traffic, including food imports.
Freeport is currently being expanded to accommodate container vessels.
The Bahamas also has five international airports, with the two largest at Nassau and Freeport.
It is estimated that there are less than twenty food wholesalers in the Bahamas, including Asa H. Pritchard, Jagar, D'Albenas, Island Seafood and Nassau Hotel and Restaurant Supply.
The Grand Bahamas Food Company and the Thompson Trading Company are two medium-sized wholesalers based in Freeport.
The wholesale business is reported to be increasingly competitive as many grocery stores, including warehouse-type discount outlets, are importing direct from manufacturers or through Miami-based wholesalers.
There are over 200 grocery stores in the Bahamas, most of which are small.
The three major grocery store chains are City Markets (owned by US-based Winn Dixie), Super Value, and John Chea and Sons.
There is also Solomon's and CostRite, which are similar to Sam's Club in the US.
Both operate both as a traditional wholesaler and as a retailer by selling directly to the public out from their warehouses.

Consumer Preferences.
Popular juice brands include Tropicana and Florida Natural citrus juices, as well as Dole and Minute Maid fruit juices and Mott's apple.
While these imported varieties are popular on the main islands, the small outer islands have their own locally produced drinks that are not sold on the main islands, including drinks of lemon and lime flavoring.
Juice is sold fresh, both canned and in cartons, as well as concentrated.
Import Requirements.
Since most food imports are brought in from the United States, local food restrictions in the Bahamas follow US quality and safety guidelines.
Import permits are not required for juice products.
Tariffs and Duties.
The government of the Bahamas levies a range of tariffs on juice imports (see Table 6).

Consumer Preferences.
Despite the popularity of citrus and apple juice, retailers report local consumption of a variety of products and supermarket buyers look for a range of juices to meet consumer preferences.
Other popular varieties include pineapple, coconut, and tropical mixes.
Consumers are receptive to trying new and different products.
Juices are offered fresh, frozen and in concentrate, are usually non-carbonated, and come in bottles, cans or cartons.
Import Requirements.
Although there are no labeling or packaging regulations enforced in CuraÃ§ao, imported juices meeting US food safety guidelines generally have no problem clearing Customs.
Tariffs and Duties.
CuraÃ§ao levies two types of import duties: a standard tariff rate against the c.i.f. value of a product and an "economic levy" which applies to locally-produced goods (special duties may apply to other products, such as a special excise tax on alcoholic beverages).
The present tariff rate for fruit and vegetable juice imports is 5.5 percent of the c.i.f. value, plus an economic levy of NA Guilders 0.60 (approximately $0.34) per liter.
Jamaica
Current Suppliers.
Jamaica is a major producer of citrus and tropical juice products, most of which are consumed locally although small volumes are also exported.
Its three major export juices are citrus, pineapple, and passion fruit.
Jamaica also imports large quantities of juices, particularly citrus and temperate varieties.
According to official Jamaican statistics, the import market for fruit and vegetable juices totaled US $5.7 million in 1997.
The US accounted for 40 percent of import demand (by volume) in 1997, followed by the UK (27 percent), Thailand (9 percent), and Argentina (5 percent).

Consumer Preferences.
According to sources, the most popular variety of imported juice is apple.
Grape juice is also popular, followed by mixes like tropical blend.
Although orange and pineapple juices are produced locally, these do not sell as well as the imported brands due to limited or inconsistent supply.
Vegetable juices are also important, with brands like V8 leading the market with tomato, carrot and fruit-vegetable mixes.
Import Requirements.
Despite high tariffs and strong competition from domestic and third-country suppliers, there are no bans on juice products entering Jamaica and import permits are not required for juices.
Juice imports are subject to Jamaican labeling guidelines, which are similar to those of the US.
In addition to requiring content description and expiration date of the product, all descriptive information must utilize the metric system of weights and measures where appropriate.
Tariffs and Duties.
The following duties apply to Jamaican imports of juices:
Standard tariff rate (see Table 13) levied against CIF value;
Stamp duty (see Table 13, applicable on certain products) levied against the sum of the CIF value and standard tariff amount;
General Consumption Tax (see Table 13, applicable on certain products) levied against the sum of the CIF value and the first two duties.
Jamaican Customs "users fee" of J$100 (less than US$3) on all imported shipments.
As a result of Jamaica's status as a juice producer and exporter, the government maintains a complicated tariff schedule for juices with rates ranging from 0-40 percent, depending on the product.
Certain varieties of apple and grape juice, for example, are levied the consumption tax only, while other citrus varieties are charged a 40 percent tariff in addition to stamp and consumption duties.

Distribution and Sales Channels.
There is one port at Hamilton that serves all ocean freight with shipments arriving once or twice a week.
Air freight is expensive (around $0.40/lb) and is expected to increase to as much as $0.80-$0.96/lb due to future cutbacks in airline service.
It is hoped that increased coordination among shippers will make ocean freight more flexible.
For example, weekly food shipments from Salem and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are expected to begin arriving on different days of the week instead of the same day; in effect, wholesalers will be able to rely on two shipments per week instead of one.
Bermuda's supermarkets include The Marketplace, Arnold's, Lindo's Family Foods, The Supermart, Garden Market, Harrington Hundreds and White's.
While a few independent importers operate on the island, most retailers are supplied by a handful of importer/distributors including Butterfield Vallis, BGA Group, A.C.Brewer Distributors, and Viking Food Ltd.
In addition to the retail sector, these groups also handle the majority of food distribution for hotels, restaurants and institutional food buyers.
Table 16 provides a list of selected juices at local supermarkets during a December 1998 survey.

Import Requirements.
There are no specific labeling requirements for imported juices.
The basic requirement for food products across the board is that they conform with the pure food and drug requirements of the country of origin.
Labeling that meets the standards of the product's country of origin is normally accepted in Bermuda.
The import of any food or drink containing cyclamates is prohibited.
Tariffs and Duties.
In Bermuda, juices are subject to a 5 percent tariff.
In addition, all imported goods are also assessed a "wharfage tax," which includes an additional charge of 1.01 percent of value for use of the dock or airport of entry.
There are no VAT or stamp taxes for goods imported to Bermuda.
