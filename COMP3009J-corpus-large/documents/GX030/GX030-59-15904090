What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving it?
All cultivated oilseed sunflower planted around the world has been derived from a limited genetic base, which makes the crop vulnerable to disease and insect pests that can exploit this genetic weakness.
The goal of this project is to produce a genetic map with emphasis on determining the chromosomal location of genes for disease or insect resistance, and other agronomically important genes.
Molecular markers will be developed and used to demonstrate gene flow and transfer of genes from wild species into cultivated lines.
The markers will also be useful in marker-assisted selection for multiple traits as well as for traits difficult to select using conventional approach.
Important genes for agronomic traits will be mapped onto the USDA-ARS public genome map for sunflower and tightly linked markers made available to the public.

How serious is the problem? Why does it matter?
Sunflower ranks as one of the major oilseeds worldwide, and in many countries it constitutes a major source of edible oil for human consumption.
At present, a single gene derived from wild H. petiolaris, is used for hybrid sunflower production world-wide.
Similarly, a limited number of major disease resistance genes and agronomically important genes are being used repeatedly in cultivated lines.
This low genetic diversity in cultivated sunflower makes it vulnerable to new races of pathogens or to new insect pests.
Molecular linkage maps and markers are extremely useful for identification of disease and insect resistance genes and for the characterization of fertility genes used in hybrid seed production.
The markers are also useful for monitoring gene transfer from wild species.

How does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? This project is assigned to National Program 301, Plant, Microbial 
Within National Program 301 the project addresses two program components, Germplasm Enhancement and Manipulation and Genomics and Database Management.
The project allows ARS scientists to develop a molecular linkage map for cultivated sunflower, to integrate trait genes onto the molecular map, to monitor gene transfer from the wild species to the cultivated sunflower, and to develop a marker-assisted selection strategy for sunflower breeding, and provides fundamental new knowledge about the sunflower genome.

What were the most significant accomplishments this past year? A. Single Most Significant Accomplishment during FY 2000 Year: The degree of genetic diversity in USDA sunflower germplasm lines was previously unknown.
To assess the degree of diversity, over 300 RFLP molecular markers were used to evaluate the polymorphism of 23 representative USDA lines at Fargo.
The results demonstrated distinct groups of USDA maintainer and the fertility restoration lines, and high genetic variability among USDA released lines.
The discovery confirmed the high value of USDA germplasm, and demonstrated that RFLP probes are useful for breeding purposes by revealing genetic diversity among germplasm lines.

Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted or actual impact.
A framework RFLP map with 271 markers of 232 cDNA clones was completed using an F2 population derived from a cross of USDA lines RHA271 x HA234.
These gene markers plus a fertility restoration gene, Rf1, defined 20 linkage groups, covering 1164 cM of the sunflower genome.
RAPD markers linked with the vigor restoration genes derived from wild perennial species were identified using isogenic lines.
RAPD markers linked with rust resistance in sunflower lines CM90RR and HAR5 were identified using the bulk segregation method on an F2 population.

What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? Mapping of the rust resistance in CM90RR and HAR5 will be completed early in the year 2001.
Additional resistance gene clusters to rust and downy mildew will be mapped to the USDA RFLP map.
This project terminates May 2001.

What science and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the constraints, if known, to the adoption 
The cooperation is expected to yield genetic information on drought tolerance, and useful drought tolerant germplasm will be jointly released to the public for breeding purposes.
Special cooperation with the Institute of Sustainable Agriculture, Cordoba, Spain, focused on the gene transfer of broomrape resistance, including gene mapping for resistance.
All the resistance material from this cooperation will be made publicly available.
Due to the urgent situation of new broomrape race(s) spreading, germplasm will be released as early as possible.
Molecular markers linked to the resistance will help breeding selection in areas where the new broomrape races are not available.
