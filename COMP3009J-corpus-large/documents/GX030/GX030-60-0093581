Scientific Publications
1.
What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving it? The viability of the sunflower industry in the U.S. requires the development of diverse sources of sunflower germplasm with traits leading to improvements in production capacity.
The most important traits at present are those used in creating hybrids that produce new, innovative vegetable oils for the frying food industry, and disease resistance to pathogens causing major economic damage to sunflower in the U.S.
Also, it is important to monitor pathogen severity in the North Central and High Plains areas to identify new pathogens/races and to investigate alternatives to genetic disease resistance.
Germplasm is being developed with mid-oleic levels, low saturated fatty acids, and disease resistance to Sclerotinia, downy mildew, and Phomopsis.
Biological and chemical control options are being investigated as control supplements to genetic resistance for diseases such as Sclerotinia wilt and downy mildew.

2.
How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? The development of new, innovative vegetable oils for the frying food industry will improve human nutrition by lowering the saturated acid content and increasing the monounsaturated acid content.
The increased monounsaturated content will decrease the hydrogenation requirement which in turn leads to lower trans fatty acids, a human nutrition concern.
The oxidative stability is important to industry due to increased use time of the oil and shelf life of the product.
Cultivated sunflower presently in production has been bred to be immune or tolerant to several main diseases.
However, changes in the disease organisms could allow the pathogen to overcome the plant's genetic resistance mechanism.
The monitoring of changes in disease pathogens will stimulate both the development of germplasm with resistance to new races and other control alternatives.
Sclerotinia wilt continues to cause the greatest yield loss due to any disease, and while high levels of resistance have been incorporated into released USDA lines, current commercial hybrids still lack high levels of Sclerotinia resistance because of the polygenic nature of this resistance.

How does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? This project is assigned to National Program 301, Plant Microbial 
This project allows ARS scientists to identify and incorporate genes into sunflower germplasm and to create genetic diversity for agronomic, quality, and disease resistant traits.
The pathology portion of this project allows scientists to identify and characterize genes for disease resistance from cultivated sunflower and wild Helianthus species to enhance opportunities for developing host plant resistance.
Combining genetic resistance with improved cultural practices and biological control will lead to integrated disease management that will be cost-effective and ecologically-based.

What were the most significant accomplishments this past year? A.
The U.S. frying industry desires a modified sunflower oil containing 50-60% monounsaturated fatty acids in seed produced by a sunflower hybrid with high yield, high oil content, and good agronomic characteristics.
Crosses were made between USDA maintainer (female) and restorer (male) lines having a mid-oleic fatty acid profile to produce hybrid seed.
These hybrids were successful in producing the NuSun type of sunflower oil desired by the frying industry, and had high yield, acceptable oil content and excellent resistance to prevalent diseases.
The germplasm was released to industry and public research programs to develop hybrids and parental lines with the NuSun quality characteristics.
B.
Other Significant Accomplishments: The downy mildew fungus has developed complete tolerance to the fungicide metalaxyl, which all seed companies have come to depend upon for control of the disease.
After testing over 30 fungicides in greenhouse trials, we identified three fungicides which will control the metalaxyl-resistant strain of downy mildew, and additionally demonstrated that USDA-released germplasm lines (HA 335 to RHA 340) continue to exhibit total immunity to all races and all strains of downy mildew.
Field testing in summer 2000 of the three fungicides, alone and in various combinations, was done at 25 sites in ND, SD, MN, TX, Manitoba and Hungary, with the aid of university and industry cooperators, and residue trials were done with zoximide-treated seed to expedite full registration via R-4.
Seed companies can use USDA sunflower germplasm to transfer genetic resistance to their proprietary germplasm, and once a new fungicide(s) is registered for seed treatment, growers will again have inexpensive, environmentally safe protection against downy mildew.
A new virus disease of sunflower was discovered in Texas and there are no known sources of resistance.
The virus was fully characterized, with the aid of virologists from Idaho and USDA-BARC, and the host range found to be restricted to sunflower and zinnia.
Resistance to the sunflower mosaic virus was found in wild sunflower collected from Texas (and maintained at the USDA Plant Introduction Station in Iowa), and is being transferred into the best USDA sunflower germplasm.
The planned germplasm releases will not only have virus resistance, but will be the first germplasm to also contain immunity to all races of rust and all races of downy mildew, allowing seed companies to use one parental line to achieve resistance to three diseases at once.
C. Significant Accomplishments/Activities that Support Special Target Populations:

Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted or actual impact.
Wild sunflower accessions were identified with resistance to imidazolinone class herbicides and those accessions were crossed with USDA germplasm lines to incorporate resistance.
Three of these germplasm lines were released to industry to provide hybrid development.
ARS hybrid seed with imidazolinone resistance was developed and planted in experimental plots to begin the registration process.
The potential for these hybrids to increase production could be considerable due to lack of registered herbicides for broad-leaf weed control for hybrid sunflower production.
NuSun maintainer lines were developed and released to industry to create hybrids with a mid-oleic level.
A new misting system was established at Carrington, ND, and will aid in cooperative research efforts with North Dakota State University to test both commercial hybrids and USDA breeding material for resistance to Sclerotinia head rot, which will ultimately lead to the release of sunflower germplasm with both head rot and stalk rot resistance.

What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? During FY 2001, the inheritance of imidazolinone class herbicide resistance will be determined.
During FY 2002 and FY 2003, lines with the imidazolinone herbicide resistance will be incorporated with the NuSun oleic quality characteristic in germplasm lines.
During FY 2001, FY 2002, and FY 2003, gamma tocopherol will be incorporated into NuSun genotypes to etermine if stability of the NuSun oil can be increased under frying conditions.
In FY 2001 a new fungicide seed treatment, consisting of two chemicals with different modes of action, will be registered for use on sunflower.
In FY 2002 new sources of multi-race downy mildew immunity, identified in wild sunflower, will be released in USDA germplasm along with resistance to rust and Sclerotinia.
We expect that by FY 2003, improved levels of resistance to both head rot and stalk rot caused by Sclerotinia will be found in wild annual or perennial sunflowers, crossed into cultivated sunflower and released.

What science and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to the adoption 
The end-users of the NuSun product are the frying food industry and consumers.
A complete conversion of the sunflower crop from the traditional to NuSun is in progress, these releases will be important in helping the industry achieve that conversion.
Release of imidazolinone herbicide resistant maintainer and restorer lines to industry will allow producers to plant sunflower hybrids and apply a herbicide that controls many broad-leaf weeds.
The impact on increasing production could be considerable due to lack of registered herbicides for hybrid sunflower production.
Meetings were organized with seed and chemical company personnel to share information about the development of downy mildew resistance to metalaxyl seed treatment, and to coordinate research efforts to identify new fungicides to replace metalaxyl.
Information about disease resistance, specifically against Sclerotinia head rot and stalk rot, was published in a North Dakota State University extension bulletin, which reaches both seed industry personnel and growers.
Results of evaluations of wild and cultivated sunflower from the USDA Plant Introduction collection were entered into the GRIN computer database, accessible world-wide via the Internet.
