Launching Women Lobbyists: A Workshop for Citizens, is a program of the Kentucky Commission on Women (KCW) and was designed to educate women on the legislative process in Kentucky and provide them with the skills to become more effective participants and citizens.
Betsy Nowland-Curry, executive director of KCW, said, "This workshop is yet another step in the effort to increase the economic status of Kentucky women.
Legislators and other elected officials need to hear from Kentucky women.
Participants received valuable information and were encouraged to stay informed and get involved in public issues of interest to them."
The agenda included a presentation on the importance of women in the political process by Carolyn Bratt of the University of Kentucky College of Law.
A staff person from the Legislative Research Commission spoke about the basics of the legislative process in Kentucky, and KCW staff introduced participants to resources they could use to follow legislation and communicate with legislators.
Participants also received advice from a panel of professional and volunteer lobbyists and a panel of Kentucky's women legislators.
