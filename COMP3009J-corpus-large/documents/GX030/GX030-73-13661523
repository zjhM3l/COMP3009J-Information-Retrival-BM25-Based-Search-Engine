Results of the MTPE Solid Earth and Natural Hazards Research and Applications NRA Basic and applied research in natural hazards is identified in the Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) Science Plan as one of five specific research themes for focused investments of program resources during the next 5 years.
The Natural Hazards Research and Applications theme applies MTPE science and technology to hazard characterization and risk reduction from natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, floods, droughts, severe storms and coastal hazards.
The overall objectives of the Program are to: * Understand earth processes which can lead to natural disasters, and improve risk assessment capability for vulnerable regions * Utilize existing, planned, or develop new technology and techniques to aid in understanding hazardous earth processes, risk assessment, and disaster characterization * Establish NASA relationships with disaster management practitioners * Coordinate with international space agencies in programs of research, observation, and flight projects related to natural hazards
In March, 1997 NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) announced the results of the first annual Solid Earth and Natural Hazards Research and Applications Research Announcement (NRA-MTPE-1996-05).
This announcement addresses the natural hazards research theme.
Proposals were received in 6 broad categories including; wildfire observation, analysis and modeling; coastal hazard, sea level change, and riverine flooding research and analysis; geological applications of MTPE remote sensing data; planetary-scale geophysical observation and analysis; regional surface deformation and seismic hazards; and volcanic hazards.
The proposals selected for support focus on the use of NASA space geodetic and remote sensing technology to improve our understanding of the physical dynamics of the solid earth (including its interaction with the atmosphere, ocean, and fluid core) and improve and demonstrate the capability of this technology in the assessment and mitigation of natural hazards.
