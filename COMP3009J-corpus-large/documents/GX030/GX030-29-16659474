(New and improved technologies and approaches for contraceptive methods and family planning identified, developed, tested, evaluated and disseminated), 936-SS01.1 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $28,345,000 DA INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: To build the scientific and technological base for successful, high quality family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH) programs by identifying, developing, testing, evaluating and disseminating new and improved methods and approaches for effectively delivering FP and RH services.
The ultimate beneficiaries will be the women and men of reproductive age in developing countries who will have greater access to quality FP/RH information and services.
The increased availability of technologies will also benefit consumers in the United States and other industrialized countries.
Key Results: Four key sub-results are necessary to achieve the objective of SSO1.1: (1) new and improved products, strategies and technologies developed and evaluated; (2) enhanced understanding of issues contributing to change of reproductive intention and behavior; (3) improved knowledge-base for understanding, setting priorities, and applying new or improved technologies and approaches; and (4) products, tools, technologies, approaches, and knowledge transferred in a form that can be received, utilized and sustained.
Performance and Prospects: Performance over the past year has met or exceeded the planned results.
In FY 1998, achievements in contraceptive development included the submission of Femcap, a female barrier method, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval.
Several products advanced to the next stage of development including: completion of a phase II clinical trial of a vaginal hormonal ring; completion of a safety and acceptability trial of a long-acting hormonal method for men; and the completion of the pre-clinical evaluation of spermicidal/microbicidal compounds to be tested in human safety studies in 1999.
Many products are in early stages of development, including methods to provide protection from both unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI), and HIV/AIDS.
An inherent problem with this component of the SSO is the lack of strong commercial sector involvement due to liability issues, FDA requirements, and the low profit margin that can be made in less-developed countries; this necessitates a high level of public sector involvement in research and development activities.
Operations research (OR) has designed new tools for assessing the availability and quality of FP services and has developed solutions to critical global service delivery problems.
A major emphasis has been placed on scaling up of successful approaches.
The 1998 publication of a monograph detailing the findings from situation analyses in 11 countries in Africa demonstrated the diagnostic role OR can play; these results were used in country programs to identify new interventions aimed at strengthening service delivery systems.
The volume was distributed to Missions and will be used as a reference in the evaluation of the quality of FP programs.
OR evaluated the feasibility and impact of integration of treatment of STI and prevention services with FP services; pilot programs in Latin America and Kenya illustrated that women with adequate information are able to assess their own risk of STIs and pregnancy and often make more appropriate choices than service providers.
A study on male involvement demonstrated that male community-based distributors, community and religious workers, and organizations for men can be very effective in increasing FP use and preventing STIs.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: USAID's research portfolio is opportunity-driven and reflects the best interests of the public sector and its beneficiaries.
During the course of product development or service delivery research, it is not uncommon to encounter obstacles in manufacturing or partnerships, and it is difficult to predict the ultimate success of a product or strategy in the early stages of research.
Other Donor Programs: Grantees work with assistance from and in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health in technology development and evaluation, epidemiology and social science research.
Several private foundations, including Mellon, Rockefeller, and others, maximize USAID's investments by supporting complementary research.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: Grantees include The Population Council, Family Health International, Eastern Virginia Medical School, other cooperating agencies, universities, research institutions, and host country organizations.

(Improved policy environment and increased global resources for family planning programs), 936-SS01.2 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $28,345,000 DA INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: USAID central programs promote a supportive policy environment for the cost-effective provision of family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) services and the expansion of contraceptive use.
Performance on this policy objective has been positive, as many governments have updated and modified policies to support RH. Resources have increased in several key countries.
The ultimate beneficiaries are women of reproductive age in assisted developing countries; intermediate beneficiaries include government health department and nongovernmental organizations that advocate for RH.
Key Results: Activities focus on: (1) formulation and implementation of operational policies relating to FP/RH and removal of barriers to service availability; (2) increasing total financial and human resources for FP/RH; and (3) rational allocation of human and financial resources in the population, health and nutrition sector to have maximum impact in achieving sector goals.
Performance and Prospects: USAID's investments in policy dialogue and policy reform have contributed to the development of formal population policies in more than 30 countries, helped convince policy makers of the economic benefits of FP programs to society and to improved well-being at the family and individual level, and resulted in increased participation by the private sector.
In the past year, as a result of policy dialogue and advocacy, resource allocations increased.
The Ministry of Health in Romania approved funding and created a line item for family planning under the national budget; and the Prime Minister of Turkey directed the Ministry of Health to mobilize government funds for public sector procurement of contraceptives.
Also in the past year, strategic plans were developed with USAID technical assistance in Egypt, Morocco, and Nepal.
Formal political support for population programs was obtained in the Philippines when two governors signed executive orders of support, and free radio time was donated to disseminate population information.
In Haiti, parliamentarians called for a national population policy.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: As the world's largest cohort ever of adolescents reaches their reproductive years, some 900 million women in the developing world, excluding China, will be of reproductive age.
To expand the level of service delivery necessary to meet this growing demand, renewed advocacy efforts and appropriate RH policies will be ever more critical.
In addition, assessment of progress in the five years since the Cairo conference may suggest more attention to financing of FP/RH programs.
Other Donor Programs: USAID coordinates and collaborates with other donors such as the World Bank, International Planned Parenthood Foundation, United Nations Population Fund, and bilateral donors such as the Department for International Development which also provide funds and technical assistance.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID implements activities through The Futures Group International, U.S. Bureau of the Census, the National Academy of Sciences, Management Sciences for Health, and the Population Reference Bureau.

[Enhanced capacity for national programs (public, private, nongovernmental organization and community-based institutions) to design, implement, finance, and evaluate sustainable family planning programs], 936-SS01.3 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $28,345,000 DA INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: USAID is working to improve the technical and programmatic capabilities and planning and budgeting decisions that impact the quality of family planning (FP) services provided and the number of users reached.
The ultimate beneficiaries are women and men of reproductive age in developing countries who will have greater access to quality FP information and services.
Key Results: Activities focus on strengthening the capabilities of family planning provider organizations and their staff to (a) design, monitor, finance and evaluate their programs; (b) manage more effectively by improving business and marketing skills, and developing strategies for increasing cost recovery and financial sustainability; and (c) collaborate to use limited resources efficiently, and to reach underserved groups.
Funding is channeled through both U.S. and local nongovernmental organizations with the ultimate goal of program sustainability.
Performance and Prospects: USAID has been working to improve the technical and management capacity and the financial self-reliance of over 100 national family planning and reproductive health institutions in developing countries.
To date, 40 institutions have been assessed in 25 countries.
The assessment is a management diagnosis of the institution's mission, structure, strategies and management systems for each of 12 essential management components.
Following the assessment a management action plan is developed to address the management deficiencies identified.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Family planning institutions must become stronger and more efficient to keep up with both population growth and rising demand.
The need for well-trained staff and well-managed FP organizations is greater than ever.
In 2000 a new state-of-the-art FP/reproductive health (RH) management and leadership program will be launched which will increase the availability of sustainable, quality FP/RH services .
Other Donor Programs: USAID works closely with United Nations Population Fund, International Planned Parenthood Federation, Department for International Development, Pan American Health Organization and the World Bank.

(Increased access to, quality of, cost-effectiveness of, and motivation for use of family planning, breastfeeding, and selected reproductive health information and services), 936-SS01.4 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $56,691,000 DA INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: USAID is working to improve the ability of information and service delivery systems to respond effectively to existing demand for family planning (FP) and related reproductive health (RH) information and services and increase FP awareness, community empowerment, and demand for such services and information.
The ultimate beneficiaries are women and men of reproductive age in developing countries who will have greater access to quality FP information and services, and children up to five years old in developing countries who will have improved health because of improved birth spacing.
Key Results: Activities focus on expanding service-delivery points, enhancing quality by promoting a client-centered orientation, improving contraceptive logistics, and ensuring the existence of appropriate norms, and expanding cost-effective approaches to implementation of services, including training in cost management.
Activities also include increasing women's and community empowerment and demand for services by improving communications with clients and communities, and strengthening linkages between FP and integrated women's health services, hygiene, and other programs.
Performance and Prospects: Major innovations to expand access and quality of care pioneered by USAID include community-based distribution, contraceptive social marketing, mobilization of private sector service delivery, and client-centered services.
Between April and September 1998, Pathfinder International reached over 1.0 million new FP users and Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, Inc.
(CARE) managed 46 projects in 33 countries offering a package of services, including FP, RH, maternal health and STD/HIV.
The Focus on Young Adults project has provided global technical leadership in documenting lessons learned in meeting the RH needs of youth in more than 15 countries.
The improving Nutrition and Reproductive Health (LINKAGES) project is providing training in women's nutrition, the Lactational Amenorrhea Method, breastfeeding, and weaning practices in 11 countries, enhancing birth spacing which directly effects infant and maternal mortality rates.
In FY 1998, The John Snow Inc.
(SEATS) project expanded quality FP/RH services by providing technical assistance to more than 490 urban and rural service delivery sites, in 10 countries.
The Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) is continuing their successful expansion of FP/RH nongovernmental organization (NGO) service delivery activities in conjunction with democracy and governance initiatives in Nigeria, leading to increased access, choice, demand and community empowerment.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Family planning services have to expand rapidly to keep up with both population growth and rising demand.
By the year 2000, nearly 900 million women in the developing world, excluding China, will be in their reproductive years.
Hence, the need for expanded, higher quality FP/RH services is greater than ever.
In 1999 a new state-of-the-art FP/RH information and service delivery program will be launched which will increase the use of sustainable, quality FP/RH services through clinical and non-clinical programs.
Other Donor Programs: USAID works closely with United Nations Population Fund, International Planned Parenthood Federation, Department for International Development, Pan American Health Organization, and the World Bank.
Host country partners, including national and local governments, private sector entities, NGOs, and community organizations, have primary responsibility for program implementation.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID implements activities through Pathfinder International, CARE, Association for Voluntary and Safe Contraception, John Snow Inc., CEDPA, and other cooperating agencies, U.S. private voluntary organizations, private companies, and host country institutions.

PROGRAM: Central Programs TITLE AND NUMBER: Increased use of key maternal health and nutrition interventions.
(Effective and appropriate maternal health and nutrition interventions and approaches identified, developed, evaluated and disseminated), 936-SS02.1 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing (SSO2.1 revised in FY 1998) PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $5,250,000 CS INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: A critical need exists in developing countries for state-of-the-art technical assistance, information on best practices, and evaluation of approaches to promote maternal/ neonatal health and to prevent maternal/neonatal mortality.
The purpose of this activity is to identify, develop, evaluate and disseminate interventions and approaches that enhance delivery and utilization of antepartum, safe delivery, postpartum, neonatal care, and services for the management of life-threatening maternal and neonatal complications including postabortion care.
Beneficiaries include pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns in developing countries.
Key Results: Key results include: (1) developing approaches to improve maternal/neonatal survival; (2) assessing the costs and effectiveness of service delivery approaches; (3) developing new approaches for the detection and/or treatment of anemia and sexually transmitted infections; and (4) developing indicators of progress in maternal health and nutrition programming.
Performance and Prospects: Research is focused on filling critical gaps in knowledge related to the design and implementation of cost-effective maternal/neonatal health programs.
Recent achievements include: (1) implementing curricula for obstetrical skills training in life-saving skills (Indonesia, Egypt); (2) developing easy to use spreadsheet models to assist health planners in developing countries to determine the costs of essential maternal and neonatal services (Kenya and Bolivia); (3) determining the costs to consumers for maternal and reproductive health services and how service utilization varies in the public versus private sector according to price, location and quality of service provision (Ghana, Uganda, Malawi and Indonesia); (4) identifying, field-testing and implementing new approaches to developing and improving community-based iron supplement distribution and counseling strategies aimed at preventing and reducing maternal anemia (Indonesia, India, Malawi, Guatemala, Bolivia, Honduras); (5) assessing alternative methods of monitoring progress in reducing the number of maternal and neonatal deaths at country level and validating process indicators for measuring improvements in health services delivery.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: With the revision of the SSO2 strategy to strengthen the focus on interventions directly related to events surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, USAID will be better able to focus activities in the countries where high maternal/neonatal mortality occurs.
The revised SSO2 strategy is being implemented as planned.
A new program has been awarded and will be the centerpiece of USAIDs effort to promote maternal/neonatal survival in developing countries.
Additionally, regional initiatives are being implemented in Latin American/Caribbean and Africa to stimulate and enhance maternal/neonatal programs in participating countries.
In FY 2000 results will be obtained from studies currently in progress on vitamin A and its effect on postpartum and neonatal sepsis in Indonesia, and on the impact on maternal/neonatal survival of presumptive treatment of sexually transmitted infections in pregnant women in Uganda.
In Thailand, the cost-effectiveness of two models of antenatal care will be assessed as part of a WHO multi-centered trial.
Additionally, research will continue to focus on alternative methods of monitoring progress in reducing the number of maternal deaths and on the development and field-testing of new, inexpensive technologies for resource-poor settings to screen for sexually transmitted infections (a major cause of neonatal mortality).

Summary: Health policy and systems reform is essential to lay the foundation for sustainable programs and to correct deficiencies in supplies, logistics and emergency communications and transport.
Appropriate standards of practice, training and quality assurance mechanisms must be in place to guide the delivery of services.
Barriers to the provision of services must be reduced or eliminated.
The purpose of this activity is to improve policies and increase public and private sector resources and capacity to deliver maternal/neonatal health and nutrition services.
Beneficiaries include pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns in developing countries.
Key Results: Key results include: (1) broadened political commitment to maternal/neonatal survival including increased and sustainable public and private sector resources for maternal/neonatal health and nutrition; (2) increased adoption of appropriate policies and standards of practice and processes for assuring quality of care; (3) improved infrastructure for meeting the health services needs of pregnant and postpartum women and newborns.
Additionally, USAID has developed constituencies for maternal/neonatal health and nutrition with governments, non-governmental organizations, universities, womens groups, other donors and cooperating partners.
Performance and Prospects: In the area of advocacy and political commitment, USAID worked with several multilateral organizations to ensure consistent policy and messages related to maternal-child transmission of HIV via breastfeeding.
USAID supported the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing a "Baby-Friendly" certification process for hospitals and mobilized efforts toward development of advocacy for "Mother-Friendly Societies".
In Nepal, a national network of 60 organizations worked together with donors, USAID cooperating agencies and the government to promote maternal health.
In the areas of promoting policies for quality care and improving infrastructure, policy reformulation in Ghana resulted in authorization of midwives to provide more comprehensive essential obstetrical care.
In Bolivia, as a result of a seroprevalence study, new policies and practices for prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women and newborns were adopted.
Throughout Central America, evaluation of the nutrient content of donated and commercial foods has led to improved policy guidance for package content, manufacturing techniques and packaging in private and public sector food programs.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In FY 2000 efforts will be accelerated to improve the performance of health systems in developing countries.
Improved performance implies supply outcomes (improved access to services, quality, efficiency/effectiveness, and sustainability) and demand outcomes (improved practices and strengthened community participation) in four areas: nutritional status, birth preparedness, safe delivery, postpartum and newborn care, and management of complications.

Summary: Communities must take charge of their own health.
This involves creating demand for services and identifying local solutions to local problems through information-education-communication and community mobilization strategies.
The purposes of this activity are to improve community awareness about maternal/neonatal health and nutrition, and to involve communities in the planning and implementation of programs that effect change.
Beneficiaries include pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns in developing countries.
Key Results: Key results include: (1) increased womens and families knowledge of maternal/neonatal health and nutrition needs; (2) Improved community health systems and resources for, and linkages between preventive, curative and emergency services; (3) expanded womens and community participation in the design, implementation and evaluation of maternal health and nutrition programs; (4) increased mens and community knowledge of and demand for services and activities to improve maternal/neonatal health care and nutrition programs in their communities.
Performance and Prospects: In Guatemala, Bolivia and Indonesia behavior change communication strategies have been developed, based on the results of community assessment of local problems.
The assessments identified feasible actions that might be taken by women, their husbands and relatives in the event of an obstetrical emergency.
The communications strategies promoted the "local solutions" as well as preventive behaviors for pregnant women.
Results of community diagnoses in these countries pointed to a major deficiency among health personnel in communicating respectfully with women.
This proved to be a major barrier to the use of services.
Interpersonal communications modules were developed using country-specific content.
In Indonesia 525 village-based midwives in South Kalimantan were trained.
Following training in Guatemala and Bolivia, several community customs were incorporated into patient care at hospitals in order to reduce barriers to care.
As part of a behavior change strategy in Bolivia, a radio soap opera, "Destinys Diary", was developed to increase community awareness of the danger signs of pregnancy, labor and delivery, as well as appropriate and timely actions.
The 60 chapter soap opera was aired at prime time by five radio stations.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In FY 2000, increased emphasis will be placed on information-education-communication to increase both the demand and supply of maternal/neonatal health and nutrition services.
Grassroots womens organizations, non-governmental organizations, and district health committees will be mobilized to: (1) recognize emergencies; (2) develop emergency transport systems; and (3) respond to obstetric and neonatal emergencies.
Similarly, more emphasis will be placed on community self-assessment and developing linkages between health services and communities they serve.
Mechanisms for strengthening community-level service delivery will be tested and scaled up.

Summary: Most developing countries lack quality maternal/neonatal health services.
Barriers to implementation include lack of trained personnel, deployment of trained personnel, lack of motivation on the part of facility staff, inadequate supervision of staff, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment and commodities, ineffective supply systems, and inadequate referral and transport systems.
The purpose of this activity is to expand quality essential services to reach a greater proportion of the population of women and infants in developing countries.
Beneficiaries include pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns in developing countries.
Key Results: Key results include: (1) development of quality assurance systems based on appropriate practices and standards, provider accountability, culturally-attuned services, and client satisfaction; (2) expansion of capacity and capability of programs and services to provide safe pregnancy, birth, essential obstetric, postpartum and post-abortion care; and (3) strengthened health worker performance through pre-service education and in-service training in essential maternal health care skills.
Performance and Prospects: Changes in attitudes and knowledge among health care providers led to changes in contraceptive behavior, for example, in the use of the lactational amenorrhea method and progestin-only pills.
Competency-based training programs incorporating clinical and interpersonal communications and counseling skills are underway in Bolivia, Indonesia, Guatemala, Ukraine and Moldova.
In Bolivia the curriculum developed for in-service training will become part of pre-service training education in two major medical faculties.
In South Kalimantan Indonesia two life-saving skills training centers have been established with over 250 midwives trained.
A special postpartum care emphasis has been part of this training among village-based midwives, with four visits planned immediately postpartum an innovation in routine maternity care.
A Maternal and Perinatal Audit system was established in three districts in Guatemala to identify and review cases of maternal and perinatal deaths from the community and health facilities.
This activity helped to improve maternal health services by increasing knowledge among providers.
In Russia, as a result of reproductive health training courses, the proportion of mothers breastfeeding for at least three months increased from 46 percent to 58 percent and rooming-in is now practiced by approximately 95 percent of women at nine maternity hospitals in one region (Primorsky krai).
In Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia, a program to train neonatologists has overcome obstacles to the initiation of immediate postpartum breastfeeding.
Use of rooming-in rose from zero to 86 percent in one municipal maternity hospital.
In Nepal a successful maternal health care activity piloted in the national Maternity Hospital has been replicated in two additional referral hospitals, with an emphasis on provision of quality family planning counseling and on-site provision of services.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In FY 2000, increased emphasis will be placed on strengthening health systems and expanding coverage through building on existing institutions and on what is already working in countries.
Donor coordination and complementary approaches will be expanded as well as coordination among non-governmental organizations and private voluntary organizations.

(New and improved cost-effective child survival interventions developed and disseminated), 936-SS03.1 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $9,868,000 CS INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996; ESTIMATED COMPLETION: Continuing
Summary: This encompasses the research and development capabilities of USAIDs Office of Health and Nutrition.
Key technologies have been targeted based on the technical review of child survival priorities, an assessment of needs, and an objective appraisal of potential for success.
The pursuit of new tools such as new vaccines, vaccine vial monitors and new diagnostics, represent a discreet set of technological priorities which can have a global impact and are achievable in a reasonable timeframe.
The integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) represents a global approach to the prevention of illness and the cure of the sick child and will be pursued globally in cooperation with our bilateral and multilateral donors.
If instituted at the community and facility levels, IMCI can improve child survival worldwide.
Key Results: USAID's child survival funding supports two types of research: (1) new child survival technologies, strategies and products, including new vaccines, treatment regimens and nutritional supplements; and (2) new approaches for child survival, including ways to improve delivery of child survival interventions and better ways to evaluate the success of child survival programs.
USAID will initiate evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the integrated management of childhood illness strategy in field settings, and will support evaluation and introduction of new vaccines against pneumonia and rotavirus diarrhea, development of vial monitors for vaccines other than polio, and development of interventions to reduce or treat life-threatening illnesses of newborns.
Performance and Prospects: USAID has achieved global leadership in child survival research.
USAID provided critical support in early research to develop oral rehydration therapy as an effective treatment for diarrheal disease in infants and children, and in disseminating knowledge and use of this technique worldwide, contributing directly to saving millions of lives.
USAID supported original research on how vitamin A deficiency not only causes child mortality, but contributes to higher rates of maternal mortality and developed new diagnostic techniques for malaria and vitamin A deficiency.
USAID has provided sustained support for developing new vaccines against acute respiratory infection and malaria as well as safer, more efficient childhood immunization instruments and techniques.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Research and development of new methods and technologies often present new opportunities and directions during implementation.
The new and improved cost-effective child survival interventions cited in this data sheet are key interventions at present.
Future flexibility in technical innovation must be maintained in order to promote the greatest impact on child survival over the medium term.

Summary: USAID, with the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), is helping countries identify and develop policies that represent cost-effective approaches to address major threats to the survival and health of infants and children.
Increasing the host country's efficiency and effectiveness will ensure that USAID's investments in child survival are sustained.
Key Results: USAID will carry out technical assessment and policy dialogue to strengthen polices for malaria, vitamin A, and other basic child health interventions.
USAID will also continue to interact with resource allocation and health sector reform to assure greatest benefit to child health and survival: national health accounts will be used to support resource allocation for child health in over twenty countries, and maternal child health insurance approaches will be developed and evaluated in Latin America.
Cost-effectiveness analyses will be developed for vitamin A and other interventions, and approaches to finance current and new vaccines will be developed.
Partnerships with private voluntary organizations (PVOs) will be expanded to strengthen technical approaches at the community level and in decentralized health systems, and commercial private sector partnerships will be expanded for production and distribution of child health products including oral rehydration salts, vitamin A-fortified foods, insecticide treated bednets, and soap for handwashing.
Performance and Prospects: This result is being achieved through four approaches: (1) applying technical analyses based on state-of-the-art approaches to encourage the development of appropriate policies and programs; (2) carrying out analysis, policy dialogue and advocacy to promote sector reform, improved decision-making, regulatory action and commitment to child survival activities; (3) developing sustainable financing and management approaches to increase and improve host country resource allocations for child survival activities; and (4) developing partnerships that increase accessibility, efficiency and quality of child survival goods and services.
These approaches have already proven successful in many settings: USAID has supported development of new policies combatting resistance to important antibiotics and antimalarial drugs, provided international leadership to identify financing approaches for new children's vaccines, and increased working partnerships with PVOs, other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and private providers of goods and services such as oral rehydration salts.
There are increasing needs and opportunities to expand these approaches in USAID-assisted countries.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: USAID programs will continue to focus on these key areas over the next five years.
Regional and national level adjustments will be considered over time, as political, economic and technical development proceeds.

Summary: To maintain technical leadership, USAID has supported ground-breaking activities in refining, adapting and applying social marketing approaches to promoting better health and nutrition behavior change.
As a result, modern communication methodologies are being employed by essentially all components of child survival programs, including care seeking, nutrition, malaria prevention (through the use of bed nets), immunization, oral rehydration, breastfeeding, handwashing and other program elements.
USAID's experiences have shown that small additional investments -- about 10% -- in information, education and communication can assure greater impact of the Agency's child health and nutrition programs in developing countries.
Key Results: To reduce infant and child mortality, USAID is supporting social marketing behavioral approaches to enhance knowledge and use of key child health and nutrition practices and behaviors in selected countries.
Activities focus on improving four areas of behavior change: (1) knowledge and use of preventive behavior at the household and community levels; (2) home treatment and correct care-seeking when child illness occurs; (3) client-provider relationships; and, (4) synthesizing, adapting and disseminating effective communication strategies and approaches.
USAID will expand its interaction with communications agencies such as Voice of America and British Broadcasting Corporation World, to introduce increased child health content into international broadcasting, and will also increase the child health and nutritional content of local media in USAID-assisted countries.
USAID will work with private voluntary organizations and other partners to increase community involvement in key child health areas such as detection of polio cases, mobilization for immunization and vitamin A supplementation, and prevention, home care, and appropriate care-seeking for respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and illnesses of newborn infants.
USAID will analyze and adapt innovative communication and behavior change approaches, such as peer group methods and new media strategies, to increase knowledge and use of key child health and nutrition practices.
Performance and Prospects:Significant progress has been made in increasing individual and community awareness of disease and modes of infection.
For example, use of oral rehydration therapy now occurs in roughly half of child diarrhea episodes, demand for polio and other immunization has increased, and increasing numbers of communities have been mobilized to improve recognition and care of sick children.
However, maximizing the preventive and curative behaviors associated with reducing morbidity and mortality has been slower to realize.
This activity will focus on changing normative behavior to improve child survival.
Areas of emphasis will include vitamin A intake, promotion of breastfeeding, supplementary feeding and care of the infant, improving maternal nutrition, and basic hygiene.
The outlook for success is reasonable, but will require targeted investments over the medium term in order to establish positive normative change.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: The behavior change arena is an expanding sphere of interest and importance relative to the sustained implementation of key child survival interventions.
Promoting innovative behavior change and communication interventions will require a flexible program that can draw on success, and replicate progress across geographic regions.
Options for adjusting program priorities will be maintained because of the nature of behavior change and the importance of recognizing what works and does not work for specific regions and populations.
Creating positive normative behavior for key child survival priorities such as immunizations, disease recognition and care seeking will take time and will require a range of insightful and flexible approaches.

Summary: USAID has been a leader in systematically addressing the areas of improved quality of child health and nutrition services.
USAID contributions have included the widespread application of operations research and quality assurance techniques to improve child health services, the development of methods to improve availability of essential drugs and commodities like oral rehydration salts, and the support of improved training approaches for health workers.
The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness protocol, developed by USAID, United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), and the World Health Organization (WHO), is being implemented in over 20 countries, revolutionizing the training and provision of child survival services.
USAID is assisting in the eradication of polio in over 60 countries.
Worldwide polio eradication will strengthen child health systems and eventually save over $230 million annually in the United States.
Future horizons include accelerated measles control, reducing deaths in newborns and infants, and controlling respiratory disease.
Key Results:To improve the quality and availability of key child health and nutrition services, activities in both the public and private sectors will focus on: (1) improved quality of prevention and treatment services for children; (2) improved planning, organization and management of health and nutrition services; (3) increased access to health and nutrition services, especially for high- risk children; (4) increased availability and distribution of child health vaccines, drugs and commodities; (5) strengthened capability of institutions and communities to provide environmental health services; and, (6) improved use of information for managing child survival services.
Illustrative key results include: increased appropriate treatment of diarrheas, respiratory infection, and malaria; 80 percent of children receiving Vitamin A in priority countries; strengthened implementation of Polio Eradication and measles control initiatives, and improved infant and child feeding in key countries.
Performance and Prospects:USAID has been a global leader in achieving improvements in child health and survival through approaches that build sustainable capabilities.
This has included the adaptation of quality assurance approaches to child health services, systematic improvements in countries capability to provide and manage drugs and vaccines, and improved use of information to achieve results and to reach families in greatest need.
The improved delivery of child survival services will depend upon an extended commitment by governments, donors and multilateral agencies.
The interventions and results mentioned above depict a reasonable set of interventions and targets that can be respectively implemented and achieved in the medium term.
The interventions directly influence child survival and are aimed at the major killers of children worldwide.
Although the technical interventions are understood, bringing those interventions to wide segments of populations in need remains a challenge.
Furthermore, sustaining the interventions will require long-term policy commitments by host governments over time.
The present program builds on the success of our past child survival programs and focusses on the major causes of death in children under five years of age.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Program interventions will remain flexible, however, this targeted approach which focuses on the major killers of children under five years will be maintained over the medium term.
Variations relative to strategic interventions such as accelerated measles control, community-based integrated management of childhood illness, and respiratory disease control will require adjustments over time, but the focus on these major problems and service delivery will remain Agency child survival priorities.

(Increase quality, availability, and demand for information and services to change sexual risk behaviors and cultural norms in order to reduce transmission of HIV), 936-SSO4.1 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $8,937,000 CS INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1997; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: 2002
Summary: Recent data from Zambia, where 20% of all adults are infected with HIV/AIDS, illustrates the importance of this activity.
Although all men know about AIDS and 90% believe it is always fatal, only 49% know that AIDS can be avoided by using condoms and only 12% of those who perceive themselves to be at risk regularly use condoms.
In response, USAID: (1) develops multi-channel communication and educational interventions to reduce sexual risk behaviors in household, school, workplace, other community, national and transnational settings; (2) promotes cost-effective public and private sector strategies to increase the quality, demand for, and access to, male and female barrier methods for the prevention of HIV transmission; and (3) supports models and strategies to introduce, improve and expand services provided by public and private health providers to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Key Results: The reduction of sexual transmission of HIV infections (which accounts for 85% of all HIV infections in the developing world) requires the adoption of safer sexual behavior.
Mass media can raise awareness, change attitudes and promote safer behavior; however these programs are not effective alone and must be complemented by interpersonal communication activities.
Forty-four communications and behavior change activities are now programmed in 23 countries and this commitment will increase as the program expands.
In addition to changing sexual risk behaviors, this activity includes research to provide new information to more effectively design and implement effective behavior change communication and social marketing activities to reduce HIV transmission.
Performance and Prospects: During the first full year, this program designed STI/HIV interventions in Ukraine, Nigeria Honduras, Ghana; and provided technical assistance to improve services in Zambia, Mexico, and Honduras; provided training to 30 key national, state and city health workers in Maharashtra State, India on formative research methodologies; designed female condom use and motivation studies in Zimbabwe and Brazil; and began to research the delivery and impact of HIV voluntary counselling and testing services in Zimbabwe.
The West Africa Regional Migrant Outreach Program has been completed providing information and condoms to high risk migrants, travellers and their sexual partners along transportation routes linking Ivory Coast, Togo and Burkina Faso - a planned evaluation will inform similar programs in other areas.
In Brazil, a four-year $1.5 million program with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) was launched to expand availability of male and female condoms to high risk populations with the goal to increase annual project sales of male condoms from 34 million in 1998 to 45 million by 2001.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: These programs, awarded through cooperative agreements late in 1997, were staffed up and became fully operational during 1998.
The key objective during this reporting period will be continued and improved cooperation among the implementing agencies in order to focus and maximize the impact of resources.
Other Donor Programs: Host countries through their national AIDS control program, public and private health infrastructure, select donor agencies, and Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
This activity will also share best practices in HIV/AIDS prevention and social marketing through regional workshops targeting policy makers in East Africa co-sponsored by the British Department for International Development and similar regional meetings co-funded by UNAIDS and other USAID-funded organizations.

Summary: Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) increases the transmissibility of HIV up to 10 fold.
Effective STI control programs can substantially reduce HIV incidence up to 40%.
USAID seeks to provide enhanced quality, availability, and demand for STI management and prevention services.
Key Results: Three sub results are necessary to achieve SSO4.2: (1) develop, promote and support policies, guidelines and programs which increase availability, quality and demand for STI services in private and public health settings; (2) support research to identify, test and apply improved techniques and approaches to prevent and manage STI; and (3) develop, improve, promote and support public and private sector initiatives (including community-led initiatives) to deliver high quality STI prevention and case management services.
Performance and Prospects: Through agreements with Family Health International, The Population Council, and Population Services International, USAID has begun activities in eight countries which seek to improve STI case management; bring new barrier prevention technologies to persons at highest risk; utilize new methods of STI management in high risk populations; refine treatment guidelines; and develop international guidelines for STI program managers.
In the area of STI diagnostics, The Population Council has completed work which will improve the detection of vaginal infections in low resource settings.
Also, to date, USAID, through its support of Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), has developed a simplified method for syphilis diagnosis which is currently commercially available through a private firm in the United Kingdom.
PATH continues to work on rapid "dip stick" tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia using vaginal secretions or urine.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: It is likely that USAID will need to adapt programs as new diagnostic and treatment technologies become available which will create opportunities to improve sexually transmitted disease detection and treatment for underserved populations - especially women.
The recent rise of herpes simplex infections in Subsaharan Africa, an STI for which there is no cure, will necessitate additional efforts in prevention through increased use of barrier methods and abstinence.

Summary: USAID seeks to provide improved knowledge about, and capacity to address, the key policy, cultural, financial, and other contextual constraints to preventing and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS.
HIV/AIDS prevention efforts are often hampered by policy and other constraints.
USAID addresses these constraints by communicating costs of HIV/AIDS to policy makers, and promoting the elimination of barriers to prevention and care services.
Much of this work is done through private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the field.
Key Results: Activities include efforts to: (1) enhance knowledge and awareness among policy makers of the social, economic, cultural, and health impacts of HIV/AIDS; (2) identify and address key social, political, information, human resources and service barriers, including stigma and discrimination that affect responses to HIV/AIDS; (3) reduce key information and service barriers for vulnerable populations; (4) develop, evaluate and promote important policies and strategies for the delivery of basic care and support services; and (5) support global, regional and national policy initiatives to allocate adequate resources, and develop more cost-effective responses to HIV/AIDS.
Performance and Prospects: USAID has supported research into the process of HIV/AIDS policy formulation, including the process of formulating policies to expand the availability of and access to HIV prevention and care in 13 countries; development and dissemination of a comprehensive AIDS policy compendium, accessible through the internet; development of community-based programs in support of people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa and Latin America; and a U.S. study tour of HIV/AIDS prevention programs by senior Russian Officials which resulted in a joint USAID/Russian prevention strategy for Russia.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Due to the success so far of these activities and interventions, no major adjustments are presently being considered.
Other Donor Programs: Multilateral organizations and the World Bank, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, bilateral donors, the private sector, churches and the broader PVO and NGO sector all provide critical assistance.

Summary: USAID continues the following activities to strengthen and expand private sector organizational responses in delivering HIV/AIDS information and services: (1) expand and strengthen the capacity of key indigenous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), religious organizations and social sector institutions to deliver HIV/AIDS information and services, and to design, test, evaluate and disseminate community-led approaches for implementing effective responses to HIV/AIDS; (2) integrate HIV/AIDS prevention into policies and programs of key U.S. private voluntary organizations working in the health sector, while mobilizing key U.S. and host country commercial organizations to advocate and support HIV/AIDS prevention and care policies and programs; and (3) support and develop effective international, regional and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) networks and coalitions to respond to the epidemic.
Key Results: USAID continues to support the development of local capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Since 1987, USAID has provided technical and financial support to more than 600 private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and NGOs to implement HIV prevention programs and has trained more than 186,000 professional and volunteer front-line workers in sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV/AIDS prevention.
USAID has supported an international alliance to build technical and organizational capacity among local nongovernmental organizations at national and regional levels which channel funds and expertise to community-based organizations and other NGOs.
USAID also works through the private sector to encourage corporate support for HIV/AIDS prevention programs in workplace settings, as well as corporate sponsorship of mass media and other communication programs to raise awareness and change risk behaviors.
Performance and Prospects: The International HIV/AIDS Alliance (The Alliance) is the primary partner to advance USAID's objective to strengthen and expand the private sector response in delivering HIV/AIDS services.
The Alliance's program strategy emphasizes building the capacity of local nongovernmental organizations in the 12 countries where it is currently active.
To more efficiently meet the increased demand for local prevention and care services, the Alliance assists these groups to become independent partners in a local response to the HIV epidemic.
In this past year, local Alliance partners in the Philippines and Sri Lanka have matured to become independent NGOs able to provide local support to smaller, newer NGOs interested in HIV programming.
Over the next two years, the Alliance will pilot a new strategy to build local "centers of excellence" prioritizing South-to-South cooperation in Mexico, India, and Zambia.
As a result of its success in this area, the Alliance was recently named as a United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS Collaborating Center to serve as a central resource for understanding and learning from civil society responses to AIDS.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Given the success of these interventions, USAID will continue to strengthen and expand private sector organizational responses in delivering HIV/AIDS information and services and efforts in capacity building.
Other Donor Programs: Host country commercial sector, NGOs, including the informal sector, and other international donors and organizations, as well as the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS.

Summary: USAID recognizes the importance of accurate data to monitor and evaluate HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence, trends, and program impacts.
Through agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Bureau of Census, and Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, consensus guidelines will be finalized on minimum surveillance packages for developing countries based on the phase of the epidemic; technical assistance to USAID field missions and host governments will be provided to establish and maintain credible surveillance systems; operations research will develop and refine methodologies to estimate HIV and risk behavior incidence; and an HIV prevalence database will be maintained.
Key Results: Three sub results are necessary to achieve SSO4.5: (1) establish and/or strengthen surveillance and evaluation systems; (2) develop, validate, and disseminate improved tools and models to determine HIV/AIDS/STI levels, trends, intervention costs, and program impact; and (3) develop mechanisms to support timely dissemination and use of monitoring, surveillance and impact research by field programs and in policy dialogue activities.
Performance and Prospects: A recently completed interagency agreement with CDC will support methodological research to improve the quality and analysis of HIV surveillance data.
Through our existing agreements with the U.S. Bureau of Census and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), HIV surveillance data continue to be compiled and maintained in a database which is routinely distributed to over 600 individuals and institutions.
For the first time this database included data from Romania, Ukraine and Russia, as well as HIV incidence studies.
The Bureau of Census also has drafted an evaluation of the main data sources and methodologies used to estimate global mortality estimates.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: The advent of new technologies for detecting recent HIV infections, along with new methodologies for estimating incidence using prevalence data, will increase the availability of incidence estimates.
USAID and its partners will develop methods for the proper use and interpretation of these new data sources.
At the same time, local budget cuts threaten many existing HIV surveillance systems in USAID assisted countries.
USAID will need to find ways to make surveillance more accurate and useful, while reducing costs.
Other Donor Programs: UNAIDS has assisted in establishing international consensus for surveillance methodologies; other multilateral and bilateral donors will participate in support for country data collection and regional and global analyses.
Host countries, especially ministries of health, will be major implementers of country surveillance activities.

Summary: This component addresses USAID's core value of customer focus, which is to provide quality and timely assistance to partners to ensure effective implementation of HIV/AIDS programs.
USAID expects to achieve the following results in the next two years: (1) establish improved mechanisms for USAID field missions and offices to implement HIV/AIDS activities; and (2) ensure that field implementation and the HIV/AIDS research agenda are mutually reinforcing.
This will be accomplished through the Design, Monitoring, Evaluation, Lessons Learned and Dissemination (DMELLD) procurement to be awarded in 1999.
Key Results: USAID is the world's leading contributor to HIV prevention globally.
Assistance is being provided to 44 countries around the world, and other activities have resulted in the development and dissemination of innovative HIV prevention technologies and methodologies.
Coordination and collaboration with the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and numerous donors has been essential in keeping the donor community abreast of important developments in HIV/AIDS.
The sharing of lessons learned in other activities, countries and regions within USAID and with donors, host country counterparts and implementors has created a well-informed global response.
Performance and Prospects: USAID considers customer focus key to the achievement of results over the next two years.
Once DMELLD is operational, this partner will play a primary role in helping establish or strengthen mechanisms for USAID field missions and offices to implement HIV/AIDS activities; and ensure that field implementation and the HIV/AIDS research agenda are mutually reinforcing.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: With the award of the DMELLD contract in FY 1999, USAID's efforts to develop and strengthen mechanisms to provide quality and timely assistance to partners to ensure effective and coordinated implementation of HIV/AIDS programs will be greatly enhanced.
Other Donor Programs: The public and private sector are actively involved in HIV/AIDS programs where USAID conducts programming.
The application of findings throughout the world by donors, governments, private-for-profit sector, nongovernmental organizations and communities takes place on a worldwide scale.

PROGRAM: Central Programs TITLE AND NUMBER: Increased use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance, (New and improved cost effective interventions developed, field tested and disseminated), 936-SSO5.1 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $4,775,000 CS INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1998; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: In FY 1998, USAID initiated a new strategic objective to reduce the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance.
To help achieve this Agency-wide objective, USAID/Washington has developed a program to increase the use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases, focusing in four priority areas: malaria, tuberculosis (TB), antimicrobial resistance, and surveillance and response.
A key element of this strategy is developing, testing and making available new and improved interventions appropriate for use in the developing world.
Activities focus on research leading to the development, testing and introduction of new technologies, methodologies and products, and new approaches to prevent and control malaria, TB, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and improve capacity for surveillance and response.
The major beneficiaries of achievement of this objective are persons in developing countries.
However, given the potential for infectious diseases to spread quickly around the world and the threat from increased antimicrobial resistance, this assistance will contribute to reducing the risk of the spread of infectious disease to the United States.
Key Results: To achieve the result of new and improved cost effective interventions developed, field tested and disseminated, two subresults have been identified: 1.
New technologies and products developed, tested, and introduced, including: target vaccines and related tools and technologies; and diagnostic technologies and treatment regimens for selected infectious diseases and for slowing the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
2.
New approaches to improving the understanding, prevention and control of infectious diseases developed, tested, and introduced, including approaches to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance; to improve quality, effectiveness, and sustainability of service delivery; to promote and sustain behavior change; for collection and utilization of surveillance and drug use data and management information, including appropriate linkages within the public health system.
Performance and Prospects: USAID's Infectious Disease strategy was developed through extensive consultations with external partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research community, and nongovernmental organizations, private voluntary organizations and other elements of the private sector.
Prioritization of a strategic research agenda aimed at the development of new and appropriate low-cost technologies, diagnostics and methods for improving the prevention of infectious diseases and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been developed through close consultation with these external partners and other experts in the field.
This substantially encompasses the research and development capabilities of USAID's Office of Health and Nutrition in support of efforts directed towards the four categories targeted under this strategic objective: malaria, tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistance and surveillance.
The planned results under this intermediate result will be supported substantially, although not entirely, with USAID's own resources and will involve partnerships with multilateral and other bilateral organizations, other U.S. government agencies, NGOs, and the commercial sector.
By the end of the year 2000, expected achievements include the development and field testing of diagnostics for malaria and antimicrobial resistance; the identification and development of a new TB drug combination ready for field testing; and several new improved methodologies for surveillance developed and tested.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Research and development of new methods and technologies must be recognized as a long term process.
For example, clinical trials of new drug regimens or new drug combinations are comprised of several phases, and newly developed diagnostics, revised treatment guidelines and intervention approaches must undergo efficacy and usability trials, all of which may affect anticipated results.
In collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners, USAID is participating in the development of global strategies for antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis.
Other Donor Programs: WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Health (NIH), Japan International Cooperation Agency, U.S. universities and U.S. biotechnology industry complement USAID's work by supporting research in these and other related areas.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID will work closely with the NIH, CDC, WHO, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Naval Medical Research Center, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, the Rational Pharmaceutical Management Project, International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs, Management Sciences for Health, and The United States Pharmacopeia Convention.

Summary: As part of USAID's new infectious disease initiative, aimed at reducing the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance.
USAID focuses on those diseases that are the sources of significant mortality in the developing world, and on building the capacity of developing countries to prevent, respond to and minimize the spread of infectious diseases.
To help achieve this Agency-wide objective, USAID/Washington has developed a program to increase the use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases, focusing in four priority areas: malaria, TB, antimicrobial resistance, and surveillance and response.
Part of this effort focuses on improving the policy environment for applying effective interventions for infectious diseases.
Emphasis will be placed on the formulation of global strategies, such as in the case of tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistance, and on ensuring that national and local resources are available to address priority infectious disease areas.
Activities will focus on improvements both in the broad policy environment in which the commitment of resources to selected infectious diseases areas is made, and in the technical quality of those policies so that the resources committed will have the greatest impact.
The major beneficiaries of achievement of this objective are persons in developing countries.
However, given the potential for infectious diseases to spread quickly around the world and the threat from increased antimicrobial resistance, this assistance will contribute to reducing the risk of the spread of infectious disease to the United States.
Key Results: To achieve the result of policies improved and global, national and local resources for appropriate infectious disease interventions increased, three subresults have been identified: 1.
Reformed policies, improved decisions, and strengthened commitment to sustainable improvement in the prevention and control of select infectious diseases achieved through advocacy to increase commitment to key infectious disease and drug use policies and interventions; analyses and use of information to improve allocative and technical efficiency of policies and programming related to infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance; partnerships to leverage resources of other organizations and develop coordinated approaches on key issues.
2.
Improved financing approaches that generate equitable increases in access, quality, and sustainability of infectious disease services developed and implemented.
3.
Development of public/private partnerships to increase access to and quality of infectious disease interventions, including: private health providers; commercial producers of relevant goods, services, and information; private voluntary and other non-governmental organizations.
Performance and Prospects: USAID's Infectious Disease strategy was developed through extensive consultations with external partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research community, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private voluntary organizations and other elements of the private sector.
Prioritization of a strategic research agenda aimed at the development of new and appropriate low-cost technologies, diagnostics and methods for improving the prevention of infectious diseases and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been developed through close consultation with these external partners and other experts in the field.
This will be supported substantially, although not entirely, with USAID's own resources and will involve partnerships with multilateral and other bilateral organizations, other U.S. government agencies, NGOs, and the commercial sector.
Close collaboration with these partners will be key to the achievement of these results.
By the end of the year 2000, expected achievements include development and endorsement of global strategies and action plans for antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis; four countries will have improved malaria drug policies and policies that exempt insecticide-treated materials from value added tax; and in at least four countries policy makers will regularly use improved disease surveillance data.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In collaboration with WHO and other partners, USAID is participating in the development of global strategies for antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis.
As these strategies are developed and as priorities emerge, some adjustments to USAID's programs may be necessary.
Other Donor Programs: WHO, CDC, International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), World Bank, Department for International Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency and with other bilateral donors working with WHO and through other fora.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID will work closely with WHO, CDC, the Rational Pharmaceutical Management Project, International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs, Management Sciences for Health, IUATLD, the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
Selected Performance Measures:
Baseline (1998) Target (2000) Number of partners and regions endorsing the Global Strategy and Action Plan for control of antimicrobial resistance and the TB Global Action Plan Plans not fully developed or endorsed Endorsement of antimicrobial resistance and TB strategies Countries that have made appropriate changes to malaria drug policies and standards 0 4 Number of countries that exempt bednets and insecticides from import and VAT tax 0 4 _______________________________________________________________

Summary: As part of USAID's new infectious disease initiative, aimed at reducing the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance.
USAID focuses on those diseases that are the sources of significant mortality in the developing world, and on building the capacity of developing countries to prevent, respond to and minimize the spread of infectious diseases.
To help achieve this Agency-wide objective, USAID/Washington has developed a program to increase the use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases, focusing in four priority areas: malaria, tuberculosis (TB), antimicrobial resistance, and surveillance and response.
Effective mobilization of the demand for and appropriate use of infectious diseases intervention is essential to maximizing the sustained impact of these interventions.
Choices and actions by families and communities, are essential for reducing the burden of infectious diseases and contributing to improved health, including prevention, detection, and initial care-giving.
Activities will focus on applying proven information/education/communication, social marketing, social mobilization, and behavior change approaches developed by USAID and other organizations as part of a comprehensive effort to promote the adoption of effective preventive and care-giving practices at the household and community levels.
The major beneficiaries of achievement of this objective are persons in developing countries.
However, given the potential for infectious diseases to spread quickly around the world and the threat from increased antimicrobial resistance, this assistance will contribute to reducing the risk of the spread of infectious disease to the United States.
Key Results: To achieve the results of knowledge, beliefs and practices related to effective prevention and management of infectious diseases enhanced, three key subresults have been identified: 1.
Knowledge and use of appropriate behaviors for effective prevention of the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases, particularly for malaria and tuberculosis, at the household and community level increased.
2.
Ability of families and communities to identify, provide, and seek appropriate health interventions for prevention and management of infectious diseases improved.
3.
Capacity of health care providers to administer effective information, education and communication services to clients increased.
Performance and Prospects: USAID's Infectious Disease strategy was developed through extensive consultations with external partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research community, and nongovernmental organizations, private voluntary organizations and other elements of the private sector.
Application of appropriate interventions to improve knowledge, beliefs and practices related to infectious disease prevention and control will build on the efforts of these partners and on USAID's experience in child survival, HIV/AIDS and other public health areas.
By the end of the year 2000, expected achievements include: an increase in the percentage of health providers that give caregivers essential information regarding the use of antimicrobial drugs, model centers of excellence for TB established to improve the use of Directly Observed Therapy - Short course for tuberculosis control and to conduct training for TB control; and an increased proportion of insecticide-treated materials for malaria prevention appropriately retreated.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In collaboration with WHO and other partners, USAID is participating in the development of global strategies for antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis.
As these strategies are developed and as priorities emerge, some adjustments to USAID's programs may be necessary.

PROGRAM: Central Programs TITLE AND NUMBER: Increased use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance, (Quality and availability of key infectious disease services and systems improved), 936-SSO5.4 (PHN) STATUS: Continuing PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: FY 2000: $5,729,000 CS INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1998; ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: Continuing
Summary: As part of USAID's new infectious disease initiative, aimed at reducing the threat of infectious diseases of major public health importance.
USAID focuses on those diseases that are the sources of significant mortality in the developing world, and on building the capacity of developing countries to prevent, respond to and minimize the spread of infectious diseases.
To help achieve this objective, USAID has developed a program to increase the use of effective interventions to reduce the threat of infectious diseases, focusing in four priority areas: malaria, tuberculosis (TB), antimicrobial resistance, and surveillance and response.
In most USAID-assisted countries, substantial effort is still required to improve the accessibility, quality, and effectiveness of targeted, cost-effective infectious diseases services, both preventive and therapeutic.
Such effort is essential to increasing the impact of infectious disease programs; particularly in a way that increases countries' and individuals' capabilities to sustain that impact.
Performance in most countries also requires improvement of the health care delivery system, including: more efficient management and planning; developing reliable supplies and logistics systems for essential drugs, vaccines, and commodities; improving the collection and use of information; and employing quality assurance techniques to identify and resolve problems.
USAID will promote improvements in the availability, quality and cost-effectiveness of key infectious disease services, focusing on the four priority areas: tuberculosis, malaria, antimicrobial resistance, and surveillance.
In addition, the USAID will support the development and implementation of policies, plans and programs promoting standards for a high quality of care.
The major beneficiaries of achievement of this objective are persons in developing countries.
However, given the potential for infectious diseases to spread quickly around the world and the threat from increased antimicrobial resistance, this assistance will contribute to reducing the risk of the spread of infectious disease to the United States.
Key Results: To achieve the result of quality and availability of key infectious disease services and systems improved, four subresults have been identified: 1.
Performance of health workers - as measured by the quality of diagnosis and treatment of illness, and counseling of patients - improved.
2.
Planning, organization, and management of key infectious disease services improved.
3.
Approaches to deliver high quality preventive and treatment services to high risk populations developed and implemented.
4.
Production, selection, procurement and use of drugs, vaccines, and commodities for the treatment and/or prevention of infectious diseases improved.
Performance and Prospects: The activities designed to achieve results under this objective are intended to complement, build upon and scale-up on-going interventions being carried out under other USAID strategic objectives that have already been shown to be effective in reducing the threat of infectious diseases -- specifically diseases that threaten the survival of children, the reproductive health of women and the life expectancy of young adults (such as HIV/AIDS).
The planned results will be supported substantially, although not entirely, with USAID's own resources and will involve partnerships with multilateral and other bilateral organizations, other U.S. government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the commercial sector.
By the end of the year 2000, specific achievements will include: an increase in the proportion of health providers that demonstrate knowledge of appropriate antimicrobial use; more laboratories that pass minimum standards; increased number of countries or subregions that adopt Directly Observed Therapy - Short Course (DOTS) for TB; and increased number of target countries that procure and distribute netting and insecticide in a timely manner.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: In collaboration with WHO and other partners, USAID is participating in the development of global strategies for antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis.
As these strategies are developed and as priorities emerge, some adjustments to USAID's programs may be necessary.
Other Donor Programs: World Health Organization (WHO), International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), The World Bank, Department for International Development and Japan International Cooperation Agency.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID will work closely with WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, the Rational Pharmaceutical Management Project, Management Sciences for Health, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, Gorgas Institute, IUATLD, and International Clinical Epidemiology Network.
Selected Performance Measures:
Baseline (1998) Target (2000) Percent of surveyed health workers that demonstrate knowledge of appropriate antimicrobial drug use.
(Baseline surveys in FY99) TBD in FY99 25% Countries or subregions adopting the DOTS strategy 0 4 Percentage of participating countries that procure and distribute netting and insecticide in a timely manner.
