* These programs allow an operator to determine what is actually happening in "real" world by using:
* Data Collection * Information Sharing Exchange
Within the program, a comparison of actual performance to established standards can then be conducted
If desired performance is not up to specification * recommendations to address deficiencies are identified and instituted * performance is monitored to determine if the corrective action was successful
These programs are essential to all operations functions within a carrier, but particularly for flight operations and aircraft maintenance/overhaul
The FAA should require pro-active safety programs along with some of the measuring tools needed for data collection.
* Data collection tools include the following:
* Partnership programs allowing for voluntary disclosure of safety related events.
* FOQA ( to extent resources allow) * Internal Audit Programs for the carrier and its code sharing partners
These pro-active programs require a defined management structure to function effectively * The FARs require "Director of Safety" Position * The responsibilities of that position are not yet defined by the FAA * Data collection and overall program safety program management should be responsibility of a "Director of Safety"
FAA 90 DAY SAFETY REVIEW The Focus of this Review was FAA Surveillance and Oversight
* The overall purpose was to determine how the FAA could improve its Surveillance and Oversight of:
* Flight Operations * Maintenance
The concern was how the FAA could make improvements to its oversight programs considering * FAA Resource Limitations * Budget Limitations
Report Recommendations of Interest * The report indicated that aviation safety oversight requires better management of programs
* Data collection is needed to allow analysis * Effective data collection requires not only FAA resources but also outside resources * Analysis of the data will provide FAA with information to allow them to deploy resources where they are most needed
ALPA Recommends Shared Programs * Use of Shared Programs that would allow FAA to modify direct oversight for better effectiveness by:
* Reducing direct oversight at well established carriers with FAA approved internal Quality Assurance Programs * Increasing direct oversight and spending more time at newer or weaker carriers
Implementation of internal carrier operated safety/quality assurance programs should include: * FOQA Programs * Partnership Programs * Internal Audit
FAA INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES International Representation - ALPA Global Pilot Strategy
* ALPA now represents members in U.S. and Canada, and provides services to other associations in Europe and the Far East * ALPA was concerned with the implementation of international code sharing agreements
* concerned about effect on membership labor agreements * concerned about the effects on safety because many countries safety standards are less than those in the U.S.
ALPA developed a Global Strategy including One Level of Safety Internationally * Designed to address the level playing field concept and effect upon safety * Example: Flight Time/Duty Time limitations where some countries limitations are far less restrictive than the U.S.
FAA International Responsibilities * The Accident Risk is much higher outside the U.S./Canada/Europe/Oceania and this disparity is of significant concern * U.S. should lead, not follow: seek a common standard worldwide
* FAA has done this in some areas * Example: Global Positioning Satellite program
Current FAA International Activities are Reactive Programs, Driven by Politics and Economics * Harmonization of Aircraft Certification Rules - driven by manufacturers cost concerns
* Already well underway * FAA/JAA Harmonization in 14th year * Progress has been slow but substantial
Harmonization of Operating Rules - driven by cost concerns * Very limited progress to date
FAA International Aviation Safety Assessment Program (IASAP) - driven by Avianca Accident and resulting public concern * Affects only foreign carriers that operate into the U.S. (Part 129) * Fully support that program
ICAO Assessment Program - driven by IASAP program * Chicago Convention Provisions not enforced * Some states do not file differences, much less try to comply with the Standards and Recommended Practices * A more formal program needed * Active FAA role in ICAO Assessment needed
The FAA Needs a Proactive Global Safety Strategy * Examples of work FAA could do if it were proactive
* International partnership in data sharing with other regulatory agencies * Controlled Flight Into Terrain
* More participation in already existing program developed by Flight Safety Foundation and ICAO * FAA was previously active, now it does not participate on the implementation team * Many states do not require Ground Proximity Warning Systems * Participation in development of standards for Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems
TCAS * TCAS on freighters is not required today in U.S.
* It will be required on freighters in Europe in January 1998.
In India rule to be effective in December 1997 * ICAO proposal being developed and requires active FAA participation
Air Carrier Airport and Facilities Assessments * FAA cannot tell other states how to set up their airports and facilities * FAA can require U.S. carriers to fulfill their obligation to conduct operator assessments of destination airports and facilities.
* FAR Part 129 Oversight of Foreign Carriers * Remove roadblocks to enforcement due to State Department and other political considerations.
An overall review needs to be conducted to determine how and where the FAA can be proactive to improve safety globally
SAFETY DATA/INFORMATION PROGRAMS Data/Information Programs Provide Valuable Safety Information
* Programs provide early warning clues to help prevent accidents * Programs properly run have support of pilots
FOQA and Partnership Programs * Programs are Non Punitive * Data needs to be protected to assure it will continue to be collected and used for safety purposes * Punitive programs will not result in significant data collection
Cockpit Voice Recorders * Flight Crew Privacy a major concern * Should be used for Accident Investigation Purposes Only * They now have special protection from public disclosure * There should be no action that would lessen the effectiveness of the present CVR rule
Future * Benefits of data collection have been manifold, and they are fundamental for tracking progress toward meeting safety goals * Build on successful present protection practices * Provide the same special protection to Flight Recorder, FOQA and Partnership data that is now provided to cockpit voice recorders * Assure no degradation of present data protection and non-punitive provisions
