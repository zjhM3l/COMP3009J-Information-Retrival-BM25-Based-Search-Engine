What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving it?
All cultivated oilseed sunflower planted around the world has been derived from a limited genetic base which makes the crop vulnerable to disease and insect pests that can exploit this genetic weakness.
A goal of this project is to increase the genetic base of cultivated sunflower using the broad germplasm base of the fifty species of wild sunflowers, which have sufficient variability to overcome some of the weaknesses of the limited genetic base.
Economic losses in sunflower can be reduced by using the available wild species to introduce genes for genetic resistance to pests and for desirable agronomic quality characteristics.
In this project we identify agronomically important genes in wild sunflower, develop techniques to transfer the genes into a semi-domestic background, characterized the genes, and determine their chromosomal location on a genetic map that can be used by public and private sunflower breeders.

How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? Global production of sunflower exceeds 16 million hectares in 50 countries.
The present use of a single male-sterile cytoplasm derived from wild H. petiolaris, and associated restoration genes for global hybrid sunflower production makes the crop extremely vulnerable to potential disasters.
Presently, most cultivated sunflower has been bred to be tolerant to several diseases.
However, disease organisms that attack sunflower have the ability to change and overcome plant tolerance by exploiting a weakness in the plant's genetic composition.
Diseases also have the ability to become resistant to chemicals used for their control.
Some of the predominant diseases of sunflower, such as downy mildew, have had recent shifts in races, making sunflower susceptible to unacceptable economic losses.
This genetic vulnerability of current cultivated sunflower hybrids puts this important oilseed crop at risk globally.
Furthermore, the improvement of nutritional and agronomic traits such as fatty acid composition, yield, maturity date, drought, and salinity tolerance require a wide variety of available genes to produce a nutritional crop that is productive in diverse environments.

How does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? This project is assigned to National Program 301, Plant, Microbial 
It allows ARS scientists to collect and evaluate wild sunflower germplasm, and to transfer useful agronomic traits from the wild species to the cultivated sunflower.
The project provides fundamental new knowledge about the sunflower genome and supplies useful genetic stocks to geneticists and breeders who further characterize the transfer of genetic traits and develop advanced breeding lines for commercial hybrid sunflower production.

What were the most significant accomplishments this past year? A. Single Most Significant Accomplishment during FY2000 Year:
New races of broomrape in Europe attack all cultivated sunflower, posing a serious threat to production and necessitating the urgent need for new broomrape resistance genes.
In cooperation with Dr. Jose Fernandez-Martinez at CSIC, Cordoba, Spain, interspecific amphiploids between wild perennials sunflower and cultivated lines and their backcross progeny were produced in Fargo, screened in Spain, and resistant plants identified.
Seeds of selected resistant plants derived from each of the four wild perennial species were increased for germplasm registration and release.
The use of these broomrape-resistant amphiploid lines will provide protection against the new broomrape races, and also illustrates the potential value of amphiploids for interspecific gene transfer of other traits.
B.
Other Significant Accomplishment(s): The worldwide sunflower industry has used a single male sterile cytoplasm (PET1) for almost 30 years, making it extremely vulnerable to changes in pest complexes because of its narrow genetic base.
In FY 2000, a new male sterile cytoplasm was characterized from a wild annual species from Texas (PI 468526), and related fertility restoration genes were also identified.
This newly discovered cytoplasm will provide the sunflower industry with a new source of cytoplasm from the closest relative of the cultivated sunflower.
Cultivated sunflower lacks the genetic diversity necessary to adapt to various stresses.
Previously, four perennial sunflowers were identified as potential sources of genes for pest resistance and to provide genetic diversity.
Ten interspecific germplasm lines derived from these four wild perennial sunflowers were released in FY 2000.
These germplasm lines will facilitate the incorporation of unexploited interspecific germplasm derived from perennial species into commercial breeding programs.
The fatty acid composition of sunflower oil is a major quality factor for marketing of the oil.
Previously, a population of wild annual sunflower closely related to the crop species was discovered to have 52% lower saturated fatty acids than the cultivated crop.
In FY-2000, interspecific hybrids of this source were produced for further evaluation.
This genetic material will provide breeders the opportunity to lower the present level of saturated fats to produce a sunflower oil that will be healthier and more competitive in the marketplace.

Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted or actual impact.
An interspecific sunflower line (ARG-1575-2) with multiple race resistance to downy mildew, including resistance to a new APRON-tolerant race of downy mildew, was released in FY 2000.
Several populations of wild sunflower species (ancestors) from Canada were discovered to have low saturated fatty acids, and this information was incorporated into the Germplasm Resources Information System (GRIN) database for future selection and breeding of quality traits in sunflower oil.
Gene flow from cultivated sunflower to wild sunflower species was documented, implying that transgenes from genetically engineered sunflower could readily introgress into wild populations.
Twenty-seven new sunflower lines with cytoplasmic male sterility, a trait required for hybrid seed production, were identified along with the genes that restore their fertility.
A method was developed to overcome the strong seed dormancy in wild sunflowers, facilitating the use of the wild species in research programs by allowing an adequate number of plants to be obtained for further study.
Cultivated sunflower germplasm lines containing 30% less saturated fatty acids were developed.
A framework RFLP map with 232 cDNA clones was completed, and will yield useful molecular markers for important agronomic traits.

What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? During FY 2001 we will release sunflower lines with reduced saturated fatty acids, a new cytoplasmic male sterility source (from PI 432513) along with four newly identified restoration sources, and germplasm populations with genes for fertility restoration of a new cytoplasm (CMS PEF1) for use by sunflower breeders.
Also during FY 2001, we expect to release several interspecific amphiploids as genetic stocks, useful for breeders who have an interest in using wild perennial species.
By FY 2002 we anticipate the release of broomrape resistant plants with normal sunflower chromosome number, n=34, developed from backcross progenies of amphiploids with cultivated lines.
During FY 2002, we also expect to complete mapping of the rust resistance genes in lines CM90RR and HAR5.

What science and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to the adoption 
Germplasm resources and expertise were transferred to CSIRO, Brisbane, Australia, for their work on sunflower drought tolerance, and its molecular mapping.
We transferred interspecific sunflower germplasm to the Institute of Sustainable Agriculture, Cordoba, Spain, for development of broomrape resistant cultivated sunflower.
