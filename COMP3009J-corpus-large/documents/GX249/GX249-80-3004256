AN ACT
CONCERNING A CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT FOR PHARMACISTS.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
SECTION 1.
Part 1 of article 22 of title 12, Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW SECTION to read:
12-22-118.5.
Continuing education.
(1) EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN SUBSECTIONS (2) AND (3) OF THIS SECTION, THE BOARD MAY NOT RENEW OR REACTIVATE THE LICENSE OF ANY PHARMACIST UNTIL THE PHARMACIST PRESENTS EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMPLETED TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF APPROVED CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWO YEARS.
SUBJECT TO SUBSECTION (9) OF THIS SECTION, SUCH EVIDENCE MAY BE PROVIDED BY CHECKING A SIGN-OFF BOX ON THE LICENSE RENEWAL APPLICATION.
(2) (a) THE BOARD MAY RENEW THE LICENSE OF A PHARMACIST WHO PRESENTS ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE PHARMACIST WAS UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION.
(b) THE BOARD MAY GRANT A SIX-MONTH COMPLIANCE EXTENSION TO PHARMACISTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION.
(c) WITH REGARD TO LICENSE RENEWALS OCCURRING PRIOR TO JULY 1, 2002, THE BOARD SHALL REQUIRE PHARMACISTS TO PRESENT EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMPLETED ONLY TWELVE HOURS OF APPROVED CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION.
(3) THE BOARD MAY RENEW THE LICENSE FOR THE FIRST RENEWAL PERIOD FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF THE ORIGINAL LICENSE WITHOUT REQUIRING A PHARMACIST TO COMPLETE ANY CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION IF THE PHARMACIST OBTAINS A LICENSE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE PHARMACIST'S PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION.
(4) TO QUALIFY FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT, A PROGRAM OF CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION MUST BE CURRENTLY APPROVED BY THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION OR AN EQUIVALENT ACCREDITING BODY AS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD.
(5) EACH PROGRAM OF CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION SHALL CONSIST OF AT LEAST ONE CONTINUING EDUCATION UNIT, WHICH IS ONE HOUR OF PARTICIPATION IN AN ORGANIZED CONTINUING EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING POSTGRADUATE STUDIES, INSTITUTES, SEMINARS, LECTURES, CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS, CORRESPONDENCE COURSES, CASSETTE PROGRAMS, PROGRAMMED LEARNING COURSES, AUDIOVISUAL PROGRAMS, INTERNET PROGRAMS, AND ANY OTHER FORM OF PRESENTATION THAT IS ACCREDITED.
(6) ANY ASPECT OF THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF A PROGRAM OF CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACEUTICS, COMPOUNDING, PHARMACOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY, BIOCHEMISTRY, PHYSIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, PHARMACY ADMINISTRATION, AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE MANAGEMENT.
(7) A PROGRAM OF CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING:
(a) A DEFINITE STATED OBJECTIVE;
(b) PRESENTATION IN AN ORGANIZED MANNER; AND
(c) A METHOD OF PROGRAM EVALUATION THAT IS SUITABLE TO THE TYPE OF PROGRAM BEING PRESENTED.
(8) A PROGRAM OF CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION SHALL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE ACCREDITING BODY.
(9) THE BOARD MAY ANNUALLY AUDIT UP TO FIVE PERCENT OF THE PHARMACISTS LICENSED AND RESIDING IN COLORADO TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION.
(10) FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF APPROVED CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION SHALL RESULT IN THE LICENSE BECOMING INACTIVE.
INACTIVE LICENSEES SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ANY CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT SO LONG AS SUCH LICENSEES REMAIN INACTIVE, BUT SHALL CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY APPLICABLE FEES, INCLUDING RENEWAL FEES.
INACTIVE STATUS SHALL BE NOTED ON THE FACE OF ANY LICENSE ISSUED WHILE THE LICENSEE REMAINS INACTIVE.
SHOULD AN INACTIVE PHARMACIST WISH TO RESUME THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY AFTER BEING PLACED ON AN INACTIVE LIST, THE PHARMACIST SHALL FILE AN APPLICATION THEREFOR, PAY THE REGISTRATION RENEWAL FEE, AND, SUBJECT TO SUBSECTIONS (2) AND (3) OF THIS SECTION, MEET THE TWENTY-FOUR HOUR CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT.
ENGAGING IN THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY WHILE ON INACTIVE STATUS PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE MAY BE GROUNDS FOR LICENSE REVOCATION.
