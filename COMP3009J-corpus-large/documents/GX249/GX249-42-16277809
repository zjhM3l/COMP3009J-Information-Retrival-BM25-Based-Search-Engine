KISD had only 2.9 percent of students taking AP examinations.
This percentage is significantly lower than the percentage of students that took these exams in the peer districts and the state Exhibit 2-29.
The director of Instructional Services said that KISD recognizes the need to improve and strengthen the AP program and to encourage more students to take the advanced courses.
In November 2000, KISD organized subject matter vertical AP teams in math/science/English/social studies.
The director of Educational Services said these teams will reduce fragmentation and align the AP curriculum.
KISD counselors are presenting the AP program to parents and encouraging students to take more rigorous courses and, according to the director of Educational Services, "funds will be provided for students who cannot afford to take AP exams."
Exhibit 2-30 is the district's list of other strategies that are being discussed
Exhibit 2-30 Strategies Identified to Improve AP program December 2000
Strategies Continue development of vertical teams Allocate funds for new resources Provide staff development and on-site training Develop timeline Develop Scope and Sequence for Pre-AP/AP program Review weighted credits Reward students for success on AP exam Use BRAG lab for SAT/ACT computer program Offer PRE-SAT in grade 8 during the day at Memorial Middle School Send teachers for SAT/ACT training Use NovaNet lab program for SAT/ACT development

In December 2000, the district applied for a Pre-AP Coastal Bend School-to-Career Partnership grant.
This grant requests funds to develop a plan, set goals and activities and define an evaluation process to be used as a model for developing a Pre-AP science program at Memorial Middle School.
The district is committed to implementing the project even if it is not awarded the grant.
The district will also fund a program to develop Pre-AP programs in mathematics, English and Social Studies.
Several school districts have taken innovative steps to increase the number of students that take the AP examinations.
In Austin ISD, Kealing Junior High School has a seventh and eighth grade Pre-AP program.
The purpose of this program is to provide rigorous courses to prepare junior high school students to take AP courses in high school.
In another district, Ysleta ISD, school principals select AP and pre-AP faculty members.
They must have completed AP training and continue to obtain 30 hours of instruction for gifted/talented students.
The district also initiated a program that provides rebates or advance payment of testing fees depending on student examination scores.
In an effort to provide more challenging curricular options, the district purchased college-level textbooks for English and Spanish AP courses with additional areas scheduled for purchase during the next two years.
Between 1996 and 1997, the number of Ysleta ISD AP placement examinations increased by 71.2 percent, from 416 to 712.
The total number of students passing AP examinations also increased from 173 to 233.
Recommendation 15:
Fund and implement strategies that will increase the number of students completing advanced courses and taking Advanced Placement exams.
The district should ensure that the District Improvement Plan and individual Campus Improvement plans include specific steps and timelines for improving the AP program.
KISD has expressed an interest in providing financial assistance to students and in developing a pre-AP program.
The director of Instructional Services said the district will support students that want to take Advanced Placement examinations.
District staff should research other schools across the state that have implemented strategies that have increased the number of students completing advanced courses and taking Advanced Placement exams.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The director of Instruction Services reviews successful pre-AP and AP programs across the state and makes presentations to the superintendent, to the associate superintendent for Instruction and Human Resources and to the vertical AP planning teams.
April 2001 2.
The director of Instruction Services prepares a plan for an AP/pre-AP program that includes testing fee rebates and advanced faculty training in the District Improvement Plan and in the Campus Improvement Plan.
July 2001 3.
The director of Instruction Services and school counselors, with input from the vertical AP planning teams, identify eligible program participants.
August 2001 4.
The superintendent gives the directive for program implementation throughout district.
July 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
The fiscal impact assumes that the district will provide financial assistance to students to take the Advanced Placement examinations.
Each AP exam costs $77.
Based on KISD's 1999-2000 enrollment for grades 11 and 12 in King High School (282 + 267 = 549), 16 students (2.9 percent) took at least one AP exam.
Because the number of students taking an AP exam is low, a target should be set to double the number of students taking AP exams.
This would result in 32 students taking one AP exam (5.8 percent).
The total cost to provide this service for students would be $2,464 ($77 X 32).
Recommendation 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 Fund and implement strategies that will increase the number of students completing advanced courses and taking Advanced Placement exams. ($2,464) ($2,464) ($2,464) ($2,464) ($2,464)
FINDING
The Gifted and Talented program in KISD is fragmented, lacking a differentiated curriculum for many courses and dedicated administrative oversight.
The district does not have a full-time position assigned specifically for gifted and talented education.
The director of instructional Services serves as the district's gifted and talented coordinator but the format in which gifted/talented services are delivered to students is a school decision.
Exhibit 2-31 shows that compared to the peer districts, KISD had the highest percentage of students identified as gifted and the highest percentage of teachers with gifted/talented certification.

* Expressed in Full Time Equivalents.
The primary schools (K-1) have a waiver from the state to identify gifted and talented students, but in interviews, principals said that all of the teachers at these schools have received gifted and talented certification.
The district has policies and procedures that explain how students are identified, and these are available in the Challenge Handbook to parents upon request and at every campus.
Parent surveys, however, show that not all parents are informed about the gifted and talented program, the process for identification, or the services provided.
One parent said, "The district has nothing in black and white informing parents what the criteria is for children to make it into the gifted and talented program....the district does not share information about the program with parents."
This parent said that though the district does have an appeal process when a student is not identified as gifted, the process is so flawed that "...if they end up getting their child in the program, the child is so far behind that they end up waiting until the next year to start."
Several teachers and district administrators said there are no specific efforts to identify gifted bilingual education students.
Although the director of Instructional Services coordinates the district's gifted program, the district does not have adequate staff to fulfill its responsibility.
The district central office, for instance, does not periodically review or update the program curriculum guides.
Teachers said the KISD's central office does not provide specific training or assistance for AP teachers.
The director of Instructional Services said that while the district has made training available since 1999, it is researching ways to provide more staff development and on-site training for teachers.
State law requires teachers of gifted/talented students to receive 30 hours of instruction in teaching gifted/talented students and continue to receive instruction to maintain the certification.All district teachers are encouraged to receive training.
The director of Instructional Services said, "all of the gifted and talented teachers in the district have taken the required 30 hours of gifted and talented teacher training.
These teachers are required to attend six hours of gifted and talented staff development every year.
Administrators and counselors must attend six hours of training."
Although training may improve a teacher's instructional methods, it does not ensure that properly trained teachers will be teaching gifted students.
KISD does not have a district-level accountability system in place for assessing the quality of the gifted/talented program.
Providing effective services to gifted and talented students that are in the regular classroom is a difficult task.
Teachers must serve the regular class, the bilingual/ESL students, the students receiving special education services, the at-risk students and the gifted and talented students.
To be effective, districts need to research and identify successful practices, develop and plan appropriate services and then provide the necessary training and support for the classroom teacher.
Districts across the state that have successfully implemented the recommendations in the State Plan for gifted and talented education use creative and innovative programs, and they allocate the necessary staff to implement the State Plan's recommendations effectively.
Many districts and one of the peer districts have created an office of Advanced Academic Studies.
This office, in addition to coordinating the district's gifted and talented program, also coordinates other programs not exclusively offered to gifted and talented students, but are related to overall advanced academic studies.
These programs include: the State Board of Education recommended high school program, the development and coordination of advanced courses like physics and trigonometry, the SAT/ACT testing program, and advanced placement courses and examinations, ULI academic competitions, and the International baccalaureate Program.
Recommendation 16:
Fully implement the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
Full implementation of the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students will result in a cohesive program that effectively addresses the concerns expressed by both parents and teachers.
This recommendation can be accomplished in a number of ways.
One alternative is to allocate one full-time position to coordinate gifted and talented education as well as other advanced academic programs available to all students.
The following implementation strategies and fiscal impact are based on that alternative.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent creates a full-time Advanced Academics coordinator position.
May 2001 2.
The assistant superintendent for Instruction and Human Resources hires an Advanced Academics coordinator.
June 2001 3.
The assistant superintendent for Instruction and Human Resources directs the Advanced Academics coordinator to review the districts' Challenge program.
July 2001 4.
The Advanced Academics coordinator determines the extent to which each school in the district is implementing the recommendations in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students (State Plan) July - August 2001 5.
The Advanced Academics coordinator contacts other school districts with exemplary, cost-effective, gifted and talented programs.
May - August 2002 6.
The district's Advanced Academics coordinator develops a three-to-five year plan for achieving exemplary status as outlined in the State Plan and secures staff and board approval.
Ongoing 7.
The Advanced Academics coordinator develops measures to ensure that every school follows the State Plan.
August 2002 8.
The Advanced Academics coordinator uses the State Plan to develop an accountability system for the KISD gifted and talented program.
August 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation would have an annual cost of $53,944.
The cost of hiring an advanced academics coordinator is based on a salary of $50,201 for 212 days plus benefits.
Recommendation 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 Fully implement the Texas State Plan for Education of the Gifted/Talented Students.

FINDING
The percentage of Hispanic students identified as gifted and talented is higher in the elementary schools than in the middle and high school and out of 586 gifted and talented students, only six are enrolled in bilingual/ESL or are LEP students not receiving Bilingual/ESL instruction.
Thirty-six gifted and talented students are identified as at risk.
KISD student enrollment is 76.4 percent Hispanic.
Exhibit 2-32 shows that in the elementary schools, the percentage of gifted and talented students identified as Hispanic students is 82 percent.
This percentage is greater than the percentage of Hispanic students in the district.
However, in the middle and intermediate schools, the percentage of Hispanic students identified declines to 67 percent.
At King High School (grades 9 - 12) the percentage of gifted and talented students identified as Hispanic declined to 40 percent.
The percentage of identified gifted and talented Hispanic students decreased by almost half, from 82 percent at the elementary grades to 40 percent at the high school.
At the same time, the percentage of Anglo students that were identified as gifted and talented increased from 15 percent in the elementary schools to 36 percent in high school.

Source: KISD Gifted and Talented Enrollment.
These findings suggest that fewer Hispanic students are taking fewer advanced courses and taking fewer advanced placement examinations.
All schools should provide gifted and talented education to language minority students who meet eligibility requirements.
Region 1 Education Service Center and three participating school districts, Edcouch-Elsa Independent School District, La Feria Independent School District and La Villa Independent School District, propose to establish and operate a model GT/Bilingual program for all gifted and talented students.
Through a restructuring process, teachers, counselors, administrators, and parents will collaborate to review, evaluate and use traditional and non-traditional assessment and identification processes among potentially gifted and talented students.
The three participating school districts will work with nationally recognized researchers and educators to develop and restructure the gifted education curricula and accompanying materials.
This model will also provide an interactive technology component for parents and will be available in printed and electronic forms for review via the Internet.
Recommendation 17:
Ensure all gifted and talented students are identified and served.
