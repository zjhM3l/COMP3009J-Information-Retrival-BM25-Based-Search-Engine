ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on August 30, 2000, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Happy Hour, Inc., License Number R-SS-3513 (hereinafter Licensee).
An Administrative hearing was held on Thursday, January 18, 2001, pursuant to requisite and appropriate hearing notice.
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S.
Section 4-471, and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.
C.S. Section 5513, in that on June 19, 2000, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
FINDINGS OF FACT: 1.
The Bureau of Enforcement conducted an investigation of the licensed premises which began April 20, 2000 and concluded June 21, 2000.
A letter was sent to the licensed premises by certified mail, return receipt requested on July 6, 2000.
That mailing was signed as received on July 7, 2000.
A citation dated August 30, 2000 was issued by the Bureau of Enforcement.
That citation was sent by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensed premises.
The mailing was signed as received on August 31, 2000 (N.T. 28-29 and Exhibits B-1 and B-2).
2.
Officer Sinclair is employed by the Bureau of Enforcement and has so been employed for approximately ten years.
On June 19, 2000, he visited the licensed premises and conducted an inspection (N.T. 7-8).
3.
At approximately 12:28 p.m., he went to the licensed premises located at Ford Road near the intersection of Monument in the city and county of Philadelphia.
He entered the premises and observed the bartender, later identified as Theresa, rendering services of alcoholic beverages to one patron.
The officer identified himself to the bartender and informed her that he was going to conduct a routine inspection.
During the course of the inspection, he observed an electronic video poker machine located in the right rear of the premises (N.T. 8).
4.
Officer Sinclair approached the machine and placed a $1.00 bill in U.S. currency in the bill validator, located on the front of the machine, and received four credits.
He played a hand and received three sevens.
It awarded him three additional credits, bringing the total on the screen to six.
At that point, he pressed the high score button and the six points were knocked off the screen (N.T. 8-9).
5.
The high score button is the button located on the play face of the machine, which gives you access to an initial mode.
Once you enter the initials, the points on the screen are reduced to zero and the initials are displayed in ranking order of highest points accumulated.
This is a mechanism for removing the credits.
This mechanism is common for Riviera High Score electronic video poker machines (N.T. 9-10).
6.
The officer has had the opportunity to investigate numerous Riviera poker machines in the past (N.T. 11).
7.
The officer seized the machine and placed it on a property record.
The machine was transported back to the evidence room and placed under Property Record No. W1-2497 (N.T. 11-12 and Exhibit B-3).
8.
The machine was logged into the evidence room according to proper procedures by the evidence officer.
It was placed in the evidence room and the machine was labeled with the incident number and the name of the premises, its location and inventory number (N.T. 13).
9.
Officer Sinclair was trained at Bureau headquarters by the Pennsylvania State Police to identify characteristics of gambling devices (N.T. 13-14).
10.
Officer Sinclair indicated that in order to operate the machine, U.S. currency is placed in the bill validator and credits are received which are displayed on the screen.
You then have the option of standing or discarding certain cards and receiving another hand (N.T. 14).
11.
No payoffs were witnessed on the machine (N.T. 14).
12.
Officer James Brown is employed by the Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Enforcement and has been so employed for approximately two years.
He conducted an undercover investigation at the licensed premises on two occasions.
On his first visit to the premises, he did not observe any violations.
On March 17, 2000 at approximately 8:05 p.m., he visited the licensed premises.
At the bar, he noted that there was a poker machine in the right hand corner.
He noted that it was a Dodge City cabinet, but it did not have a Dodge City screen in it.
It did not have the characteristics that he was familiar with that were typically found on a Dodge City poker machine (N.T. 16-17).
13.
Officer Brown was trained by the Pennsylvania State Police and he has inspected twenty five to thirty machines.
He received training from the State Police Academy and from experts in the field in recognizing the characteristics of gambling and electronic devices per se (N.T. 8).
14.
Officer Brown noted that the machine that he observed on March 17, 2000 was not typical of a Dodge City poke machine, in that on the Dodge City poker machine there is a disclaimer on the screen as it goes through the various modes.
The Dodge City machine repeatedly indicates that it is not a gambling machine.
That was not observed on the machine that was on the licensed premises (N.T. 20-21 and Exhibit B-3).
15.
Officer Brown cut the locks off the machine and opened it up.
Inside the machine there was a motherboard that had a dip switch on it.
The dipswitch is used to make changes in the machines odds.
Officer Brown concluded that one could switch all characteristics of the different modes.
When he opened the machine, he inserted some U.S. currency.
There were two meters located to the right of the motherboard.
The meters had numbers on them.
The money in was recorded on the meters.
The machine had an internal counting device (N.T. 23-24).
16.
The machines odds were set at 77%, according to the internal counting device.
It also had a power interrupt circuit, i.e. if you unplug the machine, the power goes off and the machine will retain the number of credits showing prior to the power outage (N.T. 26-27).
17.
The machine also has a double up feature.
It took approximately three to five seconds to play the machine.
Officer Brown noted, as did Officer Sinclair, that the knockoff device was a high score button.
Once the initials were entered, the high score was recorded and the credits were knocked off the machine (N.T. 27).
18.
Officer Brown concluded that the machine was a gambling device per se (N.T. 28).

DISCUSSION:
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he/she intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
18 Pa.
C.S. Section 5513(a)(1).
In Commonwealth v. Irwin, 636 A.2d 1106 (Pa. 1993), the Supreme Court again reinforced that a machine is a gambling device per se if it can be used for no purpose other than gambling.
For a machine to be so intrinsically connected with gambling as to constitute a gambling device per se, the following three elements must be proved by the Bureau: (1) consideration, (2) a result determined by chance rather than skill, and (3) a reward.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has also held that proof of gambling payouts made on a video poker machine is not necessary where the machine is determined to be a gambling device per se.
Commonwealth v. Twelve Dodge City Video Poker Machines, 537 A.2d 812 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988).
Commonwealth v. Two Electronic Poker Game Machines, 465 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1983), the Supreme Court held that the ability to knock off free games and the presence of a meter to enable the machine owner to determine how many games were knocked off on video poker machines can make those machines gambling devices per se.
The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes other sufficient cause as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
After a thorough examination by the Bureau, the video machine confiscated by the Bureau, which amongst other things, was coin operated with internal meters, counting devices, dipswitches and a knock off device was determined to be a gambling device per se.
The only remaining question is whether Licensee knew or should have known that there was a gambling device on the premises.
In a decision by Judge Flaherty of the Office of Administrative Law Judge, New Sharletsville Hotel, Inc., Citation No. 97-2191, he indicated, It is my opinion that machines such as the one involved in this case are very susceptible to use for gambling purposes.
Licensee should, therefore, have taken affirmative steps to determine whether the machine was a gambling device per se.
The same is true of the machine found on the premises.
The record did not establish that Licensee made any effort to determine whether or not the machine in question was a gambling device per se or to prevent the placing of a gambling device per se on the licensed premises.
Therefore, this Court concludes the scienter requirements of Pa Liquor Control Board v. T.L.K., Inc., 544 A.2d 931 (Pa. 1988) have been met.
After careful review of the record, a $400.00 monetary penalty shall be imposed.
PENALTY:
Section 471 of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S.
Section 4-471, prescribes a penalty of suspension or revocation of license or imposition of a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00, or both, for violations of the type found in this case.
Accordingly, we issue the following

THEREFORE, it is hereby Ordered that Licensee, Happy Hour, Inc., License Number R-SS-3513, pay a fine of Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) within twenty (20) days of the mailing date of this Order.
