General Information
The myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) are clonal myeloid disorders that possess both dysplastic and proliferative features and that are not properly classified as either myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD).[1] This category is composed of 3 major myeloid disorders: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML).
Myeloid disease that shows features of both MDS and CMPD but does not meet the criteria for any of the 3 major MDS/MPD entities is designated as myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease, unclassifiable (MDS/MPD-U).
The French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme for myeloid disorders did not contain this Ã¢overlap category,Ã¢ which made the classification of CMML particularly difficult.[2,3] Recognizing the special diagnostic challenge that these diseases represent, a group of pathologists and clinicians sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) created the MDS/MPD category to provide a less restrictive view of myeloid disorders that in some instances clearly overlap.[4]
The etiology of MDS/MPD is not known.
The incidence of MDS/MPD varies widely, ranging from approximately 3 per 100,000 individuals over the age of 60 annually for CMML to as few as 0.13 per 100,000 children from 0 to 14 years of age annually for JMML.[1] Reliable data concerning the incidence of aCML, a recently defined entity, are not available.
The incidence of MDS/MPD-U is unknown.
The pathophysiology of MDS/MPD involves abnormalities in the regulation of myeloid pathways for cellular proliferation, maturation, and survival.
Clinical symptoms are due to complications resulting from cytopenia(s), dysplastic cells that function abnormally, leukemic infiltration of various organ systems, and general constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise.[5] Patients with MDS/MPD do not have a Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
No specific genetic defects have been identified for any of these entities, although abnormalities in regulation of the RAS pathway of signaling proteins appears to be a common finding in CMML, aCML, and JMML and may have some role in the abnormal myeloid proliferation associated with these diseases.[4] In general, the treatment of these diseases is tailored to the manifestations, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic, that predominate in the individual patient.

Disease overview
Note: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) under the French-American-British (FAB) scheme.[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) classification removed CMML from MDS, placing it in the new category Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases (MDS/MPD).[2]
CMML is a clonal disorder of a bone marrow stem cell.
Monocytosis is a major defining feature.
CMML exhibits heterogenous clinical, hematological, and morphologic features, varying from predominantly myelodysplastic to predominantly myeloproliferative.
CMML is characterized pathologically by the following:[3] * Persistent monocytosis greater than 1 x 10^9/L in the peripheral blood.
* No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
* Less than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow.
* Dysplasia involving one or more myeloid lineages or, if myelodysplasia is absent or minimal, either an acquired clonal cytogenetic bone marrow abnormality or at least 3 months of persistent peripheral blood monocytosis, if all other causes are ruled out.
Clinical features of CMML include the following:[3] * Fever, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss.
* Infection.
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
* Hepatomegaly (in some patients).
* Splenomegaly (in some patients).
* In patients with normal or slightly decreased white blood cell count, clinical features may be identical to MDS.
* In patients with elevated white blood cell count, features are more like chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) including more frequent splenomegaly and hepatomegaly.
The median age at diagnosis of CMML is 65 to 75 years of age, with a male predominance of 1.5 to 3.1.[3] There are no reliable incidence data for CMML, because CMML is grouped with chronic myeloid leukemia in some epidemiologic surveys and with MDS in others.[4]
Morphologically, the disease is characterized by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis (always 
Neutrophilia occurs in nearly one half of patients, with neutrophil precursors (promyelocytes, myelocytes) accounting for greater than 10% of the white blood cells.[6] Mild normocytic anemia is common.
Moderate thrombocytopenia is often present.
Bone marrow findings include the following:[3,7,8] * Hypercellularity (75% of cases).
* Blast count less than 20%.
* Granulocytic proliferation (with dysgranulopoiesis).
* Monocytic proliferation, dyserythropoiesis (e.g., megaloblastic changes, abnormal nuclear contours, ringed sideroblasts, etc.).
* Micromegakaryocytes and/or megakaryocytes with abnormally lobated nuclei (up to 80% of cases).
* Fibrosis (30% of cases).
Hepatosplenomegaly may be present.[3] Autoimmune phenomena, including pyoderma gangrenosum, vasculitis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia, have been observed in CMML.[9]
In CMML with eosinophilia, all criteria for CMML are present and the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood is greater than 1.5 x 10^9.[4]
Although clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are found in 20% to 40% of patients with CMML, none is specific.[3,10,11] Point mutations of RAS genes may occur in as many as 40% of patients with CMML.[3,11]
* Low platelet count; high white blood cell, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts.
* Presence of circulating immature myeloid cells.
* High percentage of marrow blasts.
* Low percentage of marrow erythroid cells.
* Abnormal cytogenetics.
* High levels of serum LDH and Ãƒ2-microglobulin.
Progression to acute leukemia occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of cases.[11]
Treatment overview
Various chemotherapy regimens for CMML have been used with only modest success.[12] In a study evaluating single-agent therapy with topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, 25 patients with CMML were treated with topotecan at doses that induce bone marrow aplasia (2.0 mg/m^2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days).
Complete hematologic remissions were induced in 28% of patients.
Toxic effects were significant, and the median duration of remission was 8 months.[13][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
This combination regimen induced complete remission in 44% of patients with CMML; median duration of complete response was 50 weeks, and patients required monthly maintenance therapy.[14][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
Treatment with hydroxyurea is an option.[12] One hundred five patients with advanced CMML were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing treatment with hydroxyurea versus treatment with etoposide.
Doses were scheduled to be escalated up to hydroxyurea 4 g/d and etoposide 600 mg/week in the absence of response, and finally adjusted to maintain white blood cells between 5 x 10^9/L and 10 x 10^9/L.
Median actuarial survival was 20 months in the hydroxyurea arm, versus 9 months in the etoposide arm (P
Main factors associated with poor survival were allocation to the etoposide arm, Ã¢unfavorableÃ¢ karyotype (i.e., monosomy 7 or complex abnormalities) and anemia.[15]
Bone marrow/stem cell transplantation appears to be the only current treatment that alters the natural history of CMML.
In a review of 118 young MDS patients (median age 24, range 0.3-53 years of age) who received allogeneic bone marrow transplants from matched unrelated donors, the actuarial probability of survival at 2 years for the 12 patients with CMML was 10%.
Transplant-related mortality was influenced by the age of the patient (
This study included patients who received transplants as early as 1986, which may have influenced the patient survival data.[16][Level of evidence: 3iiiA]
The 5-year estimated probability of relapse was 49%.
The data showed a trend for a lower relapse probability of acute graft vs. host disease grade II through IV and for a higher relapse rate in patients with T cell-depleted grafts, suggesting a Ã¢graft-versus-CMML effect.Ã¢ This latter series represents the largest cohort of patients with adult CMML and allogeneic stem cell transplantation to date.[17][Level of evidence: 3iiiA]
A case report suggests that targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate may be effective in a subset of patients with CMML related to PDGFÃŽÂ²R fusion oncogenes.[18]
The designations in PDQ that treatments are Ã¢standardÃ¢ or Ã¢under clinical evaluationÃ¢ are not to be used as a basis for reimbursement determinations.

Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.

Disease overview
Note: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) was classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) under the French-American-British (FAB) scheme.[1] The World Health Organization classification removed JMML from MDS, placing it in the new category Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases (MDS/MPD).[1-3]
JMML (also known as juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) is a rare hematopoietic malignancy of childhood accounting for about 2% of all childhood leukemias.[4]
In children presenting with clinical features suggestive of JMML, a definitive diagnosis requires the following:[5,6]
Major criteria (all 3 required) * No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
* Peripheral blood monocytosis greater than 1 x 10^9/L.
* Less than 20% blasts (including promonocytes) in the blood and bone marrow.
Minor criteria (2 or more required) * Hemoglobin (Hb) F increased for age.
* Immature granulocytes in the peripheral blood.
* White blood cell count greater than 1 x 10^9/L.
* Clonal chromosomal abnormality (e.g., monosomy 7).
* Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors in vitro.
The clinical features of JMML at the time of initial presentation may include the following:[5-8] * Constitutional symptoms (e.g., malaise, pallor and fever) or evidence of an infection.
* Symptoms of bronchitis or tonsillitis (in approximately 50% of cases).
* Bleeding diathesis.
* Maculopapular skin rashes (in 40%-50% of cases).
* Lymphadenopathy (in approximately 75% of cases).
* Hepatosplenomegaly (in most cases).
The clinical and laboratory features of JMML can closely mimic a variety of infectious diseases, including those due to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, histoplasma, mycobacteria, and toxoplasma.
It is important to exclude these and other infectious agents as a cause for the clinical and hematologic findings by appropriate laboratory testing.[5,6,9-11]
JMML typically presents in young children (median age approximately 1 year) and occurs more commonly in boys (male to female ratio approximately 2.5:1).
The cause for JMML is not known.[6] Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk for developing JMML, and up to 14% of cases of JMML occur in children with NF1.[8,12]
Morphologically, the peripheral blood picture in this disease shows leukocytosis, anemia, and frequently, thrombocytopenia.[6-8,13,14] The median reported white blood cell count varies from 25 x 10^9/L to 35 x 10^9/L.
However, in 5% to 10% of children with JMML, it is greater than 100 x 10^9/L.
The leukocytosis is comprised of neutrophils, promyelocytes, myelocytes, and monocytes.
Blasts, including promonocytes, usually account for less than 5% of the white blood cells, and always for less than 20%.
Nucleated red blood cells are seen frequently.
Thrombocytopenia is typical and may be severe.[6-8,13,14] Bone marrow findings include the following:[6,8,13,14]
* Hypercellularity with erythroid precursors (in some patients).
* Monocytes comprising 5% to 10% of marrow cells (30% or more in some patients).
* Minimal dysplasia.
* Reduced numbers of megakaryocytes.
A distinctive characteristic of JMML leukemia cells is their spontaneous proliferation in vitro without the addition of exogenous stimuli, an ability that results from the leukemia cells being hypersensitive to GM-CSF.[15,16] There is no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
Although cytogenetic abnormalities, including monosomy 7, occur in 30% to 40% of patients, none is specific for JMML.[6,14,17] In JMML associated with NF1, loss of the normal NF1 allele is common, and loss of heterozygosity for NF1 has been observed in some patients with JMML who lack the NF1 phenotype.[17]
The median survival times for JMML vary from approximately 10 months to more that 4 years, depending partly on the type of therapy chosen.[7,8,19] Prognosis is related to age at the time of diagnosis.
The prognosis is better in children under 1 year of age at the time of diagnosis.
Children older than 2 years of age at the time of diagnosis have a much worse prognosis.[6,7] A low platelet count and a high Hb F have been associated with a worse prognosis.[8,13]
Treatment overview
There is no consistently effective therapy for JMML.
Historically, more than 90% of patients have died despite the use of chemotherapy.[20] Patients appeared to follow 3 distinct clinical courses: 1.
Rapidly progressive disease and early demise.
2.
Transiently stable disease followed by progression and death.
3.
Clinical improvement that lasted up to 9 years before progression or, rarely, long-term survival.
A recent retrospective review described 60 children with JMML treated with chemotherapy (nonintensive and intensive) and/or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using sibling or unrelated HLA-matched donor marrow or autologous marrow.
The median survival was 4.4 years.[7][Level of evidence: 3iiiA]
BMT seems to offer the best chance of cure for JMML.[4,8,19-22] A summary of the outcome of 91 patients with JMML treated with BMT in 16 different reports is as follows: 38 patients (41%) were still alive at time of reporting, including 30 of the 60 (50%) patients who received grafts from HLA-matched or 1-antigen mismatched familial donors, 2 of 12 (17%) with mismatched donors, and 6 of 19 (32%) with matched unrelated donors.[4]
In a retrospective study investigating the role of BMT for CMML, 43 children with CMML given BMT were evaluated.
In 25 cases, the donor was a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical or a one-antigen-disparate relative, in 4 cases a mismatched family donor, and in 14 cases a matched unrelated donor.
Conditioning regimens consisted of total-body irradiation and chemotherapy in 22 patients, whereas busulfan with other cytotoxic drugs were used in the remaining patients.
Six of 43 patients (14%), 5 of whom received transplants from alternative donors, failed to engraft.
Probabilities of transplant-related mortality for children transplanted from HLA-identical/one-antigen-disparate relatives or from matched unrelated donors/mismatched relatives were 9% and 46%, respectively.
The probability of relapse for the entire group was 58%; the 5-year event-free survival rate was 31%.
The authors of this study concluded that children with CMML and an HLA-compatible relative should be transplanted as early as possible.[19][Level of evidence: 3iiiDi]
In a more recent retrospective review from Japan, the records of 27 children with JMML who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) were examined to determine the role of different variables that potentially influence outcome.
The source of grafts was HLA-identical siblings in 12 cases, HLA-matched unrelated individuals in 10 cases, and HLA-mismatched donors in 5 cases.
Total-body irradiation was used in 18 cases.
Event-free and overall survival (OS) at 4 years after SCT were 54.2% (+/- 11.2% standard error) and 57.9% (+/- 11.0% standard error), respectively.
Six patients died of relapse and 3 of complications.
Patients with abnormal karyotypes showed a significantly lower OS than those with normal karyotypes (P
Patients younger than 1 year of age showed a significantly higher OS than those of 1 year of age or older.
Other variables studied were not associated with OS.
A multivariate analysis of these factors indicated that the abnormal karyotype was the only significant risk factor for lower OS.[23][Level of evidence: 3iiiA]
Treatment with retinoic acid was associated with a decrease in spontaneous colony formation and in GM-CSF hypersensitivity.[24]
Molecular-targeting therapies currently under evaluation include the use of farnesyltransferase inhibitors that prevent RAS protein maturation, which may result in increased tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell growth.[16,25]

Atypical Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
Disease overview
Atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML) is a leukemic disorder that exhibits both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features at the time of diagnosis.
aCML is characterized pathologically by the following:[1]
* Prominent dysgranulopoiesis.
* No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
* Neutrophil precursors (promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes) greater than 10% of white blood cells.
* Minimal absolute basophilia with basophils less than 2% of white blood cells.
* Absolute monocytosis with monocytes typically less than 10% of white blood cells.
* Hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic proliferation and granulocytic dysplasia.
* Less than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow.
* Thrombocytopenia.
Clinical features of aCML include the following:[1-4] * Anemia.
* Thrombocytopenia.
* Splenomegaly (in 75% of cases).
Although cytogenetic abnormalities are found in up to 80% of patients with aCML, none is specific.[1-3,5] There is no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.
The exact incidence of aCML is unknown.
The median age at the time of diagnosis of this rare leukemic disorder has been reported to be in the seventh or eighth decade of life.[1-3]
Morphologically, aCML is characterized by myelodysplasia associated with bone marrow and peripheral blood patterns similar to chronic myelogenous leukemia, but cytogenetically it lacks a Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene.[1] The white blood cell count in the peripheral blood is variable.
Median values range from 35 x 10^9/L to 96 x 10^9/L, and some patients may have white blood cell counts greater than 300 x 10^9/L.[1-3,5] Blasts in the peripheral blood typically account for less than 5% of the white blood cells.
Immature neutrophils usually total 10% to 20% or more.[1] The percentage of monocytes is rarely more than 10%.
Minimal basophilia may be present.[1-3,5] Nuclear abnormalities, such as acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, may be seen in the neutrophils.
Moderate anemia (often showing changes indicative of dyserythropoiesis) and thrombocytopenia are common.[1-4] Bone marrow findings include the following: [1-3,5]
* Blast count less than 20%.
* Dysgranulopoiesis * Megakaryocytic dysplasia.
* Erythroid precursors greater than 30% of marrow cells with dyserythropoiesis present (in some cases).
The median survival times for aCML are reported to be less than 20 months, and thrombocytopenia and marked anemia are poor prognostic factors.[1,2] Atypical CML evolves to acute leukemia in approximately 25% to 40% of patients.[1,3]
Treatment overview
The optimal treatment of aCML is uncertain, due in part to the rare incidence of this chronic leukemic disorder.
Treatment with hydroxyurea may lead to short-lived partial remissions of 2 to 4 months duration.[4] It appears that aCML responds poorly to treatment with interferon-ÃŽÂ±.[4]
Current clinical trials
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.
Entry requirements and suitability for individual patients often vary from one trial to another.

Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Disease, Unclassifiable
Disease overview
Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Disease, Unclassifiable (MDS/MPD-U) (also known as mixed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassifiable and Ã¢overlapÃ¢ syndrome, unclassifiable) shows features of both myeloproliferative disease and myelodysplastic disease but does not meet the criteria for any of the other MDS/MPD entities.[1]
Diagnostic criteria for MDS/MPD-U can be either:[1] 1.
The combination of all four sets of criteria (a-d): a.
Clinical, laboratory and morphologic features of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess of blasts), with less than 20% blasts in the blood and bone marrow. b. Prominent myeloproliferative features, e.g. platelet count greater than 600 x 10^9/L associated with megakaryocytic proliferation, or white blood cell count greater than 13.0 x 10^9/L with or without splenomegaly. c.
No history of an underlying chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD), MDS, or recent cytotoxic or growth factor therapy that could cause the myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative features.
d.
No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene, del(5q), t(3;3)(q21;q26), or inv(3)(q21q26).
2.
Mixed myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic features that cannot be assigned to any other category of MDS, CMPD or MDS/MPD.
Clinical characteristics of MDS/MPD-U include the following: * Features of both MDS and CMPD.
* Hepatomegaly.
* Splenomegaly.
The incidence and etiology of MDS/MPD-U are unknown.
Laboratory features typically include anemia and dimorphic erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear.[1] Thrombocytosis (platelet count 
Neutrophils may exhibit dysplastic features, and giant or hypogranular platelets may be present.
Blasts make up less than 20% of the white blood cells and of the nucleated cells of the bone marrow.
The bone marrow is hypercellular and may exhibit proliferation in any or all of the myeloid lineages.
Dysplastic features are present in at least one cell line.[1]
There are no cytogenetic or molecular findings specific for MDS/MPD-U.
Due to its rare occurrence, the prognosis and predictive factors are unknown.[1]
Treatment overview
Because of its rare occurrence, there is little literature that specifically addresses the treatment of MDS/MPD-U. Supportive care involves treating cytopenias and infection as necessary.
Current clinical trials
Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.
Entry requirements and suitability for individual patients often vary from one trial to another.
