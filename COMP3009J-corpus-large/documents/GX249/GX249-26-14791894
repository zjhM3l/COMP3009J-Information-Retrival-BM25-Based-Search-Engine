ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on October 5, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against The Wheel Bar, Inc., t/a The Wheel, License Number R-SS-9652 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on August 18, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises.
An administrative hearing was conducted on February 9, 1999, at Two Parkway Center, 875 Greentree Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The Bureau was represented by Richard Parker, Esquire.
Licensee did not appear personally or through legal counsel.
After hearing the testimony presented, and upon review of the evidence submitted, the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are entered:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
1.
The Bureau commenced its investigation of Licensee's premises on July 30, 1997, and completed its investigation on September 2, 1998.
(Exhibit C-1)
2.
The Bureau notified Licensee of the nature of the alleged violation(s) disclosed by its investigation by letter dated September 14, 1998, which was sent by certified mail to Licensee's premises.
(Exhibit C-2)
3.
The citation was issued on October 5, 1998, and was sent by certified mail which was returned unclaimed, and by first class mail which was not returned.
(Exhibits C-4, C-5)
4.
Licensee's address of premises as listed on its renewal application for the term ending May 31, 1999 is The Wheel Bar, Inc., t/a The Wheel, 3058 Washington Pike, Bridgeville, PA 15017-1404.
(Exhibit C-3)
5.
The notice relative to the date, time and place of the evidentiary hearing was mailed to Licensee's premises on December 23, 1998 by certified mail as well as first class mail.
6.
The aforementioned certified mailing of the notice of hearing was signed for and received by Licensee on December 26, 1998.
7.
On August 18, 1998 at 3:10 p.m., Liquor Control Enforcement Officers Kenneth Ceh, Allen R. Sunday and Officer West conducted an open inspection of Licensee's premises.
(N.T. 6-7, 12)
8.
During the course of this inspection, Officer Sunday examined the two "New Cherry 96" video slot machines and a "Cherry Master" video slot machine which were maintained on the premises.
This examination revealed that each machine was operational and contained a method of clearing accrued credits.
One of the "New Cherry 96" video slot machines and the "Cherry Master" video slot machine were referred to as "5 cent machines," as twenty credits were accrued for every one dollar placed into these machines.
The other "New Cherry 96" video slot machine was referred to as a "quarter machine," as four credits accrued for every dollar placed into this machine.
Play of these slot machines were found to be based on chance rather than skill, and contained the typical "slot machine" characteristics.
(N.T. 7, 12-13)
9.
During the course of this open inspection, Officer Sunday found that accrued credits could be cleared from the two "New Cherry 96" video slot machines by placing a metal object between two boltheads located on the left side of each machine.
Officer Sunday also found that credits could be cleared from the "Cherry Master" video slot machine by simultaneously pressing the "take," "double," and "big" buttons located on that machine.
(N.T. 8-9, 12-13)
10.
The Enforcement officers seized the three video slot machines from Licensee's premises after determining that each machine was operational and contained a method of clearing accrued credits.
(N.T. 7-13)
11.
On September 2, 1998, Enforcement Officer Ceh examined the internal components of the three video slot machines seized from Licensee's premises during the open inspection held on August 18, 1998.
This examination revealed that the three machines each contained internal accounting capabilities relative to recording "coins in" and "coins out," in addition to further verification that these machines contained a method of clearing accrued credits consistent with those findings established during the open inspection.
(N.T. 7-9)
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW :
1.
The notice provisions as prescribed by Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] have been satisfied.
2.
On August 18, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises, in violation of Section 5513 of the Crimes Code, which constitutes "sufficient cause," as that term is used in Section 471 of the Liquor Code, thereby subjecting Licensee to the penalties provided by that Section.
DISCUSSION:
Upon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has clearly established the violation as charged by a preponderance of the evidence.
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Leggens, 542 A.2d 653 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988); Omicron Enterprises, 449 A.2d 857 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1982).
Also see: Two Electronic Poker Game Machines, 465 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1983)
PRIOR RECORD :
Licensee has been licensed since March 28, 1994, and has had one prior violation, to wit:
Citation No. 95-1990.
Fine $500.00.
Waiver of hearing.
1.
Illegal gambling (machines).
May 12 and June 1, 1995.
PENALTY :
Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] prescribes a penalty of license suspension or revocation or a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00 or both for violations of the type found in this case.
The record discloses that Licensee has had a prior gambling offense at Citation Number 95-1990.
Therefore, Licensee shall not be afforded consideration as a first offender.
Moreover, this court notes that Licensee's failure to submit a pre-hearing memorandum as directed by this court on November 20, 1998, as well as its failure to appear at the administrative hearing demonstrates a clear lack of interest in this liquor license.
Licensee is advised that fines imposed by this Office in connection with its unlawful possession and/or operation of gambling machines on its premises shall not be viewed as a "cost of doing business."
For the foregoing reasons, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount of $1,000.00.
ORDER :
THEREFORE, it is hereby ordered that The Wheel Bar, Inc., t/a The Wheel, License Number R-SS-9652, pay a fine of $1,000.00 within 20 days of the mailing date of this Order.
In the event the aforementioned fine is not paid within 20 days from the mailing date of this Order, Licensee's license shall be suspended or revoked.
The fine must be paid by Treasurer's Check, Cashier's Check, Certified Check or Money Order.
Personal checks, which include business-use personal checks, are not acceptable.
Please make your guaranteed check payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and mail to:
