ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on April 20, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against V.F.W.
Social Club, Hamilton-Maloy Post 595, License Number CC-2617 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513] in that on March 4, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises.
An administrative hearing was conducted on September 8, 1998, at Two Parkway Center, 875 Greentree Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The Bureau was represented by Richard Parker, Esquire.
Licensee did not appear personally or through legal counsel.
After hearing the testimony presented, and upon review of the evidence submitted, the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are entered:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
1.
The Bureau commenced its investigation of Licensee's premises on February 19, 1997, and completed its investigation on March 18, 1998.
(Exhibit C-1)
2.
The Bureau notified Licensee of the nature of the violation(s) disclosed by its investigation by letter dated March 18, 1998, which was sent by certified mail and received by Licensee on March 20, 1998.
(Exhibit C-2)
3.
The citation was issued on April 20, 1998, and was sent by certified mail and received by Licensee on April 23, 1998.
(Exhibits C-3, C-4)
4.
The notice relative to the date, time, and place of the evidentiary hearing was mailed to Licensee's premises on July 22, 1998 by certified mail as well as first class mail.
5.
The aforementioned certified mailing of the notice of hearing was signed for and received by Licensee on July 24, 1998.
6.
On March 4, 1998 at 9:20 p.m., Liquor Control Enforcement Officers Kenneth Ceh and Joseph Cozzoli conducted an open inspection of Licensee's premises, after identifying themselves to Licensee's Club Steward, Michael B. Lane who was in charge of the premises and rendering service to nine patrons.
(N.T. 6-8)
7.
During this open inspection, Officer Cozzoli observed that Licensee maintained two "Dodge City" video poker machines, and two "Super Cherry Master" video slot machines on the premises.
(N.T. 6-8)
8.
Officer Cozzoli proceeded to inspect the four video machines, and determined that each of the two "Super Cherry Master" video slot machines was operational and contained a method of clearing accrued credits by placing a magnet on the left side of the video screen.
Subsequent to placing currency into each of the video slot machines, playing each machine and clearing credits by use of the magnet, these machines were seized.
The two "Dodge City" video poker machines were not seized, as Officer Cozzoli was unable to verify that these machines contained a method of clearing accrued credits.
(N.T. 8-10)
9.
On March 12, 1998, Enforcement Officer Ceh examined the internal components of the two "Super Cherry Master" video slot machines seized from Licensee's premises on March 4, 1998.
(N.T. 10-11)
10.
This examination revealed that each machine accepted currency and provided the player with 20 credits for each one dollar inserted into the machine.
Upon play of each machine, Officer Ceh found that the results were determined by chance, and that the credits were able to be cleared by placing a magnet on the left side of the screen.
Each machine also contained video accounting capabilities.
(N.T. 11-14)
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
1.
The notice provisions as prescribed by Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] have been satisfied.
2.
On March 4, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia on its licensed premises, in violation of Section 5513 of the Crimes Code, which constitutes "sufficient cause," as that term is used in Section 471 of the Liquor Code, thereby subjecting Licensee to the penalties provided by that Section.
DISCUSSION:
Upon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has established the violation as charged by a clear preponderance of the evidence.
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Leggens, 542 A.2d 653 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988); Omicron Enterprises, 449 A.2d 857 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1982).
Also see: Two Electronic Poker Game Machines, 465 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1983).
PRIOR RECORD :
Licensee has been licensed since August 5, 1935, and has had one prior violation(s) since July 1, 1987, the date of establishment of the Office of Administrative Law Judge, to wit: Citation No. 94-1114.

Licensee is advised that its possession and operation of electronic poker machines, slot machines, or similar devices used for gambling purposes on its licensed premises constitutes a relatively severe gambling offense warranting more than a minimal penalty.
For the foregoing reasons, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount of $750.00.
