Statement of Purpose / Fiscal Impact
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
RS 13717C1
This legislation amends Section 18-3101, Idaho Code, to more clearly define and strengthen the current law relating to the prohibition of pyramid promotional schemes in Idaho.
This bill will differentiate between legitimate direct selling opportunities and inherently fraudulent pyramid schemes by creating a clear and specific set of definitions, and thus, protect Idaho residents from becoming potential victims of illegal pyramid promotional schemes by giving law enforcement better tools to prosecute.
Not only will this bill protect the potential victims of current and future fraudulent pyramidschemes, but it will also protect the estimated 60,000 Idaho citizens who supplement their incomes through legitimate direct selling opportunities.
FISCAL IMPACT
There is no anticipated fiscal impact.
