GOVERNOR PROTECTS CONSUMERS FROM PRODUCTS CONTAINING DANGEROUS HERB Thursday MAY 23, 1996 __________________________________________________________________ Citing a danger to New York's youth from products such as Herbal Ecstasy, Governor George E. Pataki has directed thecommissioners of Health and Agriculture 
"It is sad that our youth are being tempted to use these products as if they were vitamins, M 
"These products are marketed to young people as safe and legal alternatives to street drugs," the Governor said.
"Users may be unaware that ephedrine is a stimulant that can have potentially dangerous effects on the nervous system and heart."
Acting under State Public Health Law, Health Commissioner Barbara A. DeBuono, M.D., has issued an order banning the sale or distribution in New York State of herbal stimulants containing ephedrine that are being marketed to youth via the Internet, magazine ads, and displays in health food stores, convenience stores and drug paraphernalia or "head shops."

The stimulants come in pill, powder or liquid form and have suggestive brand names such as Herbal Ecstasy, Ultimate Xphoria, Legal Weed, Buzz Tablets and Cloud 9.
Package labels claim or imply that the products will produce effects associated with illicit drug use, including euphoria, increased sexual sensation, heightened awareness, increased energy, and a natural high.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned that products containing ephedrine have been implicated in hundreds of health problems and 15 deaths nationwide.
Possible adverse reactions to ephedrine range from dizziness and gastrointestinal distress to irregular heartbeat, heart palpitations, heart attack, stroke, seizures, psychosis and death.
Ephedrine is a stimulant derived from Ephedra plants grown in Asia; it also can be made synthetically.
Ephedrine has legitimate medical uses, primarily as the active ingredient in bronchial dilators for asthmatics.
Prescription or over-the-counter medications containing ephedrine are not subject to the ban.
Products subject to the ban and recall might not list ephedrine as an ingredient.
Labels typically list such ingredients as ma huang, Chinese ephedra, ma huang extract, ephedra, Ephedra sinica, ephedra extract, ephedra herb powder, or epitonin.
Any of these ingredients listed on the label indicates the presence of ephedrine in the product.
The Health Department's ban on the sale of 20 specific products containing ephedrine takes effect immediately.
Manufacturers and distributors of the specified products will have an opportunity to attend a hearing on June 4 to present any proof that the sale or distribution of their products does not pose a danger to the citizens of New York.
Local public health directors will help enforce the ban through spot checks, investigating complaints and warning consumers.
Willful violations can carry civil penalties of a $2,000 fine or criminal penalties of up to one year in prison.
The Department of Agriculture 
all New York distributors of the drinks by Thursday.
Failure to comply with this request may result in seizure of the products and other legal enforcement sanctions.
"I commend Senator D'Amato for seeking to address this problem on a national level," Governor Pataki said.
"Our efforts to ban the sale of these so-called 'herbal highs' will be enhanced by congressional passage of the Senator's bill.
But until this bill is the law of the land, I feel we must act immediately to protect New Yorkers."
Governor Pataki's action comes two days after U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato introduced federal legislation to classify as a drug any dietary supplement with labeling or advertising implying that the supplement produces euphoria, heightened awareness or similar mental or psychological effects.
Senator D'Amato's bill is co-sponsored by Senators Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Bill Frist (R-Tenn).
