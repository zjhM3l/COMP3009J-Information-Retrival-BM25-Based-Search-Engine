The Fund is a revolving fund for carrying out the purposes of the Authority.
Subject to approval by the Board of Public Works, the Authority may hold an ownership interest in and operate a professional football or major league baseball team or team franchise, on a temporary basis, during a transition of the team or team franchise to private ownership.

In the sports complex at Camden Yards, the Ravens' new home opened September 6, 1998.
Originally called PSINet Stadium, the field was called Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards from February 28, 2002 until May 6, 2003.
It was renamed M 
Located at 33rd Street in northeast Baltimore, Memorial Stadium had been vacant since the Ravens' move.
