Strategic Plan Overview
The strategic plan for Department of Fish and Wildlife focuses the direction of the department's efforts toward four areas of concern: resource conservation, recreation, human health and safety, and efficient operations and effective management.
The resource conservation section reflects the vital importance of land and water to the Department's mission.
For the first time, measurable indicators are identified to help us see how well we are doing.
Three outcomes are proposed.
The first focuses on natural communities and habitat, the second on species conservation, and the last on the public's support and understanding of the importance of land conservation and stewardship.
We will start to measure and hold ourselves accountable for results.
The focus of the recreation section is to encourage participation and improve user satisfaction by providing a diversity of fish and wildlife-based recreation opportunities, within the ecological limits of the resources.
Participation in fish and wildlife-based activities is significant because the public who participates generally possesses a land stewardship ethic and appreciation for natural landscapes and habitats, which is key in the department's efforts to maintain ecosystem integrity in the face of development, suburban sprawl and other human impacts.
The human health and safety section of this plan is new and details an aspect of the department's responsibilities that is not always recognized, but which impacts the quality of life for Vermonters.
The department's focus will be to limit the number of harmful encounters with wildlife through a variety of actions, as well as provide assistance in responding to emergency incidents, search and rescues, and enforcing laws to prevent flagrant violations which threaten human health and safety.
Finally, to accomplish its mission, the Department of Fish and Wildlife must have effective management and operate efficiently.
To do this the factors that contribute to efficient operations and effective management were identified and measures or indicators set.
Fourteen areas were identified and objectives set based on our past performance and the performance of other state fish and wildlife agencies.
The goal of this section is to ensure the department is effectively managed and efficiently operated so that the mission, goals and outcomes of this department are attained.
This strategic plan will provide guidance in the conservation and sustainable use of Vermont's fish and wildlife resources and convey measures of effectiveness in managing these resources.
The plan looks to the following goals and outcomes to move the Department of Fish and Wildlife forward in meeting the challenges of the future:
GOAL : Conserve, enhance, and restore the ecological integrity of Vermont's natural communities and habitats and the ecological processes that sustain them.
Detailed Discussion
Outcome I: Conserve, restore, and enhance natural communities and habitats that have high wildlife and ecological value in Vermont; to preserve ecosystem integrity.
Outcome II: Conserve and restore Vermont's fish and wildlife species to maintain ecosystem integrity for the benefit of the public.

Mission and Philosophy of the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife
The Preamble to the Department Mission and Philosophy
We as employees of the Fish and Wildlife Department, are public servants and stewards of fish and wildlife resources.
Our every power is derived from law, and our only authority is that given us by the people of Vermont.
The following articles of Vermont law and the State Constitution, and the following mission statement express our philosophy, and constitute our vision of our mandate.
Mandates: The Fish and Wildlife Department is specifically charged with promulgating and enforcing rules and procedures, and conducting programs which implement these policy statements:
"That all power being originally inherent in and consequently derived from the people, therefore, all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants; and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to them" (Vermont Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 6).
"The inhabitants of this State shall have liberty in seasonable times, to hunt and fowl on the lands they hold, and on other lands not enclosed, and in like manner to fish in all boatable and the waters (not private property) under proper regulations" (Vermont Constitution, Chapter 2, Article 67).
"It is the policy of the state that the protection, propagation, control, management and conservation of the fish, game, and furbearing animals in this state is in the interest of the public welfare, and that safeguarding of these valuable resources for the people of the state requires a constant and continual vigilance" (10 V.S.A.
Section 4081).
Mission Statement
The mission of the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife is the conservation of all species of fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the people of Vermont.
In order to accomplish this mission, the integrity, diversity and vitality of their natural systems must be protected.
Department Philosophy
We believe that fish and wildlife resources are part of the natural systems which sustain us all, and add meaning to our lives.
We believe it is desirable and appropriate for people to enjoy fish and wildlife resources.
To carry out our mission, and in accordance with our beliefs, we must communicate with the public about the economic, educational, and scientific values of fish and wildlife and their habitats, and the outcomes of human interactions with those resources.
We acknowledge the importance of the public's role in our work, and encourage citizen participation in our resource management.

Introduction
This document is the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife's second strategic plan.
It was developed by teams comprised of representatives from each major Department work unit.
Organization of this plan may be new -- it is shorter and redundant strategies (now referred to as focus actions) have been eliminated -- but many of the ideas found in the first one are carried forward herein.
The plan specifies goals and outcomes that can be achieved by continuing to do current work that constitutes the backbone of our organization while encouraging actions that will achieve the measurable indicators of its work.
It does not attempt to identify all the work activities of the Department.
This core work of department employees is too extensive to describe in this report, and is the foundation of the Department's efforts to protect fish, wildlife and plant resources (See Appendix I for a list of department projects).
Instead, for a strategic approach, the plan emphasizes focus actions which enhance the effect of our current core work.
The Department's leaders take this document very seriously and will make every effort to implement it.
Hopefully, as you read this, you can visualize the positive impact this plan will have on positioning the Department to meet its near-term and future challenges.

Background on the Department of Fish and Wildlife
The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife's history extends back to 1886.
In that year, the legislature appointed a Board of Fish Commissioners.
A decade later this board was given authority over game birds and mammals, and in 1892 the Board of Fish Commissioners was renamed the Fish and Game Commission.
Even though the Department's initial focus was on game fish and animals, and associated recreational pursuits, it was concerned for the welfare of all fish and wildlife.
This was formally recognized in 1983 when the department's name was changed from Fish and "Game" to Fish and "Wildlife."
The Department is responsible for the conservation of wildlife in its broadest sense: 41 species of reptiles and amphibians, 89 species of fish, 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, plus fungi, algae, and 76 different types of natural communities.
The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife is presently staffed by 123 dedicated individuals, all committed to its written mission of conserving fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the people of Vermont.
These people work at desks, navigate boats, walk through fields and woods, and travel in the department's trademark green trucks every day.
They issue licenses, send out films and literature, tag and stock fish, acquire land, weigh deer, monitor threatened and endangered species, respond to animal damage complaints, attend public meetings, evaluate hydroelectric proposals, and enforce laws, to name only a few of the many duties and responsibilities of department staff.
Because the plan directs attention to new or key focus actions, this should not be construed to mean that many current activities are of less value or importance.
Habitat conservation and management through planning, education, regulations, and acquisition will continue to be pursued.
The quality of Vermont's aquatic and wildlife habitat will ultimately determine the ability of the water and land to support healthy fish and wildlife populations.
Biologists will continue to inventory, monitor, and manage many different plant, fish and wildlife species, and natural communities.
Reliable information on the status of Vermont's fish and wildlife populations and natural communities is essential to adequately protect and manage these important resources.
Fish will continue to be stocked in the waters of the state to restore sustainable fisheries and to enhance recreation.
Wardens will continue to protect fish and wildlife resources from misuse or overuse in accord with the laws and regulations of the state.
They will continue to offer assistance for protecting human health and safety, and they will respond to damage complaints.
Outreach, marketing, and addressing customer needs will continue to be important activities.
We will produce educational materials; produce programs; participate in selected fairs and outdoor shows; train future hunters, trappers and anglers; and sell licenses in buyer-helpful ways.
The Department will continue to manage or operate its 182 fishing and boating access areas and its 84 wildlife management areas totaling over 100,000 acres, its two youth conservation camps, and its five fish hatcheries.
The development of new and better access for wildlife viewing, hunting, fishing and trapping will continue to be pursued as budgets permit.
The opportunity for the public to access Vermont's waters and lands is essential for long term participation and enjoyment of angling, wildlife harvesting and viewing experiences.
In sum, the Department of Fish and Wildlife already conducts many important activities that have successfully conserved and restored Vermont's abundant fish and wildlife, resources enjoyed and appreciated by as many as 80 percent of the state's inhabitants.
Increasing demands for limited staff time, the challenge of dealing with new management issues, and the complexity of modern problem-solving require, however, that some energy be diverted from these tasks, some tasks be done in a different way and some new tasks be undertaken so that the department can better effect meaningful change for the future.
This plan is intended to help that occur throughout the Department.

GOAL A
[img.gif]
Preamble: This section of the strategic plan addresses conservation of ecosystems, including their component species and processes.
An ecosystem is a complex array of organisms, their natural environment, the interactions between them, and the ecological process that sustain the system.
Vermont's landscape has been significantly altered during the past few hundred years of intense human use, yet we retain more of our natural heritage than many other places.
Some nonnative species are well established and valued by Vermonters, such as brown and rainbow trout, eastern cottontail rabbit, many roadside plants, and ornamental trees.
There are also invasive, nonnative species such as zebra mussel, purple loosestrife, and phragmites reed that threaten ecosystems.
As a department, we hope to conserve our ecosystems and resist unwanted changes due to habitat loss and invasion by nonnatives.
The following words written by Aldo Leopold were prophetic and may be even more applicable today: " The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant: "what good is it?" If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every part is good, whether we understand it or not.
If the biota, in the course of aeons, has built something we like but don't understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts.
To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering."
As human populations increase in Vermont, the pressure on our wildlife and the natural processes that support them increases also.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife believes it is important to conserve the state's ecosystems and all the integral 'cogs and wheels'.
Goal A : Outcome I: Conserve, restore, and enhance natural communities and habitats that have high wildlife and ecological value in Vermont; to preserve ecosystem integrity.
Indicators: * An increase in the percentage of river and stream miles that fully support the Vermont Water Quality Standards designated use of Aquatic Habitat.
Currently 58 percent of Vermont's river miles fully support the designated use of aquatic habitat (Water Quality Assessment 305(b)).
* No net loss in the number of miles of free flowing, unaltered streams in Vermont.
Presently, 295 miles of rivers in Vermont are impaired by flow alterations.
* An increase in the number of miles of river with acceptable riparian buffers.
* An increase in the number of acres of habitat conserved through acquisition, easements, etc., from the 1998 base of 98,387 acres of fee and 7,528 acres of less than fee ownership (Agency of Natural Resources land records).
* An increase in the health of native freshwater mussel communities.
* No net increase in the distribution of invasive species.
* An increase in the cumulative acres of habitat and shoreline protected through the regulatory process from the current inventory of 7,545 acres of winter deer habitat, 10,500 acres of bear habitat, 798 acres of wetlands, and 65,841 linear feet of shoreline (Federal Aid Report Technical Assistance Report).
* An increase in the number of wildlife management areas with biodiversity assessments.
Currently, one wildlife management area has a completed assessment.
Focus Actions
Challenges: Fragmentation, isolation, and degradation of remaining fish, wildlife, natural communities, and plant habitat is occurring as a result of continuing land use changes and invasion and introduction of exotics.
The sustainability of ecosystems is at risk.
Protection and conservation of species and habitats requires efficient and extensive law enforcement activities.
Currently laws related to habitat protection and conservation fall under the jurisdiction of the environmental board and Department of Environmental Conservation.
The enforcement structure does not allow effective enforcement by Game Wardens
* 1 Prioritize and implement department land conservation efforts to reduce the loss of high-value areas such as rare or significant communities, corridors, and riparian, aquatic, and wildlife habitats throughout Vermont.
* 2.
Participate more effectively in regulatory activities to protect significant natural communities, endangered and threatened species, and fish and wildlife habitats.
* 3.
Manage all department lands to reflect the intent of the purchase, while maintaining the ecological values of the parcel, and to implement ecosystem management.
Conduct one biodiversity assessment per year on existing department lands.
* 4.
Develop and implement exotic plant and animal policies to protect ecosystem health and stability.
* 5.
Increase efforts to inventory and monitor wildlife habitats and natural communities.
* 6.
Increase efforts to manage and restore high-value habitats and natural communities.
* 7.
Improve technical assistance to the public involved in regulatory activities affecting fish and wildlife ecosystems to minimize the adverse impacts humans have on natural systems.
* 8.
Work with private landowners and consulting foresters to promote land conservation on high-value areas (Guidelines for Management on Private Lands).
* 9.
Change enforcement structure so wardens can enforce laws relating to fish and wildlife habitat degradation.
* 10.
Develop guidelines for acceptable riparian buffers and generate baseline information for use in the next planning cycle.
* 11.
Develop process for measuring health of freshwater mussel communities and generate baseline information for next planning cycle.
Goal A : Outcome II: Conserve and restore Vermont's fish and wildlife species to maintain ecosystem integrity for the benefit of the public.
Indicators:
* Maintain at least 47% of Vermont's land mass as occupied black bear range.
* A decrease in the number of listed and status of endangered and threatened species for animals and plants from the current twenty (20) endangered and fourteen (14) threatened animal species, and sixty-one (61) endangered and ninety-two (92) threatened plant species.
* Successfully restore the Connecticut River American Shad and Atlantic Salmon populations by maintaining a consistent annual shad run of 30,000 fish at Vernon, and an annual estimated salmon smolt production of 150,000 fish in Vermont tributaries.
* Maintain and enhance self-sustaining trout population levels.
* An increase in the amount of conserved lands that protect threatened and endangered species and significant natural communities.
Currently 25.1% of threatened and endangered species and 29.4% of significant natural communities occur on conserved lands.
* Monitor breeding bird survey trends (US Fish and Wildlife Service data)
Focus Actions
Challenges: Need to acquire better information on wildlife species composition, abundance and distribution characteristics as well as the current status and the effects of regulated harvest on Vermont's fish and wildlife.
In addition, there are human-induced threats on these resources that need to be monitored.
* 12.
Inventory and monitor the abundance and distribution of Vermont's fish and wildlife species and assess their well-being by:
* + Establishing and maintaining a computerized database of existing information.
+ Identifying and prioritizing inventory needs so that the most important work is completed first.
+ Collecting inventory and monitoring information according to the priority needs.
+ Develop abundance and distribution objectives for fish and wildlife species and, where appropriate, prepare species management plans based on ecological considerations.
Plans should take into consideration social impacts and the benefits of choosing one population objective over another.
Monitor the number and/or harvest of selected species to maintain sustainable levels of populations within ecological limits.
* 13.
Coordinate more effectively with other agencies and organizations to develop and implement recovery plans for specific threatened or endangered species.
* 14.
Develop a process for using existing data sets on trout population levels as an indicator.
Goal A : Outcome III: Increase the public's support and understanding of land conservation issues and promote and facilitate a land stewardship ethic in Vermont.
Indicators:
The following are used as measures of public support for the department's mission: * Maintain or increase Vermont's 4^th place national standing in percentage of taxpayers contributing and 1^st place national standing in per capita donation level of $10.78 to the Non-Game Wildlife fund on the income tax form.
* The number of sportsmen's licenses sold compared to general hunting license sales.
* An increase in the number of conservation license plates sold from the current base of 5,200.
* The number of towns with a conservation commission or its equivalent.
Currently there are 63.
* An increase in the level of public knowledge (particularly youth) about the relationship between human activities, conservation ethics, habitat loss and biodiversity.
* An increase in the percentage of news releases, publications, etc., produced by the Department that relate to conservation ethics and habitat loss from the current average of 8% and 5%, respectively.
* An increase in the number of volunteer hours contributed to department programs from the current base of 7,137 hours.
Focus Actions
Challenges: As the human population increases in Vermont, the potential for adverse impacts on fish and wildlife, natural and plant communities also increases.
The future integrity of Vermont's ecosystems and dependent fish and wildlife resources are at risk because, as Leopold said in a Sand County Almanac, "...man-made changes are of a different order than evolutionary changes, and have effects more comprehensive or foreseen."
The public is not always aware of the adverse impacts human activities can have on the environment or the importance of sustaining fish, wildlife, and plants.
In addition, as the traditional rural culture in Vermont becomes more suburbanized, fewer people are directly connected to the land.
Therefore, a declining number of Vermonters recognize the ecological value of sustainable utilization of natural resource * 15.
Develop and define a department land stewardship message that will promote the conservation and appropriate and ethical use of Vermont's terrestrial and aquatic communities.
Provide training for all department employees so message will be incorporated into all outreach programs and all contacts with the public.
* 16.
In partnership with town government agencies, educational institutions, private conservation organizations, town conservation commissions, and businesses to implement land use planning strategies and develop conservation strategies for towns and regional planning.
* 17.
Focus more of our public outreach program on issues that relate to habitat degradation and fragmentation, threats to wildlife and natural resources, and the importance of natural resources so the public is better able to make informed decisions affecting ecosystems in Vermont.
* 18.
Emphasize the importance of habitat conservation and a land ethic in all existing department youth programs (camps, teacher programs, hunter and trapper education).
* 19.
Work with other outdoor youth camps to incorporate a habitat conservation and land stewardship ethic into their programs.
* 20.
Develop materials and training methods relating to land stewardship and human/wildlife relationships.
Provide materials to teachers and other educators to enhance their ability to deliver these important messages.
* 21.
Increase efforts to raise awareness of urban and suburban residents to the value of working rural landscapes which includes the sustainable and ethical utilization of fish and wildlife resources.
* 22.
Provide training and encouragement to all department employees and volunteers to assist wardens in the enforcement of law, monitoring compliance with Act 250 conditions and assist environmental enforcement officers in the enforcement of Department of Environmental Conservation laws.
* 23.
Because wardens are the department's first line of contact with the public, an effort should be made by them to emphasize the land stewardship and conservation ethic with their contacts.
* 24.
Involve Vermonters in activities that will increase their understanding of land stewardship and the influences of human activities on fish and wildlife resources, in order to build public support for fish and wildlife conservation.
* 25.
Enhance our ability to coordinate and encourage volunteer efforts within the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife.
* 26.
Develop a process to collect information regarding the level of public knowledge about outdoor ethics, conservation, habitat loss and biodiversity.
* 27.
Increase the percentage of news releases and publications produced by the Department that relate to conservation, outdoor ethics, biodiversity and habitat loss.

GOAL B
[img1.gif]
Preamble: Hunting, fishing, trapping and observing wildlife are rich traditions and an integral part of Vermont's culture and heritage.
People in Vermont have always looked to the land in securing food for their table, and for relaxation through watching wildlife and observing nature in general.
Today many Vermonter's still look to the land, and the utilization of fish, wildlife and plants as part of their life style and as a means for securing nutritious food for their families.
Each year during regulated seasons, thousands of pounds of venison, fish and fowl are harvested by the public in Vermont.
This meat is consumed in households throughout the region.
Likewise each year thousands of residents and visitors alike spend time watching, learning and admiring Vermont fish, wildlife, plants and the landscape that sustains them.
All these activities significantly enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike.
Equally important is the fact that regulated hunting, trapping and fishing allows people to meet their needs and provide for their families, yet it does not alter or destroy fish or wildlife habitat in the state.
In fact, these hunting and fishing activities re-enforce the need to keep habitat in a wild state.
This regulated harvest of fish and wildlife resources, as well as observing nature in natural wild settings contribute toward the public good and are part of the quality of life people enjoy in Vermont.
Additionally, these activities foster stewardship toward lands and habitats and raises the knowledge and concern for wildlife and the environment by the public who choose to participate.
While increased participation in fish and wildlife-related activities (e.g., wildlife viewing, feeding, photographing, hunting, fishing, trapping) may be desirable, the Department recognizes the need to carefully balance the demand, to ensure that neither the quality of these experiences nor the natural resources which sustain them are compromised.
It is the Department's mission to act as sentinel and steward to the task of safe guarding Vermont's valuable fish and wildlife resources for the people of the state, through a constant and continual vigilance.
With direction from these fundamental premises, this strategic plan looks to the following to move toward these areas of concern:
Goal B : Outcome IV: Provide a diversity of wildlife harvest opportunities, consistent with conservation goals and within ecological limits, that is indicated by user participation measures and satisfaction levels.
Harvest Participation Indicators: * The percentage of adults (ages 16 and older) participating in hunting in Vermont ranking within the top 25% of the states nationally, and the top two states regionally; as measured by the USFWS National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation (year 2001).
* Youth participation as a increase in the percentage of youth ages 10-17 participating in hunting in Vermont; as measured by the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife junior licenses issued.
* The average number of days spent hunting for big game, small game, migratory bird and other animals; ranking within the top 20% of states, as measured by the USFWS National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation (year 2001).
* Maintain the total number of person days spent afield, and related harvest levels measured by the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife annual regulated trapping survey.
* The total number of person days spent training, scouting and hunting afield; as measured by the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife periodic big game species hunter survey.
* The amount of wild meat, fish, and other provisions from wildlife resources annually harvested under regulated seasons, at sustainable levels.
Harvester Participation Satisfaction Indicators:
* Changes of public satisfaction levels from surveys.
Maintain an overall "very satisfied" or "satisfied" rating among users of Vermont's wildlife and lands and other publics interacting with Vermont's wildlife,or participating in a department-sponsored program.
* Public access to regulated harvest opportunities on Department of Fish and Wildlife lands will be improved or enhanced, as measured by:
+ the total acreage available, total miles of stream bank under Department of Fish and Wildlife ownership (number of miles of streams, acres of additional ownership, or improved public access).
+ Improved or enhanced public access due to department efforts (including cooperative ventures with other public and private organizations such as The Vermont Land Trust, Federal Agencies etc.).
* Public satisfaction as measured by surveys at open houses or other public involvement processes for developing species management plans.
* A 95% or greater compliance rate of licensed hunters and trappers participating afield.
(*regionally - includes the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York)
Focus Actions
Challenge: As human populations increase, social and demographic changes relating to expanding urban and suburban populations result in shifts in traditional cultures and values related to the utilization of animals in society and the role of humans within the environment.
These changes may result in less support for sustaining fish and wildlife resources and utilization of these resources and associated quality of life benefits related to one's access and opportunity to harvest natural foods.
Vermont residents and visitors should understand, support, and act to benefit the management of fish, wildlife and their habitat.
* 28.
Develop a communications plan which incorporates the idea of a "Working Vermont Landscape"; explaining conservation issues, the concept of utilizing wildlife, harvest methodologies, the importance of wildlife habitat, threaten and endangered species, and the ecological appropriateness of various human activities as well as the negative aspects of other human activities.
* 29.
Develop a broad-based education plan that complements communication plan and message, and provides a basic understanding of the Department'smission, goals, programs, environmental issues and responsible ethics to wildlife and habitats.
* 30.
Enhance educational outreach so that 25% or more of Vermont schools will utilize Department of Fish and Wildlife programs and materials to fulfill their curriculum framework.
* 31.
Increase information and opportunities available to youths and families for hands-on experiences harvesting resources, resource conservation activities, or other department programs.
* 32.
Develop and implement a method to measure the effectiveness of current and future public outreach techniques to generate baseline information.
* 33.
Survey and inventory the public for opinions, motivations, and use characteristics to help the Department focus programs to meet or exceed the expectations of the participating public.
Challenge: An important factor identified in limiting wildlife harvesters participation is the availability of free time due to competing interests and activities.
Barriers to entry and participation in opportunities to harvest and utilize wildlife resources need to be identified and a coordinated broad-based plan of reducing barriers initiated.
* 34.
Develop a database of past and current license holders and use it to provide information on changes in hunter and trapper characteristics.
* 35.
Review existing harvest regulations and revise as needed to ensure necessary protection of wildlife resources while minimizing needless complexity for the public who participate in programs.
* 36.
Expand youth initiative program by diversifying the special pre-season opportunities for youths to provide a variety of harvest experiences for first-time hunters or trappers.
Develop a mentor program for trappers.
* 37.
Targeted marketing on new residents to Vermont who have hunted or trapped previously.
Develop an outreach strategy to encourage new hunters and trappers to continue to participate in Vermont.
Partner with local rod and gun clubs when feasible.
* 38.
Develop, update and enhance Wildlife Management Area management plans, and enforce rules and regulations governing public activities on WMA's to maintain and enhance opportunities.
* 39.
Promote the retention of present hunters by managing for multiple satisfactions (e.g., keeping WMA's well marked and aesthetically appealing) and for a range of opportunities (viewing wildlife, naturalistic\wild qualities, harvesting resources).
* 40.
Expand hunter education programs to target various groups, including those initiated at a young age by parents or close relatives, and those initiated at an older age by peers.
Consider the specific needs of each group when developing the programs.
* 41.
Improve and simplify the ability of the public to get needed training before participating in harvest programs, such as more accessible and expanded training locations and time frames.
* 42.
Focus on recruiting present hunters' spouses as a means to promote the social and cultural aspects of the activity.
Challenge: Increasing human populations will expand impacts of people on wildlife habitat.
Urban sprawl and other human development of wildlife habitat will preclude current harvest opportunities because of direct conflict over land use between owners of new developments and traditional fish and wildlife harvesters.
Cultural differences and perceptions of the urban\suburban publics over resource utilization or methodology used in regulated hunting and trapping activities as conducted by members of the public utilizing fish and wildlife resources poses an additional potential for conflict.
* Implement a feasibility study and needs assessment strategy to develop two "field classrooms" to be located at appropriate sites (e.g., a WMA or fish hatchery) that target suburban and urban dwellers.
Major themes to include: a land stewardship ethic, the sustainability of populations of fish, wildlife, plants, the importance of protecting endangered species, the compatibility of regulated hunting, trapping and fishing as appropriate ecological activities and the relevance to the lifestyles of Vermont residents.
Major component of these areas will be self-guided trail systems.
* Develop and enforce regulations to ensure responsible and ethical harvest techniques are employed and preclude the wanton waste of Vermont's fish and wildlife resources.
* Develop informative signs for WMA's that identify ownership, habitat protection function and appropriate activities and time frames of activities at all locations.
Where potential conflicting activities may occur, schedule the activities, separate the location of the activities or employ other collaborative methods to minimize the potential of conflict or user dissatisfaction.
* +
Goal B : Outcome V: Provide a diversity of angling opportunities, consistent with ecosystem conservation goals, and that is indicated by angler participation and satisfaction levels.
Angler Participation Indicators:
* The percentage of adult (ages 16 and older) angler participation ranking within the top 50% of states nationally, and the top two states regionally* for freshwater angling; as measured by the USFWS National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation (year 2001).
* The percentage of child (ages 6 to 15) angler participation ranking within the top 30% of states nationally, and the top two states regionally* for freshwater angling; as measured by the USFWS National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation (year 2001).
* The average number of resident angler days ranking within the top 20% of states nationally, and the top two states regionally* for freshwater angling; as measured by the USFWS National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation (year 2001).
* The percentage change in fishing license sales for resident and nonresident anglers ranking within the top 50% of states nationally, and the top two states regionally*; as measured by the USFWS Federal Aid State License Sales Data.
* The number, miles, or acres of additional or improved public access to Vermont waters due to department efforts (including cooperative ventures with other public and private organizations); and the miles or acres of additional posted lands (Title 10).
Angler Satisfaction Indicators:
* Angler satisfaction level changes from 1996 to 2001 as measured by a state-wide survey of Vermont anglers.
* A 95% or greater compliance rate for licensed anglers participating afield.
(*regionally - includes the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York)

Challenge: As human populations increase, social and demographic changes relating to expanding urban and suburban populations result in shifts in traditional cultures and values related to the utilization of animals in society and the role of humans within the environment.
These changes may result in less support for sustaining fish and wildlife resources and utilization of these resources and associated quality of life benefits related to one's access and opportunity to harvest natural foods.
While increased participation in fish and wildlife related activities may be desirable, we must be careful to ensure it does not compromise the quality of these experiences or the natural resources which sustain them.
* * 46.
Design and implement an outreach campaign which promotes a consistent message about the mission of the Vermont Department of Fish 
Develop themes which increase awareness and understanding of the Department's programs and accomplishments and which acknowledges the support of anglers, hunters, and other wildlife enthusiasts who contribute to department programs.
* 47.
Increase information and opportunities available to youths and families for hands-on experience in angling skills and aquatic resource conservation.
* 48.
Increase educational program effectiveness through volunteer partnerships, similar to the Hunter Education Program, to provide instruction to youths on safe and ethical fishing practices, while improving their knowledge of aquatic resource conservation.
* 49.
Develop a database of past and current license holders that will be used to provide information on changes in Vermont angler characteristics.
* 50.
Survey and inventory anglers for opinions, motivations, and use characteristics to help the Department focus programs to meet or exceed the expectations of the participating public.
Challenge: An important factor identified in limiting angler participation is the availability of free time due to competing interests and activities.
Potential anglers will be less inclined to participate if fishing is perceived to be a complicated activity.
* 51.
Increase information available to the public on how and where to fish.
Investigate the effectiveness of techniques such as "how-to" fishing clinics, fishing tackle loan programs, and media outreach such as the Internet, television, video, radio and printed materials.
Emphasize safe and ethical fishing practices while increasing understanding of aquatic resource conservation.
Target youths and families, and identified low-participation groups.
Optimize the potential outreach benefits associated with the National Fishing Week promotion campaign.

* 53 Develop and implement a procedure to identify, prioritize and obtain, through purchase or easement, long-term public access to important stream fisheries.
Maintain or improve access to public water through private lands by improving relationships among the general public, private landowners, and anglers.
Challenge: The quality of Vermont's aquatic habitat will ultimately determine a stream or lake's ability to support healthy fish populations.
If Vermont is to conserve it's fishery resources and the angling opportunities they provide, then habitat protection and enhancement must be our highest priority.
* 54.
Implement strategies identified under the ecosystem conservation goal.
* 55.
Compile information which effectively demonstrates the economic and social value of healthy aquatic systems and productive fisheries.
Provide information to the public and other constituency.

GOAL C
[img2.gif]
Preamble: It is the policy of the state that the protection, management, and conservation of fish and wildlife in this state is in the best interest of public welfare, while acknowledging that some encounters may be harmful or fatal to humans.
It is in this interest that the Department should strive to limit the number of harmful encounters with wildlife through various means, including the monitoring of occurrences, species management techniques, and public outreach.
The protection of human health and safety is further enhanced by the department's assistance in responding to emergency incidents, search and rescues, and enforcing laws to prevent flagrant violations which threaten human health and safety.
This section of the plan is new, relative to the previous strategic plan.
The following outcomes and focus actions detail an aspect of the department's responsibilities that is not always recognized, but which will impact the quality of life for Vermonters.
Goal C : Outcome VII: Limit the number of human injuries and fatalities caused by wildlife as indicated by:
Indicators:
* The number of big game motor vehicle collisions per year remaining below 770 collision per 100,000 Vermonters and the number of collisions per year resulting in human fatalities remaining below 0.5 fatalities per 100,000 Vermonters.
* The number of human exposures to fish and wildlife species transmittable diseases per year remaining below 25 occurrences per 100,000 Vermonters.

GOAL D
[img3.gif]
Preamble: In order to accomplish its mission the Department of Fish and Wildlife must have effective management and operate efficiently.
A measure of management effectiveness has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Management Assistance Team in collaboration with researchers from Virginia Tech and members of the Organization of Wildlife Planners.
They identified and described factors that determine management effectiveness of the nation's most effective fish and wildlife agencies and identified problem areas.
Management Effectiveness indices were then developed to use as a basic assessment tool, and the nine highly effective agencies were used as benchmarks.
The Management Effectiveness Scan identifies strengths and weaknesses relative to 14 factors, as well as in more detailed diagnostic modules for each factor (Appendix III).
The department was evaluated in 1995 and again in 1998.
Significant improvements were made in the department's management effectiveness.
Factor scores improved for 12 of the 13 factors assessed in both 1995 and 1998 management effectiveness surveys, and in some cases the improvement was dramatic.
Department's managers are committed to continuing to improve and are striving to be in the range of effectiveness of the most effective fish and wildlife agencies in the nation.
They also recognizes other important areas such as customer service not emphasized in the management effectiveness survey.
These other important areas will also be addressed.
Goal D : Outcome IX: To improve the scores of eight effectiveness indicators to a level that meets or exceeds the objective score of the management effectiveness project.
Indicators:
The following 8 factors were identified as areas that were not in the range of the highly effective agencies.
The indicated score represents the level of effectiveness as measured in 1998 scan and the objective value is the measured level of effectiveness the Department will strive to achieve.
In each area, problems will be identified and focus actions developed:
* Planning - budget link (Score: -0.26, Objective: +0.06) * Adequacy of department budget (Score: -0.99, Objective: -0.85) * Relationships with other agencies (Score: +0.57, Objective: +0.69) * Department leadership on issues (Score: -0.22, Objective: +0.55) * Political sensitivity of decision making (Score: +0.48, Objective: +0.57) * Internal relationships - 4 Subcategories (Score: +0.02, Objective: +0.23) * Leader supportiveness (Score: -0.01, Objective: +0.15) * Participation in decision making (Score: -0.12, Objective: +0.15) * Internal communications (Score: +0.11, Objective: +0.24) * Teamwork (Score: +0.17, Objective: +0.27) * Openness to public input - behavior (Score: +0.45, Objective: +0.49)
Focus Actions
Challenge: Planning-Budget Link - The strategic plan does not adequately drive preparation of the budget and allocation of the resources.
* 81.
Develop an operational planning process that include a review process by staff that tie projects submitted to priorities identified in the strategic plan.
* 82.
The strategic plan will be referred to and considered before deploying significant funding or other resources for staff, training, marketing, etc. * 83.
Provide training for all department employees so key themes and messages identified and described in the focus actions (strategies) for public outreach and communication plans will be clearly understood and incorporated into all the Divisions' outreach programs and all contacts with the public.
* 84.
Develop a coding system that tracks project costs.
* 85.
Inform staff of how the operational planning process addresses these needs, and provide evidence of planning and budget links to staff.
* 86.
The Department and each division should report annually on how it is doing on the various plan indicators.
The purpose of this step is not only to measure progress, but to assure staff and stakeholders that progress is made.
Challenge: Adequacy of Department Budget - It is unlikely that a budget would ever be adequate to accomplish all that should be accomplished.
In the past 14 years because of a stagnant funding structure and decreasing revenues, the department's funding base has not kept up with expenses.
Increased funding through a portion of the rooms, meals, and gas taxes have kept us stable.
However, increasing department costs as well as demand for new programs will require an increased funding base.
* 87.
Develop a detailed, in-depth saleable strategy that will move this Department into the 21^st century with adequate funding.
Commissioner should set up a group under his guidance to develop and support this.
* 88.
Support national funding legislation and pro-actively plan for the use of such funds upon availability.
Challenge: Relationships with Other Agencies - Department employees believe the Department does not maintain regular contact with federal, state and, in particular, local government agencies.
* 89.
Communicate current efforts re: programs and issues with federal, state and local agencies.
Make staff aware of the contacts with federal, state and local agencies through Moosetrack articles and other means.
* 90.
The district structure is to provide closer communications with local and regional publics.
Each district will identify local agencies routinely worked with and/or contacted and this list will be shared with the rest of the department staff.
Challenge: Department Leadership on Issues - The Department was not recognized by staff as being a leader in national and/or regional conservation issues.
* 91.
Identify current efforts of the Department in national and/or regional conservation issues and inform staff.
* 92.
Query staff to determine if there are specific issues or organizations where we should direct efforts to be more pro-active at the regional or national level.
* 93.
Encourage staff to take leadership roles and provides them the resources to fulfill the commitment.
Challenge: Political Sensitivity of Decision Making - Staff believe habitat protection issues could be political decisions.
* 94.
Gather information from staff to define problem areas.
Involve staff in the decision making.
* 95.
Communicate rationale of decisions made.
Challenge: Leader Supportiveness - The objective of getting the job done must be balanced with concern for the employee.
* 96.
All employees will have workplans that are meaningful, flexible, realistic, and relate to the strategic and operational plans, and include training needs.
Overtime and weekend work issues will be addressed in the workplans.
* 97.
Workplans must be regularly reviewed.
* 98.
Encourage innovation and reward good attempts.
Challenge: Participation in Decision Making - Management does not routinely seek and/or act on employee ideas.
* 99.
Management will actively solicit input to major decisions, and the rationale for the decisions should be provided.
* 100.
A forum will be provided for seeking ideas (i.e., Moosetracks, electronic idea box, etc.) and giving responses (including ideas that have not been acted upon).
* 101.
Empower employees to make decisions to the extent possible.
Challenge: Internal Communications - Staff do not believe management is accessible and/or listening, and that the communication related to department decision making is open and honest.
* 102.
Personnel will be provided the opportunity to schedule time to bring problems/questions to management team meetings.
Responses to those problems/questions will be provided in management team minutes.
* 103.
Management team will work with staff to determine how communications can be improved.
* 104.
Input to the strategic plan will continue to be actively solicited from all staff.
Challenge: Teamwork - Employees are not eager to participate on teams, and when on teams their responsibilities are not clearly defined.
* 105.
Managers initiating the formation of (ad hoc) teams should give other program managers and staff as much notice as practical, and team assignments will be planned into work schedules and work priorities more effectively.
* 106.
To the extent possible all appropriate disciplines should be represented on teams.
* 107.
Team responsibilities, accountability and authority should be clearly defined in writing when formed.
* 108.
Provide recognition of staff participating on a team and the team's contributions.
Challenge: Openness to Public Input-Behavior - The Department is not as responsive to public input as it could be.
* 109.
Define expectations of public involvement processes.
* 110.
Ensure selection of public involvement process are the most effective techniques.

Indicators:
The following 6 factors were identified as areas that were in the range of the highly effective agencies:
* Personnel role definition * Public awareness of agency programs * Participation/understanding of planning and budget * Public perception of agency decisions * Political credibility * Training * Employee recognition
Focus Actions
Challenge: The Department Management must maintain that high standard in these areas while improving in areas of effectiveness identified as weak.
* 112.
Repeat the management effectiveness survey in 2002 to continue to monitor effectiveness in all areas.
* 113.
Routine review of effectiveness factors and strategies by management team.
* 114.
Division\Sections will develop a management plan to address issues identified in the Management Effectiveness Study for their Division\Section.
Goal D : Outcome XI: To maintain high standards in other areas not identified in the management effectiveness scan.
Focus Actions
Challenge: The Department must continue to strive to provide good customer service.
* 115.
Improve and simplify the ability of the public to acquire needed permits and purchase licenses by expanding opportunities such as through access to toll-free telephone sales, credit card sales, the Internet, and expanded physical locations (e.g., fish and wildlife field offices, state welcome centers).[INS: :INS] * 116.
Develop methods to provide timely and accurate responses to all public inquires.
* 117.

APPENDIX II - Baseline Values for Specific Indicators
The data presented below is expanded information for two of the indicators listed in Outcome I.
The data for these indicators come from the Water Quality Assessment 305(b) Report prepared by the Department of Environmental Conservation.
Data is collected every other year.
The most recent is from 1996.
Rivers and Streams
Percentage of rivers and stream miles that fully support designated uses.
The most recent data (1996) indicate that approximately 79% of Vermont's perennial rivers and streams fully support the uses designated under the Vermont Water Quality Standards.
This measure is broad and includes areas that the Department influences and those it does not.
Percentage of river and stream miles that fully support designated use of Aquatic Habitat.
The Department of Environmental Conservation determines if this designated use is being met based on agency fish and macroinvertebrate surveys.
The results from 1996 are shown in the following table.
This measure is more specific to the goals in the Department's strategic plan, and is affected by our actions.
[Ref. p.III-16]
Percentage of River Miles Supporting the Designated Use of Aquatic Habitat Fully Supported Fully Supported but
Threatened Partially Supported Not Supported 58% 22% 16% 5%
Number of river and stream miles not fully supporting designated uses as a result of specific causes.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife influences some of the causes of use impairment, including the following categories from Table III.3.4 of the 305(b) report: siltation, other habitat alterations^1, and flow alterations.
[Ref. P. III-19]
River Miles Not Fully Supporting Uses and Extent of Impairment Cause Major Impairments Minor Impairments Total Siltation 562 420 982 Other Habitat Alterations 227 112 339 Flow Alterations 176 119 295 Total 965 651 1,616
__________________________
^1Impairments of the suitability of the water for aquatic life due to physical disturbance such as channel alterations and streambed disruption (bulldozers in stream, gravel removal).
Number of river and stream miles not fully supporting uses in specific source categories.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife influences some of the sources of use impairment, including the following categories from Table III.3.5 of the 305(b) report: streambank erosion, removal of riparian vegetation, flow regulations and modifications, upstream impoundments, land development, highway maintenance and runoff, channelization and highway/road/bridge construction.
[Ref. P. III-20]
River Miles Not Fully Supporting Uses and Extent of Impairment Source Major Impairments Minor Impairments Total Streambank Erosion 229 334 563 Removal of Riparian Vegetation 116 246 362 Flow regulations 160 136 296 Upstream Impoundments 108 151 259 Land Development 158 99 257 Highway Maint. and Runoff 5 212 217 Channelization 10 51 61 Highway/road/bridge Construction 10 16 26 Total 796 1,245 2,041
Lakes and Ponds
Acres of lakes and ponds not fully supporting designated uses as a result of specific causes.
Many of the measures used for lakes are for causes that the Department of Fish and wildlife does not significantly influence, such as contamination, enrichment and nuisance aquatic weeds.
However, the Department does influence siltation and fluctuating water levels --- causes listed in Table III.4.7 
Fluctuating water levels affect fish habitat and impair more inland lake acreage than any other single cause.
[Ref. p. III-28
Acres of Lakes Not Fully Supporting Uses and Extent of Impairment Cause Major Impairment Minor Impairment Total Siltation - Inland Lakes 1,885 2,672 4,557 Siltation - L. Champlain 3,029 13,506 16,535 Water Level Alterations^2 7,288 4,959 12,247 Total 12,202 21,137 33,339
