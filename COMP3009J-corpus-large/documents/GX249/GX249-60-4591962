ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on January 12, 1999, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Green Flag, Incorporated, License Number R-AP-SS-11032 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on May 15, 1998, August 23, 1998 and November 9, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises.
An administrative hearing was conducted on June 15, 1999, at Two Parkway Center, 875 Greentree Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The Bureau was represented by Richard Parker, Esquire.
Licensee was represented by Kenneth E. Kohl Jr., Esquire.
The Bureau began its investigation of this matter on April 7, 1998, and completed its investigation on November 19, 1998.
Thereafter, Licensee was notified of the nature of the violation(s) disclosed by the investigation by letter sent by certified mail on December 2, 1998.
Counsel for Licensee stipulates that the notice provisions of Section 471 of the Liquor Code have been satisfied.
After hearing the testimony presented, and upon review of the evidence submitted, the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are entered:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
May 15, 1998 1.
On May 15, 1998 at 9:45 p.m., Liquor Control Enforcement Officer Edward M. Ferchak entered Licensee's premises in an undercover capacity and observed a male bartender heard to be called "Tom" rendering service of alcoholic beverages to approximately 30 patrons.
(N.T. 7) 2.
Upon entering, Officer Ferchak noted that Licensee maintained a "Dyna Cherry Master" video slot machine, a "New Cherry 96" video slot machine and a "Draw 80" video poker machine on the premises.
(N.T. 7-8, 22) 3.
During the course of this visit, Officer Ferchak observed a male patron playing the "Dyna Cherry Master" video slot machine further identified by a four to five inch diagonal scratch located on the left side of the cabinet approximately 18 inches from the floor.
(N.T. 8) 4.
Officer Ferchak observed bartender "Tom" first provide $70.00 in cash in exchange for 1400 credits, and then an additional $20.00 in exchange for another 400 credits accrued by the aforementioned male patron playing the "Dyna Cherry Master" video slot machine.
The currency used in these transactions was removed from Licensee's cash register.
Following each transaction, the male patron cleared the accrued credits by means of activating a "knock-off" located in the back of the machine which caused the screen to change into a different mode and caused the credits to count back to zero.
(N.T. 8) 5.
Officer Ferchak also observed bartender "Tom" make notations on a slip of paper prior to providing the $70.00 and $20.00, respectively, to the male patron who had been playing the machine.
(N.T. 9) August 23, 1998 6.
On August 22, 1998 at 9:30 p.m., Officer Ferchak entered Licensee's premises in an undercover capacity and observed a female bartender heard to be called "Robin" tending bar and rendering service to various patrons.
(N.T. 9) 7.
Officer Ferchak noted that Licensee continued to maintain the three machines observed during his visit of May 15, 1998.
(N.T. 9) 8.
Upon entering, Officer Ferchak observed a male patron heard to be called "Bob" playing the "Dyna Cherry Master" video slot machine, and noted "Bob" had approximately 1979 credits accrued on that machine.
"Bob" continued to play this machine after midnight on August 23.
At 12:10 a.m., the credits had been decreased to 600, at which time he stated, "Take it off."
(N.T. 9-10) 9.
Bartender "Robin" proceeded over to the slot machine and reached behind the machine, causing the screen to be placed into a different mode which caused the 600 credits to count back to zero.
(N.T. 10) 10.
Bartender "Robin" returned behind the bar and was then observed removing $30.00 in cash from Licensee's cash register and provided this money to "Bob."
(N.T. 10) November 9, 1998 11.
On November 9, 1998 at 3:05 p.m., Liquor Control Enforcement Officer Ferchak accompanied by Enforcement Officers Sunday, Ceh and Cozzoli, entered Licensee's premises armed with a Search Warrant and proceeded to identify themselves and presented the Search Warrant to Licensee's principle officer, Mr. Scott Miller.
(N.T. 10-11, 29) 12.
During the course of this inspection, Officer Kenneth Ceh examined each of the three video machines identified as a "Cherry Master" video slot machine, a "New Cherry 96" video slot machine, and a "Draw 80" video poker machine.
(N.T. 29-32) 13.
Officer Ceh determined that each of the aforementioned three video machines were set up for play and operational.
Officer Ceh then proceeded to place $1.00 into each of the three machines.
Officer Ceh determined that the "Cherry Master" and the "New Cherry 96" machines were nickel machines, and received 20 credits on each machine in exchange for the one dollar inserted.
The "Draw 80" machine was determined to be a quarter machine.
Therefore, Officer Ceh received four credits in exchange for the one dollar inserted in that machine.
(N.T. 29-32) 14.
During play of the "Cherry Master" and "New Cherry 96" slot machines, Officer Ceh found a "knock-off" device which was activated by pressing a button located on the rear of each machine.
Officer Ceh then played the minimum bet of eight credits and "knocked-off" the remaining 12 credits by activating the aforementioned "knock-off" on each machine.
(N.T. 29-32) 15.
Officer Ceh determined that the "knock-off" on the "Draw 80" video poker machine was activated by connecting two boltheads, one located on the top of the machine and the other located on the side of the machine.
On this machine, Officer Ceh played one credit and "knocked-off" the remaining three credits by activating this "knock-off" device.
(N.T. 29-32) 16.
The aforementioned three video gaming devices were then seized from Licensee's premises and were placed into evidence at a Bureau facility.
(N.T. 19) 17.
On November 9, 1998, Officer Ferchak examined the internal components of the three video machines seized from Licensee's premises.
(N.T. 13-26) 18.
This examination revealed that the "Cherry Master" and the "New Cherry 96" video slot machines each contained a power interrupt circuit, video accounting and manual meters.
Officer Ferchak played these machines after inserting a dollar into each.
Nine credits were played on the "Cherry Master" and the remaining 11 were "knocked-off" by pressing the button located on the rear of the machine.
Similarly, Officer Ferchak played eight credits on the "New Cherry 96" and "knocked-off" the remaining 12 credits.
In each case, the internal metering components continued to record the remaining 11 and 12 credits, respectively, on each machine.
(N.T. 13-26) 19.
Officer Ferchak inserted $5.00 into the "Draw 80" video poker machine and received 20 credits.
Officer Ferchak played five credits and "knocked-off" the remaining 15 credits.
This machine contained manual meters which continued to account for the 15 credits after those credits had been cleared from the machine.
As previously described, the "knock-off" device consisted of placing a conductive metal object between two boltheads located on the machine.
(N.T. 13-26) 20.
Liquor Control Enforcement Officers Edward Ferchak and Kenneth Ceh contain the requisite training and experience in the examination of video gambling devices and are considered by this court to be expert witnesses.
(N.T. 12-13, 28) 21.
In the opinion of Officer Ferchak, no skill was required to play any of the aforementioned three video gaming devices seized from Licensee's premises on November 9, 1998.
(N.T. 13-26)
DISCUSSION:
Upon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has clearly established that each of the three video gambling devices seized from Licensee's premises on November 9, 1998 contained the requisite elements of a gambling device per se.
