3634-1:N:04/11/1992:JL/JL LRS97-2111 SB131 By Senator By Senators Armistead, Adams, Hill, Lipscomb, Smith, Windom, Hale, Amari, Butler, Ghee, McClain, Dixon and Bailey RFD Governmental Affairs Rd 1 13-JAN-1998 SYNOPSIS: Existing law does not specifically provide for or regulate foreign adoption agencies, although it does prohibit unlicensed, foreign adoption agencies from advertising in Alabama.
Under existing law, domestic adoption agencies are required to register with the Secretary of State and obtain licenses.
They are also required to submit anticipated adoption fees for pre-approval to the judge of probate of the county in which the birth mother resides or county of birth of the prospective adoptive child.
Prior to the adoption being finalized, the agency is required to submit a final accounting of fees to the same judge of probate for approval.
Domestic agencies must also comply with the applicable corporation, partnership, and association provisions of law and applicable revenue and taxation provisions of law.
This bill would define foreign adoption agencies and would require foreign adoption agencies to meet the same requirements as domestic adoption agencies.
This bill would require certain domestic and foreign adoption agencies to pay a licensing tax.
The revenue from the tax would be placed in a fund to be used by the Department of Human Resources to carry out the provisions of the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children.
