The Sailing Emporium is a Certified Maryland Clean Marina ______________________________________________________________ ANNAPOLIS, MD (November 6, 2001) The Sailing Emporium in Kent County is the 35th marina in Maryland to earn the prestigious Clean Marina Award.
The Clean Marina designation indicates that The Sailing Emporium has satisfied the rigorous pollution prevention standards established by Marylands Clean Marina Committee and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) as part of the agencys Clean Marina Initiative (CMI).
We take pride in doing the right thing, said President Art Willis.
We want to meet legal requirements and, more importantly, protect the resources that support boating in Maryland.
The Sailing Emporium is a family owned and operated marina in Rock Hall Harbor.
Mary Sue Willis, wife and co-owner, has made a personal commitment, which is apparent when one walks around the impeccably clean and beautifully landscaped grounds.
Over the years, the inherited, dilapidated remnants of previous ownerships have been replaced with elements of design that are functional, attractive and emphasize a clean Chesapeake Bay.
Most recently a 200-foot wooden, collapsed bulkhead was replaced with rip rap; providing better habitat for aquatic species
.
The Sailing Emporium is a working boat yard with 25 employees and is managed to minimize pollution.
Outside contractors are required to comply with EPA and OSHA rules to clean up all trash, dust and other debris resulting from work.
Certified Clean Marinas demonstrate that business and environmental interests can be compatible, said Clean Marina Coordinator, Elizabeth Fuller Valentine.
They improve their bottom line and the quality of our waterways by voluntarily exceeding environmental regulations.
CMI promotes voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas, boatyards, yacht clubs, and recreational boats.
Each of the 35 Clean Marinas has implemented measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair, petroleum storage and transfer, sewage disposal, solid, liquid and hazardous wastes, stormwater runoff, and facilities management.
Recognized Clean Marinas may use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead.
They also receive a flag to fly from their facility, a page on the Clean Marina web site (www.dnr.state.md.us/boating), and promotion in Clean Marina publications.
Signing the Clean Marina pledge is the first step toward receiving recognition as an environmentally-responsible marina.
So far, 129 entities have taken the pledge.
There are approximately 600 boating facilities in Maryland and the CMIs goal is to certify 150 of those as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners by 2004.
The Clean Marina Partner designation recognizes boating facilities other than marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs that are implementing pollution prevention measures.
There are 7 certified Clean Marina Partners.
