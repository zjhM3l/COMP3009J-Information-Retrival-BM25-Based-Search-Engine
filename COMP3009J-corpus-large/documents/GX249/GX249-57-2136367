EAST UNION TWP.
SITE TO BE RECLAIMED . . . . . . . .
February 18, 2000 DEP's Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in Wilkes-Barre completed a final inspection of the Oneida West/North Sheppton Strip Mine reclamation project in East Union Township, Schuylkill County, on Jan. 27.
The project, which was completed in one year, restored 37 acres of abandoned mine land by eliminating three strip pits that were approximately 60 feet deep.
The project included three constructed wetland areas covering seven acres, new culverts to convey Little Tomhicken Creek safely beneath the township road and the reestablishment of approximately 3,800 feet of stream.
The half-million dollar project was completed by James T. O'Hara Inc. of Moscow and was funded through a federal tax on coal removal.
BAMR COMPLETES RECLAMATION PROJECT DESIGN . . . . . . . .
February 4, 2000 DEP's Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in Wilkes-Barre recently completed the design for an abandoned mine reclamation project in Reilly Township, Schuylkill County.
The 32-acre project is located on land owned by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.
The project will eliminate 7,200 feet of dangerous highwall, which are the cliff faces of abandoned mines, and four vertical mine openings.
It involves the grading of approximately 170,000 cubic yards of on-site material.
Bids will be opened at 2 p.m., Feb. 29.
FRAILEY TWP. RECLAMATION PROJECT PLANNED . . . . . . . .
July 30, 1999 DEP met with contractors for the North Donaldson abandoned strip mine site in Frailey Township, Schuylkill County, on July 20 to finalize reclamation plans.
Latona Trucking Inc. will reclaim 40 acres of land by excavating and grading one-half million cubic yards of spoil to backfill strip pits up to 70 feet in depth.
A mine opening will be backfilled and a weir will be constructed to monitor discharge flow.
Work is to be completed by Aug. 26, 2000.
MINE SUBSIDENCE OPENS VOID IN GIRARDVILLE . . . . . . . .
December 11, 1998 A massive subsidence event caused the backfilled "Packard V" coal mine shaft in Girardville, Schuylkill County, to give way over several hours Dec. 3.
The subsidence is estimated to be 40 by 80 feet on the surface and at least 100 feet deep to the mine pool.
The 1,100 foot shaft, closed since 1948 and backfilled in the 1960s, is on a Girard Estates surface mining site.
The federal Office of Surface Mining called the site an emergency and is working with Girard Coal Co. to backfill the subsidence with rock.
Backfilling began on Dec. 5 and should take at least a week.
Investigators are uncertain about what caused the event, but believe that drought conditions, heavy traffic on an adjacent haul road and improper backfilling contributed.
EASTERN PA COALITION FOR ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION
The Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation was established to provide leadership for encouraging the reclamation, development and best use of abandoned mine lands in central and eastern Pennsylvania.
This independent, non-profit, non-partisan group supplements the efforts of the Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts, the Rural Abandoned Mine Program, and others with similar goals.
DEP awarded L.G. Hetager Drilling Inc., $241,905 to provide rotary exploration drilling investigations at six sites in the five counties -- Columbia, Lackawanna, Luzerne Northumberland and Schuylkill counties (Jan. 24, 1997).
