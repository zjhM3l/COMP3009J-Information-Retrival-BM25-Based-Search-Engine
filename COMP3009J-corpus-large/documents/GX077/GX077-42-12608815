There is a growing accumulation of guidance materials and other resources that are helpful in the development and operation of Tribal programs under the Federal Welfare Reform provisions.
These range from guidance in developing programs and plans, to reporting instructions, to after-the-fact reports and evaluations of existing operational programs.
There are resources for those Tribal organizations that would operate the full range of Welfare Reform programs, (Tribal TANF), and those that would operate Tribal TANF and/or Native Employment Works (NEW), and those that would operate the Child Care component of the overall program.
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) maintains the ACF Tribal Resources Web Site that will take you from ACF's Administration for Native Americans (ANA) web page to many of the ACF, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other federal program sites that provide services or grants to American Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations.
The site includes, among other resource links, links directly to the * Tribal Resource Directory of ACF Programs, and the * ACF Tribal Consultation Plan.
You may wish to visit the HHS Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Internet site, which contains a wealth of information on the HHS implementation of this important approach to serving our needy populations.
* Frequently asked questions about Child Care * new Frequently asked questions about Native Americans
Also, below you will find links to other resources that may be helpful to you.
We have attempted to roughly categorize the following listing, but there is much overlap among categories, so a thorough review of all materials would be a good idea.
Many of the following sites are supported by the U.S. Government, while other sites are operated independently.
When you click on the links to independently operated sites, you leave the U.S. Government Web space.
