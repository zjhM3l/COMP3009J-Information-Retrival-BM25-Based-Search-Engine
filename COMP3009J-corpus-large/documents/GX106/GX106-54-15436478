Pesticides: On the farm.
In the fields.

After seven years of investigating the clues, researcher Martin Ouellet is ready to indict a culprit in the mass deformities and early death of frogs: pesticides used on the farm.
Donna Jacobs reports.

It's a double biological murder mystery.
What agents, possibly operating internationally, are horribly deforming so many species of frogs? And, what fate did all the other missing frogs meet?
Martin Ouellet, a 30-year-old veterinarian who left his small animal practice near Montreal, has devoted the past seven years to hunting down the answer.
He has the world's largest collection of deformed frogs in his lab at McGill University's Redpath Museum.
For every misshapen frog he collects, he examines and releases hundreds.
"I don't want to take many," he says, "because they're already under so much pressure."
He and a team of Canadian Wildlife Service biologists, have now examined nearly 30,000 frogs.
He submits his photos into evidence.
A frog with one eye staring out from its back.
A frog with legs growing from its belly.
A frog with three extra legs.
A frog dragging itself along with stumps for hind legs or with hind legs fused.
A frog missing an eye, or fingers or toes, or having extra digits, one with 23 extra toes.
His autopsy reports are equally chilling.
Many frogs that looked normal outside were being poisoned to death inside by clogged and yellowed livers.
Frogs that look like males are female inside.
Lab results show altered DNA.
Even last year, Dr. Ouellet was circumspect in naming his primary suspects.
He said he needed more proof before he could shift suspicion to accusation.
Now, he is no longer hedging.
The culprit, he says, is pesticides.
Although his data proves guilt by association, the only way to convict pesticides, he says, is to reveal the mechanisms that disfigure frogs and to reproduce these deformities in frog- pond experiments.
He finds the grotesque frogs along a 250-kilometre stretch on both sides of the St. Lawrence River, from Montreal eastward to Montmagny, Que.
Only a man who has spent many summer months bending over frog ponds in farmers' fields could speak so plainly.
He has catalogued 25 types of deformities among 16 amphibians -- spring peepers, grey tree frogs, mink frogs, wood frogs, green frogs, pickerel frogs, northern leopard frogs, bullfrogs, American toads, eastern newts, mudpuppies, redback salamanders, blue- and yellow-spotted salamanders, northern two-line salamanders and northern dusky salamanders.
"We have to know why the frogs are deformed and why they are dying," says Dr. Ouellet.
"We're also living in the St. Lawrence Valley and we put the food coming from there on our tables."
Sometimes he finds the evidence left behind in plain view at the scene -- empty pesticide containers lying right there in the water.
Dr. Ouellet watched as one farmer, unaware that the scientist was photographing frogs nearby, cavalierly burned plastic containers at the edge of an irrigation pond.
"All these ponds are used to irrigate fields, and sometimes they are chemical soup," he says.
"We're eating the food so there is a big human connection."
His most dramatic findings: On agricultural land that has not been sprayed for many decades, an average of one frog in every hundred is deformed -- ranging (depending on the site) from a zero-to-12 per cent deformity rates.
On working farms that use insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers, an average of 12 frogs in every hundred are deformed -- yielding zero-to-100 percent deformity rates.
In July, Dr. Ouellet surveyed a farm property near St-Charles, 25 kilometres southeast of Quebec City.
There, every single frog he picked up was deformed -- missing toes and parts of legs.
The deformities occurred in three different species -- leopard, mink and green frogs.
Overall, this summer the news was bad: "There were fewer frogs but way more deformities."
Jean Rodrigue, a CWS biologist based in Ste-Foy, Que., has been Dr. Ouellet's frequent field-research partner.
When Dr. Ouellet presented their earlier findings, scientists challenged the data based on a small sample size of a few thousand frogs.
"After seven years, we are finding exactly the same pattern but the sample size is huge and very hard to criticize."
On the spreadsheets of his enormous database, probably the largest field study in the world, each frog has its own line.
That means the PhD candidate will spend an intense winter in data analysis to find the common instruments in the deaths and deformities.
The Canadian contribution is significant amid the increasingly crowded field of scientists who, worldwide, are working flat out to solve the riddle.
However, the usual scientific curiosity has taken on a sense of urgency for at least three reasons.
First, some frogs are already on the threatened-species list in several countries, including Canada.
Dr. Ouellet's academic supervisor is David Green, a professor of biology at McGill and former national co-ordinator of the Canadian Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force.
Among Canada's 24 frog and toad species and 21 salamander species, according to Dr. Green, 17 are in decline.
Several of those are designated as vulnerable or threatened species, mostly among western species, because of human activities: encroachment, farming and logging practices.
(For years, Canadian farmers have received attractive subsidies from the public purse to drain their lands for cultivation.)
Mass deformities have not caused all of the global population declines.
Individual populations cannot thrive, however, when every other frog is abnormal.
Severe deformities sentence young frogs to an early Darwinian death, which explains why Dr. Ouellet never finds a grossly misshapen adult frog.
Second, amphibians are an important "sentinel" for the health of water, soil and air.
Frogs are particularly susceptible during their dramatic, hormone-driven change from water-breathing tadpoles to air-breathing frogs.
Some frogs, such as mink frogs, green frogs and bullfrogs, spend two or three years in breeding ponds as tadpoles, perhaps the single reason they show particularly high levels of deformities.
Third, hormone-disrupting chemicals which play havoc with master glands and organs, such as the thyroid and liver, have raised alarm among scientists.
One particularly suspect class of pesticides are retinoids, compounds derived from Vitamin A, known to produce birth defects in humans and other vertebrates.
Hormone disruption often affects the thyroid, which directs a huge number of body functions, from metabolism to sexual development, and the liver, which is crucial for filtering out environmental contaminants and toxins in the blood.
Researchers are looking at human health -- at increases in prostate and breast cancer, at declining human fertility, at abnormal sexual organs in children -- and sensing a pattern.
Research done in Canada, California, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Finland shows that children of parents who work or live in farm settings have more deformities.
These include: fused fingers and toes, missing fingers and toes, deformed arms and legs and abnormal hearts, kidneys and sexual organs.
Mothers who work in agricultural industries are more likely to miscarry or have stillborn children.
"There are big problems going on out there," says Dr. Ouellet.
"The frogs are probably trying to tell us something, so it's probably important to listen."
Already, in some rural areas in Canada, the once-deafening sound of frogs peeping and bullfrogs croaking is down to a few voices.
People talk to Dr. Ouellet about it.
"People all over the place say, 'I remember going to that pond when I was a kid and there were tons of frogs' or 'I remember when it was so loud it was impossible to sleep.
Now it's hard even to hear one frog singing.'"
While deformities naturally capture headlines and the public's attention, they may be the least severe situation.
"If there's too much toxicity and the eggs die," says Dr. Ouellet, "you will have no frogs at all."
Scientists and nature lovers are already dreading the season that some of them believe is quite close: the long Silent Summer.
Some researchers blame the steep decline in frog populations on UVB rays blazing through a thin ozone layer and destroying genetic material in eggs and tadpoles.
For others, the culprit is an affliction: a frog virus, bacterium, fungus or parasite.
Only Dr. Ouellet openly points to pesticides: "We have very incriminating results."
The more circumspect Mr. Rodrigue is amused by his colleague's outspokenness.
"I guess it is incriminating.
But of what?"
These two men have spent months of their lives catching frogs; some days start at 4 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.
They work in rain, swatting bugs and mosquitoes.
Dr. Ouellet holds the record for examining 1,058 frogs in one day.
Pressed to speculate about causes, Mr. Rodrigue says only that he has a feeling that the problem lies with insecticides.
Whenever he sees a strawberry field or a potato field, he is pretty sure the nearby pond will hold a high percentage of deformed frogs.
(In potato fields whose ponds produced deformed frogs, the scientists have documented use of the herbicides metribuzin and diquat and the insecticides phorate, azinphosmethyl, cypermethrin, oxamyl and chlorothalonil, and the fungicide mancozeb.)
Strawberries are known to carry the highest load of pesticide residues: "Wash your strawberries very well," he says.
But he won't draw conclusions about whether and which pesticides because of inconsistencies, the pristine ponds with five per cent of the frogs deformed and the working farm ponds with no deformities.
He's waiting for their data to presents the answers.
Dr. Ouellet says he also expects to see deformed frogs in ponds next to corn fields.
(Some farm ponds with deformed frogs are next to corn fields sprayed with the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide carbofuran; both have hormone-disrupting effects on wildlife.)
Both men criticize the practice of farmers who remove vegetation around their farm ponds and who mow their fields right to the water's edge.
This gives pesticides a direct, unfiltered runoff path into the ponds.
Some farmers actually spray the water, itself.
In both cases, this violates the "buffer zone" clause -- specific pesticide distances from water -- detailed for some farm chemicals.
In Mont-St-Hilaire, however, the researchers have a huge experimental "control site."
The two small mountains, formed by ancient volcanoes and now owned by McGill University, has been declared a biosphere by the United Nations.
It's located 45 kilometres east of Montreal, on the St. Lawrence River's south shore and it's a remnant of the environment before pesticides.
In a world where pesticides ride on air currents for thousands of kilometres, of course, there is no truly pristine place left on earth.
However, having never had a direct application of farm chemicals, Mont-St-Hilaire bolsters Dr. Ouellet's damning conclusion about pesticides.
Among the 7,000 frogs and salamanders he and student assistants Linda Paetow and Roxane Petel examined there, only 10 had deformities -- all mild limb malformations.
Fifty or 60 years ago, another generation of researchers had catalogued the 16 native frog species and other amphibians and reptiles that lived there.
Pristine or not, Mont-St-Hilaire now has fewer frog species -- two frog and three salamander species are missing altogether.
The old specimens, stored at the Redpath Museum and at the Museum of Nature in Ottawa, provide a comparison of frogs from the dawn-of-pesticides era with those from today.
Amphibian deformity is not a new phenomenon.
Mysterious mass deformities have been documented for some 300 years.
And the growing file on deformed frogs now, particularly in Quebec, Vermont, Minnesota and California, reflects the increase in the number of scientists looking for them.
Dr. Ouellet's work in agricultural areas, with students Jonatan Blais and Patrick Labonte, contrasts with the typical wildlife biologists who work in "nice wetlands and don't go into a corn field, which is not fun to sample.
It's disgusting.
There's a little water, a cornfield, pesticides.
It smells."
If, when the answers are in, the culprit is whole families of pesticides, the Canadian and U.S. governments may indeed ban their use.
Then, says Dr. Ouellet, pesticide companies will just develop new products which, in a decade or two, will also be proven harmful.
"Whatever the mechanism, pesticides are always toxic in the end," he says flatly.
"That's why they work.
Some will disrupt hormones, some will cause direct mortality, others will cause limb deformities."
He looks to DDT as a perfect example of a chemical with proven toxic effects on wildlife and humans.
Banned in 1972, its metabolite, DDE, remains in the soil and wildlife even now.
Nevertheless, he says, pesticides companies "sell it like crazy" in Africa, South America and Asia because it's a cheap compound and it's not banned there.
For Dr. Ouellet, the solution is in natural biological controls and restoring the natural cycle where healthy populations of birds, frogs and dragonflies, and microscopic predators, suppress crop-chewing insect populations.
He believes this counter-revolution begins not with the farmer, but with the consumer, that is, everyone who eats.
A pesticide-free apple with a yellow spot, a crooked carrot, a lopsided, imperfectly red tomato are natural.
People would be more willing to buy them, indeed, one day may go looking for them, when they know the true cost of picture-perfect produce.
In 1998 alone, Minnesota committed $1 million to frog deformity research -- after school children found deformed frogs on a 1995 field trip.
The sum discourages this Canadian team which is working with a 1998 grant of $25,000 from the Canadian Wildlife Service and occasional grants or free services offered by a coalition of McGill, the University of Montreal and the Quebec ministry of the environment.
The scientists don't have enough money to pay for lab tests.
One frog autopsy, one chromosomal analysis and one pond water analysis would cost, says Dr. Ouellet, more than $1,000.
The huge discrepancy in funding strikes the veterinarian as doubly ironic.
"We're in worse shape than the U.S.," he says.
Canada's climate dictates cultivation along its warm southern border, farming that is more concentrated and pesticide-consuming.
And, he says, as governments cut research funds to pay for health care, they may be paying for human diseases from the environmental contamination the researchers are trying to document.
Dr. Ouellet and his colleagues are the only Canadian scientists doing a large-scale investigation of this mystery.
Wherever they've looked, they've found deformed frogs.
And Dr. Ouellet's "take home message" is that if he were looking anywhere else in Canada for deformed frogs, he would find them there, too.
