An epidemic of deformed frogs in his back yard frightens Raymond Greffe.
But what really worries him is why provincial and federal governments aren't more interested.
Donna Jacobs investigates an environmental harbinger.

NOTRE-DAME-DU-MONT-CARMEL, Quebec -
When Raymond Greffe stepped out of his house in rural Quebec to mow his lawn in July, he expected to see what he always sees: Hundreds of tiny new leopard frogs hopping like mad to get out of his way.
Instead, they were "crawling like toads or just falling over in the grass."
He picked one up.
Part of its hind leg was missing.
He picked up another and another -- 30 in all and 24 of them had a stump instead of a hind leg, or no hind leg at all.
All week he watched the frogs struggle.
He didn't mow his grass for a month to give the frogs shade and cover from predators.
"I've been looking at nature since I was 12," says the aviation electronics technician, "and I never saw a robin eating frogs before.
They were beating frogs against wood.
The grackles were just walking in the grass and picking up frogs all over the place.
The same thing for the crows."
He phoned the department of the environment and wildlife of Quebec.
While he waited for someone to come to his house, in the little village of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, 45 kilometers south of Montreal, he did some investigating.
Was this misshapen population the result of one batch of genetically damaged eggs? But examination of frogs along a half-kilometer stretch up the road showed no difference.
The 80-per-cent deformity average held.
"In the beginning I was looking for frogs that were deformed," he says.
"After that, I looked for frogs that weren't deformed."
Don't, he says, ask if he was surprised.
He already knew about the masses of deformed frogs in the U.S.
But, most of all, as an environmentalist who lost many fights in the 1970s and 1980s, he was resigned.
"I predicted years ago that the frogs would be the first to be attacked," he says, because they live in water as eggs and tadpoles and, particularly, because tadpoles breathe through their skin.
But he just didn't expect to find the calamity literally at his doorstop.
"It's the quantity that scared me to hell.
I thought I'd see it gradually come about.
One year a couple, and the next year a few more.
But it was all the babies around."
Danielle Guay, Mr. Greffe's friend, also spent many hours picking up frogs, documenting their missing and shortened legs.
She lives in a neighboring town, where she drives a school bus.
She takes me on a walk down the lane that runs between Mr. Greffe's property and a very weedy pond that receives agricultural runoff from the field nearby.
She has made a net to catch the frogs and captures eight frogs and two toads.
One frog is missing part of a foot and two have only a stump at their hip.
Gently, expertly, she extends their legs, notes their deformities and, murmuring to them, puts them back in the grass.
"If the frogs are sick, the fish are also sick," she says, and more comfortable in French, she adds "Grenouilles malades, hommes malades (frogs sick, humans sick)."
In Mr. Greffe's own back yard, beside his cattail swamp, two young frogs are disfigured; three older frogs are normal.
A few days later, Dr. Martin Ouellet, a veterinarian and specialist in frog deformities, visited Mr. Greffe.
The environment department had contacted him because he has spent the past seven years looking for the cause of frog deformities.
"If it had been my goal to collect 1,000 frogs that day," he recalls, "I would have been able."
The lawn earned his description of "hot spot."
"Every time you're catching two frogs, one is deformed," he says.
"It's huge."
He anesthetized and killed several frogs for this winter's work: autopsies and analysis of genetic abnormalities on the frogs he has collected all over southern Quebec.
They will form part of his database of nearly 30,000 amphibians, mostly frogs, but also some toads and salamanders.
Among the 16 species he has studied, he has found 25 types of deformities -- frogs with three legs, with 23 extra toes, with an eye placed on a shoulder or a back, with missing fingers and toes, legs or parts of legs.
The deformed frogs virtually all die, either from predators or disease.
"They're handicapped.
They have a hard time moving and when they fall, they have abrasions from gravel.
The bacteria enter and they usually die from septicemia."
This blood poisoning is a painful death, a total-body infection that causes them to swell up.
"Of course, they're probably not comfortable," says Dr. Ouellet, who wants to avoid anthropomorphizing.
"But they fall.
They have nerves and muscles.
If you do that to a frog," -- he pinches his skin -- "they feel it.
They have the same nerves that we have."
Martin Leveille, a biologist with the environment ministry, accompanied Dr. Ouellet to see the frogs around Mr. Greffe's property.
He described the sight as "bizarre" with hundreds of tiny frogs with uneven legs, making erratic jumps.
"These animals are still very vigorous and jump very well," he said.
"They don't seem to have much problem feeding."
If a toxic substance caused the deformities and the frogs survive for two months after metamorphosis, their chances "seem quite good."
He says that it would be upsetting if the deformities were the result of human activity, but noted that causes can also be natural.
"That's why we have to be prudent," he said.
"Next year there will be budgets and priorities and money for water tests."
The third person to visit the site, two weeks later, was Real Normandeau, provincial agricultural technician.
He spoke with Mr. Greffe and Ms. Guay.
He looked at the frogs with Dr. Ouellet.
However, Mr. Normandeau did not take any water samples of the pond nearby where the frogs hatched, nor well-water samples from the nearby homes, nor a sample of water coming out of the large drainage pipe from the adjacent farm field.
The pipe carries runoff from the farm fields, complete with fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides that farmers have sprayed on their crops.
He did not talk with the farmers nearby to see which pesticides they have used this season.
"We are not sure if we can have the laboratory do samples and we're not sure if we have enough pesticide to produce good results," he said, noting that pesticides disintegrate.
He added: "We're not sure pesticides are the cause of the deformities."
He preferred, he said, to make a research proposal for next spring and summer rather than ask the provincial government to analyze a variety of water samples from that site in July.
"What," he asked, "should we tell the lab to look for?"
Mr. Leveille said he did not know what farmers typically spray on their corn and soybean crops but said that Mr. Normandeau would know.
Mr. Normandeau said he didn't.
He said, though, he will find out.
"I will go back," he told the Citizen on Sept. 18., "in two weeks."
In contrast, when Minnesota school children discovered deformed frogs during a school trip in 1995, it became an international story and set off a national and state emergency.
Scientists tested pond and residential well water for pesticides, heavy metals, salt, pH levels -- any agents that could cause genetic abnormalities.
They're still testing.
In May, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt convened a cabinet-level briefing on plummeting frog populations in the U.S., which led to the creation of the Task Force on Amphibian Declines and Deformities to co-ordinate federal research.
(Its Canadian counterpart is the Task Force on Declining Amphibian Populations in Canada.)
This week, Mr. Babbitt announced a new coalition of government, environmental groups and children, and a new web site -- www.frogweb.gov -- to find out what is killing and deforming frogs in the U.S.
"When we consider that these creatures are hardy enough to have been on Earth for 350 million years," he said, "it is shocking to think that there could be a world without frogs."
This difference in response to his own situation strikes Mr. Greffe: "No one cares about the frogs."
He includes farmers, neighbors and the provincial department in charge of this sort of environmental emergency.
Anyway, he says, government departments work at cross purposes.
Several years ago, the provincial government gave the neighboring farmer permission to install a pump for his drainage system.
Runoff now goes directly into the pond at the end of his corn field instead of draining into the ditch that runs the length of the huge field.
The cattails in the ditch used to purify the water before it left the farm.
"Everybody knows that aquatic vegetation cleans out polluted water," says Mr. Greffe.
Runoff is choking out the wildlife with weed growth.
Both Mr. Greffe and Dr. Ouellet say that governments are reluctant to investigate farm chemicals and practices because it is big business, and because, in rural Quebec, the farm union is very powerful.
There were fewer frogs already, says Mr. Greffe, without the possibility of pesticide poisoning.
In 1992, just as Dr. Ouellet began documenting deformities, the provincial government invented a new permit to provide a legal frog hunt.
"You see how dumb things are: The year they put out a permit, there's less and less land and fewer marshes for the frog and now they have a permit that says you can take any quantity you want."
He says that, four years ago, bullfrogs had started to make a comeback in his area.
"We were there at night and there were bullfrogs singing.
It's so beautiful.
"One night, someone came by truck to catch the bullfrogs and you couldn't hear one the night after.
The men were there all night.
I put a note in their truck window.
They never came back because they'd just cleaned the whole place out."
Even this summer, there are only a few bullfrog voices.
The collectors supply restaurants with frogs, where only their legs are used, cut off at the hip and ankle.
The other market is school and research laboratories.
Frog hunters shine a light on the frogs -- deer hunters call this jacking -- which freezes them, or they wave a red flag with a hook on it, or they hit them with a dart.
Under provincial regulations, the hunting season in southern Quebec for bullfrogs, green frogs and leopard frogs is July 15 to Nov. 15.
Hunting methods approved for use: nets, fish hooks, a blunt instrument for stunning, pits, barriers, darts and capture by hand.
Mr. Greffe explains the pit-barrier method.
Frog collectors stretch a burlap fence along a pond, and at each end they dig deep holes.
When the frogs come out of the mud after their winter hibernation and try to get to the water to breed, they have to hop sideways along the barricade.
When they reach the end of the barricade, they fall into the holes.
If the frog population dives -- and Mr. Greffe says there are fewer frogs now than even five years ago -- the mosquitoes will lose their primary predators and this will create a problem in this cottage country.
"Then we'll start spraying products that kill mosquitoes.
That's how humans work.
They don't look for the cause.
They'll attack the results of what they did themselves."
Mr. Greffe says he'll protect the frogs as best he can.
"The animals have no choice.
Even these frogs that are sick are beautiful in a certain way."
