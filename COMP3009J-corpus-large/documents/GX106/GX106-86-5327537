TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ WORKING GROUP: EVALUATION OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES FOR THE PERIOD 1995- 1996 Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary: Wild sunflowers are native to the U.S. and ancestors of the cultivated crop.
Having the ancestors of the cultivated crop accessible with the boundaries of the U.S. allows the collection and utilization of the wild species of sunflower.
Since there are 50 species of wild sunflower with considerable genetic variability, the task of finding desirable charac- teristics in this diversity is a difficult task.
Due to the large number of species, a team approach is needed to discover the valuable character- istics.
There is a global interest in the utilization of the wild sunflower species to improve cultivated sunflower.
The Food and Agricul- ture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), European Cooperative Network on Agriculture (ESCORENA), has established a working group on the evaluation of wild sunflower species.
This group has been active in the characterization of wild sunflowers.
Participants of the group share the common goal; this is to increase the genetic diversity of cultivated sunflower using wild species.
It is through organizations such as FAO that the sunflower industry benefits from the numerous countries that participate in the wild species working group.
The group has made significant progress in expanding our knowledge of wild species, but the task is far from complete.
It is through international cooperation that we will be able to make more rapid improvement in the sunflower crop.
