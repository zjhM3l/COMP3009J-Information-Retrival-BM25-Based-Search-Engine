We have sequenced a 105 kilobase region of the tomato genome, identified genes in this sequence, and searched for related genes in the emerging Arabidopsis genomic sequence.
Surprisingly, regions containing three or more related genes were found on four different chromosomes of Arabidopsis, and the pattern of colinearity suggests that these regions are all ancient duplicates of one ancestral region.
The subsequent loss of duplicated genes in Arabidopsis has been extensive.
Thus, the application of knowledge concerning the gene content and order in Arabidopsis to distantly related plants will require methods that account for the occurrence of gene and genome duplications.
