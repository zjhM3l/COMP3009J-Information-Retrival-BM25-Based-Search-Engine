Amphibious Abnormalities:
Scientists Probing Cause of Frogs' Missing Parts

WATERBURY, Vt.
-- The frogs scattered ahead of the truck as Mark Ferguson and Rick Levey drove toward the Lake Champlain shoreline to investigate bizarre reports that many of the little amphibians seemed to be missing legs or even eyes.
From a distance, the Northern leopard frogs -- so called for their dark green spots -- looked normal enough.
But, as the state wildlife officials got closer on that day last October, they could see something was wrong.
"You could tell which ones were deformed by watching them hop.
If it didn't have a leg, it would hop and then fall over," said Ferguson, zoologist for the Department of Fish and Wildlife "They probably won't make it through the winter."
More than 15 percent of the frogs Ferguson and Levey inspected at four locations had deformities, including missing feet, withered or missing hind legs, and missing or malformed eyes.
In one day, the pair collected more deformed frogs, 38, than had been reported to the state in 75 years.
The deformed frogs, now stored in a Zip-Loc bag inside Levey's lab freezer, have drawn New England into a disturbing national investigation that began when students on a field trip found one-legged frogs in Minnesota last year.
Now, wildlife officials from California to Vermont are reporting extraordinary numbers of deformed frogs, almost all of them young.
Some researchers suspect an outbreak of a parasite is invading tadpoles and stunting their development as they grow into frogs.
If true, the deformities reported in nine states as well as Canada would be an unsettling, but natural, phenomenon.
But others fear that the deformed frogs may be a warning sign of a larger, human-caused danger such as toxic chemical releases or the thinning of the Earth's ozone layer.
Currently, researchers are investigating whether a chemical used to kill mosquitoes, or the ultraviolet light that penetrates the depleted ozone layer could cause the deformities.
If the frogs are suffering from a pollution-related abnormality, moreover, EPA officials are concerned that the frogs could simply be the first species to show signs of damage.
Since they live on both land and water, frogs are highly sensitive to environmental degradation, making them like the canaries that coal miners once sent ahead to test tunnel air.
The EPA convened a meeting here in Waterbury just before Thanksgiving to discuss the frog deformities, bringing perhaps the nation's leading authority, biologist Joe Tietge of EPA's Duluth, Minn., lab, to brief officials from Vermont and other states as well as the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
Tietge, who organized a national conference on the frog deformities last September, believes that the deformities are not genetically inherited, but occur sometime while the amphibian is developing from tadpole to frog.
However, he is unsure whether the damage is natural or human-induced.
But Tietge is quite sure that the current outbreak is extremely rare.
Herpetologists, who specialize in snakes and amphibians, say they seldom see large numbers of deformities, and almost none among the adult frog population.
In Minnesota, by contrast, deformed frogs have been found in 54 out of the state's 87 counties.
"It's just not normal to see deformed animals," Tietge recently told the Washington Post.
Wildlife officials know even less about frog deformities in Vermont than in Minnesota, largely because they weren't aware of them until late September.
That's when publicity about the frog deformities in Minnesota prompted Vermonters to report deformities near Lake Champlain.
As a result, Levey and Ferguson were able to investigate only four of the 12 reports before cold weather sent the frogs into hibernation.
However, the tipsters proved correct at all four sites.
The researchers found deformed frogs near the Northern shore of the lake in St. Albans, Alburg, Isle La Motte, and Ferrisburg.
In all, 16.5 percent of the Northern leopard frogs they saw that day had some deformity.
"We got the feeling . . . that anywhere we looked we would find deformed frogs," said Levey, an aquatic biologist at the Department of Environmental Conservation.
The deformed frogs were emaciated, perhaps from inability to feed themselves, Levey added, and one died as the researchers held it.
Ferguson believes that the deformity rate might have been even higher earlier in the year before frogs with severe deformities died.
In Minnesota, where researchers have more frog-collecting experience, they found a frog with an eye inside its throat and another with virtually no hind legs.
Out of the meeting in Waterbury, state and federal officials agreed to find resources to study Northern leopard frogs across Vermont next year, and, if possible, Maine and New Hampshire as well.
In addition, Levey hopes to have the deformed frogs in his freezer tested for parasites.
"We hope to form a working group that will involve the state of Vermont, private herpetologists and university people" to direct the frog research, said Greg Hellyer of the EPA's lab in Lexington.
But Stanley Sessions, a biologist at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., believes he may already have the solution: a parasitic flatworm called the trematode.
In a lab study, Harris found that 72 percent of the frogs that were invaded by cysts like those produced by the trematode developed abnormal legs, especially duplicate legs.
He suggested that the surge in frog deformities could be part of "an ancient phenomenon dating back millions of years."
However, in Vermont, researchers saw no duplicate legs like those Sessions found, a fact that troubles Laura Eaton, wildlife biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service in New Hampshire.
"I'm not ready to buy into any theory right now," said Eaton.
Unfortunately, almost any theory on frog deformities will be tough to prove.
For example, Gerald Ankley of the EPA's Duluth lab has suggested that the deformities could be a by-product of human damage to the ozone layer.
A thinner ozone layer allows more ultraviolet light to reach the Earth, he points out, and ultraviolet light has damaged frog embryos in lab experiments.
But there is no evidence that ultraviolet light can cause missing legs, Ankley concedes, especially at the only slightly elevated levels found in nature.
Likewise, linking the deformities to any particular chemical is difficult since the deformities occur in places with very different chemical histories, from heavily treated Iowa farmland to relatively pristine Kill Kare State Park in Vermont.
"There doesn't appear to be one source of contamination that would explain all of these because they are so widespread," said Hellyer of the EPA.
