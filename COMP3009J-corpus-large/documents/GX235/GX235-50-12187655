ABSTRACT The Geysers geothermal f ield in northern California, with about 2000-MW electrical capacity, is the largest geothermal f ield in the world.
Despite its importance as a resource and as an example of a vapor-dominated reservoir, very few complete geochemical analyses of the steam have been published (Allen and Day, 1927; Truesdell and others, 1987).
This report presents data from 90 steam, gas, and condensate samples from wells in The Geysers geothermal f ield in northern California.
Samples were collected between 1978 and 1991.
Well attributes include sampling date, well name, location, total depth, and the wellhead temperature and pressure at which the sample was collected.
Geochemical characteristics include the steam/gas ratio, composition of noncondensable gas (relative propor tions of CO2, H2S, He, H2, O2, Ar, N2, CH4, and NH3), and isotopic values for D and 18O of H2O, 13C of CO2, and 34S of H2S.
The compilation includes 81 analyses from 74 different production wells, 9 isotopic analyses of steam condensate pumped into injection wells, and 5 complete geochemical analyses on gases from surface fumaroles and bubbling pools.
Most samples were collected as saturated steam and plot along the liquid-water/steam boiling curve.
Steam-togas ratios are highest in the southeastern part of the geothermal f ield and lowest in the northwest, consistent with other studies.
Wells in the Northwest Geysers are also enriched in N2/Ar, CO2 and CH4, D, and 18O.
Well discharges from the Southeast Geysers are high in steam/gas and have isotopic compositions and N2/Ar ratios consistent with recharge by local meteoric waters.
Samples from the Central Geysers show characteristics found in both the Southeast and Northwest Geysers.
Gas and steam characteristics of well discharges from the Northwest Geysers are consistent with input of components from a high-temperature reservoir containing carbonrich gases derived from the host Franciscan rocks.
Throughout the geothermal f ield, the carbon-isotopic composition of CO2 is consistent with derivation of carbon from Franciscan metasedimentary rocks.
NH3 concentrations are high in most Geysers well fluids, and are 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than would be expected in a the gas phase exhibiting homogeneous equilibrium at normal reservoir temperatures and pressures.
Evidently, NH3 is flushed from the Franciscan host rocks at a rate that exceeds the reaction rate for NH3 breakdown.
Many wells show clear influence by fluids from reinjection wells where steam condensate has been pumped back into the geothermal reservoir.
Six wells were resampled over the time period of this study.
One of these six wells was strongly affected by a nearby injection well.
Three of the six resampled wells showed some signs of decreasing liquid/ steam within the geothermal reser voir, consistent with "drying out" of the reservoir due to steam withdrawal.
However, two wells exhibited little change.
Analyses of gases from f ive surface manifestations (fumaroles and bubbling pools) are roughly similar to the deeper geothermal samples in both chemical and isotopic composition, but are lower in soluble gases that dissolve in groundwater during transit toward the surface.
INTRODUCTION The following report contains gas and isotope analyses of fluids discharged from steam wells in The Geysers geothermal f ield, Sonoma, Lake and Mendocino Counties, California.
These samples were collected and analyzed by a variety of USGS scientists over a period of 20 years.
Though sampling and analytical methodologies were not always identical, we have made every effort to ensure that the data are consistent and comparable, and we believe the data published herein are accurate within the precisions reported.
In addition to analytical data and locations, we have provided additional information on the wells, such as their total depth, depth of casing, temperature, and pressure, to aid workers in their use of the data.

BACKGROUND ABOUT THE GEYSERS The Geysers steam f ield is a vapor-dominated geothermal reservoir located in the Mayacmas Range in northern California, about 150 km north of San Francisco (f ig. 1).
It covers about 150 km2 on the border of Lake, Mendocino, and 1
2
Sonoma Counties.
In vapor-dominated systems, water is present as both liquid and steam, though vaporized water constitutes the pressure-supporting medium.
Thus, these reservoirs are signif icantly underpressured with respect to a hydrostatic load and must be tightly sealed by low-permeability rocks to prevent the system from being flooded by colder inf iltrating ground water (White and others, 1971).
The Geysers is the most obvious manifestation of a large heat-flow anomaly associated with the adjacent Clear Lake volcanic f ield, a late Pliocene to Holocene magmatic system
(Hearn and others, 1981, 1995; Donnelly-Nolan and others, 1981).
The Geysers steam f ield is oriented northwest-southeast, parallel to the southwest edge of the volcanic f ield.
It is bordered to the southwest and northeast by active NW-trending faults of the San Andreas fault system.
Apparently, these faults and associated lithology changes act as permeability bar riers that contain the geothermal system (Goff and others, 1977).

The energy crisis of 1973-74 spurred a large increase in geothermal exploration and development in subsequent years, and the electrical generating capacity at The Geysers reached 943 MW by late 1980, making it the largest powerproducing geothermal area in the world.
Development continued at a rapid pace through much of the 1980s, despite decreased steam prices and the increasingly common transfer of ownership of geothermal wells between companies.
Environmental regulations combined with the need to increase steam pressures led to reinjection of cooled, condensed steam into former production wells.
Although Unocal (a.k.a.
Union Geothermal) had begun a limited reinjection program in the Central Geysers as early as 1969 (Gambill, 1992), it was not until the early 1980s that the Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) and Calpine, operating in the
Southeast Geysers, began to reinject condensed steam (Klein and Enedy, 1992; Beall and others, 1992).
By 1989, the operati ng capacit y at The Geysers had reached over 2,0 00 M W T he rate of exploration f i nally . slowed as steam pr ices decreased and exploration cost s i ncreased due to the g reat depth s (

In all, ~770 deep wells have been dr illed i nto the geother mal system (locations for sampled wells are show n i n f igs. 1 a nd 2).

GEOLOGY OF THE GEYSERS RESERVOIR The Geysers geother mal f ield lies withi n the central belt of the Franciscan Complex, an assemblage of deep oceanic deposits for med in the Mesozoic Era and early Ter tiar y Per iod.
I n th is region, the Franciscan assemblage consists pr i mar ily of regionally metamor phosed g ray wacke, argillites , and cher ts.
Numerous th r ust faults result i n a complex overlapping of these rock types with Franciscan melange, ser pentin ite, and g reenstones (McLaughlin, 1981).
Most of the th r usti ng occur red contemporaneously with sedimentation and subduction.
During the last 2-3 million years, northwest-oriented, strike-slip faults have formed as part of the San Andreas fault system and offset many of the thrust packages within the steam f ield.
The Colloyami and Mercuryville strike-slip faults form the northeast and southwest edges of The Geysers f ield, respectively creating a geometry for the steam f ield that is elongate parallel to the faults of the San Andreas system.
The steam f ield is also coaxial with a large composite intrusion (f ig. 3), informally known as "the felsite" (Schriener and Suemnicht, 1981).
This composite intrusion of granite, granodiorite, and microgranite por phyry was emplaced at about 1.1-1.2 Ma (Dalrymple, 1993; Grove and others, 1998) and is thought to be an intrusive equivalent of Cobb Mountain dacite and rhyolite, part of the Clear Lake volcanic f ield (Hulen and Walters, 1993; Hulen and others, 1997b).
It appears highly likely that the geothermal system was created by intrusion of "the felsite" to create a liquid-dominated reservoir about a million years ago (Sternfeld, 1981; McLaughlin and others, 1983; Moore and Gunderson, 1995; Hulen and Nielson, 1996).
Besides its heat, the "felsite" may have induced some of the fracturing that has created the permeability necessar y to sustain an economic geother mal system (Hulen and Walters, 1993).
The liquid-dominated reservoir was characterized by studies of fluid inclusions and oxygen isotopes (Moore and Gunderson, 1995) and appears to have persisted until 0.28-0.25 Ma, when venting and consequent boiling produced the present-day geothermal system (Shook, 1995; Hulen and others, 1997a, b).
More recent, underlying, unsampled intrusions likely provide the heat that is being "mined" by the cur rent geothermal system (Hearn and others, 1981; Truesdell and others, 1987; Donnelly-Nolan and others, 1993).
The presence of recent intrusions is consistent with 3He/4He ratios in geothermal discharges (Kennedy and Truesdell, 1996) and the very high temperatures (~340Â°C) recorded in deep wells in the Northwest Geysers (Walters and others, 1992).
The productive portion of the geothermal reservoir is primarily located in weakly metamor phosed Franciscan rocks but extends down into the felsite intrusion and its sur rounding biotite-hornfels-grade aureole.
Most of the reservoir rocks are not highly porous, ranging from 1 to 5 percent (Gunderson, 1992a), and thus the steam appears to be located primarily in fractures, though there is some disagreement on the orienta-
tion of the most important steam-bearing fractures (cf. Thompson and Gunderson, 1992; Beall and Box, 1992).
Mapping of D anomalies caused by reinjection of condensate provides evidence that many steam-bearing fractures have a NNE trend (Beall and others, 1992), consistent with WNW regional extension.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GEYSERS STEAM RESERVOIR As noted above, The Geysers reservoir is a vapor-dominated reservoir that is underpressured with respect to a hydrostatic pressure gradient.
As suggested by White and others (1971) and modeled by Pruess (1985) and Shook (1995), vapor-dominated systems represent heat pipes wherein upward-flowing steam condenses to liquid droplets at the base of the caprock, which then flow back down through the reservoir.
Such a mechanism can account for the very high heat flow in the region, where heat is transported up toward the surface as steam.
White and others (1971) proposed that a deep boiling brine should underlie the geothermal system and that pressures would therefore return to hydrostatic levels at depth.
To date, evidence for a deep water table remains elusive, though fluid-inclusion evidence shows that dense, saline liquids have existed during the history of The Geysers geothermal system (Moore and Gunderson, 1995).
Because the reservoir contains both steam and liquid water droplets, the compositions of well discharges are a function of the relative amounts of the two phases available for transport to the surface (Truesdell and White, 1973; Truesdell and others, 1987).
The relative reservoir steam saturation (the proportion of steam to liquid water + steam, or "y" value) can be estimated by using a combination of gas equilibria and gas solubility equations (D'Amore and Celati, 1983; D'Amore and Truesdell, 1985).
The latter authors found that well discharges from the Southeast Geysers were composed mostly of recently boiled liquid water (y = 0.01 to 0.05), whereas fluids from the Northwest Geysers were predominantly derived from reservoir steam (y = 0.1 to 1.0).
These f ieldwide characteristics can partially be traced to different temperature reservoirs that have been identif ied.
The Geysers steam f ield is divided into two principal reservoirs, a normal-temperature reservoir and a high-temperature reservoir (NTR and HTR), which appear to be hydrologically connected.
In the NTR, temperatures are close to 240Â°C, with a pressure around 35 bars.
Pressures in the HTR are only marginally higher, though temperatures normally exceed 300Â°C and have been measured as high as 342Â°C (Walters and others, 1992).
The host rock for the NTR is normally Franciscan graywacke; though the HTR is found typically in the hornfels, no obvious changes in lithology occur as one passes from the NTR to the HTR (Walters and others, 1992).
Moreover, the temperature and pressure gradients be-
6
tween the reservoirs are continuous.
Wells that extend into the HTR, such as the Prati wells from the Northwest Geysers, pass through the NTR, and so sampled fluids represent a mixture of steam and gas from both reservoirs.
Though the HTR may reside beneath the NTR throughout The Geysers steam f ield, it has only been sampled in the Northwest and NorthCentral Geysers, where wells extend below the 5,900 ft (1,798 m) bsl elevation at which the HTR is located.
Kennedy and Truesdell (1996) conjecture that the low y and absence of evidence for the HTR in the Southeast Geysers may be due to the greater meteoric recharge (from Cobb Mountain) and greater heat conduction due to the shallower reservoir depths.
Geochemically, there are a number of obvious trends that differentiate the Southeast Geysers from the Northwest Geysers.
Steam discharges in the Southeast Geysers have an isotopic signature of slightly oxygen-exchanged meteoric water that is similar to present-day streams and springs in the region (Truesdell and others, 1987).
In contrast, samples from the Northwest Geysers have elevated 18O and D and show far less influence of present-day meteoric water.
Haizlip (1985) suggested that this isotopically enriched water was equivalent to "connate" or formation waters (derived from ancient seawater) that discharge from Franciscan and Great Valley sediments and are found throughout the Clear Lake volcanic f ield (White and others, 1973).
Donnelly-Nolan and others (1993) proposed that this end member is instead evolved meteoric fluid that has undergone near-closed-system, repeated boiling episodes within Franciscan rocks in areas of high heat flow.
Whatever its origin, Gunderson (1992b) showed that the trend in steam discharges is also accompanied by changes in the oxygen-isotope composition of host rocks in the geothermal reservoir.
In the Southeast Geysers, host rocks have lower 18O than in the Northwest Geysers, consistent with higher meteoric-water/rock ratios over the history of the geothermal system.
Apparently, natural recharge of meteoric water occurs mainly in the southeast part of the f ield (Truesdell and others, 1987).
The Northwest Geysers is also characterized by higher gas/steam ratios than the rest of the f ield, part of which is due to the influence of the high-gas-to-steam HTR (Walters and others 1992).
The higher gas content of the Nor thwest Geysers wells may be due partly to the high temperatures associated with the HTR, which causes breakdown of organic matter in Franciscan rocks, and to the lesser flushing by meteoric water in that part of the f ield over the lifetime of the system (Gunderson, 1992b).
Steam from the Northwest Geysers and parts of the Central Geysers are also high in HCl (Haizlip and Truesdell, 1989), values of which can reach nearly 100 ppm in bulk steam (Kennedy and Truesdell, 1996).
This has caused considerable cor rosion-related problems, and the operating companies have created mitigation systems to raise the pH of condensing steam in the wellbore (Bell, 1989).
Gas samples from the Northwest Geysers have been shown to have high 3He/4He ratios (R/Ra of 6.3 to 
Kennedy and Truesdell (1996)
interpreted these values to indicate modern magma degassing beneath the Northwest Geysers, possibly extending south underneath the entire geothermal f ield.
The degree to which a magmatic input influences the noncondensable-gas content (other than He) of The Geysers geothermal fluids is not clear.
SAMPLE COLLECTION Sampling procedures, described in greater detail in Fahlquist and Janik (1992), are summarized below.
Because The Geysers geothermal reservoir is a steam f ield rather than a liquid-dominated f ield, samples could be directly taken from the sampling port on an insulated steam line near the wellhead.
All acid mitigation systems were deactivated to prevent sample contamination and to ensure minimal condensation of fluid in the wellbore before sample collection.
In addition, precautions were taken to prevent condensation at the inlet to the sampling apparatus.
The high temperatures of well fluids required careful cooling prior to collection in the sample bottle.
A double-coil condenser of 1/4-in.-O.D. stainless-steel tubing was connected to the steam line by a regulating valve.
The f irst coil was immersed in water that was allowed to boil, effectively reducing the temperature of the sample to about 100Â°C.
The second coil was placed in an ice-water bath, which condensed the water vapor and reduced the sampling temperature to about 30Â°C.
Flow rate was regulated by a valve connected to the end of the second coil.
The steel coil was then connected to the sample bottle with silicone tubing.
The gas sampling bottle, a modif ied-Giggenbach bottle (Nehring and Tr uesdell, 1977) with known volume, was weighed, 1/4- to 1/3- f illed with a known amount of 4 N NaOH solution, and then evacuated so that the internal pressure of the bottle approximated that of the vapor pressure of the NaOH solution.
CO2, H2S, and NH3 were dissolved in the NaOH solution, which was diluted by condensed steam.
Other gases (He, Ar, N2, CH4, and H2) f illed the headspace in the bottle.
Sample collection was complete when: (1) the vacuum in the head space had disappeared and the bottle's internal pressure approached atmospheric pressure, or (2) if the caustic solution had become nearly saturated with soluble gases (typically only for fumaroles), or (3) if addition of condensed steam caused the bottle to become more than 75% full.
Steam condensate was collected from the silicone tubing at the outlet of the condenser for isotopic analysis.
Samples were collected in 60-mL glass bottles and f itted with airtight caps to prevent evaporation.
Five samples were collected from surface manifestations.
G95-01, 02, 03, and 04 were collected by inserting a funnel into standing water in Hot Springs Creek and at Old Geysers.
Gas passing through the funnel was collected into an evacuated gas bottle partly f illed with caustic solution, as above.
This sampling conf iguration results in loss of soluble gas components such as NH3, which dissolve in the standing
7
water.
Sample G96-01 was collected from a fumarole at milepost 2.51 on Big Sulphur Creek Road.
A titanium tube was placed directly in the vent, mud was packed around the tube to prevent air entrainment, and the Ti tube was connected to a gas bottle with silica-rubber tubing.
Condensates were collected by coiling the sampling tube and placing it in a bucket of water, causing the steam to condense before flowing into a 60-mL glass bottle with threaded top.
Bubbles of noncondensable gas were allowed to escape.
The condensate was kept signif icantly below 100Â°C to prevent boiling and signif icant evaporative loss, which would affect the isotopic composition of the sample.
sample constituents was determined.
Full details on sample analysis are available in Fahlquist and Janik (1992).
RESULTS Tables 1 through 5 contain well attributes, sample geochemistry from production wells, mean well compositions, characteristics of injection wells, and temporal trends for sample geochemistry, respectively.
Appendix I provides further documentation on sample acquisition, units, and context for data interpretation.
Below, we provide short summaries of observed trends in The Geysers geochemistry data set.
Before proceedi ng, it is wor th noti ng that well discharges are not subst antially different in composition than those collected in 1925 and analyzed by Allen and Day (1927).
Thei r analysis of Well 6, a 487-ft- deep well near The Geysers Resor t (f ig. 2) showed ~18,000 ppm by weight noncondensable gases, composed of 65.2% CO2, 14.65% H2, 15.40% CH4, 3.45% N2+N H3 and 1.35% H2S (all i n mol%), with i n the range of compositions noted in this st udy.
SAMPLE ANALYSIS Gases in the sample-bottle headspace (H2, He, Ar, CH4, N2 and O2) were analyzed by gas chromatography at Menlo Park.
After measuring the initial pressure in the headspace, two Carle AGC 111 gas chromatographs with thermal conductivity detectors were connected to a common sampling inlet system to allow the samples to be injected at known pressures less than 1 atmosphere (Fahlquist and Janik, 1992).
One chromatograph used Ar as a car rier gas, and the other used He.
Before the sample analyses, standards of known composition were used for calibration.
Sample concentrations were determined by reference to the peak areas for the standards.
After the gas analysis, the total volume of caustic (with dissolved sample gases and added steam condensate) was determined.
In addition, part of the caustic liquid was isolated for a density determination that was necessary for later quantif ication of the total gas analysis.
NH3 within the caustic solution was deter mined by gas-sensing electrode.
For all samples except those collected in 1981 (G81 samples), CO2 was liberated from the caustic solution by addition of phosphoric acid on a stable-isotope-extraction line.
The number of micromoles of CO2 was noted for a given volume of caustic solution.
The evolved CO2 was then kept for later isotopic analysis of 13C. G81 samples had their CO2 concentrations quantif ied by precipitation of carbonate as SrCO3, a technique that is not as accurate as direct evolution of CO2 gas by addition of phosphoric acid.
Earlier analyses, including those of Nehring (1981), overestimated CO2 because the amount of precipitated Sr(OH-)2 was not accounted for and was assumed to be SrCO3.
H2S, present in the solution as sulf ide, was oxidized to sulfate with H2O2 and then precipitated as BaSO4 by addition of BaCl2 to the solution, which f irst had been acidif ied with HCl to remove CO2.
Sulf ide was quantif ied by determining the mass of BaSO4 precipitated per volume of caustic.
For many samples, the BaSO4 was analyzed subsequently for its 34S by mass spectrometry.
The mass of water added to the sample bottle during sample collection (as steam condensate) was then quantif ied by subtracting the masses of all previously determined components.

The highest elevation in the steamf ield is over 1,400 m on the summit of Cobb Mountain (f ig. 2).
The lowest elevation is about 250 m, at the confluence of Squaw and Big Sulphur Creeks in the Northwest Geysers.
The topography is highly mountainous and irregular and is deeply dissected by numerous streams wherever the surface geology consists of Franciscan rocks.
In contrast, the drainage network is only poorly developed on Cobb Mountain and the other highly porous Clear Lake volcanics, (Goff and others, 1977; Kennedy and Truesdell, 1996).
As mentioned above, the ter rain has a distinctive northwest trend caused by Quaternary faulting.
TOTAL DEPTH Most wells are over 2,000 m deep, with the exception of some of the older ones, such as Sulphur Bank 8 and 15, drilled in the early 1960s.
Wells in the Northwest Geysers are the deepest, extending up to and over 3,000 m (f ig. 3).
TEMPERATURE Temperatures measured at the wellheads were quite consistent at 175 to 195Â°C.
Temperatures reported to DOGGR have a wider range, plausibly because they represent more variable conditions (shut-in, bleed, etc.), whereas the USGS samples were taken during normal operations.
As shown in
8
f igure 4, most samples fall within the steam region of a temperature versus pressure plot, but right along the saturation line for liquid water.
Samples with the highest temperatures and pressures, presumably reported to DOGGR immediately after being shut-in, approach the conditions expected for the initial reservoir before to development (White and others, 1971).
Such samples have pressures and temperatures close to the maximum enthalpy of saturated steam (235Â°C and 30.6 bars).
A few samples have high temperatures at relatively low pressures and plot well within the steam f ield.
Some of these samples come from the Northwest Geysers and may have some input from the high-temperature reservoir (HTR).
STEAM TO GAS (MOLAR) AND GAS/STEAM The wells from the Southeast Geysers were consistently higher in steam to gas than the Central And Northwest Geysers wells (f ig. 5).
Some of the Northwest Geysers wells contained over 5 % non-condensable gas.
In contrast, most Southeast Geysers wells had less than 1000 ppm gas by weight.
NONCONDENSABLE-GAS COMPOSITIONS CO 2
PRESSURE Most wellhead pressures ranged from 8 to 10 bars and reflect pressures along the univariant curve for saturated steam (see above).
pH FIELD VERSUS pH LAB Field measurements of pH were typically 0.5 to over 3.0 log units lower than corresponding measurements of the same samples in the lab.
This is likely due to degassing of CO2 between f ield sampling and laboratory analysis.
Samples from the Northwest Geysers appear to have had slightly higher f ield pHs and lower laboratory pHs.
CO2 concentrations in production-well fluids varied from 23.4 to 79.2 mol% of the noncondensable gases; however, most samples had 50-70% CO2.
Some fumaroles tended to have more CO2, presumably because they had low NH3 and H2S due to condensation of steam and loss of soluble gas to shallow ground and surface waters.
CO2 concentrations were higher in the Northwest Geysers than to the southeast and correlated negatively with H2S, steam/gas, and H2 (f ig. 5, 12a).

Unf illed circles represent data measured at wellhead by operator on day of sampling.
Small f illed squares are data reported to the California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources for the month that sampling took place.
Most of the data fall very close to the steam/water phase boundary, though some samples appear to lie totally within the steam f ield.
Figure 5.--Mol% CO2 vs. mol% H2S and molar steam/gas for The Geysers wells and surface manifestations.
A.
The two gases show a clear negative cor relation in all parts of the steam f ield.
Samples from the Southeast Geysers are highest in H2S.
B.
The regions of the f ield are easily differentiated on a plot of molar Steam/Gas versus mol% CO2.
Steam/gas clearly increases as one proceeds from northwest to southeast.
Unit 15 wells have similar CO2 to the Central Geysers but have lower steam/gas.

H2S H2S concentrations varied from 1.6 to 24.4%, though most sample concentrations ranged from 3 to 9%.
The highest relative concentrations were found in the Southeast Geysers wells, though given the low gas/steam in those samples, the absolute concentrations of H2S would not be high.
H2S cor related strongly with H2 (f ig. 6).
He He concentrations were very low.
Most were below detection, though a few constituted up to 0.07% of the noncondensable gases.
H2 H2 concentrations varied from about 7 to 33% of the noncondensable gases.
Most samples had between 10 and 30% H2.
As previously stated, a plot of H2 vs. H2S shows a strong cor relation between these two gases (f ig. 6).
O2 As expected for a reduced geothermal system with high H2S, H2, and CH4 concentrations, O2 concentrations were very low, even in samples with N2/Ar ratios consistent with incorporation of air or air-saturated water.
For example, G90-25 had very high N2, and N2/Ar, consistent with addition of air,
but the O2 had been reacted out prior to sampling or analysis.
O2 reacts rapidly with steel casing and steam in the wellbore (producing H2).
Only in samples where air was introduced during actual sampling is there likely to be any O2 entering the sample bottle.
The only samples with signif icant O2 were the two surface manifestations collected as gas bubbling through water in Hot Springs Creek.
Ar Ar concentrations were uniformly low, and generally below 0.1% of the noncondensable gas.
The sample with the highest Ar content, G81-15 from the McKinley 1 well, was also unusual for having extremely low CO2 and high H2.
Air may have been entered the wellbore at some stage, diluting the gaseous components in the geothermal fluid, and reacting with the steel casing to produce oxidized iron and H2.
In general, samples with the highest Ar concentrations had N2/Ar ratios between that of air and air-saturated water (f ig. 7).
N2 Most samples had N2 concentrations between 1 and 5 mol% of the noncondensable constituents, though a few had much higher values, presumably due to addition of air or large amounts of gas from air-saturated water.
In general, N2 concentrations did not correlate positively with N2/Ar ratios.
However, they did correlate strongly with CH4 (f ig. 8), as would be expected for thermal breakdown of organic matter.

CH4 concentrations ranged from less than 1 to over 20 mol% of the noncondensable gas, though most samples tended to fall in the range of 3 to 13%.

NH
NH3 concentrations had a similar range to those of CH4, most falling in the range of 3 to 12% of the noncondensable gases.
The highest values were found in the Northwest Geysers (CCOC and Unit 15 wells), though high values were also found in other areas.
Unlike CH4, there was no obvious correlation between high NH3 and high gas to steam ratios.
Though samples reach ratios as low as 18, the majorit y of The Geysers gas samples had N2/A r ratios g reater than that of ai r (84) or ai r-sat urated water (ASW: 38).
Over 17 samples , pri marily those with high gas/steam ratios had N2/ A r over 200, and a number of others had ver y high values but were unquantif ied because thei r A r concentrations were below the detection limit.
T he N2 in samples with N2/A r less than ASW probably has undergone par tial conversion to NH3.

13C in CO2 Samples from throughout the f ield had 13C tightly clustered between about Â­12 and Â­15, with no obvious trends within this range.
Values of this magnitude are signif icantly lower than magmatic values (Â­8 to Â­4; Allard and others 1977; Allard, 1979) or carbon values from most marine carbonates (Rollinson, 1993).
However, they are signif icantly greater than values typically associated with the breakdown of organic materials in sedimentary rocks, which are usually 
34S in H2S Though the two laboratories that provided sulfur-isotopic analyses gave values that differed somewhat, both gave values near zero (the total range for both data sets was Â­3.3 to +1.9 ).
Such values are consistent with (but do not prove) an igneous source of sulfur to The Geysers geothermal reservoir.
D and 18O in steam D plotted against 18O range from close to the meteoric-water line to an oxygen-shifted endmember similar to magmatic and metamor phic fluids (f ig. 9) and are consistent with values from Truesdell and others (1987) and Beall and others (1992).
The most 18O-shifted samples were those with high gas-to-steam ratios, found primarily in the Northwest Geysers.
Waters pumped into injection wells was much higher in D, consistent with evaporative fractionation at the surface to create isotopically heavy residual waters.
Some Union samples collected in 1990 (primarily from the Southeast and Central Geysers) appeared to show some mixing with this injection-derived heavy water (similar trends discussed in detail in Beall and others, 1992).
Southeast Geysers samples showed the greatest influence of meteoric water.
Samples from the Northwest Geysers were strongly shifted towards a heavyoxygen, high-deuterium end member and showed no obvious mixing with any reinjected fluid.
The isotopically enriched end member is discussed further below.

Central Geysers, 130 in the Northwest Geysers, and 220 in Unit 15 wells (Table 3).
Central Geysers wells were more variable, and some of these wells may receive input from the HTR.
Looking only at the noncondensable-gas compositions, Southeast Geysers wells had higher relative H2S and H2 and lower CO2 than the other parts of the f ield (f ig. 10).
Organic gases were highest in the Northwest Geysers: Unit 15 had the highest proportion of CH4, though Northwest Geysers wells had the highest relative NH3.
The Northwest Geysers wells also had the highest relative CO2 concentrations.
Fumarole samples were different from well fluids in that they lacked NH3 and had higher relative proportions of CO2, N2, and other gases (particularly O2 and Ar; f igs. 7, 10, 11a).

Figure 10.--Pie diagrams illustrate the relative amounts of various noncondensable gases in The Geysers well discharges.
CO2 dominates the noncondensable fractions from all wells but is most abundant in the Northwest Geysers.
Wells from the Southeast Geysers are highest in H2S and H2, whereas Unit 15 wells contain the highest CH4 concentrations.
Figure 11.--Ternary diagrams for noncondensable gases from The Geysers steam f ield.
A. N2 Â­ 100*Ar Â­ 1000*He diagram shows that samples range from air-saturated-water (ASW)- and air-derived- end members toward a He-enriched component consistent with either crustal or magmatic input to the system.
The Geysers samples follow a trend similar to that for samples from the nearby Clear Lake volcanic f ield (Sulphur Bank-Borax Lake trend of Goff and others, 1995).
B. N2 Â­ 100Ar Â­ CH4 diagram has a similar trend to A, but toward a CH4-rich organic/sedimentary endmember.
C. CH4-H2SH2 ternary f igure demonstrates the high H2 and H2S of most samples from the Southeast Geysers as compared to those from Unit 15 and Northwest Geysers wells, which trend toward a very CH4-enriched composition.
H2/H2S of Geysers well fluids is relatively constant.
12
There are two basic end members of Geysers gases.
The f irst end member is high in CH4, CO2, gas/steam, and N2/Ar and is typically found in the Northwest Geysers, both in the Prati wells (CCOC) and Unit 15 (f ig. 5b, f ig. 11b, f ig. 12).
This type of sample is typif ied by Prati 25 (G91-10).
The other end member is found in the Southeast Geysers.
It is
lower in CO2, and CH4 and higher in H2S and H2 (f ig. 11c, 13).
N2/Ar values are closer to air-saturated water (f ig. 7), gas/steam ratios are low (f ig. 13a), and dD and d18O values (f ig. 9) are only slightly removed from those found in local meteoric water.
A representative sample of this g roup is McKinley 3 (G81-16).

NH3 concentrations are very high in the Northwest Geysers (f ig. 10) but tend to decrease in the samples with the very highest gas/steam (f ig. 14).
In the Central Geysers, NH3
appears to correlate with D as a result of reinjection of steam condensate (see below).
The relative abundance of NH3 relative to N2 and H2 is much higher than would be expected at equilibrium, as is discussed in the next section.
EQUILIBRIUM, MIXING, AND CONDENSATION IN THE GEYSERS RESERVOIR Numerous indicators hint that the sampled fluids from The Geysers reservoir were not in equilibrium with each other, and moreover, individual constituents within a single gas sample do not typically attain equilibrium.
This is complicated by the observation that Geysers well discharges are a mixture of reservoir steam and liquid, all of which is flashed to steam during withdrawal (Truesdell and others, 1987), and would be unlikely to attain equilibrium.
Figure 15 displays a plot of temperature versus log H2/ H2O, as modif ied from f igure 4 of Giggenbach (1987).
The Geysers samples are plotted as a f ield (in gray) that completely includes all samples from the present study.
Temperature is chosen to be 250Â±50Â°C, which brackets the downhole temperatures measured in most parts of the f ield.
Samples from The Geysers plot between the Ni/NiO and magnetite/ hematite buffers.
The range of H2/H2O is striking, given the homogeneity of temperatures in the geothermal reservoir.
Most of the samples with the lowest H2/H2O values are from the Southeast Geysers.
By accounting for the higher steam saturation in that part of the f ield, and calculating only that part of the H2 and H2O introduced directly by reservoir steam,

the H2/H2O values are much more similar and plot between ~Â­2.5 and Â­3.0 (discussed in f igure caption: solubility data for H2 from Giggenbach (1980) and y values calculated with method of D'Amore and Truesdell, 1985).
Such values are appropriate for a geothermal reservoir rock containing both ferric and fer rous iron.
The Geysers data, plotted on a graph of log of the concentrations of (NH3)2/(N2xH2O) versus the log of the concentrations of CH4/CO2 (f ig. 16) implies a very different oxidation state than that displayed in f ig. 15.

Geysers samples plot at more reducing conditions than the magnetite/fayalite equilibrium and equilibrated at temperatures above 600Â°C.
Boiling of reservoir liquid does not account for the high NH3 concentrations because NH3 still partitions strongly into the vapor, and samples with the highest calculated y value (as determined from f ig. 4 of Truesdell and others, 1987) have some of the highest values of (NH3)2/ (N2xH2O).
Both plots cannot be correct; and in fact, it appears that the amount of NH3 in The Geysers samples far exceeds that which could be in equilibrium with the rest of the geother mal fluid at geother mal temperatures and typical crustal oxidation states.
Geochemical modeling with SOLVGAS (Symonds and Reed, 1993) demonstrates that NH3 from The Geysers steam f ield is several orders of magnitude more abundant than would be expected at typical reservoir temperatures and pressures (240Â°C and 30 bars).
SOLVGAS can calculate the equilibrium distribution of gas species, given an input composition, temperature, and pressure.
Calculated N2/NH3 ratios are more than 160 times greater than those actually observed.
The H2, H2O, CH4, and CO2 were consistent with equilibrium at 30 bars and ~235Â°C for sample G90-11, and with an equilibrium temperature of 297Â°C for sample G91-10 from the Northwest Geysers.
However, inclusion of NH3 in the calculations proved unsuccessful.

The f illed circles represent samples A86-4, A86-9, G88-15, G90-7, G90-20, G90-25, and G91-02.
The unf illed circles are the same samples corrected to account for H2O derived from reservoir liquid boiled during steam withdrawal.
The y values (a fraction equal to H2O from steam divided by H2O from both reservoir steam and liquid) were estimated from f igure 4 of Truesdell and others, 1987).
Steam/liquid partition coeff icient for H2 was from Giggenbach (1980) and calculated for 240Â°C.
For clarity, samples are offset along the X-axis from their uncorrected equivalents and do not imply different temperatures.
The f igure demonstrates great heterogeneity of H2/H2O for bulk well discharges, but similar H2/H2O values calculated for the steam fraction within the reservoir.
It thus appears that H2 has an approximately equilibrium concentration within the steam phase of the reservoir and is in equilibrium with typical crustal Febuffering assemblages.

not match actual concentrations except at temperatures below 100Â°C, resulting in poor f its for the other components.
Calculations by Eugster (1972) for conditions of 500 K (227Â°C) show that the relative NH3 and N2 concentrations of typical Geysers samples such as G81-0 9 are consistent with H2 fu gacities of ~0 .5 bars, more than 100 times those likely at t he ~30 bars total pressure of T he Geysers reservoir.
The NH3 is either coming from great depth (
Evidently, the N H3 does not have suff i cient tim e to equilibrate in The Geysers reservoir.
Giggenbach (1987) noted that NH3 was the slowest of the geotherm al gas es to equilibrate.
SOURCES OF COMPONENTS IN THE GEYSERS FLUIDS End member #1 -- Northwest Geysers: Samples from the Northwest Geysers are unique in composition, as discussed above, and are characterized by high CO2, CH4,and gas/steam, relatively high NH3, and low H2S and H2.
Such characteristics imply a strong component of fluid from the HTR (Walters and others, 1992).
As noted by several workers, there is also an obvious trend in the isotopic composition of Northwest Geysers well samples away from a meteoric end member towards an isotopically heavy composition that is similar to both connate and magmatic waters (Haizlip, 1985; Walters and others, 1992; D'Amore and Bolognesi, 1993; Kennedy and Truesdell, 1996).
The gas samples in this study, particularly from the Northwest Geysers, are consistent with this observation.
Fluids with a strong meteoric signature come from the southeast part of the f ield; e.g., most Southeast Geysers samples consistently plot with 18O between Â­5 and Â­7 and with D between Â­ 50 and Â­60.
Other Southeast Geysers samples trend toward the composition of evaporated steam condensate that has been pumped back into the ground (as discussed below).
In contrast, the Northwest Geysers samples point toward an end member with around Â­4 18O and Â­40 D, which could feasibly extend into the region commonly associated with high-temperature volcanic gas or steam (shown on f ig. 9).
However, these same samples have characteristics that are inconsistent with a simple magmatic origin, and are more representative of connate (sedimentary) or metamorphic fluids, which have compositions that can overlap with those of magmatic fluids (White and others, 1973).
One example of this connate/metamor phic signature is the 13C of CO2 in the Geysers samples, which is very similar t hroughout the fi eld, ranging only from Â­11.7 to Â­15.0 VP DB (most a r e between Â­12 and Â­14).
As discussed by Bergf eld a n d ot her s ( 1999), s uch value s a r e ty p ical of F ranciscan carbonate veins (see also Sternfeld, 1981; Lambert and Epstein, 1992).
Carbon isotopes from vein carbonate in Franciscan graywackes, taken from a core drilled in the
bottom of S ulphur Bank 15 (SB-15) cluster around a value of Â­12, with all values (n = 24) falling between Â­9 and Â­15 (Bergfeld and others, 1999).
Both metamorp hic veins and younger hydrotherm al veins yield values similar t o those for CO2 from gas samples in this report.
Bergfeld and others (1999) concluded that modern gases have derived their carbon primarily from these older metamorp hic calcite veins, mixed with some carbon from organic materials in the Franciscan rocks.
There is no evidence for signif i cant magmatic carbon input to the system, which should have a value of Â­4 to Â­8 (Allard and others, 1977; Allard, 1979; Rollinson, 1993).
Analyses of 13C in CH4 are also low (Â­29 to Â­33 VPDB, see footnote to table 2), and imply a thermally derived sedimentary component of methane to The Geysers system (see also Shigeno and others, 1987; Bergfeld and others, 1999).
Another characteristic inconsistent with magmatic input to The Geysers reservoir fluid is the high CH4 and NH3 concentrations in the high gas/steam wells of the Northwest Geysers.
These two gases are unstable at magmatic temperatures and crustal oxidation states and are typically added to geothermal and volcanic discharges by relatively low-temperature addition from sedimentary and metamorphic sources (Symonds and others, 1994; Giggenbach, 1987).
Ternary diagrams of N2-Ar-CH4 show a clear trend from an air-saturated meteoric water end member toward a CH4-rich source most obvious in the Nor thwest Geysers and Unit 15 (f ig. 11).
Gunderson (1992b) also noted the trend toward gas-rich compositions in the Northwest Geysers and attributed it to the greater thickness of Franciscan reservoir rock in the Northwest Geysers, relative to felsite, and the lesser flushing of the northwest part of the f ield by recharge of meteoric water.
This nonmeteoric end member is also obvious in the N2/Ar ratios of high gas/steam fluids, which exceed 300 in 7 samples and are far greater than the atmospheric ratio of 84.
High N2/Ar is also found in springs and gas vents all over the Clear Lake volcanic f ield, as discussed by Goff and others (1995) and Goff and Janik (1993).
For example, Goff and Janik (1993) reported high values at the Herman Pit of Sulphur Bank Mine (N2/Ar = 248), at Jones Hot Spring (191), and at the Kelseyville methane well (195).
Even higher values were listed by Jenden and others (1988) for natural gases from deep wells in the California Great Valley.
These gases had N2/Ar ranging from 
These extraordinarily high values were attributed by Jenden and others (1988) to production of N2 by thermal decomposition of organic matter and/or oxidation of ammonium in sheet silicates of the Franciscan assemblage believed to underlie the Great Valley strata in the California Great Valley.
It is therefore reasonable to postulate that the high CH4, gas/steam ratios and N2/Ar in the Northwest Geysers is from a Franciscan sedimentary/metamorphic component to The Geysers gases.
The high temperatures and high 3He/4He (Kennedy and Truesdell, 1996) may also indicate an input of magmatic heat and mantle-derived noble gases to the Northwest Geysers.
The sulfur-isotopic signature from Geysers
16
steam samples (close to 0 CDT) are also compatible with a magmatic origin but could conceivably be explained as the composition of H2S in equilibrium with Franciscan-seawater-derived sulfate (~+20 to +30 CDT) that is dissolved into the liquid phase in the geothermal reservoir.
Norman and others (1998) found excess H2S in fluid inclusions from The Geysers reservoir and attributed it to magmatic input of sulfur-rich gases and low kinetic rates of breakdown by reaction with rock.
End member #2 -- Southeast Geysers: In comparison to end member #1 from the Northwest Geysers, the well discharges typical of the southeast part of The Geysers f ield are higher in H2, H2S, and H2O, the latter which is relatively unshifted in its isotopic composition.
This reflects higher meteoric recharge to the Southeast Geysers (Truesdell and others, 1987), a greater integrated water/rock ratio over time, and less resulting influence of gases from argillaceous Franciscan Complex metagraywackes (Gunderson, 1992b).
The high H2 concentrations are consistent with the high steam/gas.
H2 is relatively fast at equilibrating in geothermal systems (Giggenbach, 1987), and the high H2 values reflect the higher steam abundances and reduction of H2O to H2 at geothermal temperatures.
As mentioned above, H2/ H2O ratios in gases from the Southeast Geysers are low due to the addition of liquid water from the reservoir during production.
H2S values are high due to partial equilibrium sulf ide (Norman and others, 1998) and lower dilution with high CH4-CO2 Franciscan-derived gases.
Compared with many geothermal systems (Ellis, 1979), The Geysers gases are quite low in CO2, averaging less than 50% of the noncondensable gases in the Southeast Geysers wells.
The concentrations of carbon gases are highest in the Northwest Geysers and lowest in the southeast.
Again, this likely reflects the greater flushing of the Southeast Geysers over time by meteoric waters, resulting in most of the Franciscan-derived carbon gases having been swept from the southeast part of the reservoir (Truesdell and others, 1987; Gunderson, 1992b).
from the injection wells and those Southeast Geysers samples closest to the meteoric water line) indicate that as much as 25-40% of the steam in some wells appears to be derived from reinjected fluids.
The sample with the most obvious "injectate" signature also has the highest NH3 concentration of any sample from The Geysers that we analyzed (f ig. 17).
Given the high solubility of NH3 in liquid H2O, it is likely that some of this gas dissolves in condensing steam in the wellbore and then remains in the steam condensate during cooling at the surface before reinjection.
Samples with a high proportion of "injectate" would then have higher NH3 concentrations than the typical Geysers well fluid (already very

EFFECTS OF RE-INJECTION The most obvious signs of reinjected steam condensate in the samples from this study are those from the Southeast and Central parts of the f ield.
On a plot of D vs. 18O, (f ig. 9), one can discern a trend from an 18O- and D- depleted end member toward the f ield represented by the eight injection wells which are considerably enriched in D and 18O due to low temperature (
The trend is distinct from that shown by wells from the Northwest Geysers, which points toward a more 18O-enriched "connate" water that is distinct from the injected steam condensates (table 4).
The trend implies that injected fluids have migrated from injection wells to be reboiled and returned to the surface through production wells.

high as noted above).
Increased NH3 in well discharges of the Southeast Geysers were discussed by Beall (1993), who discusses the use of NH3 as a tracer for injectate.
Figure 17 also demonstrates that Central Geysers wells with the highest D also have N2/Ar ratios that are consistent with higher contributions of air-saturated water, as would be expected for steam condensate that had sat at the surface before reinjection.
As discussed below, the 1991 sampling of Prati 38 (Nor thwest Geysers) also showed obvious influence of "injectate," with increased NH3 and steam/gas.
trips and appears to have been influenced by the nearby injection well (Prati 9).
Compared with the 1988 samples of Prati 38, the 1991 sampling is higher in Ar and has a lower N2/Ar ratio, indicating a greater influence of air-saturated water.
The gas/steam ratio decreased markedly between 1988 and 1991, and the NH3 concentration increased by 250%, as would be likely if there were a strong "injectate" signature.
FUMAROLE COMPOSITIONS AS COMPARED WITH WELL DISCHARGES When compared with the relative noncondensable-gas abundances of well discharges, the fumaroles are low in H2S and NH3.
These gases have relatively high solubility in the O2-rich meteoric waters that geothermal fluids would have to pass through to reach the surfac e. N2, Ar, and O2 are all higher in the fumarolic gases, as might be expected for surface emanations.
The N2/Ar ratio is also consistent with input of airsaturated water.
CH4 and H2 are about the same as samples in the well-discharge database and CO2 is somewhat higher.
The 13C of CO2 from the fumaroles is the same as that of CO2 from the geothermal reservoir.
TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE GEYSERS FLUIDS Seven wells in the database were resampled over time (once each: table 5).
The three samples from the Southeast Geysers, CA956#1, McKinley 3 and Abel 1 were resampled 7.5, 6 and 20 months after the original samplings, respectively.
Each showed increased gas/steam and mol% CO2, decreased NH3,and decreased H2S.
The decreases in NH3 and H2S would indicate a lesser influence of a liquid phase in the reservoir, as both gases are relatively soluble in any condensed phase.
If the liquid phase were still abundant but were undergoing progressive boiling, one would expect increased abundance of soluble gases over time, and decreased gas/steam ratios, as most gases are only slightly soluble and would boil away early.
Instead, the opposite is tr ue.
Most likely, the amount of saturated liquid feeding these two wells decreased during the interval between sampling.
Loss of this liquid phase would increase permeability through small cracks in the reservoir where adsorbed liquids would originally reside, potentially resulting in increased migration of gas and steam through regions previously occupied by NH3- and H2S-rich liquids.
Reduction of reservoir liquid is consistent with the progressively lower reservoir temperatures and pressures observed as a result of production and withdrawal of reservoir fluids over time (Truesdell and White, 1973).
Beall and Box (1993) noted a similar increase in noncondensable gas with time, as well as an increase in the mole fraction of CO2.
They attribute the change to reduction of reservoir pressures, causing open-system flow of CO2-rich gases into the Southeast Geysers from below the geothermal reservoir.
Their explanation is similar to that offered above, but infers an external source of noncondensable gas to the reservoir, rather than simply a decrease in saturation of the system and flow of noncondensable gases already present.
There was little change in Rorabaugh A-4 (Unit 15) in the two years between sampling.
Changes in Prati State 24 (Northwest Geysers) were also small.
Prati 25 (Northwest Geysers) had increased gas/steam, which was accompanied by an increased D, implying a greater proportion of the Franciscan "connate" component (discussed in previous section) over time.
The composition of Prati 38 (Northwest Geysers) changed markedly over the 3 years between sampling
CONCLUSIONS Â· This database of geother mal f luid analyses from the Geysers contains chemical data on 81 production-well discharges and 9 injection wells from, the Nor thwest, Central, and Southeast Geysers , Unit 15 (westcentral Geysers), and 5 surface manifestations in the Central Geysers.
Wellhead temperatures and pressures cor respond to the liquid-water/steam boiling cur ve or slightly superheated conditions.
Â· Evidence for recharge of meteoric water is most obvious in samples from the Southeast Geysers, where steam has an isotopic composition close to that of slightly oxygen-exchanged present-day precipitation and N2/Ar ratios are similar to or slightly higher than air-saturated water.
The noncondensable component in Southeast Geysers geothermal fluids is enriched in H2 and H2S.
Â· Many of the differences between the Northwest Geysers and Southeast Geysers can be explained by higher temperatures and considerable contributions of carbonrich gases from the host Franciscan assemblage to the Northwest Geysers.
The Franciscan component is manifested in the high concentrations of CO2 and CH4, the low 13C of CO2 and CH4,and the high N2/Ar.
In contrast, there is evidence for greater input of meteoric water (recharge) to the Southeast and a longer history of meteoric water-rock reaction, which would have depleted the local Franciscan rocks of their carbon-rich component and caused both rock and fluid to have isotopic compositions

more similar to meteoric water.
Contributions of magma-derived gas to the Northwest Geysers has been suggested by Kennedy and Truesdell (1996) and may be responsible throughout the f ield for the near-zero values for 34S of H2S.
The high N2/Ar of the Northwest Geysers may be explained either by a magmatic input or a sedimentary input (the explanation favored herein).
The abundance of NH3 is too high to reflect equilibrium within the geothermal reservoir, even if it were derived partially due to boiling of liquid condensate.
Apparently, NH3 enters the system due to breakdown of Franciscan-hosted organic materials and reacts too slowly with the other gaseous components to reach equilibrium.
Seven wells resampled during this study show some increases in y (steam/liquid+steam) in the reservoir and some influence of injection-derived condensate.
Several wells showed no appreciable change in discharge composition.
Surface manifestations are similar in chemical and isotopic composition to deep fluids but have higher CO2 and lower NH3 and H2S.
N2/Ar ratios reflect air-saturated water.

APPENDIX I: DESCRIPTION OF DATA TABLES TABLE 1.
WELL ATTRIBUTES Sample #: Denotes an individual visit to a particular well.
All samples collected by USGS personnel begin with the letter "G".
Unit15 wells were collected in 1986 by Geo Corporation and begin with the letter "A".
Samples A87-1and A87-2 were collected by Mr. Tom Box of Calpine Corporation in 1987.
The number following the initial letter represents the year in which the sample was collected (19XX).
The final number denotes the order in which the samples were collected during that year.
Well: The full name of the well.
G95 and G96 samples are from surface manifestations rather than wells.
Region: S= Southeast; C= Central; N= Northwest; U= Unit 15.
In order to facilitate plotting of the geochemical data, the steam field was divided into 4 regions.
The boundaries of these regions are shown in fig. 1.
The limits were chosen partly based on geography and partially based on steam/gas ratios.
API Number: The official designation of the well as listed by the California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR).
Map #: The number assigned to the well in figure 1.
Well Type: Wells are listed as production or injection, depending on what they were used for at the time of collection.
Reinjection became mandatory, due to environmental concerns, in the late 1960s, before the first sampling for this study.
G95 and G96 samples are from bubbling pools and fumaroles rather than wells.
Year Drilled: The year that the well was first put into production.
Operator: The company utilizing the well at the time of sampling.
CGC= Calpine Geysers Corporation, CCOC=Coldwater Creek Operator Corporation, Union= Unocal Geothermal Company.
Current Operator: All wells sampled for this study that are now active are utilized by Calpine.
The former CCPA wells are inactive and the Unit 15 wells are abandoned.
Latitude: Latitude of the well listed in decimal degrees.
Data are from varied sources, including Reed (1982), California Division of Oil and Gas (1992), and public records available through the California DOGGR.
Longitude: Longitude of the well listed in decimal degrees.
Data are from varied sources, including Reed (1982), California Division of Oil and Gas (1992), and public records available through the California DOGGR.
Latitude: Latitude of the well listed in meters (Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 10).
Data were generated from the latitude records above.
Longitude: Longitude of the well listed in meters (Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 10). ).
Data were generated from the longitude records above.
Section-Township-Range: The section, township, and range where the well is located.
Sample Date: The date of sampling in year/month/day.
Surface Elevation: The ground elevation, in meters, at the site of the well.
Total Depth: The well depth, in meters, measured relative to the surface elevation.
Casing Depth: The depth to which the well was fully cased before sampling, relative to the surface elevation, in meters.
Perforated casing is not included.
Wellhead T: The temperature of the well discharge at the sampling
point on the Earth's surface, in Â°C.
This is usually significantly lower than the downhole reservoir temperature.
Stated value represents the temperature of the discharge on the day of sampling, as supplied by the operator to the USGS.
Wellhead P: The pressure of the well discharge at the sampling point on the Earth's surface.
This is usually significantly lower than the downhole reservoir pressure.
Stated value represents the pressure of the discharge on the day of sampling, as supplied by the operator to the USGS.
Pressure in bars (absolute, corrected from gauge pressure), with psi (lbs/in2) in parentheses.
Wellhead T*: Because we did not obtain wellhead temperatures at the time of collection for all of our samples, we have included the temperature of the well discharge, in Â°C, as reported by the operator to the California DOGGR for the reporting period of the month of sampling.
The temperature represents a single individual temperature measurement during that month, and could be strongly affected by well conditions such as shut-in, blowoff, etc.
As such, it may be different from the wellhead temperature at the time of sampling.
Wellhead P*: Because we did not obtain wellhead pressures at the time of collection for all of our samples, we have included the pressure of the well discharge as reported by the operator to the California DOGGR for the reporting period of the month of sampling.
The pressure represents a single individual pressure measurement during that month, and could be strongly affected by well conditions such as shut-in, blow-off, etc.
As such, it may be different from the wellhead pressure at the time of sampling, and could be different than typical operating conditions.
Pressure in bars (absolute, corrected from gauge pressure), with PSI (lbs/in2) in parentheses.
