Natural History Information
Historical background and range of coyotes in Massachusetts: Coyotes originally moved into the central and western regions of Massachusetts in the 1950s, and they have been in the Eastern sections and Cape Cod since the 1970s.
This canid species is now well established statewide.
Coyotes are often seen individually, in pairs, or in small groups.
The area a coyote uses may vary from 4 to 30 square miles.
Description: Coyotes are the size of a medium-size dog, but with longer, thicker fur.
Coyotes have a long, bushy, black-tipped tail that is usually carried pointed down.
Their snout is long and slender, and their ears are pointed and erect.
The pelts of coyotes in Massachusetts range from grayish-black to blondes, light tan, dark tan, or even all black.
Females weigh 33-40 lbs and males are slightly larger (34-47 lbs).
Coyotes can attain weights of 50-60 lbs.
Because of their thick fur, weights of coyotes can easily be over-estimated.
Food: Coyotes are opportunistic feeders and their primary foods include small rodents, rabbits, deer, birds, snakes, frogs, and insects.
They will also eat fruits, berries, vegetables, garbage, and pet food left outdoors.
In some areas they prey upon unprotected pets, including house cats, and have been known to attack domestic dogs.
Because coyotes utilize so many different food sources, they have adapted to and live in a variety of habitats including urban and heavily populated areas.
Habits: Coyotes are usually shy and elusive.
Male and female Coyotes pair up, establish a territory, and breed in February or March; 4 to 8 pups are born in April or May.
Activity is variable; they can be active night or day, and sightings at dawn or dusk are common.
They remain active all year-round and do not hibernate
Coyotes are an important natural resource in Massachusetts.
They are classified as a furbearer species, for which an established harvest season and management program exists.

Preventing Conflicts With Coyotes
Coyotes are currently well established throughout the state from the Berkshires to Cape Cod.
They thrive in suburban and urban areas close to people.
Coyotes eat many different foods, including small animals, fruits, vegetables, garbage, and pet food.
Remember everything a coyote does is related to a potential meal.
Here are a few suggestions to make your property less attractive to coyotes.
*
Secure your garbage! Coyotes will raid open trash materials and compost piles.
Secure your garbage in tough plastic containers with tight fitting lids and keep in secure buildings when possible.
Take out trash the morning pick up is scheduled, not the previous night.
Keep compost piles in containers designed to contain but vent the material.
Don't feed or try to pet coyotes! Keep wild things wild! Feeding, whether direct or indirect, can cause coyotes to act tame and over time may lead to bold behavior.
Coyotes that rely on natural food items remain wild and wary of humans.
Keep your pets safe! Although free roaming pets are more likely to be killed by automobiles than by wild animals, coyotes do view cats and small dogs as potential food and larger dogs as competition.
For the safety of your pets, keep them restrained at all times.
Keep bird feeder areas clean! Use feeders designed to keep seed off the ground as the seed attracts many small mammals coyotes prey upon.
Remove feeders if coyotes are regularly seen around your yard.
Feed pets indoors! Outdoor feeding attracts many wild animals to your door!
Close off crawl spaces under porches and sheds! Coyotes use such areas for resting and raising young.
Don't let coyotes intimidate you! Don't hesitate to scare or threaten coyotes with loud noises, bright lights, or water.
Cut back brushy edges in your yard! These areas provide cover for coyotes and their prey.
* Protect livestock and produce! Coyotes will prey upon livestock.
Techniques, such as fencing, will protect livestock from predation.
Clear fallen fruit from around fruit trees.
* Educate your neighbors! Pass this information along since your efforts will be futile if neighbors are providing food or shelter for coyotes.
