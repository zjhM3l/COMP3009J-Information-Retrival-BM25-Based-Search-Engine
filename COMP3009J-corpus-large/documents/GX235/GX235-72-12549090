Those proposed rules lapsed in November 1998.
(Texas law requires that proposed rules be finalized within six months of their proposal dates.)
A new set of proposed ephedrine rules was approved by the Board of Health on Jan. 12, 1999.
See above links for more information about these proposed rules.
_______________________________________________________________
On May 15, 1998, the Texas Board of Health proposed rules that would restrict the sale of some products that contain ephedrine.
____________________________________________________________________
1) What are the Texas Board of Health rules intended to do? The proposed rules would classify ephedrine as a dangerous drug and require a prescription for most ephedrine- containing products sold in Texas.
A dangerous drug is one that is unsafe for self-medication.
The Board of Health has the authority to require a prescription for a dangerous drug if that drug has been shown to be abused or misused.
Prescription status implies that a drug is used under the supervision of a licensed physician.
2) Why were these rules proposed? More than 1,400 reports of a wide range of adverse effects, including eight deaths, associated with the use of ephedrine have been recorded in Texas since 1993.
The Board of Health is concerned with the safety of these products, especially when self-administered, and believes requiring a prescription under the supervision of a physician will greatly reduce the threats to individual health associated with these products.
3) How do the 1,400 incidents break down by product type and age group? Half the reports were associated with ephedrine-containing dietary supplements; half with energy-boosting drugs that contain ephedrine.
About 90 percent of the dietary supplement users were adults, and 60 percent of those using the energy-boosting drugs were kids.
Though other factors may have been involved in some of the deaths, the eight people who died were adults who had used dietary supplements containing ephedrine.
4) What is ephedrine? Ephedrine is an amphetamine-like drug, a stimulant, found naturally in ma huang, a group of Chinese herbs in the ephedra genus of plants.
Ephedrine can be extracted from its natural plant sources and used in concentrated amounts with other substances.
Ephedrine also can be produced synthetically.
All ephedrine in the U.S. is imported.
5) How is ephedrine used? Ephedrine is an ingredient in many dietary supplements and so-called energy-boosting drugs.
However, the only over-the-counter uses of ephedrine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are in products sold for the treatment of hemorrhoids, hay fever, mild asthma and nasal decongestion.
Prescription injectable ephedrine is used in hospitals and emergencies to raise or maintain blood pressure in shock patients.
6) How can ephedrine be dangerous? Ephedrine is a powerful stimulant that affects the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.
Sensitivity to the drug may vary greatly from person to person.
Even small amounts of ephedrine can cause strong adverse reactions in some people.
In Texas ephedrine has been associated with headaches, irregular heartbeats, elevated blood pressure, seizures, hallucinations, psychoses, strokes, heart attacks and deaths.
The long term effects of the regular use of ephedrine, even among people who suffer no immediate side-effects, are unknown.
7) How can ephedrine products be misused and abused? Misuse occurs when a substance is used for a purpose not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Reports of adverse events associated with over-the-counter ephedrine-containing products indicate that these products had been used to get high, stay awake, lose weight, enhance athletic performance or boost energy levels.
None of these uses is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Records of calls to Texas Poison Control Centers document that school-age children consider over-the-counter drug products containing ephedrine as "legal" cheap alternatives to amphetamines (speed) and other illicit stimulants and hallucinogens.
Teens are taking more than the package-recommended dosages of these products to lose weight, enhance athletic performance, boost energy or get high.
Other teenagers have used the products to attempt suicide.
8) What is ma huang? Ma huang is a Chinese term for a group of herbs in the ephedra plant genus that contain naturally occurring ephedrine.
Though some types of ephedra grow in North America, none contains ephedrine.
9) How is ma huang used? In traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the above-ground portion of ma huang plants is used by herbal practitioners, usually for short time periods, to treat respiratory problems and edema (swelling).
A common practice is to use the plants to brew a tea.
In the brewing process, ephedrine is extracted from the plants into the tea.
Ma huang also is an ingredient in many dietary supplements and energy-boosting drug products.
10) Is ma huang dangerous? Though there is no established guaranteed safe ephedrine-use level, health authorities believe the low level of ephedrine in raw ma huang and its bitter taste discourage its misuse and abuse -- especially as prescribed in traditional Chinese herbal medicine under the direction of trained practitioners.
None of the 1,400-plus adverse effects associated with ephedrine involved the use of raw, unprocessed, unenhanced ma huang.
11) If ephedrine is relatively safe as found in the ma huang plant, why isn't it safe as found in these dietary supplements and energy boosters? The dried unprocessed plant typically has an ephedrine level of less than one percent.
Concentrated ephedrine has been added to the ma huang in many dietary supplements and so-called energy-boosting drug products resulting in an ephedrine level four to 12 times higher than found in raw ma huang.
These elevated concentrated levels of ephedrine present a far greater risk to users and increase the potential for misuse and abuse.
It is these products that are affected by the proposed rules.
12) Will people who use ma huang still be able to use it? Yes.
The new rules would not require a prescription for ma huang in its raw state or for products that contain minimally processed (cut, dried and ground) ma huang.
However, if anything is done to concentrate or increase the ephedrine content of such a product, that product would require a prescription.
13) Will people who use dietary supplements and energy boosters affected by these rules still be able to get them? Yes, with a prescription given under the supervision of a physician.
14) Will people who live in Texas still be able to obtain and possess restricted ephedrine products through mail order or by purchasing them in states where there are no restrictions? Not legally.
The restricted products could not be sold, distributed, introduced into commerce, manufactured, produced, packaged, exposed, offered, possessed or held for sale, dispensed or given away in Texas.
Texas law prohibits the possession of a prescription drug without a valid prescription.
15) Will it take long for affected products to be available under the prescription process? Manufacturers who choose not to reformulate their products will need to relabel these products.
The label would indicate that the product is prescription-only.
How long this takes will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
16) Will the affected products only be available in pharmacies, or drug stores? Yes.
By Texas law, prescription drugs can only be sold in licensed pharmacies.
17) Will products affected by these rules cost more as prescription items? Possibly.
Neither the Board of Health nor the Texas Department of Health establishes product prices.
Any cost increase to the individual consumer -- including charges for physician visits (to obtain a prescription) -- could be offset by health insurance coverage of physician visits and prescriptions, subject to individual insurance company decisions.
Any increase in out-of-pocket costs for the consumer could be viewed as a small price to pay to reduce the health risks associated with the self-administration of these products.
18) Isn't the federal government considering nationwide restrictions of ephedrine? If so, why does Texas need to take action on its own? Yes, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are considering regulations restricting products that contain ephedrine.
However, the federal process will not happen quickly.
The Board of Health believes it must proceed with rules to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with ephedrine in Texas.
19) Is Texas the only state to take action against ephedrine? No.
At least 27 other states have placed restrictions on various ephedrine-containing products.
Some 23 of these states require a prescription for certain ephedrine products.
Fifteen of these also have classified certain ephedrine products as controlled substances, a stronger categorization than Texas' proposed dangerous drug classification.
Controlled Substance+Prescription: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Wisconsin Prescription: Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee, Washington Other Restrictions: California, Hawaii, New York, Pennsylvania 20) What are some brand names of products that would be restricted under the new rules? Unless they are reformulated to remove elevated levels of ephedrine, some of the dietary supplements affected include: BioLean, Cloud 9, Formula One, Herbal Ecstacy, Metabolife, Ripped Fuel, Thermajetics and Thermo Chrome 5000.
So-called energy-boosting drug products affected include: 357 Magnum, GoFast, MaxBrand (formerly called MaxAlert) and Mini Two-Way Action (formerly sold as Mini Thins).
Products not affected by the rules include Bronkaid and Primatene tablets and Pazo, an external preparation to reduce hemorrhoid swelling.
21) How are these products distributed or sold? Many of the dietary supplements are sold by mail order and via multi-level marketing plans.
Some are available in health food stores.
The energy-boosting drug products are readily available in truck stops, head shops and convenience stores.
There is no minimum age requirement to purchase these products.
22) Does the Board of Health expect much opposition to the new rules? If so, from whom? Yes.
The manufacture, distribution and sale of ephedrine-containing products affected by the rules is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. Continued opposition to the rules is expected, especially from companies and individuals who derive income from the unrestricted sale of these products.
23) Isn't it unfair to deprive people who sell these products of income? Health issues are often also financial issues.
The Board of Health has been continuously told of the financial losses possible under these rules.
However, the Board's responsibility is the health and safety of Texas residents.
There is nothing in the proposed rules to prohibit manufacturers from providing their distributors and retailers with reformulated products that are exempt from the prescription requirements.
24) Why not just require these products to have a warning label? A warning label would not address concerns with the ready access of these products to anyone regardless of age or health status.
A warning label also would not address the Board of Health's safety concern that ephedrine, as a dangerous drug, be administered only under the supervision of a licensed practitioner.
25) Why not just restrict the sale of ephedrine products to adults? The Board of Health does not have the authority under Texas law to restrict the sale of products to specified consumer age groups.
Were such a restriction possible, it still would not address the safety concern that ephedrine, as a dangerous drug, should be administered only under the supervision of a licensed practitioner.
26) How do doctors feel about ephedrine and its restrictions? The Texas Department of Health and the Texas Medical Association convened two separate medical/scientific panels on ephedrine.
These panels were made up of physicians, toxicologists and other health professionals.
Both panels recommended prescription status for products containing ephedrine.
Support of restrictions of ephedrine also has been received from individual physicians, nurses, emergency room personnel, educators, dieticians and others, including family members of those reporting adverse events.
27) How do I report a bad experience with ephedrine? Adverse reactions associated with ephedrine may be reported by calling the Texas Department of Health toll-free at 1-888-839-6676.
28) How do I offer comments on the rules? Written comments may be mailed to: Texas Department of Health, Drugs and Medical Devices Division, 1100 W. 49th St., Austin, TX 78756.
Mailed comments should be postmarked on or before June 29, 1998.
29) What gives the Board of Health the authority to pass such a rule? Texas law.
The Texas Health and Safety Code (Â§483.003) gives the board the authority to limit the availability of an abused drug by permitting its dispensing only with a prescription from a licensed practitioner.
Another section (Â§431.021) prohibits the introduction or delivery into commerce of any food or drug that is adulterated and prohibits the dissemination of any false advertisement.
And Â§431.241 and Â§12.001 give the board the authority to adopt rules for the performance of every duty imposed by law on the board, the Texas Department of Health and the Commissioner of Health.
30) What is the process for the rules to become final? (See update at top.)
The proposed rules were published in the May 29, 1998 issue of the Texas Register.
A 30-day public comment period will follow.
A public hearing to receive verbal comments from the public was held June 3, 1998.
The board is expected to reconsider the rules in September.
The rules would become effective 20 days following Texas Register publication of the final rules.
