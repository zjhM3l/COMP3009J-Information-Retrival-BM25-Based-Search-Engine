The risk of these events is increased by the use of indwelling epidural catheters for administration of analgesia or by the concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants.
The risk also appears to be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture.
Patients should be frequently monitored for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment.
If neurologic compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.
The physician should consider the potential benefit versus risk before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis (see also WARNINGS, Hemorrhage, and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ).
DESCRIPTION Lovenox Injection is a sterile solution containing enoxaparin sodium, a low molecular weight heparin.
Lovenox Injection is available in two concentrations: 1 100mg per mL of Water for Injection -Prefilled Syringes 30 mg / 0.3 mL, 40mg / 0.4 mL -Graduated Prefilled Syringes 60 mg / 0.6 mL, 80 mg/ 0.8 mL, 100 mg / 1 mL -Ampules 30 mg / 0.3 mL Lovenox injection 100 mg/mL Concentration contains 10 mg enoxaparin sodium (or approximate anti-Factor Xa activity of 1000 IU [with reference to the W.H.O.
First International Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reference Standard]) per 0.1 mL Water for Injection.
2 150 mg per mL of Water for Injection -Graduated Prefilled Syringes 90 mg /0.6 mL, 120 mg / 0.8 mL, 150 mg / 1 mL Lovenox Injection 150 mg/mL Concentration contains 15 mg enoxaparin sodium (or appropriate anti-Factor Xa activity of 1500 IU [with reference to the W.H.O.
First International Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reference Standard]) per 0.1 mL Water for Injection.
The solutions are preservative-free and intended for use only as a single-dose injection.
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and HOW SUPPLIED for dosage unit descriptions.)
The pH of the injection is 5.5 to 7.5.
Nitrogen is used in the headspace to inhibit oxidation.
Enoxaparin is obtained by alkaline degradation of heparin benzyl ester derived from porcine intestinal mucosa.
Its structure is characterized by a 2-O-sulfo-4-enepyranosuronic acid group at the non-reducing end and a 2-N,6-O-disulfo-Dglucosamine at the reducing end of the chain.
The substance is the sodium salt.
The average molecular weight is about 4500 daltons.
The molecular weight distribution is: NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 2 20% 68% 18% 
In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (meanÃ¯Â¿Â½SD, 14.0Ã¯Â¿Â½3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (meanÃ¯Â¿Â½SD, 1.22Ã¯Â¿Â½0.13).
Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg / mL concentration), administered SC every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n = 1607).
Pharmacodynamics (conducted using 100 mg / mL concentration): Maximum anti-Factor Xa and anti-thrombin (antiFactor IIa) activities occur 3 to 5 hours after SC injection of enoxaparin.
Mean peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 0.16 IU/mL (1.58 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/mL) and 0.38 IU/mL (3.83 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/mL) after the 20 mg and the 40 mg clinically tested SC doses, respectively.
Mean (n = 46) peak anti-Factor Xa activity was 1.1 IU/mL at steady state in patients with unstable angina receiving 1mg/kg SC every 12 hours for 14 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin, given SC, based on anti-Factor Xa activity is 92% in healthy volunteers.
The volume of distribution of anti-Factor Xa activity is about 6 L. Following intravenous (i.v.) dosing, the total body clearance of enoxaparin is 26 mL/min.
After i.v. dosing of enoxaparin labeled with the gammaemitter, 99mTc, 40% of radioactivity and 8 to 20% of anti-Factor Xa activity were recovered in urine in 24 hours.
Elimination half-life based on anti-Factor Xa activity was 4.5 hours after SC administration.
Following a 40 mg SC once a day dose, significant anti-Factor Xa activity persists in plasma for about 12 hours.
Following SC dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min.
Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single SC dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females.
The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified, however, body weight may be a contributing factor.
Apparent clearance and A max derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple SC dosing in elderly subjects were close to those observed in young subjects.
Following once a day SC dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value.
In subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 mL/min), anti-Factor Xa CL/F values were similar to those in healthy subjects.
However, mean CL/F values of subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
(See PRECAUTIONS.)
Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose.
When a daily 1.5 mg/kg SC injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/ml or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained (see table below): NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters* After 5 Days of 1.5 mg/kg SC Once Daily Doses of Enoxaparin Sodium Using 100 mg/mL or 200 mg/mL Concentrations Concentration Amax (IU/mL or sec) Anti-Xa 1.37 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.23) 1.45 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.22) 102-110% 3 (2-6) 3.5 (2-6) 14.26 (Ã¯Â¿Â½2.93) 15.43 (Ã¯Â¿Â½2.96) 105-112% Anti-IIa 0.23 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.05) 0.26 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.05) 4 (2-5) 4.5 (2.5-6) 1.54 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.61) 1.77 (Ã¯Â¿Â½0.67) Heptest 104.5 (Ã¯Â¿Â½16.6) 110.9 (Ã¯Â¿Â½17.1) 102-111% 2.5 (2-4.5) 3.3 (2-5) 1321 (Ã¯Â¿Â½219) 1401 (Ã¯Â¿Â½227) 103-109% aPTT 19.3 (Ã¯Â¿Â½4.7) 22 (Ã¯Â¿Â½6.7) 3 (2-4.5) 3 (2-5) 100 mg/mL 200 mg/mL 90% CI tmax** (h) 100 mg/mL 200 mg/mL 100 mg/mL 200 mg/mL 90% CI AUC (ss) (h*IU/mL or h* sec) *Means Ã¯Â¿Â½ SD at Day 5 and 90% Confidence Interval (CI) of the ratio **Median (range) CLINICAL TRIALS Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Abdominal Surgery in Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications: Abdominal surgery patients at risk include those who are over 40 years of age, obese, undergoing surgery under general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes or who have additional risk factors such as malignancy or a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Prophylaxis of Ischemic Complications in Unstable Angina and Non-Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction: In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study, patients who recently experienced unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were randomized to either Lovenox Injection 1 mg/kg every 12 hours SC or heparin i.v. bolus (5000 U) followed by a continuous infusion (adjusted to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds).
A total of 3171 patients were enrolled in the study, and 3107 patients were treated.
Patients ranged in age from 25-94 years (median age 64 years), with 33.4% of patients female and 66.6% male.
Race was distributed as follows: 89.8% Caucasian, 4.8% Black, 2.0% Oriental, and 3.5% other.
All patients were also treated with aspirin 100 to 325 mg per day.
Treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the event and continued until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures, or hospital discharge, with a maximal duration of 8 days of therapy.
The combined incidence of the triple endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina was lower for Lovenox Injection compared with heparin therapy at 14 days after initiation of treatment.
The lower incidence of the triple endpoint was sustained up to 30 days after initiation of treatment.
These results were observed in an analysis of both all-randomized and all-treated patients.

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Pulmonary Embolism (PE): In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox Injection 1.5 mg/kg once a day SC, (ii) Lovenox Injection 1mg/kg every 12 hours SC, or (iii) heparin i.v. bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds).
A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated.
Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7 % men and 45.3 % women.
All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox Injection or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days.
Lovenox Injection or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.
Both Lovenox Injection regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

2 VTE = venous thromboembolic event (DVT and/or PE).
3 The 95% Confidence Intervals for the treatment differences for total VTE were: Lovenox Injection once a day versus heparin (-3.0 to 3.5) Lovenox Injection every 12 hours versus heparin (-4.2 to 1.7).
Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to Lovenox Injection or heparin.
Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study.
Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated co-morbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility.
Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY Lovenox Injection patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%).
A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated.
Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5 % men and 39.5 % women.
Patients were randomized to either Lovenox Injection 1 mg/kg every 12 hours SC or heparin i.v. bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment).
All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study.
Lovenox Injection or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days.
Lovenox Injection was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lovenox Injection is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism: Ã¯Â¿Â½ in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications; Ã¯Â¿Â½ in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, during and following hospitalization; Ã¯Â¿Â½ in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery; Ã¯Â¿Â½ in medical patients who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lovenox Injection is indicated for the prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, when concurrently administered with aspirin.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lovenox Injection is indicated for: Ã¯Â¿Â½ t h e inpatient treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium; Ã¯Â¿Â½ t h e outpatient treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium.
See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Adult Dosage for appropriate dosage regimens.
CONTRAINDICATIONS Lovenox Injection is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding, in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with a positive in vitro test for anti-platelet antibody in the presence of enoxaparin sodium, or in patients with hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium.
Patients with known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products should not be treated with Lovenox Injection.
WARNINGS Lovenox Injection is not intended for intramuscular administration.
Lovenox Injection cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage.
Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.
Lovenox Injection should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 1 3 Hemorrhage: Lovenox Injection, like other anticoagulants, should be used with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.
Cases of epidural or spinal hematomas have been reported with the associated use of enoxaparin and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis.
The risk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters or by the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs (see boxed WARNING; ADVERSE REACTIONS, Ongoing Safety Surveillance; and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported.
Some of these cases have been fatal.
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with enoxaparin.
An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.
Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox Injection.
Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3 ) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox Injection, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.
7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.
Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox Injection, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.
Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.
If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 , enoxaparin should be discontinued.
Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis have also been observed in clinical practice.
Some of these cases were complicated by organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death.
PRECAUTIONS General: Lovenox Injection should not be mixed with other injections or infusions.
Lovenox Injection should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, and hemorrhage.
Elderly patients and patients with renal insufficiency may show delayed elimination of enoxaparin.
Enoxaparin should be used with care in these patients.
Adjustment of enoxaparin sodium dose may be considered for low weight (
If thromboembolic events occur despite enoxaparin prophylaxis, appropriate therapy should be initiated.
Laboratory Tests: Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet count, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with Lovenox Injection.
When administered at recommended prophylaxis doses, routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of Lovenox Injection activity and, therefore, unsuitable for monitoring.
Anti-Factor Xa may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox Injection in patients with significant renal impairment.
If during Lovenox Injection therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox Injection (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics ).
Drug Interactions: Unless really needed, agents which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of Lovenox Injection therapy.
These agents include medications such as: anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid, salicylates, NSAIDs (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone.
If co-administration is essential, conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ).
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of enoxaparin.
Enoxaparin was not mutagenic in in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation test, and human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test.
Enoxaparin was found to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and 2 female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day or 141 mg/m /day.
The maximum human dose in clinical trials was 2.0 2 mg/kg/day or 78 mg/m /day (for an average body weight of 70 kg, height of 170 cm, and body surface area of 1.8 m2 ).
Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B: Teratology studies have been conducted in pregnant rats and 2 2 rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin up to 30 mg/kg/day or 211 mg/m /day and 410 mg/m /day, respectively.
There was no evidence of teratogenic effects or fetotoxicity due to enoxaparin.
There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
Non-teratogenic Effects: There have been a few spontaneous post-marketing reports of fetal death when pregnant women received enoxaparin.
Causality of the cases has not been determined.
In one case, placental hemorrhage and detachment NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 1 4 were found in association with the fetal death.
If enoxaparin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when enoxaparin is administered to nursing women.
Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of enoxaparin in pediatric patients have not been established.
Geriatric Use: Over 2800 patients, 65 years and older, have received enoxaparin sodium in pivotal clinical trials.
The efficacy of Lovenox Injection in the elderly ( 65 years) was similar to that seen in younger patients (
The incidence of bleeding complications was similar between elderly and younger patients when 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once a day doses of Lovenox Injection were employed.
The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in elderly patients as compared to younger patients when Lovenox Injection was administered at doses of 1.5 mg/kg once a day or 1 mg/kg every 12 hours.
The risk of Lovenox Injection-associated bleeding increased with age.
Serious adverse events increased with age for patients receiving Lovenox Injection.
Other clinical experience (including postmarketing surveillance and literature reports) has not revealed additional differences in the safety of Lovenox Injection between elderly and younger patients.
Careful attention to dosing intervals and concomitant medications (especially antiplatelet medications) is advised.
Monitoring of geriatric patients with low body weight (
(see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and General and Laboratory Tests subsections of PRECAUTIONS ) ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemorrhage: The incidence of major hemorrhagic complications during Lovenox Injection treatment has been low.
The following rates of major bleeding events have been reported during clinical trials with Lovenox Injection.

All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose-adjusted according to PT to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0) commencing within 72 hours of Lovenox Injection or standard heparin therapy and continuing for up to 90 days.
Thrombocytopenia: see WARNINGS: Thrombocytopenia.
Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases: Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and alanine (ALT [SGPT]
Similar significant increases in aminotransferase levels have also been observed in patients and healthy volunteers treated with heparin and other low molecular weight heparins.
Such elevations are fully reversible and are rarely associated with increases in bilirubin.
Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations that might be caused by drugs like Lovenox Injection should be interpreted with caution.
Local Reactions: Mild local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, and erythema may follow SC injection of Lovenox Injection.
Other: Other adverse effects that were thought to be possibly or probably related to treatment with Lovenox Injection, heparin, or placebo in clinical trials with patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, abdominal or colorectal surgery, or treatment for DVT and that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in the Lovenox Injection group, are provided below.

Ongoing Safety Surveillance: Since 1993, there have been more than 68 reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of enoxaparin and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture.
The majority of patients had a post-operative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs.
Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.
Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.
Other Ongoing Safety Surveillance Reports : local reactions at the injection site (i.e., skin necrosis, nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (i.e., pruritus, urticaria , anaphylactoid reactions), vesiculobullous rash, purpura, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (see WARNINGS, Thrombocytopenia).
Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.
OVERDOSAGE Symptoms/Treatment: Accidental overdosage following administration of Lovenox Injection may lead to hemorrhagic complications.
Injected Lovenox Injection may be largely neutralized by the slow i.v. injection of protamine sulfate (1% solution).
The dose of protamine sulfate should be equal to the dose of Lovenox Injection injected: 1 mg protamine sulfate should be administered to neutralize 1 mg Lovenox Injection.
A second infusion of 0.5 mg protamine sulfate per 1 mg of Lovenox Injection may be administered if the aPTT measured 2 to 4 hours after the first infusion remains prolonged.
However, even with higher doses of protamine, the aPTT may remain more prolonged than under normal conditions found following administration of heparin.
In all cases, the anti-Factor Xa activity is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%).
Particular care should be taken to avoid overdosage with protamine sulfate.
Administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions.
Because fatal reactions, often resembling anaphylaxis, have been reported with protamine sulfate, it should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactic shock are readily available.
For additional information consult the labeling of Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP, products.
A single SC dose of 46.4 mg/kg enoxaparin was lethal to rats.
The symptoms of acute toxicity were ataxia, decreased motility, dyspnea, cyanosis, and coma.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION All patients should be evaluated for a bleeding disorder before administration of Lovenox Injection, unless the medication is needed urgently.
Since coagulation parameters are unsuitable for monitoring Lovenox Injection activity, routine monitoring of coagulation parameters is not required (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ).
Note: Lovenox Injection is available in two concentrations: 1 100 mg/mL Concentration: 30 mg/0.3 mL ampules, 30 mg/0.3 mL and 40 mg/0.4 mL prefilled single-dose syringes, 60 mg/0.6 mL, 80 mg/0.8 mL, and 100 mg/1 mL prefilled, graduated, single-dose syringes.
NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 2 1 2 150 mg/mL Concentration: 90 mg/0.6 mL, 120mg/0.8 mL, and 150 mg/1 mL prefilled, graduated, single-dose syringes.
Adult Dosage: Abdominal Surgery: In patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications, the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection is 40 mg once a day administered by SC injection with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery.
The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days; up to 12 days administration has been well tolerated in clinical trials.
Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery: In patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by SC injection.
Provided that hemostasis has been established, the initial dose should be given 12 to 24 hours after surgery.
For hip replacement surgery, a dose of 40 mg once a day SC, given initially 12 (Ã¯Â¿Â½3) hours prior to surgery, may be considered.
Following the initial phase of thromboprophylaxis in hip replacement surgery patients, continued prophylaxis with Lovenox Injection 40 mg once a day administered by SC injection for 3 weeks is recommended.
The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days; up to 14 days administration has been well tolerated in clinical trials.
Medical Patients During Acute Illness: In medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness, the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection in 40 mg once a day administered by SC injection.
The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days; up to 14 days of Lovenox injection has been well tolerated in the controlled clinical trial.
Unstable Angina and Non-Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction: In patients with unstable angina or non-Qwave myocardial infarction, the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection is 1 mg/kg administered SC every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily).
Treatment with Lovenox Injection should be prescribed for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical stabilization.
To minimize the risk of bleeding following vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox Injection doses.
The vascular access sheath for instrumentation should remain in place for 6 to 8 hours following a dose of Lovenox Injection.
The next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal.
The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation.
The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days; up to 12.5 days of Lovenox injections have been well tolerated in clinical trials.
Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Pulmonary Embolism: In outpatient treatment, patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism who can be treated at home, the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered SC.
In inpatient (hospital) treatment, patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment), the recommended dose of Lovenox Injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered SC or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered SC at the same time every day.
In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, warfarin sodium therapy should be initiated when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox Injection).
Lovenox Injection should be continued for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2.0 to 3.0).
The average duration of administration is 7 days; up to 17 days Lovenox Injection administration has been well tolerated in controlled clinical trials.
Administration: Enoxaparin injection is a clear, colorless to pale yellow sterile solution, and as with other parenteral drug products, should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
When using Lovenox Injection ampules, to assure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug, the use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended.
Lovenox Injection is administered by SC injection.
It must not be administered by intramuscular injection.
Lovenox Injection is intended for use under the guidance of a physician.
Patients may self-inject only if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up, as necessary.
Proper training in subcutaneous injection technique (with or without the assistance of an injection device) should be provided.
Subcutaneous Injection Technique: Patients should be lying down and Lovenox Injection administered by deep SC injection.
To avoid the loss of drug when using the 30 and 40 mg prefilled syringes, do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection.
Administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall.
The whole length of the needle should be introduced into a skin fold held between the thumb and forefinger; the skin fold should be held throughout the injection.
To minimize bruising, do not rub the injection site after NDA 20-164/S-036 Page 2 2 completion of the injection.
An automatic injector, Lovenox EasyInjectorTM, is available for patients to administer Lovenox Injection packaged in 30 mg and 40 mg prefilled syringes.
