The Friends of South Mountain State Battlefield mission is to "protect, preserve and interpret the historical, cultural and natural heritage residing within South Mountain State Battlefield."
The private, non-profit Friends group works to create public-private partnerships to bring additional resources to protect and interpret the heroic Civil War battle action that took place at Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps on September 14, 1862 and other historical sites.
The Friends are supporting the creation, development and staffing of two Civil War museums at the north and south ends of the Battlefield, are supporting reenactments of the Battles of South Mountain, lighting of the War Correspondent's Arch, and many community education projects.
Your membership, active participation, donations and suggestions are welcomed.
