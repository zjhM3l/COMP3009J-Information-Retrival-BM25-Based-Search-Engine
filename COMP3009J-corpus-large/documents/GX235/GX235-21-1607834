It went so well it was extended to Dec. 21, 22 and 23.
It was started as a means to expand the 'Dillo's cultural outreach and to ensure December cash flow and it guaranteed a warm, dry space and alternative selling experience for artists who regularly sold at the Austin Renaissance Market, known as "the Drag", on 23rd Street across from the University of Texas.
Today, the Armadillo Christmas Bazaar is one of the top-ranked arts and craft shows in the nation.
In 1997, it was ranked #22 by the Art Fair Source Book, a highly respected reference source for artists in which artists themselves provide the feedback which is used to evaluate all the major shows in the US.
The Bazaar now has a long waiting list of artists who wish to be given the opportunity to show their work in this premier holiday arts and music festival.
In its 25th year, the 'Dillo demonstrates that a tradition which is infused with the love and intense efforts of literally hundreds of participants over the years can remain fresh, vibrant and contemporary.
This Christmas season, shoppers all over the nation will go to the ubiquitous shopping mall and essentially have the same experience everywhere, but there is only one Armadillo Christmas Bazaar, and it is one of Austin's truly unique cultural treasures.
