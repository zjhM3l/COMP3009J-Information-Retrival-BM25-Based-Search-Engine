PGC Banner Home What's New Newsroom Hunting - Trapping Wildlife Education County Reports Merchandise SO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EASTERN COYOTE EASTERN COYOTE In Pennsylvania, eastern coyotes have become more common than black bears, bobcats and otters over the past 30 years.
How these animals live, where they came from, and what we should do about them are topics that are popping up more and more in conversations among Pennsylvanians every day.
Once an animal automatically associated with the West, coyotes now live in every state east of the Mississippi River.
Pennsylvania's mid 1990s population numbered 20,000 to 30,000, and still appeared to be slowly growing.
They can be found almost anywhere: from the suburban sprawl surrounding Philadelphia to the remote ridges of the Alleghenies.
There are few areas remaining in the state where coyotes aren't found.
But don't expect to see or hear one.
This secretive canine prefers to operate under the cover of darkness and doesn't often howl, unlike its western counterpart.
It's very common for hunters, hikers and other people who spend countless hours afield in the state's best coyote country to have never seen one.
What most outdoors people do see, though, are coyote scat and tracks.
Few Pennsylvania mammals have an ancestral background as untraceable or a lifestyle as obscure as the eastern coyote's.
Part of this stems from the coyote population's relatively recent rise and expansion.
But part of it is also attributable to this sparsely populated animal's secretive way of life.
The Game Commission has spent considerable time and effort in recent years trying to shed further light on eastern coyotes.
This has included research into the canine's behavior, food preferences and origin.
What follows is a summary of some of the more interesting information we've uncovered and answers to frequently-asked coyote questions.
How can I identify an eastern coyote?
The eastern coyote is larger than its western cousin - typically attributed to wolf-coyote hybridization - and usually has one of four pelt colorations: tri-color (German shepherd-like), red, blond and dark brown (appears black at a distance).
Adult males weigh 45 to 55 pounds; females, 35 to 40 pounds.
When seeing one for the first time, many people mistake eastern coyotes for dogs.
Look for black lines running up and down the front of the front legs, yellow eyes and a cylindrical-shaped, low-hanging tail.
Adult coyotes are much larger than foxes, and they tend to travel trails, dirt roads and habitat edges.
What is a "coydog?"
The word coydog is used to describe a coyote-domestic dog hybrid.
Coydogs were once believed to be found in good numbers in Pennsylvania, especially when our once-expanding coyote population was thought to be having difficulty finding same-species mates.
Truth is, most of these so-called coydogs were probably coyotes or feral dogs, since the breeding cycles of dogs and coyotes are not synchronized.
Studies have confirmed coyote-dog interbreeding rarely happens.
If it was occurring regularly, it stands to reason that we'd be seeing coyotes with domestic dog-like characteristics such as spots, curly tails and floppy ears.
In addition, it's likely that red and blond coyotes were mistakenly identified as coydogs in the past simply because their coats were not of the more common tri-color pelage.
Do coyotes howl and run in packs?
Coyotes howl infrequently, but when they do, especially on a cold quiet day, or right before dark, it carries for a long way in wild areas.
Howls are thought to be used by coyotes to announce their location.
Coyotes are known to howl in response to loud noises like fire alarm whistles.
They also seem willing to respond to most coyote howling calls, so long as they hear them.
Eastern coyotes don't pack like wolves, but do run in family units and pairs.
Although families usually break up in autumn, they occasionally stay together until breeding activity starts in mid winter.
Are eastern coyotes a threat to people?
Coyotes usually steer clear of people.
They'll leave an area at the first sign of human intrusion.
But under the cover of darkness, as human activities slow almost to a halt, coyotes sneak into areas they normally avoid during daylight hours.
They canvass agricultural fields, visit picnic sites and backyards in rural areas, and work the waysides of interstate highways in their quest for food.
Most people bump into coyotes while hunting, hiking or driving at night.
Coyotes rarely display aggressive behavior toward people.
They have not exhibited a tendency to make a stand when surprised or chased, or to protect threatened pups or a carcass they're feeding on.
If people appear, they usually run.
That's good.
Still, coyotes deserve our respect.
Barring the black bear, it's the state's largest predatory animal.
That should be enough reason for anyone to give this animal due respect.
There have been a few incidents in the northeastern United States where coyotes have attacked people.
Why is unclear, but those who study these animals believe the coyotes mistook the persons attacked as wildlife prey.
Do coyotes kill deer regularly?
Coyotes sometimes do kill deer, both adults and fawns, but deer are most often eaten as carrion.
Far more deer are killed by automobiles than coyotes.
Deer hunting harvests have continued to rise in recent years and out-of-season deer losses have not changed appreciably in the past 15 years, nor has the percentage of fawns in the antlerless harvest.
These indicators point toward coyotes having minimal impact on deer.
Whenever deer are forced to yard in northern tier counties as a result of deep, crusted snow, coyotes gain an advantage because deer become confined.
Fawns are also vulnerable to coyotes, but it's unclear to what degree coyotes prey upon them.
But let's not forget that finding a fawn in the woods is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
Fawns have excellent camouflage, lay motionless and often are reared in areas where other deer don't go.
Since out-of-season deer losses are not increasing significantly in Pennsylvania, there's little justification for exploring fawn/coyote relationships at this time.
If, however, change does occur, rest assured the Game Commission will respond quickly.
For now, though, it appears coyotes get more venison from the shoulders of our highway network than anywhere else.
How can I tell if a coyote killed a deer?
Coyotes usually kill deer by grabbing and holding onto their throats.
Then they consume the internal organs, particularly the liver, which is very nutritious.
Dogs, on the other hand, take down deer by grabbing the hind quarters, which is also where they typically start eating.
Will coyotes prey upon domesticated animals?
Coyotes are opportunists.
They do no more than necessary to obtain food and they'll eat almost anything.
Coyotes do spend considerable time mousing, but they'll settle in a second for a rotting road-killed deer, or a cat that strays too far from the house.
Coyotes raising young can be a problem for farmers during spring and summer.
Sheep, chickens and ducks are especially vulnerable.
Most times coyotes kill what they need and leave with it.
But on occasion they seem to go on killing sprees.
Once an animal that could be found only in Pennsylvania's most remote settings, coyotes, with each passing year, have been discovered closer and closer to civilization.
As they adapt to living in the suburbs, their way of life may change.
Given this situation, the profile on Pennsylvania's coyotes may be incomplete.
But let's face it, as cunning and large as this canid is, it's quite capable of almost anything as it relates to disturbing and killing pets and farm animals.
So play it safe, give coyotes the consideration they deserve.
Would placing a bounty on coyotes help reduce their numbers?
Bounties were placed on coyotes in western states for decades and they didn't lead to any significant population reduction.
The main reason was that about 70 percent of a coyote population has to be removed annually in order to cause a population decline.
Even then, coyotes have demonstrated an ability to offset population declines by increasing their litter size.
They appear to have a built-in biological mechanism that responds to population deficits.
The coyote has shown it's at home almost anywhere.
That means a continuous statewide effort would be needed to make a serious run at reducing coyote numbers.
It's apparent that won't happen, even with bounty incentives.
Some of the reasons why include: 1.)
few people are interested in hunting or trapping coyotes; 2.)
success is very limited; 3.)
coyote populations are sparse; and 4.)
operating expenses would outweigh a trapper's or caller's profits.
The most important reason not to offer a coyote bounty, however, is that it's a waste of money.
No measurable good ever resulted from the Game Commission's other predator bounties, and this one would be no different.
Is it easy to hunt or trap coyotes?
Coyotes are very elusive when it comes to hunting and trapping them.
You shouldn't expect to head afield and harvest them without considerable effort.
Although a substantial number of coyotes are taken annually by trappers and by hunters who call them, the largest part of the harvest is taken by sportsmen who shoot them while hunting other species, or fox trappers.
The Game Commission has maintained liberal hunting opportunities for coyotes with an eye toward interesting more Pennsylvanians in pursuing them.
And, more are.
But it's tough to take one.
Just ask anyone who hunts coyotes.
The same applies to trapping.
Did the Game Commission release coyotes in Pennsylvania?
The eastern coyote's origin has been a topic of debate for some time.
Some folks actually believe the agency has stocked coyotes in recent years to reduce deer numbers.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Coyotes have been documented in Pennsylvania since late 1930s and '40s.
How they got here, or whether they were here all along, is the missing link to the coyote story.
Some biologists believe coyotes have always been a part of Pennsylvania's wildlife community.
Others believe western coyotes migrated north into Canada, bred with gray wolves and the resulting hybrid moved south into New England and New York and, eventually, Pennsylvania.
Another possibility is that coyotes held in captivity escaped or were set free.
Game Commission stocking stories began in the late '80s after a coyote pup ear-tagged by a wildlife conservation officer was shot by a deer hunter.
The pup, which was fitted with a telemetry collar and bobcat ear tag (#0026), was trapped on a Greene County farm where coyotes were killing sheep.
It was hoped the pup would lead the officer to its den.
Within days, however, the young coyote couldn't be located with radio gear; it apparently had shaken its telemetry collar.
The coyote, minus its collar, was shot a few months later.
Stories began to spread that it bore a ear tag from a western state, and that at least 25 other coyotes had been released, given the tag's number.
The rumors continue.
The Game Commission has never released out-of-state coyotes, or trapped and transferred coyotes, and won't in the future.
We have, however, trapped, tagged and released Pennsylvania coyotes for research purposes in recent years.
We've also liberalized hunting seasons.
Coyotes can be hunted year-round with few exceptions and there are no bag limits.
Our coyote population can handle this pressure because it's underutilized and very resilient.
