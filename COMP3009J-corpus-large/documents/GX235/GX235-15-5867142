Timeshare Tips
Unfinished Facilities - Purchasing an undeveloped property is extremely risky, but if you decide to do so, commit money to an escrow account.
If you own a vacation timeshare, be cautious about people offering to re-sell it for a fee.
Investment Potential - Never consider the purchase of a timeshare as an investment.
Timeshare resales are usually difficult.
Once all the timeshares are sold, ask if the developer will be setting up a resales office on site.
*
Total Costs - The total cost of your timeshare includes mortgage payments, travel costs, annual maintenance fees and taxes, closing costs, broker commissions and finance charges.
Maintenance fees can vary from year to year, so it is important to ask if there is a fee cap in your plan.
Keep in mind, maintenance fees will have to be paid regardless of whether or not you use the unit.
To help evaluate the purchase, compare your total timeshare costs with rental costs for similar accommodations and amenities for the same time and in the same location.
Document Review - Don't act on impulse or under pressure.
Take the documents home to review.
Ask a professional to examine them.
If the seller insists on pressuring you or refuses to let you take the documents with you, then perhaps this is not the deal for you.
Legitimate businesses don't expect you to make snap decisions.
Find out if the contract provides a "cooling-off period" during which you can cancel and get a refund.
* Oral Promises - As in any business transaction, make certain all promises made by the salesperson are written into the contract.
Exchange Programs - These programs allow you to arrange trades with other resort units in different locations for an additional fee.
However, these trades usually cannot be guaranteed.
Be sure you understand all aspects of any exchange program.
Reputation Research - Research the track record of the seller, developer, and management company before you buy.
The resort will only be a good place to vacation if it is run properly.
Visit the facilities and talk to current owners about their experiences.
Local realtors, Better Business Bureaus and consumer protection offices are also good sources of information.
*
Unfinished Facilities - Purchasing an undeveloped property is extremely risky, but if you decide to do so, commit money to an escrow account.
This is one way to protect your financial investment if the developer defaults.
Also, get a written commitment from the seller that the facilities will be finished as promised.
*
Default Protection - Learn your rights if the builder or management comapny has financial problems or defaults.
Look for the following clauses in your contract: a non-disturbance provision should ensure that you'll continue to have use of your unit in the event of default and subsequent third-party claims agains the developer or management firm; a non-performance protections clause should allow you to keep your ownership rights even if a third party is required to buy out your contract.
Contact an attorney for more information about these provisions.
*
Foreign Properties - Be especially wary of offers to purchase timeshares or vacation club memberships in foreign countries.
If your sign a contract outside the United States for a timeshare located in another country, you generally will not be protected by U.S. federal or state contract property laws.
Timeshare Resales
If you own a vacation timeshare, be cautious about people offering to re-sell it for a fee.
Most of these sales programs are bogus.
The market for resales is poor.
One recent survey found that only 3.3 percent of owners reported reselling their timeshares during the last 20 years.
The Scam
Unscrupulous companies may contact you by phone or mail.
Salespeople are likely to tell you that the market for resales is "HOT".
For an advance "listing" fee, often $300 to $500, they will promise to sell your timeshare for a price equal to or greater than your purchase price.
They may offer a money-back guarantee or a $1,000 government bond if they fail to sell it within a year.
Others may offer to purchase the timeshare for 80-90 percent of its appraised value if they fail to sell it.
In reality, it is very difficult to resell a timeshare.
If a company promises to do so, it is likely to just take your money and give you nothing in return.
If You Want to Sell If you are approached by a company offering to help re-sell your timeshare, consider taking these precautions: * Don't agree to anything over the phone until you've had a chance to check out a company.
Ask the salesperson to send you written materials.
* Find out where the company is located and where it does business.
Contact the Better Business Bureau, Attorney General or consumer protection offices in that area to see if there are any complaints against the company.
* Ask if the company's salespeople are licensed to sell real estate where your timeshare is located.
Verify this with the state licensing board.
* Be wary of companies charging an advance fee for services.
Look for a company that offers to sell for a fee only after the timeshare is sold.
