Maricopa County Stewardship Statement Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Executive Summary Animal Care and Control Services (ACCS) is in the midst of a significant transition.
This transition is not merely organizational; it is cultural.
ACCS' new mission, vision, values, name change, new management team and recent reorganization reflect an on-going societal shift from the historically accepted "catch and kill" methodologies of the past to the humane "no-kill" and non-lethal strategies embraced by most citizens today.
Today, ACCS is about families and community.
Pets are part of the family.
ACCS is no longer focused on providing a convenient method for disposing of unwanted cats and dogs.
Local government must take a more sensitive approach towards our communities' lost pets.
Euthanasia is no longer an acceptable method of pet population control.
Adoption programs are now understood to be only "stop gap" measures.
The real answers to the overwhelming numbers of lost and homeless animals impounded by ACCS each year are innovative intervention programs designed to solve the problem at its source.
This five year plan proposes such programs.
Strategic Issues ACCS has undergone an extensive process of strategic planning that will set the future tone and direction of animal care and control services in Maricopa County.
Throughout this planning process the County's methodology of "Managing for Results" was utilized to ensure organizational goals are measurable and ACCS programs are accountable in achieving results.
Key strategic issues ACCS will be focusing on over the next five years include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pet population growth and the corresponding public demand for no-kill Inability to hire and retain competent staff Increasing demands for excellent and compassionate customer service Obtaining alternative funding for innovative solutions Inadequate organizational infrastructure Five Year Financial Plan The demand for animal care and control services in Maricopa County is on the increase.
Currently in Maricopa County, there is an estimated 1.2 million dogs and cats.
The County's pet population, like in every community, is directly related to the County's human population.
Over the next five years, the human population of Maricopa County is projected to increase 80,000 people per year.
The County's pet population is expected to follow a similar pattern, rising at a rate of 35,000 animals a year.
As a result of this growth and a corresponding citizen demand for greater service, the current workload for Animal Care and Control Services (ACCS) will steadily increase.
In order to meet this demand, ACCS revenues will have to significantly expand to offset rising animal care and control costs.
Revenue Funding for ACCS services comes from five funding sources: license and permit fees; intergovernmental agreements with cities and towns; County general funds; donations Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 and grants.
Projected ACCS revenue is expected to steadily increase over the next five years.
Modest fee increases in license and adoption fees this year, coupled with expected dog and cat population growth, are projected to increase fee revenue from $4,948,530 in FY 00 to $5,179,076 in FY 01, a 4.7 percent increase.
Fee revenues are expected to grow between 2.5 to 3.0 percent thereafter, provided fees remain at their current rates.
Historically, Maricopa County has primarily funded field service operations through revenues generated from license and shelter fees.
Through intergovernmental agreements with the cities and towns, participating municipalities paid the difference between revenues collected from these fees and expenses incurred.
Unfortunately, this method of doing business had the unintended effect of using shelter revenues for city and town field services rather than shelter replacement and humane shelter services as required by statute.
Intergovernmental agreements in the future between the County and municipalities will be full cost recovery field service contracts.
Each municipality will have the option of providing its own field service operation, contracting with ACCS, or contracting with some other agency, at the full cost of providing these services.
Revenue in the future from intergovernmental agreements and the County general fund is dependent upon the level of field service the cities, towns and County desire.
If a city or town chooses not to contract with ACCS for field services, field service costs to support that entity will be eliminated from the ACCS budget.
Cost In order for ACCS to fulfill its mission, achieve its vision, and keep its key values, additional financial resources must be allocated to this department.
Existing staff resources within ACCS cannot keep pace with the current demand for animal care and control services.
Additional staff is required for basic animal care in the shelters, a shelter medicine program, the shelter business office, licensing, administration, public programs and field services.
Market pressures, low wages and poor working conditions are also making it difficult for ACCS to hire and retain qualified staff.
Sufficient funding must be secured to allow ACCS the opportunity to recruit and retain quality staff.
Within this five year plan, proposed staffing and market salary adjustments are expected to increase ACCS' shelter services budget from $4,388,709 in FY 01 to $5,459,697 in FY 02, a 24.4 percent increase.
Shelter service budget increases in the years that follow, however, are projected to only increase in the 2 to 3 percent range.
Cost reimbursement contracts with the cities and towns are expected to be in place by FY 02.
Field Service budget levels will be contingent upon the needs of those contracting for ACCS delivered field services.
Recent fee increases and restored shelter revenues will provide most of the resources needed to rebuild the ACCS staffing structure.
Additional staff paid at market salary rates will allow ACCS to better provide for the many needs of lost pets and the families requesting ACCS services.
Projected revenue from existing funding sources, however, will not be sufficient to fund all the initiatives presented in this plan.
New shelters, the Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Animal Population Control Program, the Feral Cat Management Program, cruelty investigations and future staffing initiatives are all in need of new funding yet to be identified.
Expansion of existing revenue streams and the development of new funding sources will be required to provide quality animal care and control services and to establish Maricopa County as a "no-kill" community.
A summary of ACCS' Five Year Financial Plan, including funded/non-funded strategic results initiatives, is provided at the end of this summary.
Benefits With appropriate funding, ACCS will be able to address public concerns, provide excellent animal care and control services, and be cost effective.
By FY 06, ACCS will: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Substantially reduce Maricopa County's euthanasia rate Dramatically reduce Maricopa County's impound rate Dramatically enhance Maricopa County's pet adoption program Dramatically increase the number of lost pets returned home Increase alternative funding for public programs designed to promote responsible pet ownership and enhance the human/animal bond Open new humane, community pet shelters or renovate existing shelters Provide excellent customer service Retain competent staff Conclusions Historically accepted "catch and kill" methodologies of the past must be discarded for the humane "no-kill" strategies of today Euthanasia is no longer an acceptable method of pet population control Adoption programs are now understood to be only "stop gap" measures Implementation of innovative intervention programs, designed to solve the lost pet problem at its source, are now required Currently there are 1.2 million dogs and cats in Maricopa County The pet population in Maricopa County is expected to grow at a rate of 35,000 pets per year ACCS is currently not meeting the County's growing demand for animal care and control services Revenue from existing sources will not be sufficient to fund all the strategic results initiatives presented in this plan e.g. new shelters, cruelty investigations, etc.
Alternative sources of funding will be required to provide quality animal care and control services and to establish Maricopa County as a "no-kill" community Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Introduction New Philosophy/New Name Animal Care and Control Services (ACCS), formerly known as Animal Control Services, and historically known as Rabies/Animal Control, has a new philosophy of service to match its new name.
Over the years animal control services have been seen by many as either a public health/disease control service or as law enforcement.
Times have changed, and although there are clear public health and law enforcement aspects to ACCS' mandates, ACCS has changed both its name and philosophy of service to more accurately address its state mandates, as well as meet public expectations for animal welfare and control.
New Mission, Vision, and Value Statements The new organization and service delivery of animal care and control services reflect the delicate balance that exists between animal welfare and animal control.
These changes emphasize the equal importance of animal welfare and control and are expressed through ACCS' revised mission, vision and value statements.
Mission To promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of pets and people in Maricopa County.
Vision Animal Care and Control Services envisions the day when residents, their property and neighborhoods, will be free from the dangers and nuisances of irresponsible pet ownership, and when every pet born will be assured of a good home and care all its natural life and will not suffer due to abuse, neglect, or ignorance.
Values Animal Care and Control Services values the integrity of each employee and volunteer contributing to the professional delivery of excellent customer service and the humane treatment of animals, in an atmosphere of open, honest communication, predicated on our trust in and respect for each other.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Environmental Scan Animal Care and Control Services (ACCS) is an independent department within Maricopa County government.
ACCS' organizational placement within the County's Health and Human Services Constellation identifies it as a service designed to monitor and protect the health, safety and welfare of Maricopa County's citizens and their pets.
ACCS provides animal care shelter services to 24 of the fastest growing cities and towns in the United States.
ACCS provides field services to 18 of these municipalities.
Thirtyone field officers serve the citizens of these cities and towns across more than 9,200 square miles, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
ACCS impounds and houses more than 60,000 animals annually in two full service shelters.
The shelters were designed and built when "catch and kill" was the animal control methodology norm.
These shelters are not conducive to disease control or show casing animals for adoption.
Nonetheless, ACCS adopts out thousands of animals annually and returns more than 8,000 lost pets to their owners each year.
Unfortunately, ACCS euthanizes more than 35,000 animals each year because they are unwanted, sick, injured, vicious, or because ACCS has to make room for more incoming animals.
ACCS estimates 10,000 to 15,000 more animals could be adopted if there was adequate shelter space and a more aggressive medical and adoption program.
Administrative services for ACCS are housed in the westside animal shelter located at 35th Avenue and Durango in Phoenix.
ACCS also has an eastside shelter in Mesa and a new Pet Adoption Center in Phoenix.
Field Operations is based out of both the Phoenix and Mesa Shelters.
Since opening the Pet Adoption Center in October 1999, ACCS experienced a 23% increase in its adoption rate, adopting out more than 17,480 pets , more than any municipal shelter program in the United States in a one year period.
The Pet Adoption Center program as well as all the ACCS programs are defined in more detail in Appendix A.
The Animal Care and Control Cycle ACCS is in the midst of a cycle that needs to be interrupted.
The rapid increase in pet and human populations has resulted in a corresponding increase in irresponsible pet ownership.
Pets are permitted to run loose and breed almost indiscriminately.
This necessitates the Field Operations component of the ACCS program.
Animal Control Officers enforce county and municipal animal control ordinances.
The result of this effort is that approximately 20,000 animals are impounded into County Shelters each year.
Up until now ACCS had only two solutions to this dilemma: adoption and euthanasia.
Within this five year business plan ACCS now proposes aggressive spay/neuter programs that will dramatically impact the numbers of animals impounded and the number of animals euthanized each year.
In time the cost benefit of these intervention programs will significantly impact county and municipal costs for animal care and control.
The basic ACCS cycle of citizen demand and public response is illustrated on the following page.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 GROWING HUMAN AND PET POPULATIONS 3MILLION PEOPLE 1.2 MILLION DOGS AND CATS ACCS COMMUNITY SERVICES PET LICENSING EDUCATION PUBLIC PROGRAMS FIELD SERVICES ENFORCEMENT BITE INVESTIGATIONS CITATIONS WARNINGS EDUCATION POLICE ASSISTS 24 HOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE VICIOUS DOG PROSECTUTION SHELTER SERVICES 62,000 ANIMALS ANNUALLY HOUSING, FEEDING, WATERING CARE MEDICAL 
These contracts required Maricopa County to provide field services (i.e. responding to citizen calls, picking up pets in the field, etc.) for each contracting municipality.
In addition, ACCS is also responsible for providing field services in all unincorporated areas in the county.
Historically, Maricopa County primarily funded field service operations through revenue generated from dog license and shelter fees.
At the end of each fiscal year, the participating municipalities paid the difference between all the revenue collected from these fees and all the expenses incurred.
Unfortunately, this method of doing business had the unintended effect of using shelter revenues for city and town field services rather than shelter replacement and humane shelter services as required by statute.
Full Cost Recovery Contracts with Municipalities ACCS has begun a change to develop full cost recovery contracts with the municipalities for providing animal control field services.
Each municipality will have the option of providing its own field service operation or contracting with ACCS, or some other agency, at the full cost of providing these services.
The option of providing their own field services has already been implemented by Mesa, Fountain Hills, Paradise Valley, Peoria, Wickenburg, and Youngtown.
Avondale and Surprise provide their own field services, yet contract with ACCS to supplement their efforts.
Recognizing that the implementation of the new field service contracts will necessitate rearranging budget priorities by each contracting municipality, ACCS developed a gradual implementation of the new cost recovery contracts that will provide partial cost recovery in FY 01 and full cost recovery in FY 02.
ACCS is currently negotiating full cost recovery contracts with several municipalities.
In April 2000, ACCS commissioned a full cost analysis study of all ACCS operations by DMG Maximus, a nationally respected cost accounting consulting firm.
This analysis will be updated each year to assure an accurate costing of operations.
This information will be provided to each municipality and to the policy makers of Maricopa County.
Such a process will ensure ACCS has developed an efficient, cost-effective, and fullyaccountable system of delivering both mandated shelter services and non-mandated field services.
In addition, experienced animal control staff of ACCS will be available to the municipalities in an informal consulting role to assist cities and towns wanting to develop their own field service programs.
Dog License Revenue Available for Shelters The other side of the issue imbedded in the Maricopa County/municipalities contracts is the impact these contracts have had on ACCS' mandated shelter services.
With the implementation of full cost recovery contracts, ACCS will have restored dog license and shelter revenue to its original purpose of funding mandated shelter services.
ACCS will now be able to focus on enhancing these mandated shelter services.
Additionally, ACCS will more aggressively emphasize a variety of ways to reduce the County's pet over population through means other than euthanasia.
Unless community-wide strategies are developed and implemented to address Maricopa County's pet overpopulation problems, Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 the demographics of the vastly increasing number of pets and people will continue to overwhelm the capacity of the current shelters.
Legal Mandates and Provisions Legal Mandates and provisions affecting ACCS are contained in Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 11, Chapter 7, Article 6.
The specific sections that relate to animal care and control are described below.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Section 11:1013, 11:1021 County Shelters and Humane Care Maricopa County is mandated to provide humane animal shelters to lost, homeless, and quarantined dogs and cats.
Animals are to be provided care and shelter until they are reunited with their owners, adopted to new owners, or humanely euthanized.
Section 11:1013 and 11:1022 Spay/Neuter of Adopted Pets All pets adopted through ACCS are required to be spayed or neutered.
Since 1995, ACCS has provided this service prior to the release of a pet to ensure it will never contribute to Maricopa County's pet overpopulation problem.
ACCS' spay and neuter program has helped reduce the county's per capita euthanasia rate by nearly 50%.
Section 11:1005.
3 5, 11:1007.
1 2, 11:1012, 11:1015, 11:1018 Provision for Unincorporated and Municipal Field Services Maricopa County is mandated to provide animal control ordinance enforcement to the unincorporated areas of Maricopa County.
In addition, ACCS provides animal enforcement services to 18 cities and towns .
Enforcement services (known throughout this plan as Field Services) include bite and vicious dog investigations, rabies quarantines, neighborhood patrols, response to citizen complaints, leash law enforcement, etc.
Section 11:1008, 11:1009, and 11:1010 Dog Licensing and Kennel Permitting Maricopa County is also mandated to provide dog-licensing services to any resident of Arizona.
ACCS provides rabies vaccinations and licensing services to both dogs and cats.
Section 11:1011 Funding All monies collected under the provisions of Article 6 are to be deposited in a special revenue fund to be known as the Rabies Control Fund.
The purpose of this fund is to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this article and the provisions promulgated thereunder.
Any unencumbered balance remaining in the rabies control fund at the end of a fiscal year shall be carried over into the following fiscal year.
This provision does not preclude ACCS from receiving funds from the County's General Fund for mandated shelter services.
Costs for field services are recovered from the County for the unincorporated areas and from the respective contracting municipalities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Human and Pet Population Increases ACCS, like all other County service departments, is subject to the incredible increase in population projected for Maricopa County over the next five years.
D. Pollack 
Maricopa County's low unemployment rate, reputation as a business-friendly community, weather, cultural and sports amenities, and the relative low cost of housing continue to be significant draws for not only US citizens from across the United States, but also legal and non-legal workers from around the world.
Pollack projects Maricopa County will grow by at least 80,000 new people in each of the five years included in this plan.
As the population continues to explode, so will the number of pets.
The American Veterinary Medical Association conservatively estimates a corresponding increase of 35,000 new pets for every 80,000 new people populating Maricopa County each year.
These numbers will be added to Maricopa County's current pet population that is estimated at approximately 1.2 million dogs and cats.
Based on these projections of a dramatically rising pet population, ACCS needs to modify and refine its traditional mix of services.
A significant change in funding, as well as type and quantity of services, is reflected throughout this five year plan.
Strategic Issues Through its environmental scan, ACCS identified five areas that will be most critical to its service delivery in the next five years.
Each of these five "strategic issue statements" is listed below, followed by a brief description of the issue.
1.
Public Demand for No-Kill Rapid population growth in Maricopa County will not only increase the number of pets in the county, but it will also change the demand for animal welfare services.
Many new citizens to the county come from areas that have a higher level of animal care services.
ACCS projects that these new residents will not only require a greater number of service hours, but will also demand a higher quality and variety of services.
These citizens will bring the knowledge and experience of the national trend in animal welfare toward providing "no-kill" status of care for pets qualifying for adoption.
2.
Staff Difficult to Recruit and Retain ACCS staff has been critically underpaid.
This has resulted in a high employee turnover rate (15% in FY00 and 18% in First Quarter FY01).
ACCS has been unable to provide the recommended staffing levels necessary to carry out the mandates for animal care and control because of low wages.
A recent second market adjustment appears to have slowed the employee turnover somewhat.
However, numerous positions remain empty while staff tries to recruit replacements.
3.
Public Demand for Customer Service ACCS is under tremendous pressure to provide excellent and compassionate customer service.
Whether it is helping a distraught family relocate a beloved pet, or help an Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 adopted animal recover from a disease that became symptomatic after adoption, ACCS employees are constantly called upon to render advice and assistance.
ACCS receives dozens of calls each week from citizens unhappy about a delay in receiving a license, or the condition of the shelters, or the delay in response by field personnel, or long waits in line in our Shelter Front Offices.
Most complaints are directly related to staffing issues.
4.
Opportunities to Increase Alternative Funding and Public Programs Although there is occasionally a positive story on ACCS, the public image of Maricopa County's shelter services tends to be negative, focusing on the shelters only as a refuge for unwanted animals.
Negative articles have appeared in the local print media and comments and editorials have been made in the electronic media, both radio and television.
The Board of Supervisors has heard from citizens in public meetings on animal control issues.
Many of those comments have been negative about both the quantity and quality of Maricopa County's animal sheltering services.
Citizens have severely criticized Maricopa County for destroying adoptable animals because there is no room to hold them.
ACCS also projects that the period of transition to full cost recovery for field services may generate further negative publicity.
Any time service is changed or disrupted, even if the change is minor or temporary, citizens feel uneasy and negative reactions may result.
5.
Need for Stable Infrastructure Increasing demands for workload, cost and revenue analysis; effective and efficient management tools; and managing for results, requires constant appraisal and upgrade of technological resources.
ACCS is currently lacking the information infrastructure it needs to perform its internal functions as well as provide the database capacity it needs for others to record and retrieve data.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Strategic Plan Strategic Vision Animal Care and Controls Services (ACCS) is in the midst of a profound transformation.
Mahatma Ghandi realized, "A society is measured by how it treats its animals."
If this measure had been used to evaluate Maricopa County in recent years, we would all be found wanting.
But those days will soon be behind us.
Leaving the days of "catch and kill", ACCS is now leading the community towards "nokill" as a standard for caring for pets.
ACCS no longer accepts euthanasia as an accepted method of pet population control.
ACCS has implemented and is proposing several nonlethal remedies to solve our communities pet overpopulation problems.
Since opening the nation's first municipal no-kill adoption shelter in 1999, ACCS has increased its annual adoption rate by 23%, adopting out more pets than any other municipal shelter in the United States.
ACCS will continue to strive to adopt out more and more animals, but it is also important to understand, adoption programs will never solve our communities' pet overpopulation problems.
ACCS is enhancing and improving its administrative infrastructure, sheltering services, and field services.
But that will not be enough to meet the needs of our communities.
Therefore, ACCS also plans to develop new innovative programs that enhance and promote the human/animal bond and help reduce the number of animals impounded and euthanized in Maricopa County shelters.
For instance, ACCS is proposing the development of an Animal Population Control program.
This publicly funded neutering assistance program for low-income pet owners reduced New Hampshire euthanasia rates by 70%, at a cost of just 15 cents per person per year.
According to a 1990 Animal Population Control Study , commissioned by the Minnesota Legislature, every $1 spent on publicly funded neutering assistance programs saved $18.72 in animal control expenses over a ten-year period The City of Phoenix has partnered with ACCS on a similar initiative when ACCS first opened its Spay/Neuter Clinics.
This partnership, combined with ACCS neutering every animal prior to adoption, helped decrease the euthanasia rate in Maricopa County from 20 animals per 1000 residents to 11.5 animals.
Maricopa County could potentially reduce this rate to 2.5 animals per 1000 residents, as New Hampshire has done, by expanding this program throughout the municipalities.
ACCS is also proposing the implementation of a Feral Cat Management Program.
Within a matter of a few years, cats have become the number one companion animal, and the most killed animal in American shelters.
San Diego experienced a 45% decrease in the number of feral cats euthanized due to the work of a feral cat coalition in that community.
ACCS proposes managing a similar coalition for the cities and towns, thus providing a non-lethal solution to this exponentially increasing problem.
Feral Cat Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Management, also called, Trap/Neuter/Return (TRN), is the only successful method for solving this problem.
Adding progressive programs like these to ACCS' Pet Adoption Center, New Hope Program, Foster Program, PETS911 and other innovative programs ensures Maricopa County will remain number one, not only in human population growth, but in lifeaffirming and humane values.
Strategic Goals ACCS has undergone an extensive process of strategic planning that will set the future tone and direction of animal care and control services in Maricopa County.
Throughout this planning process the County's methodology of "Managing For Results" was utilized to ensure organizational goals are measurable and ACCS programs are accountable in achieving results.
Key strategic goals ACCS will be focusing on over the next five years are listed below.
1.
Pursue "No-Kill" Status The rapid growth of human and pet populations in Maricopa County, coupled with the national trend toward the "no-kill" status of adoptable animals, will necessitate a change in organizational philosophy and the acquisition of additional resources to meet public demands.
2.
Recruit and Retain Competent Staff Due to market pressures, current low wages, and working conditions, ACCS will continue to experience difficulty hiring and retaining staff.
3.
Provide Excellent Customer Service Due to public demand for quality pet adoption, licensing, and field services, there is an increasing requirement on ACCS to deliver excellent, cost-effective and timely customer service.
4.
Increase Alternative Funding and Expand Public Programs The public has demonstrated they welcome opportunities to support progressive ACCS programs after they have been made aware of animal welfare issues.
However, much of the public remains unaware of such issues and of ACCS' leadership role in addressing them.
5.
Improve Infrastructure Increasing demands for workload, cost and revenue analysis; effective and efficient management tools; and managing for results, will require constant appraisal and upgrade of technological resources.
More detail relating to these five strategic issues is provided in the following sections.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ISSUE 1 Public Demand for No-Kill The rapid growth of human and pet populations in Maricopa County, coupled with the national trend toward the "no-kill" status of adoptable animals, will necessitate a change in organizational philosophy and the acquisition of additional resources to meet public demands.
STRATEGIC GOAL 1 Pursue "No-Kill" Status Background Rapid population growth in Maricopa County will not only increase the number of pets in the county, but it will also change the demand for animal welfare services.
Many new citizens to the county come from areas that have a higher level of animal care services.
ACCS projects that these new residents will not only require a greater number of service hours, but will also demand a higher quality and variety of services.
These citizens will bring the knowledge and experience of the national trend in animal welfare toward providing "no-kill" status of care for pets qualifying for adoption.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goals Ã¯Â¿Â½ To ensure that physical shelter capacity keeps pace with increasing demand and public expectations Ã¯Â¿Â½ To lower shelter euthanasia rates Ã¯Â¿Â½ To increase adoption rates Ã¯Â¿Â½ To reunite a greater number of lost pets with their families Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase number of spay/neuter surgeries among Maricopa County indigent pet owners Activities In order to reach those goals, ACCS proposes to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Enhance and improve its administrative infrastructure including shelter business offices, licensing and finance divisions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase shelter staffing to provide for the welfare of sheltered animals Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acquire up-to-date shelter equipment Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct a cost/benefit analysis of purchasing two freezers for dead animals versus a crematorium or continuing current processes Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase shelter capacity by building a new shelter Ã¯Â¿Â½ Replace current shelters Ã¯Â¿Â½ Continue to negotiate cost recovery contracts with municipalities to ensure proper staffing and equipment to meet public demands Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase staff in the Call Center so that it can become a community resource capable of responding to citizen demands for service Ã¯Â¿Â½ Explore the possibility of implementing an Animal Population Control program Ã¯Â¿Â½ Explore the possibility of implementing a Feral Cat Management program Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Financial Implications Additional resources will be required in order to achieve the goals as set forth in this issue.
The financial implications of this issue over the next five years are as follows: Increase Shelter Staff by 13 positions - $414,261 Increase Shelter Business Office Staff by 4 positio ns - $104,732 Increase Licensing Staff by 3 positions - $75,000 Increase Field Services Staff by 13 positions - $415,415 Increase Call Center Staff by 4 positions - $104,732 Increase Administrative Staff one position - $49,224 Build a New North Shelter - $12,917,320 Replace Existing Shelters at Durango and Mesa - $21,200,000 Purchase a Crematorium - $220,000 Purchase Two Freezers - $100,000 Animal Population Control Program - $600,000 Feral Cat Management Program - $100,000 For a year by year description and breakout of the above costs, please refer to the ACCS Five Year Financial Plan.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ISSUE 2 Staff Difficult to Recruit and Retain Due to market pressures, current low wages, and working conditions, ACCS will continue to experience difficulty hiring and retaining staff.
STRATEGIC GOAL 2 Recruit and Retain Competent Staff Background The other side of prosperity and full employment in Maricopa County is the difficulty of recruiting and retaining competent animal care and control staff.
ACCS staff must possess a unique, sometimes contradictory, set of skills, talents and personal characteristics.
For example, field service staff must be a combination of cop-on-theblock, family counselor, neighborhood mediator, and animal caregiver and advocate.
According to a Humane Society of the United States study, field animal control officers have ten times more public interaction than police officers.
The skills and characteristics required for this position are difficult to find in any single individual.
However, extensive training will help an individual acquire and perfect the skills needed to do the job.
On the shelter side of services, the staff member must be part veterinarian's assistant, family counselor, public contact professional, and animal caregiver and advocate.
Add to this the harsh reality of pet euthanasia, finding and retaining personnel possessing this combination of skills and talents is very difficult.
As with field service staff, extensive training will help individuals acquire and perfect these skills.
ACCS staff has been critically underpaid.
This has resulted in a high employee turnover rate (15% in FY00 and 18% in First Quarter FY01).
ACCS has been unable to provide the recommended staffing levels necessary to carry out the mandates for animal care and control because of low wages, despite the fact ACCS is about to implement a second market adjustment in as many years.
ACCS is submitting a budget issue to the Office of Budget and Management for a third market adjustment in early FY 02 to finally complete implementation of current market study results.
Maricopa County Human Resources Department recommends a market salary review every two years.
ACCS will regularly request such reviews.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goals Ã¯Â¿Â½ To maintain a staff vacancy rate of 10% or less by June 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ To reduce staff turnover to 10% annually by June 2002 Activities In order to address the issue of recruiting and retaining animal care and control staff, ACCS proposes to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct a market wage study every two years to ensure staff is always provided fair compensation Secure the financial resources to implement appropriate market adjustments Develop Animal Sheltering Teams adept in Humane Euthanasia services and Customer Service and Adoption Counseling by August 2002 In cooperation with the Human Resources Department and Organizational Planning and Training, design, develop and implement a competency based staffing program to recruit and retain qualified staff by June 2001 Integrate this plan with the public education and marketing plan described under Issue 4 by June 2003 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Financial Implications Additional resources will be required in order to achieve the goals as set forth in this issue.

Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ISSUE 3 Public Demand for Customer Service Due to public demand for quality pet adoption, licensing, and field services, there is an increasing requirement on ACCS to deliver excellent, cost-effective and timely customer service.
STRATEGIC GOAL 3 Provide Excellent Customer Service Background Maricopa County citizens are demanding quality pet adoption services, affordable and convenient licensing, and high-response field service operations.
Obviously, these cannot all be addressed in the same year.
ACCS has developed a strategic plan to upgrade shelter services and maintain or improve field services in municipalities contracting with ACCS.
Historically, ACCS has kept data on quantity of services delivered, but little data on quality of services or customers' perceptions of services delivered.
The first step in increasing the quality of services is to measure and define what the current satisfaction level is in order to have a baseline from which to measure future improvements.
ACCS has anecdotal information about the areas of customer dissatisfaction, and these goals address those areas.
However, questioning and measuring the actual customer satisfaction with any individual service may change these priorities over the term of this plan.
A recent customer satisfaction survey conducted by Maricopa County Department of Research and Reporting is attached as Appendix B. Inadequate staffing and low wages that result in high turnover continues to impact customer service delivery.
Proper staffing at appropriate market salary ranges will ensure ACCS provides the high quality animal care and control services that the state mandates and the public demands.
A significant change in customer satisfaction is expected from the creation of the ACCS Shelter Medicine Program.
ACCS is partnering with the American Human Association, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Arizona Veterinary Medical Association in developing a disease inhibiting design for the proposed new shelters.
In the meantime, the Shelter Medicine Program will help reduce the occurrence of diseases in the shelters, enabling more pets the chance to live healthy lives after adoption.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goal Establish a measurable baseline to increase customer satisfaction with ACCS services Develop and implement strategies to increase customer satisfaction based on customer feedback Activities In order to increase both the quantity and quality of customer services, ACCS proposes to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Define and establish a measurable baseline of customer service needs and expectations by June 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Plan and implement a staff training program on proper animal handling and care by October 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop a written Standard of Care for the shelters by January 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop an Adoption Counseling Program with the accompanying training by February 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Further develop the Adoption Program by January 2001 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Revise, update, and complete, in areas not yet covered, a written training manual for each ACCS division Ã¯Â¿Â½ Complete development of a comprehensive Shelter Medicine Program by June 2002 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase staff in the clinic in order to effectively work with the public and properly treat animals in ACCS care Financial Implications Additional resources will be required in order to achieve the goals as set forth in this issue.
The financial implications of this issue over the next five years are as follows: Establish a Shelter Medicine Program Increase Clinic Staff by 8 positions $331,317 Issues 1 and 2 Financial Implications also affect the success of this issue.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ISSUE 4 Opportunities to Increase Alternative Funding and Public Programs The public has demonstrated they welcome opportunities to support progressive ACCS programs after they have been made aware of animal welfare issues.
However, much of the public remains unaware of such issues and of ACCS' leadership role in addressing them.
STRATEGIC GOAL 4 Increase Alternative Funding and Expand Public Programs Background The public image of Maricopa County's shelter services tends to be negative, focusing on the shelters only as a refuge for unwanted animals.
Negative articles have appeared in the local print media and comments and editorials have been made in the electronic media, both radio and television.
The Board of Supervisors has heard from citizens in public meetings on animal control issues.
Many of those comments have been negative about both the quantity and quality of Maricopa County's animal sheltering services.
Citizens have severely criticized Maricopa County for destroying adoptable animals because there is no room to hold them.
ACCS also projects that the period of transition to full cost recovery for field services may generate further negative publicity.
Any time service is changed or disrupted, even if the change is minor or temporary, citizens feel uneasy and negative reactions may result.
Of late, however, since adopting its new philosophy of service delivery, ACCS has enjoyed an unequaled positive response from some of the public.
For example, in 1999, ACCS partnered with the Scratch 
Completing the transition to full cost recovery contracts with the municipalities will consume much staff time over the first two years of this plan.
However, when the new contracts are in place and the revenue stream is stable, ACCS will be able to focus on increasing the quantity and quality of both mandated and non-mandated shelter services.
Many of these useful and valuable services have been requested and even demanded by the public.
However, Maricopa County did not have the funds to implement adequate mandated shelter services, not to mention non-mandated services, nor was there the staff time to pursue alternative funding for innovative animal welfare programs.
ACCS is already involved in several innovative private/public partnerships that may result in alternative funding as well as cost savings for the municipalities.
These partnerships include: Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ PETS911: Currently ACCS is partnering with several private and public partners in the development of Maricopa County's PETS911 program which is designed to empower citizens with community-specific pet welfare information.
Animal Rescue Foundation:
ACCS is in preliminary discussions with Tony Larussa's Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) in designing and developing an Animal Therapy Program to supplement ARF's Animal All-Star Program.
This program is designed to help abused children and teens by teaching them proper care and respect for animals, thereby leading to rehabilitation.
ACCS Auxiliaries: ACCS is working with a 501c3 organization, Friends of Animal Care and Control (FACCS), that is committed to assisting ACCS with fund raising and development of innovative programs.
Alley Cat Allies: ACCS is partnering with Alley Cat Allies, a national feral cat program, and is proposing bringing Alley Cat Allies' successful feral cat management methodology, "Trap/Neuter/Return" (TNR) to Maricopa County municipalities.
Solutions To Overpopulation of Pets, Inc.: ACCS is partnering with Solutions To Overpopulation of Pets, Inc. in Concord, New Hampshire, and Maricopa County's Public Health Services in designing and developing an Animal Population Control Program to be made available to interested municipalities.
SPAY USA: ACCS is in discussion with SPAY USA and the Arizona Veterinary Medical Association (AzVMA) to investigate the viability of promoting participating veterinarians through PETS911 technology and high profile marketing, such as outdoor billboards.
This collaboration could also benefit the Animal Population Control and Feral Cat programs.
Cruelty Investigations: ACCS is working with the County Attorney's Office to develop an ordinance for the unincorporated areas of Maricopa County dealing with investigation of pet cruelty.
Although ACCS has qualified staff to provide this service, it does not have the facilities or the authority to do so.
If this potential change in County ordinance is enacted by the Board of Supervisors, municipalities could revise and adopt this ordinance and then contract with ACCS for this service.
Goals Ã¯Â¿Â½ To ensure that the public and all ACCS partners and customers are provided a positive image and accurate information regarding ACCS' progressive strides toward animal welfare and control Ã¯Â¿Â½ To obtain sufficient funding from alternative sources to provide the level of service demanded by the public Activities To enhance public support and implement innovative public programs, ACCS proposes to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Design and develop a professional program to comprehensively market ACCS' progressive role and direction regarding animal welfare by August 2002 Design and implement a public education program by August 2002 Design and implement a program to increase participation in the Volunteer Support Activity by 16% by September 2001 Design and implement a Therapeutic Programs Activity to provide indigent pet owners and those in crisis with needed pet-related services and referrals to cooperating Human Services agencies by June 2003 Develop a comprehensive, animal-centered training program for ACCS staff and volunteers by September 2002 Develop the capacity to respond to injured and abused animal calls by June 2005 Develop a behavior department that works on behavior and behavior modification of animals in and out of the shelters Define a list of potential program enhancements for mandated and non-mandated services by June 2001 Seek alternative funding for each potential non-mandated program by June 2004 Complete a five year business plan and update it every year to ensure the resources required to provide quality programs are identified and obtained Ã¯Â¿Â½ Financial Implications Additional resources will be required in order to achieve the goals as set forth in this issue.
The financial implications of this issue over the next five years are as follows: Increase Public Programs Staff by one position - $33,115 Cruelty Investigations - $159,775 For a year by year description and breakout of the above costs, please refer to the ACCS Five Year Financial Plan.
Examples of successful public programs can be found in Appendix C. Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ISSUE 5 Need for Stable Infrastructure Increasing demands for workload, cost and revenue analysis; effective and efficient management tools; and managing for results, will require constant appraisal and upgrade of technological resources.
STRATEGIC GOAL 5 Improve Infrastructure Background ACCS has always led the animal care and control industry in technology, with the development and implementation of the Chameleon, PETS911, and PetArk programs.
These programs feature shelter and field service data management capabilities, on-line licensing, interactive pet lost-and-found and pet adoption services, and more.
Each of these programs, designed and developed in ACCS, has gone national.
These programs are now used by hundreds of organizations across the country.
ACCS is currently partnering with a private sector organization in designing software that will easily allow staff to place pictures and information on every lost and adoptable animal on the Internet.
Planned innovations will enhance shelter inventory control and field services data collecting.
Animal control staff members need to be fully equipped with the appropriate computers and computerized telecommunications equipment to do their jobs and serve the public efficiently and effectively.
An aggressive program of training, and a plan to increase the quantity and quality of statistics kept, will demand an even more sophisticated level of technology and staff training to utilize available technological advances.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goal To implement information technology innovations as they become available in order to more effectively reach the goals in Issues 1 through 4.
Activities In order to address the issue of technology, ACCS proposes to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Create an IT Program Manager Position by FY02 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop and implement a comprehensive IT program with a staff training component by June 2002 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identify and obtain technological tools and resources to enhance customer service Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Financial Implications Additional resources will be required in order to achieve the goals as set forth in this issue.
The financial implications of this issue over the next five years are as follows: Information Technology - $61,248 For a year by year description and breakout of the above costs, please refer to the ACCS Five Year Financial Plan.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Functional/Organizational Realignment In order to meet the needs described in the Environmental Scan and the Strategic Plan, ACCS is implementing an organizational realignment of its divisions.
The new ACCS organization will better reflect the new mission and vision of the Department.
The new organizational structure will include the following: The Administration Division: Policy Development/Strategic Planning Human Resources Controller/Licensing Services Informational Technology Services The Animal Sheltering Division: Shelter Services Adoption Counseling Foster Program New Hope Program Pet Adoption Center Pet Identification Program (in development) Shelter Medicine Program (in development) The Field Services Division: Call Center Dispatch Center Enforcement The Public Programs Division: Volunteer Program Marketing/Grants Humane Education/Training Program PETS911 Therapeutic Program (in development) Maddie's Coalition Animal Population Control (proposed) Feral Cat Management (proposed) Additional information on each of these Divisions and their respective programs can be found in Appendix A.
This structure is also illustrated in the organizational chart on the following page.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ACCS Org anizatio nal Chart Executive Director Human Resources Controller Information Technology Automation Coordination Animal Sheltering Field Services Public Programs Licensing Pet Adoption Center West Shelter East Shelter Field West Volunteer Coordination Marketing/ Grants Humane Education Accounting Field East Call Center Dispatch Shelter Medicine Program Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Five Year Financial Plan Animal Care and Control Services The demand for animal care and control services in Maricopa County is on the increase.
Currently in Maricopa County there is an estimated 1.2 million dogs and cats.
The County's pet population, like in every community, is directly related to the County's human population.
Over the next five years, the human population of Maricopa County is projected to increase 80,000 people per year.
The County's pet population is expected to follow a similar pattern, rising at a rate of 35,000 animals a year.
As a result of this growth and a corresponding citizen demand for greater service, the current workload for Animal Care and Control Services (ACCS) will steadily increase.
In order to meet this demand, ACCS revenues will have to significantly expand to offset rising animal care and control costs.
Workload Field services, sheltering dogs and cats, dog licensing, adoptions, returning pets to owners, spay/neuter services, rabies vaccinations and euthanasias are the major services provided by ACCS.
Workload for each of these services is directly dependent upon the number of dogs and cats in the County.
ACCS is not currently meeting the County's growing demand for service.
As part of this five year plan, strategic result initiatives will be presented to justify the expansion of ACCS to meet workload requirements, now and into the future.
(See Five Year ACCS Activity Forecasts, Section 14) Revenue Funding for ACCS services comes from five funding sources: license and permit fees; intergovernmental agreements with cities and towns; County general funds; donations and grants.
Projected ACCS revenue is expected to steadily increase over the next five years.
Modest fee increases in license and adoption fees this year, coupled with expected dog and cat population growth, are projected to increase fee revenue from $4,948,530 in FY 00 to $5,179,076 in FY 01, a 4.7 percent increase.
Fee revenues are expected to grow between 2.5 to 3.0 percent thereafter, provided fees remain at their current rates.
(See Five Year ACCS Revenue Forecasts, Section 15) Historically, Maricopa County has primarily funded field service operations through revenues generated from license and shelter fees.
Through intergovernmental agreements with the cities and towns, participating municipalities paid the difference between revenues collected from these fees and expenses incurred.
Unfortunately, this method of doing business had the unintended effect of using shelter revenues for city and town field services rather than shelter replacement and humane shelter services as required by statute.
Intergovernmental agreements in the future between the County and municipalities will be full cost recovery field service contracts.
Each municipality will have the option of providing its own field service operation, contracting with ACCS, or contracting with Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 some other agency, at the full cost of providing these services.
Revenue in the future from intergovernmental agreements and the County general fund is dependent upon the level of field service the cities, towns and County desire.
If a city or town chooses not to contract with ACCS for field services, field service costs to support that entity will be eliminated from the ACCS budget.
Donations and grants are a relatively new funding source for ACCS.
During FY 00, ACCS received $ 90,556 in donations and was awarded $87,000 from two separate grants.
Future donation and grant revenue is dependent upon staff resources to write grants and participate in fundraising programs.
One of ACCS' strategic results initiatives is to hire a full time position to support this effort.
Cost In order for ACCS to fulfill its mission, achieve its vision, and keep its key values of integrity; excellent customer service; honest communication; trust and respect for others; and the humane treatment of animals, additional financial resources must be allocated.
Existing staff resources within ACCS cannot keep pace with the current demand for animal care and control services.
Additional staff is required for basic animal care in the shelters, a shelter medicine program, the shelter business office, licensing, administration, public programs and field services.
Justification for the addition of staff resources is provided in detail in the Strategic Results Initiative sections of this plan.
(See Sections 17 through 25) Staff recruitment and retention is another major problem ACCS currently faces.
Employee turnover rates for ASSC range from 15 to 18 percent.
In November 2000, ACCS was allowed to implement Phase Two of a three phase market increase for over 120 employees.
Phase Two of the market increase added over $400,000 in personal service costs to ACCS' budget.
Phase Three of the market adjustment, scheduled in FY 02, would increase ACCS' personal service budget by another $200,000.
Proposed staffing increases and market salary adjustments are expected to increase ACCS' shelter services budget from $4,388,709 in FY 01 to $5,459,697 in FY 02, a 24.4 percent increase.
Shelter services budget increases in the years that follow are expected to grow in only the 2 to 3 percent range.
Cost reimbursement contracts with the cities and towns are expected to be in place by FY 02.
Field Service budget levels will be contingent upon the needs of those contracting for ACCS delivered field services.
(See Five Year ACCS Budget Forecasts, Sections 13 and 16) Summary Recent fee increases and restored shelter revenues will provide most of the resources needed to rebuild the ACCS staffing structure.
Additional staff, paid at market salary rates, will allow ACCS to better provide for the many needs of lost pets and families requesting ACCS services.
Projected revenue from existing funding sources, however, will not be sufficient to fund all the initiatives presented in this plan.
New shelters, the Animal Population Control Program, the Feral Cat Management Program, cruelty Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 investigations and future staffing initiatives are all in need of new funding, yet to be identified.
Expansion of existing revenue streams and the development of new funding sources will be required to provide quality animal care and control services and to establish Maricopa County as a "no-kill" community.

Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Strategic Results Initiatives ACCS has adopted Maricopa County's Managing for Results strategic planning and budgeting metholodology.
What this means is that ACCS, its management system, the people who work for ACCS, the organizational structure and culture (beliefs, behavior and language) are focused on achieving results for the customer.
Managing for Results makes it possible to make good business decisions based on performance and makes it possible for a department to demonstrate accountability for results.
A result of an Environmental Scan allowed ACCS to identify five strategic issues.
These issues are described in this plan, behind Tabs 6 through 10.
The strategic issue statements summarize the issues and trends that will have a major impact on ACCS and its customers over the next two to five years.
Strategic Goals, corresponding to each of the Strategic Issues, translate resources into significant "results" to be acheieved over the next two to five years.
This provides the basis for evaluating the Department as a whole.
The Strategic Goals are described in Tabs 6 through 10.
Behind Tabs 18 through 26 are descriptions of Strategic Results Initiatives.
These initiatives are cricial to the successful achievement of ACCS' Strategic Goals.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Appendix A Current and Proposed Programs Administration Policy Development/Strategic Planning (new) Policy Development/Strategic Planning continually reviews and updates organizational mission, vision, values, policy and procedures to ensure organizational alignment to County structure and provision of effective, efficient customer service.
Human Resources (new) Human Resources provides ACCS with the accurate and professional staffing support needed to retain employees and provide mandated services.
Controller/Licensing Services The Controller's Office monitors and manages the monetary, financial reporting, purchasing, and public records activities of ACCS, providing external partners with accurate and reliable data on which to base decisions about the department's performance as a service provider.
The Licensing Division provides dog license services to the citizens of Maricopa County.
This is one of the legally mandated activities of Maricopa County.
ACCS is making the purchase of a dog license easier than ever.
Pet owners can now purchase a dog license at over 100 veterinary offices throughout Maricopa County.
Soon licensing will be offered on-line and over a mirrored phone system.
ACCS has the highest dog license compliance rate in the country, according to the National Animal Control Association.
ACCS reunites over 8,000 lost pets each year with their distraught families.
With the development of PETS911 and ACCS' own licensing system, one hundred percent of the pets ACCS receives wearing a current license tag go home.
Rarely does Maricopa County have the opportunity to achieve a 100 percent success rate in a service delivery program, and this program is uniquely successful.
Because of ACCS' Licensing and PETS911 programs, many pets are now returned home without ever having to experience the trauma of a shelter experience.
Informational Technology Services Informational Technology Services provides access and assistance to ACCS LAN users so they may expand their personal capabilities, increase their productivity, and provide more reliable and efficient customer service by effectively utilizing IT resources.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Animal Sheltering Services Shelter Services Animal sheltering services provides safe, humane housing to impounded animals.
Animal sheltering services has been a neglected component of the ACCS program for many years as a result of the deficit based municipal contracts.
Revenues meant to provide and enhance shelter services were used to provide municipal field services.
With the restoration of these funds to their state statute intended use, ACCS can now focus on enhancing and improving shelter services.
Adoption Counseling The ACCS adoption program is integral to saving the lives of thousands of animals in Maricopa County each year.
ACCS strives to place as many animals as possible into loving, responsible homes.
With the building of the Pet Adoption Center last year, ACCS was able to bring animals into a positive environment where adoption staff helped make matches between animals and new pet owners through dialogue and socializing with the animal prior to adoption.
This process, called "adoption counseling" helps to ensure the right animal goes to the right home, for a lifetime.
Within the next year ACCS will formalize the Adoption Counseling program and expand its reach to include the two full-service shelters.
Foster Program ACCS developed an aggressive Foster Program that keeps newborn and sick animals alive until they can be placed for adoption.
Hundreds of animals that historically would have been euthanized are now being saved through this program.
The citizens who provide care and foster homes for these animals are all volunteers.
Mobile Adoption ACCS, in partnership with the Scratch 
This vehicle will help to safely and humanely transport adoptable spayed and neutered animals back into the communities they came from, where they will have a better chance of finding adoption homes.
By returning animals to the communities they came from, ACCS will reduce the convenience offered by backyard breeders and puppy mills.
Research and national experiences have shown that citizens, if given the opportunity to choose, will choose to save a life when adopting a pet.
New Hope The New Hope Program saves thousands of animals each year from euthanasia by transferring animals ACCS cannot adopt to over fifty local participating rescue organizations.
These organizations then place these animals through adoption.
ACCS provides these animals at no cost to the partnering organization.
Pet Adoption Center In 1999, ACCS partnered with the Scratch 
Since then several communities around the country have expressed interest in implementing this concept.
Las Vegas recently opened such a center.
ACCS increased adoptions by 23% since opening this community center for pets and people.
ACCS is exploring partnering with several cities and towns to open more pet adoption centers.
This concept is key to ending euthanasia of healthy adoptable pets in Maricopa County.
By participating in this initiative municipalities can demonstrate their resolve to become no-kill communities.
Pet Identification (in development) Soon ACCS will insert traceable microchips in every pet adopted, further increasing a pet's chances of being reunited with its owner should it become lost.
In addition to supporting the major goal of helping reunite lost pets with families, this program will also help field staff identify loose dogs and therefore enforce animal control ordinances.
This program will also provide ACCS with valuable data concerning the animals it impounds and adopts.
This data will be helpful in planning and enhancing future initiatives.
Shelter Medicine (in development) ACCS is developing a comprehensive shelter medicine program to increase the humane medical care of both sick and injured animals in the shelter system.
The Shelter Medicine Program is supported by the shelter fee increase of August 2000 and restored dog license revenue.
This program is designed to increase adoptions and decrease euthanasia by making animals that historically were euthanized healthy enough to be adopted.
The program will also help guard the health of owned animals received by County shelters.
Field Services Programs Call Center The Call Center is designed to provide the first link in resolving citizens' concerns and complaints about animals control ordinance violations.
The Call Center ensures citizens are provided quick, clear, accurate information.
The Call Center program assists citizens in finding the owners of lost licensed pets to help ensure a quick and safe return to their owners.
The Call Center also dispatches animal control officers, when necessary, to resolve complaints of animal control ordinance violations, such as dogs running at large, bites, dog attacks, dogs on school ground and in parks, etc.
Dispatch Center The Dispatch Center provides a communications link with Animal Control Officers so officers have a reasonable expectation of safety and can be provided with quick accurate information in order to respond to customer complaints in a timely manner.
Enforcement ACCS field enforcement program provides enforcement of animal control ordinances for the residents of the unincorporated areas of Maricopa County, and by contract to the Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 cities and towns.
This program includes educating residents on the proper care of pets and legal requirements of pet ownership.
Current and proposed Field contract services include impound stray and lost dogs, investigate and quarantine animals biting humans, investigate and quarantine of possible rabies exposure cases (1999 57, 2000 240), issue citations, court appearances and prosecution of vicious dog petitions, assist police in arrests and raids, assist fire departments, respond to school calls, provide after hour emergency response to police and fire departments, provide police/parks personnel with training, dangerous dog task force, cruelty investigations, owner impounds, and coordination of a feral cat program.
Public Programs Volunteer Program Volunteers and community involvement will continue to be an integral part of ACCS' success.
In the next five years, ACCS will increase its volunteer recruitment and training programs and expand the roles that volunteers play within shelter operations to include animal behavior modification and public outreach.
ACCS will recruit more professionals into its volunteer force to help develop human/animal-based programs that assist the youth and elderly in Maricopa County.
Marketing/Grants The Marketing Program will develop partnerships with other agencies and organize a complete marketing plan.
This marketing plan will assist ACCS in improving its image and reducing animal suffering and the number of animals turned in by the public.
The creation of a Marketing position in FY 02 will allow ACCS the opportunity to create a marketing plan that will map out strategy for public relations, marketing, and advertising.
A strong program will allow ACCS to change the image from an uncaring organization to a community animal welfare leader.
This will also help increase adoption rates, reduce the number of animals turned in, picked up, and ultimately euthanized, and increase the number of animals licensed.
The Grant Activity will supplement the base budget with non-traditional funding so ACCS can develop and deliver public programs that will enhance the human/animal bond and reduce pet euthanasia.
This program will allow ACCS to identify and manage funds available to ACCS that do not stem from the sale of dog licenses, shelter fees or city contracts.
This activity will include wills/bequests, special events, corporate donations, grants and donations, individual giving and gifts in-kind.
Humane Education/Training The Humane Education Activity will educate the public on responsible pet ownership and the human/animal bond.
This education will decrease the number of calls requiring field officer intervention for animal abuse, bite-related injuries.
Through public education, pet annoyance complaints will decrease, and fewer animals per one thousand humans will enter the shelters.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 Marketing alone does not change individual behavior.
ACCS plans to create a comprehensive, interactive, developmentally based education program focusing on the relationship between people and animals, responsible pet ownership and bite prevention.
This program will be targeted to all populations including schools, community groups, adults and families.
The program will combine community-based outreach programs and interactive programs within the shelters themselves.
This position will also provide training to staff.
PETS911 ACCS, partnering with PETsMART Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, AT
This program has since rolled out nationally and over 3,500 organizations around the country now participate in this important partnership to locate lost pets.
PETS911 is now supported by such national organizations as the American Humane Association, Best Friend's Animal Sanctuary, Doris Day Animal League, Doing Things for Animals, SPAY USA, Alley Cat Allies, and PETsMART Charities.
Virtually every animal welfare organization in Maricopa County participates in the PETS911 program.
Therapeutic Program (in development) The Therapeutic Program will provide bereavement counseling for individuals who have lost a pet; temporary foster care for animals of victims of domestic violence, an emergency situation such as a fire, and for elderly who find themselves rushed to the hospital with no one to care for their pet(s); animal-assisted therapy and activities programs for senior and victims of abuse; and prevention and intervention of animal abuse programs.
Maddie's Coalition ACCS, in partnership with other local animal welfare organizations, took the lead in forming a local Maddie's Coalition that seeks to bring a $10 million private foundation grant into Maricopa County.
These funds will help local non-profit animal welfare organizations develop additional resources and services to help ACCS transform Maricopa County into a no-kill society.
Every successful effort towards no-kill will help maintain or reduce municipality costs for animal control services.
Animal Population Control (proposed) ACCS, in partnership with the City of Phoenix, implemented a targeted spay/neuter program to assist low-income families wanting to neuter their pets.
This program, combined with ACCS' own spay/neuter program, helped reduce Maricopa County's pet euthanasia rate from over 20 animals per 1000 residents in 1990 to 11.5 animals per 1000 residents in 2000.
ACCS plans to partner with other cities and towns and the Arizona Veterinary Medical Association to expand this service to indigent populations in every municipality.
Animal Population Control will assist low-income pet owners to spay/neuter their pets.
This publicly funded neutering assistance program for low-income pet owners reduced New Hampshire euthanasia rates by 70% at a cost of just 15 cents per person per year.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 According to a 1990 Animal Population Control Study commissioned by the Minnesota Legislature, every $1 spent on publicly funded neutering assistance programs saved $18.72 in future animal control expenses over a ten year period.
ACCS proposes a partnership between Maricopa County, municipalities, the Maricopa County veterinary community, and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health in the establishment of a low-income neutering assistance program similar to the successful program operated by the State of New Hampshire.
It is estimated that a similar program could be offered to municipalities in Maricopa County for an annual cost as low as 25 cents per resident.
For instance, a municipality with a population of 100,000 residents could participate in the program and offer it to their residents at a cost of $25,000 a year.
This figure is derived from the actual cost of the New Hampshire program over the past six years as adjusted for the cost of living and poverty rate in Maricopa County.
Maricopa County Public Health Services would coordinate and administer the program using as a model the forms and procedures developed by the New Hampshire State Veterinarian and Department of Agriculture, Markets and Food.
Participating veterinarians will be promoted by ACCS' PETS911 program.
This will assist citizens in finding the closest veterinarian to their home or office.
ACCS already provides this promotion to veterinarians selling dog licenses.
Feral Cat Management (proposed) Historically, feral cat problems have been addressed using the "catch and kill" methodology.
A citizen traps a feral cat, brings it to a Maricopa County shelter and staff is expected to kill it.
This approach has been practiced for 30 years and the feral cat problem has only gotten worse.
The "catch and kill" methodology is fundamentally flawed.
Cats live in colonies of approximately 20.
If a cat is removed from a colony two things happen: female cats start producing more offspring and other cats from other colonies attempt to fill the vacated niche.
This results in catfights, cat howling and spraying territory, and even more cat mating, resulting in even more offspring.
This new program would utilize a methodology that has been very successful in both large cities and small campuses.
The methodology, called "Trap/Neuter/Return" provides for the cats to be neutered, making them incapable of reproducing.
Feral cats only live three to five years, and the problem literally dies out.
The cats are also inspected and vaccinated by a veterinarian which reduces the chance of diseases, including rabies, among colony members, and spay/neutered cats don't fight, howl, spray, or reproduce, reducing the nuisance element of having them around.
Volunteers will be utilized to manage a cat colony.
The volunteers will trap, bring the cats to a County clinic or participating veterinarian's office, the cats will be spay/neutered and vaccinated, and the volunteers will return the cats and feed, water, and monitor their health every day for the life of the colony.
The only cost is that of the surgery and vaccination.
Maricopa County Department of Animal Care and Control Services/ November 2000 ACCS proposes a partnership with the municipalities and the Maricopa County veterinary community who would provide a reduced price for this service.
The actual budget and structure of this program will have to be developed by the participants.
