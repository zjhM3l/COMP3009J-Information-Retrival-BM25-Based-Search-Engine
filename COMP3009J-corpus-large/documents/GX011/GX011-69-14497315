INSTITUTE-SPONSORED MEETINGS, WORKSHOPS, CONFERENCES, AND PUBLIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES
I. Meetings Held
Dietary Supplements and the Elderly.
The NIA Office of Nutrition in conjunction with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements held a two-day advisory meeting on January 14-15 in Bethesda on "Dietary Supplements Use in the Elderly."
The purpose of the meeting was to review the current state of knowledge and to suggest future research directions.
Based on a survey conducted in 1999, it was estimated that at least 40 percent of older Americans had used some form of herbal or specialty supplement during that year.
Reasons for their use include maintenance of overall health, increase of energy, improving memory, preventing or treating illness, and slowing the aging process.
The number of scientific studies on safety or efficacy of these products is limited because FDA approval is not required.
Presentations covered three major areas: the what and why of dietary supplement use in the elderly; special physiological/metabolic conditions of the elderly that might affect DS use; and evidence-based studies on use of DS to maintain health in various organ systems, and to prevent or ameliorate diseases and impairments of the elderly.
Other NIH Institutes and Offices that contributed to this conference included National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the National Eye Institute (NEI), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research (OBSSR), as well as the US Department of Agriculture (USDA); extramural support was contributed through the Foundation of the NIH.
A summary of the conference is available through the NIA website at: http://nacanet.nia.nih.gov/meetings.htm, and further recommendations can be obtained from the program contact.

Research Needs in the Evaluation of Executive Functions from Cognitive Aging to Dementias Workshop.
This advisory workshop was held on January 27-28 in Bethesda to seek expert opinion on the comparability of executive functions across different populations, species, and cognitive levels, and the feasibility of using brain imaging to improve measurement.
The aging of executive functions was viewed as a public health issue that needs attention in terms of measurement and development of adequate interventions.
Discussions highlighted the need for better definitions of the components of executive functions in normal aging and age-related diseases across species, the importance of evaluating the adequacy of existing instruments, the need for population studies of executive functions in older persons and in middle-age individuals, as well as the need for imaging studies to identify neural network reorganizations involved in executive functions.
Recommendations from this meeting will be used in the formulation of an initiative on executive functions and aging by the NIA.
Recommendations also will be presented at the trans-NIH conference on Executive Functions spearheaded by NINDS to form the basis for future research collaborations.
A report of the meeting is forthcoming.

Defining and Measuring Environments for Genetic Studies of Aging, an exploratory workshop, took place on February 26-27, 2003, in Bethesda.
The purpose of this meeting was to explore issues related to incorporating environmental factors from the behavioral and social sciences into genetically informative studies of aging.
Development of this area is critical to understanding central issues surrounding gene expression including gene-environment interactions, gene-environment covariation, and how social contexts and behaviors affect gene expression.
The meeting congregated scientists from diverse backgrounds who have already done critical work related to the workshop theme.
The presentations and discussions addressed issues related to methodological, conceptual and substantive approaches to defining and measuring environments, gene-environment interplay, most fruitful study designs, and how to foster the required interdisciplinary research.
A special journal issue based upon the paper presentations is being considered.

Genetics of Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Case Control Advisory Workshop.
Studies of Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated that there is a genetic component.
Three of four genes shown to be associated with the disease are linked to the early onset form, are autosomal dominant, and account for only a small number of all AD cases.
Studies on the more common late onset form of AD have shown that a fourth gene, the APOE gene, is a susceptibility factor for sporadic late onset AD.
Recent reports have suggested that there are additional risk factor genes for late?onset AD, and new AD-related regions in the human genome and gene candidates have been identified that may modify the risk for AD.
The NIA has expanded its Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Initiative.
A workshop on the Genetics of Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) held in the spring of 2002, resulted in mechanisms to more rapidly collect and share large numbers of samples for genetic analysis through the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD).
A major component of the AD Genetics Initiative is the collection of two types of samples: a family based sample set and a case-control sample set.
This national case-control set of cell lines will serve as a gold standard against which risk factor genes for LOAD can be evaluated.
An advisory workshop was convened on May 5 to plan for the acquisition of the case-control sample set.
The purpose of the meeting was: to determine the goals for a national case-control study for late onset Alzheimer's Disease; to discuss the study design for a national case-control study for late onset Alzheimer's Disease; and to discuss criteria for inclusion of cases and controls.
(Contact: Dr. Marilyn Miller, NNA, Ph: 301-496-9350)
Immunology and Aging.
A BAP-sponsored exploratory workshop was held on May 7 during the annual American Association of Immunology (AAI) meeting in Denver, Colorado.
The purpose of the workshop was to allow attendees at the national meeting the opportunity to become familiar with recent progress in research on aging-related defects in immunity and to allow an opportunity for researchers working in different areas of immunology to interact.
Three speakers presented overviews of the current state of research into age-related defects in lymphopoiesis, T cell compartments and B cell compartments.
This was followed by a presentation by NIA program staff highlighting NIA interests and current funding opportunities.

II.
Meetings Planned
Workshop on Werner's Syndrome.
BAP will co-sponsor this exploratory workshop with the NIA IRP, Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology Program (GCG), the NIA International office, and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases (NIH ORD) on May 28-31.
The meeting will address recent success in understanding the molecular basis of Werner's syndrome (WS), a premature aging syndrome characterized by increased risk of cancer and osteoporosis, slow wound healing, and premature onset of cataracts and loss of subcutaneous fat.
Understanding the causes of WS may inform us about the basic mechanisms associated with development of aging phenotypes during normal aging.
The meeting will be held in Leesburg, VA.
(Contacts: Dr. Vilhelm Bohr, IRP, Ph: 410-558-8223; Dr. Evan Hadley, GCG, Ph: 301-496-6761; and Dr. Huber Warner, BAP, Ph: 301-496-4996)
Workshop on Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome.
On July 28-29, BAP will sponsor a second advisory Workshop on Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGS) to discuss promising new avenues of research on this syndrome, based on the forthcoming report in Nature that HGS is due to a specific T to C transition mutation in codon 608 of the gene for lamin A. Six other pathologies are associated with mutations in the lamin A gene.
The various phenotypes of these other six laminopathies overlap the overall phenotype observed in HGS patients.
The identification of this gene thus suggests research avenues for (1) understanding the molecular basis of HGS, (2) the development of therapeutic interventions for HGS, and (3) understanding the role that the nuclear envelope, and nuclear structure in general, could play in the development of aging phenotypes during normal aging.
The workshop is co-sponsored by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases, and the Progeria Research Foundation.
The meeting will be held in Bethesda.

SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE UNITED STATES (R01) RELEASE DATE: January 16, 2003 PA NUMBER: PA-03-057 http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-03-057.html PURPOSE OF THIS PA This PA invites qualified researchers to submit research grant applications on the demography and social science of race and ethnicity in the United States.
The goal of this program announcement is to encourage research that will improve understanding of race and ethnicity in social science and demographic research.
Demographic and social aspects of race and ethnicity include issues related to understanding how the changing composition and conceptualization of race and ethnicity are affecting the U.S. socially, economically, and demographically, including how increasing racial and ethnic diversity are affecting population health and health disparities; issues related to the development of racial and ethnic identity and to interactions between racial/ethnic identification and demographic, health, and other outcomes; and issues related to the measurement of race and ethnicity, including racial and ethnic self-identification.

MAINTENANCE OF LONG TERM BEHAVIORAL CHANGE RELEASE DATE: January 15, 2003 (see NOT-OB-03-002) RFA NUMBER: OB-03-003 http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OB-03-003.html APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE: April 11, 2003 PURPOSE OF THIS RFA This RFA invites applications for research projects that (a) examine biopsychosocial processes and test interventions designed to achieve long-term health behavior change and (b) a Resource Center to provide coordination for this set of research projects.
Past research has typically focused on short term behavioral change, yielding little information on how change, once achieved, is maintained over the long term.
This Request for Applications (RFA) encourages investigators to expand on the current theoretical base of change processes and intervention models, as well as to consider new conceptualizations from basic research in the social and behavioral sciences.
Applications must focus on important health-related behaviors already demonstrated amenable to short-term change, such as tobacco use, exercise, eating habits, alcohol and drug use, inoculation obtainment, disease screening, stress reduction, adherence to health care regimens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)or sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk practices, bullying and abuse of others, sun exposure, and failure to use safety equipment.

ACADEMIC RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT AWARD (R15) RELEASE DATE: January 9, 2003 PA NUMBER: PA-03-053 http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-03-053.html APPLICATION RECEIPT DATES: January 25, May 25, September 25 AIDS-RELATED APPLICATION RECEIPT DATES: May 1, September 1, January 2 PURPOSE OF THIS PA The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is continuing to make a special effort to stimulate research in educational institutions that provide baccalaureate or advanced training for a significant number of the Nation's research scientists but that have not been major recipients of NIH support.
Since Fiscal Year (FY) 1985, Congressional appropriations for the NIH have included funds for this initiative, which NIH has implemented through the Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) program.
Based on the expectation that funds will continue to be available each year, the NIH invites applications for AREA grants (R15) through a standing, an ongoing Program Announcement (PA).
These grants are intended to create a research opportunity for scientists and institutions otherwise unlikely to participate extensively in NIH programs to support the Nation's biomedical and behavioral research effort.

"Mind-body interactions and health" refers to the relationships among cognitions, emotions, personality, social relationships, and health.
Applicant institutions may request funds to support infrastructure and research designed to (1) enhance the quality and quantity of mind-body and health research and (2) develop new research capabilities to advance mind-body and health research through innovative approaches.
These activities must reflect a research theme that is driven by scientific questions within the context of "Mind-body interactions and health" research.
A central goal of this program is to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in mind-body and health research while providing essential and cost-effective core services in support of the development, conduct, and translation into practice of mind-body and health research based in centers or comparable administrative units.
