Mr. Charles (Garry) Betty President and CEO EarthLink, Inc. 1375 Peachtree Street Atlanta, GA, 30309 _________________________________________________________________
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today.
My name is Garry Betty and I am the CEO of EarthLink.
EarthLink is the nation's 3rd largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) serving 5 million customers nationwide with dial-up, broadband (DSL, cable and satellite), web hosting and wireless Internet services.
As such, we are on the front lines every day in the fight against unsolicited commercial e-mail, commonly known as spam.
As you well know, spam is a growing problem.
There are over 70 million American households and businesses online today and almost every one of them has firsthand experience with spam.
We at EarthLink have seen a 500% increase in spam over the past 18 months.
What was at first an occasional inconvenience grew to be an annoyance and now threatens to overwhelm online communications.
E-mail is often described as the Internet's "killer app."
Left unchecked, spam threatens to kill the killer app.
Spam creates inefficiency.
By some estimates, spam is responsible for $10 billion a year in lost productivity to American businesses.
As an ISP, approximately 50% of all e-mail coming into our servers is spam.
AOL estimates this figure as high as 80% on their network.
We are able to filter out 70-80% of these messages before they ever get to our customers, but the increasing volume means that lots of unwanted electronic junk mail still gets to user's in-boxes.
Spam costs Internet providers real money.
Excess server capacity, an "abuse team" working full time to ferret out and close down sources of spam on the internet, internal and external legal fees are all costs we incur because of spam.
While we don't publish exact figures on this, it is fair to say that they are in excess of $10 million a year for EarthLink alone.
Spam is a pernicious problem.
While get rich quick schemes, effortless weight loss programs and pills that promise to enlarge body parts are nothing new, the cost burden imposed by spam is.
Newspaper and magazines ads, telemarketing calls, direct mail pieces and signs tacked to telephone poles all require the sender to pay for their messages.
Spam adds insult to injury by shifting this cost burden.
Spam costs virtually nothing to send.
(One recent widely circulated spam message for spammers advertises 20 million email addresses for $149.00.)
Instead, the costs of spam are borne by ISPs which must handle this junk e-mail and by consumers who get their in-boxes filled with it.
In order to win the fight against spam, we must engage it on several fronts.
In addition to legislation, we must also use litigation, enforcement, customer education and technology solutions to combat spam.
I would like to briefly address each of these in turn:
Legislation
EarthLink supports legislation to help ISPs and consumers in the fight against spam.
And Congress is clearly engaged in this issue.
We count no fewer than seven bills currently being actively discussed in the House and Senate.
Rather than speak just to any one bill, we would like to note several provisions in various bills which we think will be helpful to ISPs and consumers, based upon the experience Earthlink has had in suing some of the nation's most egregious spammers.
First, we support the provision in several bills which note that they place no restrictions on an ISP's current ability to block spam on behalf of its customers.
ISPs are
truly the first line of defense against spam for consumers.
ISPs that deploy effective filtering and blocking techniques can spare their customers a good deal of the aggravation that spam creates.
However, since spammers are constantly looking for new ways to defeat ISP blocking protections, it is important to ensure that legislation does not limit the ability of ISPs to adjust and refine their filtering and blocking techniques to maximize their effectiveness.
Similarly, we support the provision in various bills that note that ISPs have a right of action to pursue legal action against spammers.
As I will discuss in the next section, ISP lawsuits against spammers are an effective tool in the fight against spam.
Next, we would urge caution in placing a cap on monetary damages.
Based on our own litigation experience, we believe that large monetary damage awards against the most egregious spammers send a strong signal about the seriousness of spamming and have a stronger deterrent effect against other spammers.
We would urge Congress not to impose a damages cap on ISP legal actions against spammers.
Finally, we support requirements for accurate sender, subject line and IP address information.
Consumers must have accurate sender, subject line and IP address information, and we applaud the legislative efforts to confirm these basic requirements.
For too long spammers have deceived innocent victims with fraudulent and deceptive "come-ons" in the subject lines, confusing consumers into thinking that they are receiving e-mails from a trustworthy entity or friend.
These deceptions must be stopped and legislative efforts to address this are well directed.
Litigation
Another important front in the fight against spam is litigation.
EarthLink was one of the first ISPs in the country to go after spammers in court.
Earthlink's successful 1997 case against Sanford Wallace and Cyberpromotions stopped what was then one of the most prolific spammers on the Internet.
Since that time, EarthLink has filed lawsuits against over 100 spammers.
Most recently, EarthLink won a judgment in May 2003 against Howard Carmack the "Buffalo Spammer."
It is estimated that Carmack sent out some 850 million spam messages over an 18-month period, or an average of about 2 million messages a day.
EarthLink's case against Carmack is illustrative of our lawsuits against spammers.
While we were able to obtain a $16.4 million judgment against Carmack, we just as importantly obtained permanent injunctive relief, barring him from spamming again.
Furthermore, when EarthLink gets judgments against spammers, it asks the court to make all other ISPs 3rd party beneficiaries of those judgments.
This bars the defendant spammer not only from sending spam to EarthLink customers, but also from sending spam to the customers of any other ISP.
We urge other ISPs to do likewise in their suits against spammers.
Obviously, this case was brought successfully without specific anti-spam legislation.
Rather, we relied on a combination of laws including federal statutes such as RICO and the ECPA, state statutes such as the Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act, fairly new laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and time-tested notions of common law such as trespass and conversion.
In all, our complaint against Carmack included 14 counts.
This is not to say that federal anti-spam legislation is unneeded, rather that it should supplement and strengthen the legal recourse available today to ISPs and other parties.
A postscript:
Based on information developed in EarthLink's civil case against Carmack, the New York Attorney General subsequently filed criminal charges against him for identity theft, landing him in jail.
We believe this to be the first time that anti-spam litigation has also led to a criminal arrest of a spammer.
Technology Solutions Perhaps the most promising front in the fight against spam is the implementation of technology solutions.
EarthLink and other ISPs have until now generally relied on filtering software to limit the amount of spam their customers receive.
EarthLink's filtering systems, known as spaminator, filters out 70-80% of all junk e-mail before it ever gets to a customer's computer.
Spaminator also provides users with customizable tools they can use to further reduce unwanted emails in their inboxes.
It is possible to increase the sensitivity of filters such as spaminator, but you then begin to run the risk of filtering out messages from legitimate senders which an e-mail user wants to receive.
Filtering technology has worked well until recently.
Eighty percent (80%) effectiveness was fine in filtering through a few dozen spam messages a day.
But as the volume of spam has increased 5-fold in the past 18 months, Internet users are now bombarded with sometimes hundreds of messages a day.
An 80% effectiveness filter therefore lets through an increasingly unacceptable number of spam messages.
Enter SpamBlocker, EarthLink's new challenge-response e-mail system.
Developed at EarthLink, spamBlocker presents a new way to give customers control over their inboxes.
Unlike filters, which default to letting through email except for the messages they filter out, spamBlocker keeps all messages "outside the gate" of a user's inbox, letting in only those messages from recognized senders.
SpamBlocker allows a user to import their address book of valid senders and to quickly and easily add names to that list.
Rather than only eliminating email from unknown sources it holds these messages in a Suspect E-mail folder allowing the recipient to review and accept the messages they wish to receive.
SpamBlocker also sends the sender a one-time easy to complete Allowed Sender Request Form.
Able to be completed in several seconds by an actual person, it will not be usable by an automated email program or be able to be filled out at all where, as is often the case, a spammer fakes the IP address which is the source of his spam.
SpamBlocker will virtually eliminate spam in a user's in-box and is available free to all EarthLink subscribers.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today.
