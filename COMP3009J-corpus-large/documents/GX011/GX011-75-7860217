* Environment--home, work, school, or community can provide barriers to or opportunities for an active lifestyle.

What does CDC recommend to help people lose weight?
* The safest and most effective way to lose weight is to reduce calories and increase physical activity.
It is best to consult with your personal physician or health care professional for advice to meet your needs.
* Government research and recommendations can provide the facts based on science so that people can make informed choices about appropriate weight loss.
The fact is the majority of people who are attempting weight loss are not using the correct method to achieve or maintain positive results.
