BEFORE: LOUIS SCALZO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE
DECISION
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
THIS CASE AROSE AS AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, 92 STAT. 1191, 5 U.S.C. 7101 ET SEQ., (HEREINAFTER CALLED "THE STATUTE") AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ISSUED THEREUNDER.
THE COMPLAINT, AS AMENDED, ALLEGED THAT ON MARCH 30, 1980, THE RESPONDENT, THROUGH BOBBIE R. PEACOCK, CHIEF INSPECTOR (CI), PORT OF ATLANTA, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, /1/ VIOLATED SECTIONS 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE BY COUNSELING, AND FILING A RECORD OF COUNSELING, OF ALBERT MARCANTONIO, A CUSTOMS INSPECTOR ASSIGNED TO THE PORT OF ATLANTA, AND WHO WAS THEN SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF CHAPTER 177, OF THE NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION (HEREINAFTER CALLED "THE UNION" AND "CHARGING PARTY").
IT WAS ALLEGED THAT THE COUNSELING RELATED TO A MARCH 29, 1980 COMPLAINT MADE BY MARCANTONIO THAT TOO MANY PASSENGERS WERE BEING SENT TO SECONDARY INSPECTION LINES.
/2/
THE RESPONDENT ADMITS THAT CI PEACOCK PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH 30, 1980 COUNSELING SESSION, BUT DENIES VIOLATING SECTION S 7116(A)(1) AND (2).
RESPONDENT ALSO DEFENDS BY ASSERTING THAT MARCANTONIO WAS COUNSELED FOR LEGITIMATE MANAGERIAL PURPOSES.
IN THE POST-HEARING BRIEF FILED BY COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO "RENEW" MOTIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT PRIOR TO AND AT THE OPENING OF THE HEARING.
THESE MOTIONS WERE DENIED (TR. 16-23).
/3/ THE POST-HEARING BRIEF SETS FORTH NOTHING NEW REGARDING ISSUES RELATING TO THE MENTIONED MOTIONS, AND PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DENIALS ENTERED INTO THE RECORD.
ALL PARTIES WERE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND WERE AFFORDED FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, ADDUCE RELEVANT EVIDENCE, AND EXAMINE AND CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES.
POST-HEARING BRIEFS WERE RECEIVED FROM COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE RESPONDENT.
THESE HAVE BEEN DULY CONSIDERED.
BASED UPON THE ENTIRE RECORD HEREIN, INCLUDING MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, THE EXHIBITS AND OTHER RELEVANT EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, AND THE BRIEFS, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION:
FINDING OF FACT
ROLE OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO
THE UNION IS THE EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF CUSTOMS INSPECTORS EMPLOYED AT THE PORT OF ATLANTA, ATLANTA, GEORGIA.
INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO HAS HELD THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF CHAPTER 177 OF THE UNION FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS.
AS PRESIDENT HE IS THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN FOR THE BARGAINING UNIT.
HIS DUTIES INVOLVE PROCESSING AND PRESENTING WRITTEN AND ORAL BARGAINING UNIT COMPLAINTS TO MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS EMPLOYED BY THE RESPONDENT (TR. 36-37, 208).
COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE RESPONDENT STIPULATED THAT PEACOCK KNEW THAT MARCANTONIO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION (TR. 33), AND THAT HE WAS VERY ACTIVE AS A UNION OFFICER (TR. 50).
HOWEVER, SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION WORK PERFORMED BY MARCANTONIO WILL BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE FACTUAL SITUATION PRESENTED PRIOR TO THE COUNSELING SESSION UNDERLYING ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT.
THE RECORD ESTABLISHED THAT MARCANTONIO HAD WRITTEN TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN HIS CAPACITY AS A UNION OFFICER IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLAINTS; THAT HE DEALT OFTEN WITH CI PEACOCK AND OTHER HIGHER MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS IN THE CUSTOMS SERVICE IN CONNECTION WITH UNION BUSINESS; THAT HE HAD, AS A UNION OFFICIAL, COMPLAINED THAT PEACOCK AND PORT DIRECTOR KENNETH ANDERBERG WERE THE SOURCE OF MORALE PROBLEM AT THE PORT OF ATLANTA; THAT MARCANTONIO WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN FEBRUARY 1980 NEGOTIATIONS LEADING TO EFFECTUATION OF A POLICY CHANGE ON MARCH 3, 1980, WHEREBY CI PEACOCK'S AUTHORITY TO SCHEDULE OVERTIME FOR CUSTOMS INSPECTORS WAS LIMITED SUBSTANTIALLY; THAT ON MARCH 26, 1980 HE REQUESTED THAT THE PORT DIRECTOR NEGOTIATE CONCERNING A "TACTICAL ENFORCEMENT TEAM," AND THAT ON MARCH 27, 1980, THE POST DIRECTOR ACKNOWLEDGED THE REQUEST AND AGREED TO NEGOTIATE; THAT HE HAD RECRUITED UNION MEMBERS; AND THAT HE CONDUCTED UNION MEETINGS AS NEEDED.
IT WAS MARCANTONIO'S PRACTICE TO ADVISE MANAGEMENT WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING IN A PERSONAL AS DISTINCT FROM A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY (TR. 134-135).
ON MARCH 29, 1980.
THE DAY ON WHICH EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE COUNSELING OCCURRED, AND PRIOR TO SUCH EVENTS, MARCANTONIO MET WITH CI PEACOCK CONCERNING CERTAIN COMPLAINTS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT OF OVERTIME WORK (TR. 68-69).
ON MARCH 30, 1980, PRIOR TO THE COUNSELING SESSION, MARCANTONIO AGAIN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE UNION'S SPOKESMAN, CONVERSED WITH PEACOCK CONCERNING A DISPUTE RELATING TO AN OVERTIME CLAIM (TR. 69-70.)
/4/
DUTIES OF CUSTOMS INSPECTORS OUTLINED
MARCANTONIO'S DUTIES AS A CUSTOMS INSPECTOR INCLUDED THE INSPECTION OF PASSENGERS AND LUGGAGE AT THE DELTA INTERNATIONAL ARRIVAL BUILDING (DIAB) IN THE PORT OF ATLANTA.
THE CUSTOMS SERVICE UTILIZES THE CUSTOMS ACCELERATED PASSENGER INSPECTION SYSTEM (CAPIS) AT THIS FACILITY, AND HAS DONE SO SINCE ABOUT MAY OF 1978.
A NUMBER OF CONFIGURATIONS OF CAPIS ARE USED BY THE CUSTOMS SERVICE.
ALL INVOLVE THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRIMARY INSPECTORS AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS.
AT THE DIAB THE SERVICE USES MODULES WITH TWO PRIMARY INSPECTORS AND TWO SECONDARY INSPECTORS.
EACH SECONDARY INSPECTOR IS LOCATED DIRECTLY BEHIND A PRIMARY INSPECTOR, AND THEY ARE USUALLY SEPARATED BY DISTANCES OF ABOUT EIGHT TO TWENTY-FIVE FEET.
VISUAL CONTACT OF THE SECONDARY INSPECTOR BY THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR IS POSSIBLE IF THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE THE SECONDARY INSPECTOR (TR. 191).
PASSENGERS ARE FIRST DIRECTED TO PRIMARY INSPECTORS WHO EXAMINE THEIR DOCUMENTS (PASSPORT, DECLARATION AND AIRLINE TICKET), AND MAKE AN INITIAL CUSTOMS EXAMINATION.
PRIMARY INSPECTION MAY COMPLETE THE INSPECTION PROCESS ENTIRELY, OR REFER THE PASSENGER BACK TO A SECONDARY INSPECTOR FOR MORE DETAILED PROCESSING AS APPROPRIATE.
IN SUCH CASES THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR CODES PASSENGER DECLARATIONS TO OWING, POSSESSION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCE, OR OTHER REASON WARRANTING A MORE INTENSIVE SEARCH).
THE SECONDARY INSPECTOR THEN COMPLETES THE PROCESSING OF THE PASSENGER.
UNDER CAPIS THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR HAS AUTHORITY TO REFER PASSENGERS BACK FOR INITIAL PROCESSING IF A SECONDARY INSPECTOR IS NOT OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN THE INSPECTION PROCESS.
IF THE SECONDARY INSPECTOR HAS A PROBLEM ON HIS LINE, THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR WOULD NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO REFER PASSENGERS BACK FOR INITIAL INSPECTION WORK (TR. 279).
ORDINARILY, THERE IS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE INSPECTION PROCESS.
IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR HAS AUTHORITY TO REFER PASSENGERS TO A SECONDARY INSPECTOR FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED, BUT THE SECONDARY HAS NO AUTHORITY TO REFER THEM BACK TO THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR (TR. 146-147).
THAT IS, THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL THE WORKFLOW (TR. 147, 247-249).
THE TESTIMONY OF SUPERVISORY CUSTOMS INSPECTOR (SCI) RICHARD HORTON ESTABLISHED THAT A PRIMARY INSPECTOR COULD OVERLOAD A SECONDARY INSPECTOR, AND THAT THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR SHOULD BE VISUALLY OBSERVING THE WORKFLOW TO INSURE THAT SECONDARY INSPECTORS ARE NOT SENT TOO MANY PASSENGERS TO PROCESS (TR. 386-387).
HE ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS WERE PAID AT THE SAME GRADE LEVEL, AND THAT IT WOULD BE HIS FUNCTION TO SPEAK TO A PRIMARY INSPECTOR WHO WAS KNOWINGLY SENDING TOO MANY PASSENGERS TO A SECONDARY INSPECTOR FOR PROCESSING (TR. 389).
DUTIES PERFORMED UNDER CAPIS AT THE RESPONDENT'S ATLANTA LOCATION ARE SUPERVISED BY CI PEACOCK, AND FIRST LINE SCI'S HORTON AND ROBERT J. COWAN.
THESE THREE ARE IN TURN SUPERVISED BY KENNETH A. ANDERBERG, DIRECTOR, OF THE PORT OF ATLANTA.
PEACOCK'S TESTIMONY ESTABLISHED THAT HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING AWARE OF WORK ACTIVITY BEING DIRECTLY SUPERVISED BY HORTON AND COWAN, AND THAT HE IS OFTEN PRESENT DURING THE PROCESSING OF PASSENGERS (TR. 170, 190).
OVERLOADING OF SECONDARY INSPECTORS REPORTED TO SCI HORTON AND TO INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO
IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF 1980, PRIOR TO EVENTS LEADING TO THE COUNSELING SESSION, CUSTOMS INSPECTOR JACK BROOKS REPORTED TO SCI HORTON THAT CUSTOMS INSPECTOR PATRICIA MCCANTS, WHILE ACTING AS A PRIMARY INSPECTOR, IMPROPERLY REFERRED TOO MANY PASSENGERS TO HIM FOR INITIAL INSPECTION WHEN HE WAS ACTING IN A SECONDARY POSITION (TR. 182-183, 194).
THIS CAUSED CONGESTION IN HIS LINE (TR. 203).
HE WAS INSTRUCTED BY HORTON TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH MCCANTS.
HE DID SO, BUT WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN HER COOPERATION (TR. 183, 187).
BROOKS REPORTED HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN COOPERATION TO THE UNION THROUGH MARCANTONIO BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BY TALKING TO HORTON AND MCCANTS (TR. 183-184, 189-190).
BROOKS CONTINUED TO HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH MCCANTS AFTER HIS MEETING WITH HER (TR. 190).
DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD CUSTOMS INSPECTOR BETH CRAIG EXPERIENCED A PASSENGER FLOODING OF HER SECONDARY POSITION AS A RESULT OF REFERRALS FROM MCCANTS' PRIMARY INSPECTION POSITION (TR. 209).
SHE COMPLAINED TO HORTON, WHO RESPONDED BY EXPLAINING IN GENERAL TERMS HOW THE CAPIS PROCEDURE WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION (TR. 361-362).
HORTON DID NOT ADVISE CRAIG TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS ABOUT THE PROBLEM (TR. 389).
INSTEAD, HORTON TOOK THE INITIATIVE AFTER RECEIVING CRAIG'S COMMENTS AND SPOKE DIRECTLY TO MCCANTS THAT SAME DAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELAYING CRAIG'S COMPLAINT (TR. 389).
/5/ CRAIG ALSO REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO MARCANTONIO BECAUSE HE WAS THE UNION PRESIDENT AND SHE DID NOT FEEL THAT SHE COULD DO A SATISFACTORY JOB IN THE SECONDARY POSITION IF MCCANTS REFERRED TOO MANY PASSENGERS TO THE SECONDARY POSITION (TR. 210).
IN ADDITION TO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM CRAIG AND BROOKS RELATIVE TO THE METHOD USED BY MCCANTS TO REFER PASSENGERS TO SECONDARY INSPECTORS, MARCANTONIO RECEIVED A SIMILAR COMPLAINT FROM CUSTOMS INSPECTOR ROGER MOYER, AND ALSO OTHER EARLIER COMPLAINTS OF THIS SAME NATURE (TR. 62-63).
INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO REPORTS COMPLAINT RELATING TO OVERLOADING SECONDARY INSPECTORS
SOMETIME IN FEBRUARY OF 1980 MARCANTONIO REPORTED TO SCI COWAN, DETAILS OF BARGAINING UNIT MEMBER COMPLAINTS WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED TO THE EFFECT THAT MCCANTS WAS OVERLOADING SECONDARY INSPECTORS (TR. 65-66).
MARCANTONIO WAS NOT INSTRUCTED TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS CONCERNING THE PROBLEM (TR. 110).
SCI COWAN'S TESTIMONY WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE; HOWEVER, HE FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIPT OF SUCH INFORMATION FROM MARCANTONIO PRIOR TO EVENTS RELATING TO THE COUNSELING, AND THE FACT THAT HE ADVISED MARCANTONIO THAT HE (COWAN) "WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT," AND FURTHER THAT HE "WOULD TALK TO (MCCANTS) ABOUT."
(TR. 331).
HIS TESTIMONY ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT HE DID IN FACT SPEAK TO MCCANTS ABOUT THE PROBLEM (TR. 334, 344-345).
/6/
EVENTS RELATING TO COUNSELING OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO
ON MARCH 29, 1980, THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO THE COUNSELING SESSION OCCURRED.
WHILE MARCANTONIO WAS WORKING A CAPIS MODULE ON A SECONDARY POSITION DIRECTLY BEHIND MCCANTS, A NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE REFERRED TO MARCANTONIO BY MCCANTS CAUSING MARCANTONIO'S LINE TO BECOME CONGESTED (TR. 66-67).
MARCANTONIO SUMMONED SCI HORTON OVER TO HIS POSITION, AND COMPLAINED TO SCI COWAN (TR. 67).
CI PEACOCK WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME MARCANTONIO COMPLAINED (TR. 67, 119).
/7/ MARCANTONIO'S SECONDARY POSITION WAS THEN ABOUT TEN FEET AWAY FROM MCCANTS, AND SHE COULD HAVE EASILY OBSERVED MARCANTONIO'S WORK SITUATION (TR. 302-303).
IN RESPONSE TO MARCANTONIO'S COMPLAINT, HORTON AND PEACOCK EXPLAINED TO MARCANTONIO IN GENERAL TERMS THE NEED FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS TO COOPERATE AND COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER (TR. 67, 297), AND ALSO, SUGGESTED THAT MARCANTONIO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH MCCANTS (TR. 117-118).
/8/ IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PEACOCK WAS NOT PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE FACTS RELATING TO MCCANTS' REFERRAL OF PASSENGERS TO MARCANTONIO; HOWEVER, HE RECOGNIZED THAT MARCANTONIO COULD HAVE BEEN FACING A PROBLEM WARRANTING SUPERVISORY ATTENTION (TR. 306, 309-310).
MARCANTONIO EXPLAINED THAT HE (MARCANTONIO) WAS NOT SUPERVISOR, THAT HE AND MCCANTS WERE BOTH JOURNEYMEN INSPECTORS, THAT HE HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER MCCANTS, AND THAT IT WAS A MATTER FOR A SUPERVISOR TO HANDLE (TR. 66-67, 118).
PEACOCK AND HORTON CONTINUED TO EXPLAIN THAT CAPIS REQUIRED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS.
MARCANTONIO DID NOT RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH COWAN AND COWAN SAID HE WOULD ATTEND TO THE PROBLEM; BECAUSE MCCANTS HAD BEEN UNRESPONSIVE IN THE PAST; BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HORTON WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS A RESULT OF PRIOR COMPLAINTS; BECAUSE HE FELT SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE FUTILE; AND BECAUSE HE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT ONLY A SUPERVISOR COULD PROVIDE A REMEDY (TR. 138-140).
PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE DISCUSSION PEACOCK LEFT HORTON AND MARCANTONIO AS THEY CONTINUED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER (TR. 297).
ON MARCH 30, 1980, AFTER MARCANTONIO HAD A DISCUSSION WITH PEACOCK CONCERNING THE OVERTIME QUESTION, PEACOCK ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING TO COUNSEL MARCANTONIO CONCERNING TWO INCIDENTS WHICH HAD OCCURRED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY, THAT IS, THE FAILURE TO MEET AN INCOMING FLIGHT AND THE MARCH 29, 1980 DISCUSSION THAT HORTON AND PEACOCK HAD WITH MARCANTONIO CONCERNING MCCANTS' REFERRAL OF TOO MANY PASSENGERS TO MARCANTONIO WHILE HE WAS FUNCTIONING AS A SECONDARY INSPECTOR.
WITH RESPECT TO THE LATER PORTION OF THE COUNSELING, THE ONLY ELEMENT PLACED IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE, PEACOCK PREPARED A MEMORANDUM FOR MARCANTONIO'S PERSONNEL FILE.
IT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:
3/30/80 . . .
IN THE PRESENCE OF SCI COWAN I COUNSELED INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO REGARDING THE
INCIDENT AT THE DELTA IAB RE: HIS COMPLAINT THAT INSPECTOR MCCANTS WAS PUTTING TOO MANY
PASSENGERS ON HIS SECONDARY COUNTER AND HIS INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER.
I EXPLAINED TO
MARCANTONIO HOW WE WANTED THE COUNTERS TO OPERATE.
I EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO
MOVE PASSENGERS THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO SEE AND TO TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS WE WANTED WITH THOSE
THAT WE WANTED TO SEE AND IF A SECONDARY INSPECTOR WAS TIED UP WITH A PASSENGER IT WAS HIS
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY THE PRIMARY INSPECTOR . . .
THE RECORD DISCLOSED THAT SCI COWAN WAS PRESENT AS A WITNESS THROUGHOUT THE COUNSELING (TR. 283-284,347), AND FURTHER THAT COWAN WAS AWARE OF WHAT WAS OCCURRING (TR. 349).
IN A SOMEWHAT ANGRY VOICE (TR. 71, 168), CI PEACOCK INFORMED MARCANTONIO THAT HIS RELUCTANCE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS REGARDING HER REFERRAL OF AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS TO HIS POSITION WAS AN INDICATION OF A FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND CAPIS PROCEDURES; THAT COOPERATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS WERE ESSENTIAL AND THAT THE FAILURE ON MARCANTONIO'S PART TO PERCEIVE AN OBLIGATION TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS EXHIBITED INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE ON HIS PART (TR. 329).
MARCANTONIO EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD, AS UNION PRESIDENT, PREVIOUSLY RAISED THE MATTER WITH SCI COWAN (TR. 70).
HE THEN TURNED TO COWAN AND REQUESTED HIM TO VERIFY THE PRIOR CONVERSATION WHEREIN MARCANTONIO HAD COMPLAINED ON BEHALF OF OTHER INSPECTORS (TR. 70, 125).
COWAN ACKNOWLEDGED IN PEACOCK'S PRESENCE THAT MARCANTONIO HAD PREVIOUSLY RAISED THE SUBJECT WITH HIM (TR. 70, 125).
MARCANTONIO ALSO ASKED "HOW MANY TIMES CAN (RESPONDENT) BE TOLD ABOUT A SITUATION AND BY HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS."
(TR. 54).
PEACOCK ACKNOWLEDGED THAT DURING THE COUNSELING MARCANTONIO AGAIN INFORMED HIM THAT OTHER INSPECTORS HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT MCCANTS "STACKING UP THE LINES."
(TR. 169).
HE ALSO ADMITTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED RECEIPT OF A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WARRANTING HIS INTERVENTION (TR. 171-172).
/9/
PEACOCK'S TESTIMONY ESTABLISHED THAT HE FELT MARCANTONIO'S SHORTCOMING TO BE A "SERIOUS MATTER" (TR. 288-289), AND FURTHER THAT MARCANTONIO'S CONDUCT COULD HAVE BEEN CONSTRUED AS "POOR PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY OR UNSUBORDINATION OR A DISCIPLINARY TYPE MATTER."
(TR. 287).
HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME HE ADMITTED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE COUNSELING HE STILL DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER HE LEFT HORTON AND MARCANTONIO ON DECEMBER 29TH (TR. 297-298); THAT HE DID NOT INVESTIGATE THE FACTS SURROUNDING THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MCCANTS, ALTHOUGH HE ORDINARILY DID SO BEFORE COUNSELING EMPLOYEES; AND THAT MCCANTS' CONDUCT COULD HAVE PRESENTED A SPECIAL PROBLEM OBVIATING THE NEED FOR ANY EFFORT ON MARCANTONIO'S PART (TR. 307-309).
PEACOCK ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE DID NOT ASK FOR MARCANTONIO'S SIDE OF THE STORY PRIOR TO COUNSELING HIM (TR. 311).
IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT IF EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR AT RESPONDENT'S ACTIVITY IS DEEMED A "SERIOUS" PROBLEM AND COUNSELING OCCURS, A REPORT IS PREPARED AND RETAINED IN THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL FILE (TR. 162).
ONLY RECORDATIONS OF "SERIOUS COUNSELING" ARE FILED.
IN THIS CASE CI PEACOCK CAUSED THE RECORD OF THE COUNSELING TO BE FILED IN MARCANTONIO'S PERSONNEL FILE. /10/ PERSONNEL FILES ARE REGULARLY USED FOR PURPOSES OF WORK APPRAISALS, PROMOTIONS, AWARDS, AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION (TR. 162).
CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO EVALUATION OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO'S WORK PERFORMANCE
THE RECORD DISCLOSED THAT INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMS SERVICE FOR SEVEN YEARS, THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WHICH HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE PORT OF ATLANTA (TR. 35-36, 79).
HE HAS WORKED ON CAPIS MODULES SINCE THE PROCEDURE WAS INTRODUCED IN MID 1978 (TR. 269), OR FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO YEARS (TR. 62).
CI PEACOCK'S TESTIMONY CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT RESPONDENT'S REPRESENTATIVES RECEIVED NO EVIDENCE THAT MARCANTONIO DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE CAPIS PROCEDURES PRIOR TO MARCH 29, 1980, AND THAT NO PRIOR FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE WAS EVER OBSERVED OR NOTED (TR. 269-270).
PRIOR TO MARCH 30, 1980, MARCANTONIO HAD NEVER BEEN COUNSELED FOR A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE OR FOR FAILURE TO WORK CAPIS PROPERLY (TR. 131, 168).
CI PEACOCK STATED THAT HE NEVER HAD ANY PRIOR PROBLEM WITH MARCANTONIO BEFORE THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION, AND THAT HE NEVER HAD TO MAKE A RECORD OF THIS NATURE FOR HIS PERSONNEL FILE (TR. 169).
APPROXIMATELY THREE WEEKS AFTER THE MARCH 30, 1980 COUNSELING, SCI'S COWAN AND HORTON AND CI PEACOCK COMPLETED AN APPRAISAL OF MARCANTONIO'S PERFORMANCE FOR A ONE YEAR PERIOD WHICH INCLUDED MARCH 29-30, 1980 (G.C. EXH. 9).
IT REFLECTED NO REFERENCE TO MARCANTONIO'S FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE, NOR WAS HE DOWNGRADED IN ANY WAY FOR THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT.
IN WORK APPRAISAL CATEGORIES RELATING TO ADAPTABILITY, QUALITY OF WORK, AND TACT, HE RECEIVED A "5," THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE GRADE, WHICH INDICATED THAT HE EXCELLED IN EVERY SITUATION RELEVANT TO THESE FACTORS.
HE WAS RATED AT THE "4" LEVEL, OR THE NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL, IN CATEGORIES RELATING TO ATTITUDE, RESPONSIBILITY, JOB KNOWLEDGE, WORK PRODUCTION, LEARNING ABILITY, ORAL COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CUSTOMS.
THE "4" LEVEL INDICATED THAT HE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO A DEGREE CLEARLY ABOVE THAT EXPECTED FOR COMPETENCE.
/11/ THE RECORD REFLECTED THAT MARCANTONIO WAS ALSO GIVEN A WITHIN GRADE INCREASE IN PAY SHORTLY AFTER THE MARCH 29-30, 1980 PERIOD (R. EXH. 7).
CI PEACOCK SIGNED THE AUTHORIZATION ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(2) THERE MUST BE A SHOWING THAT THE ALLEGED DISCRIMINATEE WAS ENGAGING IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY, THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH ACTIVITY, AND THAT THE RESPONDENT TOOK ACTION AGAINST THE DISCRIMINATEE BECAUSE OF ANTI-UNION ANIMUS.
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, 1 FLRA NO. 120 (SEPTEMBER 28, 1979); VETERANS ADMINISTRATION CENTER, LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS, 1 FLRA NO. 111 (SEPTEMBER 20, 1979); U.S. CUSTOMS SERVICE, REGION IV, MIAMI, FLORIDA, 1 FLRA NO. 108 (SEPTEMBER 13, 1979).
THE ELEMENT OF DISCRIMINATORY MOTIVATION NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A SECTION 7116(A)(2) VIOLATION MAY BE INFERRED FROM CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
U.S. CUSTOMS SERVICE, REGION IV, MIAMI, FLORIDA, SUPRA; VETERANS ADMINISTRATION CENTER, LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS, SUPRA.
IN THIS CASE THE EPISODE GIVING RISE TO THE COUNSELING IN ISSUE AROSE DIRECTLY OUT OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO'S EFFORTS AS A UNION OFFICIAL REPRESENTING BARGAINING UNIT MEMBERS.
IN FEBRUARY OF 1980 HE INTERPOSED A COMPLAINT RELATING TO MCCANTS' REPEATED REFERRAL OF AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS TO SECONDARY INSPECTORS.
HIS MENTION OF THE MATTER OF MARCH 29, 1980 TO CI PEACOCK AND SCI HORTON WAS MERELY A REITERATION OF HIS EARLIER COMPLAINT.
ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL COMPLAINT WAS LODGED WITH SCI COWAN, THE RECORD REFLECTS THAT SIMILAR COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN LODGED WITH SCI HORTON BY OTHER BARGAINING UNIT MEMBERS, AND THAT ON MARCH 30, 1980 SCI COWAN AND CI PEACOCK ACTED JOINTLY DURING THE COUNSELING OF MARCANTONIO.
THUS, THE RECORD MAKES IT CLEAR THAT MARCANTONIO WAS ENGAGING IN PROTECTED UNION ACTIVITY WHEN HE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT WITH CI PEACOCK AND SCI HORTON ON MARCH 29, 1980, AND WHEN HE DISCUSSED IT AGAIN WITH CI PEACOCK AND SCI COWAN ON MARCH 30, 1980.
OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE RECORD INDICATE THAT THE RESPONDENT'S REPRESENTATIVES WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE AWARE OF MARCANTONIO'S ROLE IN EFFORTS TO REMEDY COMPLAINTS AGAINST MCCANTS.
THE NATURE OF MARCANTONIO'S UNION ACTIVITY GENERALLY WAS WELL KNOWN, AND INVOLVED CONTACTS WITH CI PEACOCK ON MARCH 29 AND 30, 1980, PRIOR TO DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM RELATING TO INSPECTOR MCCANTS.
ALTHOUG4 UNNECESSARY TO RELY UPON INFERENCES JUSTIFYING A FINDING THAT SCI COWAN ACTUALLY APPRISED CI PEACOCK OF MARCANTONIO'S PRIOR COMPLAINT BEFORE MARCH 29, 1980, SCI COWAN'S TESTIMONY GIVES RISE TO THE POSSIBILITY.
MOREOVER, IT WAS CLEARLY CI PEACOCK'S DUTY TO BE AWARE OF PROBLEMS OF THIS NATURE, AND CI PEACOCK WAS OFTEN IN THE WORK AREA WHERE CAPIS PROCEDURES WERE BEING UTILIZED.
MARCANTONIO'S ACT OF INVITING ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM POSED BY MCCANTS' CONDUCT PRECIPITATED A PATTERN OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN OPPOSITION TO HIS BRINGING THE MATTER TO THE ATTENTION OF THE RESPONDENT.
A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE RECORD DISCLOSES NUMEROUS REASONS FOR CONCLUDING THAT THE BASIS FOR CI PEACOCK'S DECISION TO COUNSEL MARCANTONIO WAS PRETEXTUAL IN NATURE.
ALTHOUGH INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO WAS CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS, SCI COWAN AND SCI HORTON HAD BOTH PREVIOUSLY DEEMED THE PROBLEM TO BE OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO JUSTIFY THEIR OWN DIRECT PERSONAL INTERVENTION.
THIS WAS MANIFESTED BY THEM SPEAKING TO MCCANTS ABOUT THE MATTER.
IT WAS BROUGHT OUT THAT ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE SEPARATED THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INSPECTORS, AND THAT MCCANTS WOULD HAVE, AT LEAST IN THE CAPIS MODULE INVOLVED HERE, BEEN IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THAT SECONDARY INSPECTORS WERE BEING REFERRED TOO MANY PASSENGERS.
THUS THE NEED FOR COMMUNICATION IN THIS INSTANCE WAS AT LEAST GROSSLY EXAGGERATED ON NON-EXISTENT.
THE NATURE OF AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON PRIMARY INSPECTORS BY THE RESPONDENT INDICATED THAT THEY, AND NOT SECONDARY INSPECTORS, WERE PERMITTED TO CONTROL THE WORKFLOW, AND THAT IT WAS THEIR TASK TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT SECONDARIES WERE NOT OVERBURDENED.
FURTHER, THE SECONDARY INSPECTORS WERE OF THE SAME GRADE LEVEL AS THE PRIMARY INSPECTORS, AND WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO BECOME INVOLVED IN CASES WHEREIN A PRIMARY INSPECTOR KNOWINGLY WAS ACTING IMPROPERLY.
THE RECORD HERE REFLECTS AN ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT SUCH WAS IN FACT THE CASE, AND FURTHER THAT RESPONDENT'S REPRESENTATIVES HAD IN FACT TRIED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM BEFORE MARCH 29TH.
EVIDENCE OF THE PRETEXTUAL BASIS FOR THE COUNSELING INVOLVED IS ALSO REFLECTED BY PEACOCK'S UNUSUAL FAILURE TO GATHER FACTS ABOUT THE MATTER BEFORE COUNSELING MARCANTONIO, ALTHOUGH HE REGULARLY DID SO IN SUCH CASES; BY HIS OWN ADMISSION THAT MARCANTONIO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN FACING A PROBLEM FALLING WITHIN PEACOCK'S SUPERVISORY PURVIEW; AND BY THE SUBSEQUENT HIGH PERFORMANCE RATING RECEIVED BY MARCANTONIO DESPITE PEACOCK'S PROTESTATIONS THAT MARCANTONIO'S SHORTCOMINGS WERE SERIOUS IN NATURE.
BASED UPON THE KNOWLEDGE OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO'S UNION ACTIVITY, THE TIMING OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST HIM, AND THE LACK OF ANY CREDIBLE AND PERSUASIVE REASON THEREFOR, IT IS, DETERMINED THAT CI PEACOCK'S COUNSELING OF INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO WAS MOTIVATED SOLELY BY ANTI-UNION CONSIDERATIONS AND TAKEN AS A REPRISAL AND RETALIATION FOR HIS UNION ACTIVITY.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE CONDUCT OF CI PEACOCK CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(2) OF THE STATUTE.
SINCE ANY VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A) OTHER THAN SECTION 7116(A)(1), NECESSARILY TENDS TO INTERFERE WITH, RESTRAIN, OR COERCE EMPLOYEES IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE STATUTE, THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED IS ALSO A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1).
HAVING FOUND THAT THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTIONS 7116(A)(1) AND (2) IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE AUTHORITY ISSUE THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ORDERS THAT THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE, REGION IV, MIAMI, FLORIDA SHALL:

THE RESPONDENT.
(B) IN ANY LIKE OR RELATED MANNER INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING OR COERCING EMPLOYEES IN
THEIR RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE.
2.

(A) REMOVE OR EXPUNGE FROM ITS FILES THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF THE MARCH 30, 1980

WE WILL REMOVE OR EXPUNGE FROM OUR FILES THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF THE MARCH 30, 1980 RECORD OF COUNSELING EXECUTED BY CHIEF INSPECTOR BOBBIE R. PEACOCK IN CONNECTION WITH HIS MARCH 30, 1980 COUNSELING OF ALBERT MARCANTONIO.
(AGENCY OR ACTIVITY)
DATED:
BY: (SIGNATURE)
THIS NOTICE MUST REMAIN POSTED FOR 60 CONSECUTIVE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF POSTING AND MUST NOT BE ALTERED, DEFACED, OR COVERED BY ANY OTHER MATERIALS.
IF EMPLOYEES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS NOTICE OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY OF ITS PROVISIONS, THEY MAY COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, WHOSE ADDRESS IS: SUITE 501, 1776 PEACHTREE STREET, N.W., NORTH WING, ATLANTA, GEORGIA 30309, AND WHOSE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS: (404) 881-2324.
--------------- FOOTNOTES: ---------------
/1/ THE EVENTS OCCURRING HEREIN RELATE TO ACTIVITY AT RESPONDENT'S ATLANTA, GEORGIA LOCATION IN REGION IV.
/2/ DURING THE SAME COUNSELING SESSION MARCANTONIO WAS ALSO CRITICIZED FOR FAILURE TO MEET AN INCOMING FLIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERFORMING INSPECTION DUTIES.
HOWEVER, COUNSEL FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL DOES NOT QUESTION THIS ELEMENT OF RESPONDENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AND SEEKS NO REMEDY REGARDING THIS FACET OF THE COUNSELING (TR. 32, 78-79).
/3/ HEREINAFTER REFERENCES TO THE TRANSCRIPT WILL BE DESIGNATED "TR. ," AND REFERENCES TO EXHIBITS WILL BE DESIGNATED "G.C. EXH.
" OR "R. EXH. ."
/4/ PEACOCK TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO RECALL THE MARCH 29 AND 30, 1980 CONVERSATIONS RELATING TO UNION BUSINESS.
HOWEVER, WITH REGARD TO THE MARCH 29TH CONVERSATION, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT COULD HAVE OCCURRED (TR. 159-160).
/5/ HORTON EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT FEEL THAT CRAIG SHOULD HAVE BEEN COUNSELED FOR NOT COMMUNICATING HER COMPLAINT DIRECTLY TO MCCANTS BECAUSE CRAIG WAS A NEW CUSTOMS INSPECTOR (TR. 374).
HOWEVER, AS NOTED, HORTON DID NOT INSTRUCT CRAIG TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS, AND FURTHER HE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF SUFFICIENT CONCERN TO WARRANT HIS OWN INTERVENTION AS A SUPERVISOR.
THUS, HORTON'S TESTIMONY THAT CRAIG WAS INVOLVED IN POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT STEMMING FROM A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MCCANTS IN THIS SITUATION IS DEEMED DISCREDITED BY PEACOCK'S OWN TESTIMONY.
/6/ HE NOTED THAT THIS WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE MARCANTONIO WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISRUPTIVE TO THE INSPECTION PROCEDURE IF MARCANTONIO WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE HIS SECONDARY POSITION TO SPEAK TO MCCANTS (TR. 333-334, 351).
HOWEVER, IT ALSO APPEARED THAT HE DEEMED IT A MATTER OF SUPERVISORY CONCERN (TR. 345, 348).
/7/ PEACOCK ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS THEN AWARE THAT MARCANTONIO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION (TR. 287).
/8/ ALTHOUGH CI PEACOCK'S RECORD OF THE MARCH 29, 1980 CONVERSATION INDICATES THAT HORTON "ADVISED" MARCANTONIO TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH MCCANTS (G.C. EXH. 8), THE RECORD REFLECTS THAT THIS WAS NO MORE THAN A GENERAL SUGGESTION, AND FURTHER THAT MARCANTONIO WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO CONFER WITH MCCANTS ABOUT THE MATTER (TR. 117, 130-131).
/9/ COWAN TESTIFIED THAT HE COULD NOT RECALL WHETHER HE ADVISED PEACOCK CONCERNING MARCANTONIO'S PRE-MARCH 29TH COMPLAINT ABOUT MCCANTS (TR. 335).
HE SUBSEQUENTLY SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS NECESSARY AT THAT TIME (TR. 345).
IN HIS FINAL VERSION OF EVENTS HE TESTIFIED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE DISCUSSED THE MCCANTS PROBLEM WITH PEACOCK PRIOR TO THE COUNSELING SESSION (TR. 349-350).
/10/ ONLY PARAGRAPHS ONE AND THREE OF THE RECORD OF COUNSELING RELATE TO THE PORTIONS OF THE COUNSELING SESSION REFERRED TO IN THE COMPLAINT (G.C. EXH. 8).
/11/ INSPECTOR MARCANTONIO'S APPRAISAL FOR THE PRECEDING YEAR WAS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME IN ALL CATEGORIES (TR. 152-153, 290-291).
