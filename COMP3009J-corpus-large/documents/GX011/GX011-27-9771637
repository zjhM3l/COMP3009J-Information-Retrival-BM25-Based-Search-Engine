The pseudonymous artist Arribas produced this poster for two Spanish labor organizations, Union General de Trabajo and Confederacion Nacional de Trabajo, to express indignation at Franco's foreign-backed aggression.
The Spanish Civil War began on July 17, 1936 as a series of military insurrections throughout the country.
Because the Spanish Civil War was the first major military contest between left-wing forces and Fascists, it has been called the first chapter of World War II.
The Republicans fought to maintain the Republic while the Nationalists sought to restore the monarchy.
Because the Spanish Civil War represented a major threat to international political equilibrium, Americans discussed and watched closely the events of the conflict.
Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Spanish soldiers and civilians died from war or war-engendered disease and starvation and thousands of Spaniards became refugees.
The situation forced many Americans to question America's post-World War I non-interventionist policy.
The Republicans, or Loyalists, received aid from France, the Soviet Union, and Mexico.
Sixty thousand members of the International Brigades, some 2,800 of whom were men and women from the United States, volunteered their services
During the war, the Nationalists received troops, tanks, and planes from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.

I do not understand it.
The Spain I knew years ago was a quiet country, she love' peace.
Her farmers work' the rich fields.
Her artists were proud to make beautiful our big cities an' cathedrals.
We were 22,000,000 people who want only to be left alone - an' now what.
You see beautiful cathedrals all smash' an' buried; the cities in ruin.
A friend of mine, he say the other day that one Spaniard he is killed every nine minutes.
Every nine minutes.
God, that is terrible! More than one million of them lay dead from this war.

The war continued until March 28, 1939, when Nationalist troops, led by General Francisco Franco, overcame the Spanish Republic's forces and entered Madrid.
Just months after the Spanish Civil War ended, England declared war on Germany.
Franco declared Spain a neutral nation during most of the Second World War and sustained a forty-year military dictatorship until his death in 1975.

On July 17, 1754, King's College opened in New York City.
The Anglican academy would later grow into the venerable Columbia University.
The ten students of the college met for their first classes, conducted in Latin and Greek, in a schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church at Broadway and Wall Streets.
The early college educated a number of American patriots and intellectuals including several members of the Continental Congress.
Among its first students and trustees were Robert R. Livingston, a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence; Governeur Morris, author of much of the final wording of the Constitution; and Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, authors of the Federalist Papers.
