Rising to the top Small Wisconsin specialty dairy co-ops finding new niche markets By Pamela J. Karg Editors note: Karg is an agriculture communicator based in Baraboo, Wis., with extensive experience writing about cooperatives.
[greend.jpg] airy co-ops merging to create larger marketing operations has been a major news story of the past decade.
But a number of new, small dairy cooperatives that service niche markets are also popping up in Americas Dairyland.
Their mission can be complex, but their message is simple: gaining a share of a growing dairy market for their members.
In a dairy landscape dominated by such large co-ops as Dairy Farmers of America, Land OLakes, Foremost Farms USA, Associated Milk Producers Inc., Swiss Valley and Alto Dairy, the new Scenic Valley Protein Producers Cooperative is barely a blip on the radar screen.
But what Scenic Valley lacks in size, it makes up for in the dedication of its members.
Started 4 years ago, the membership now includes 11 farm families.
They are primarily colored breed producers.
That is, they milk dairy cows other than the familiar black-and-white Holsteins.
Their president and field representative is Jersey producer Mike Gallagher of Darlington, Wis.
Our goal is to earn more money for our milk, Gallagher explains.
With the cheese yield formula first proposed by the National All-Jersey Association and adopted by the U.S. dairy industry several years ago, we naturally were getting the full-value price for our milk.
When we didnt have that available, we were getting approximately from $1 to $2 a hundredweight less than were getting right now.
[rising1.jpg] The Jersey cow To understand Scenic Valley Co-op, one first needs to understand the Jersey cow.
Compared to the five other major breeds milked in the United States, Jerseys give less milk.
However, their milk is higher in protein and butterfat important ingredients for cheesemakers.
In Wisconsin, 85 percent of the 23 billion pounds (or 2.7 billion gallons) of milk produced on its 18,000 dairy farms goes into producing 300 styles and types of cheese.
That makes cheese king in Americas Dairyland, and it made the colored breed producers believe they had something of value they could capitalize on.
Jersey milk, on average in a Cheddar cheese plant, will yield about 100 to 125 percent per hundredweight of what Holstein milk will yield.
Thus, it is of more value to the plant and so, of course, to the owner, explains Mike Brown, general manager of National All-Jersey, the breeds national association, headquartered in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.
We would meet at night, at least once a week, to brainstorm ideas and discuss business, Gallagher explains.
Finally, we decided it was time to try it.
What the original five families did was contract with a small, privately operated, family-owned cheese plant.
Several times a year, milk from the Jersey producers is picked up and processed separately into cheese.
Once aged, cut and wrapped into consumer sizes, the producers sell the cheese under their own label to retail outlets.
They also offer the Scenic Valley Jersey Cheese products at holiday time, combining it with locally produced sausages and other foods in gift boxes.
The most interesting thing last year, when orders came in, was to see where they came from, Gallagher says.
There were orders coming from all over the United States, and we did it by just telling our co-op story to customers and then putting a brochure in every box we shipped.
[rising2.jpg] Telling its story Gallagher is one of five co-op directors.
The others are Gene Dirksen, vice president, from Darlington; Steve Holland, secretary, from Gratiot; John Foley, Darlington; and Jonathon Primley, Blanchardville.
Like their other four member-farms, none of these five members milk more than about 100 cows.
The members pride themselves on the natural farming methods they use, pasturing or grazing their Jersey cows on green pasture about half the year.
That pasturing gives the cheese made from the milk a more natural flavor, the co-ops brochure explains to consumers.
Cheesemakers agree that milk shipped from different regions of the state or even raised differently grazed vs. confinement puts subtle flavors into the milk.
As cheesemakers, their challenge is to then bring out and enhance those subtle differences to produce something consumers want.
In fact, that is the basis for the growth seen during the past decade in the number of farmstead cheesemaking operations across the United States.
In addition, pasturing or grazing ruminants has also proven healthy for humans who eat their meat or dairy products.
Those products have proven to be higher in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a cancer-fighting good fat discovered by researchers (see related story).
The Scenic Valley families have pledged not to use hormones in their herds.
Neither is animal rennet used to make cheese.
Rennet is the enzyme that makes the milk set up so curds can form.
It occurs naturally in the stomachs of calves and some other animals.
Therefore, Scenic Valleys contracted cheesemaker uses synthetic rennet.
Coop members use only enough pharmaceuticals to keep their herds healthy.
These producers are learning firsthand what large corporations and their public relations and marketing specialists already know: its all about image.
With help from sources such as the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Cooperatives, the producers pulled together their story in a brochure.
The four color piece is printed from a computer owned by the cooperative.
In fact, the co-op is beginning to acquire more assets.
The members recently purchased the old Darlington town hall, which was previously a rural school building.
This summer they will be renovating the town hall into a cheese distribution center.
Theyve also purchased a cooler and trailer so they can sell their cheese at local farmers markets and will make deliveries to a growing list of retail outlets.
Well fix it up and offer our cheeses for sale here, along with other Wisconsin products and maybe even some antiques or gifts, Gallagher explains, leaning against the chalkboard still hanging in the schoolhouse-turnedtown- hall-turned-cooperative.
Last Christmas, gift boxes were put together and mailed from this building.
It beats doing it at their kitchen tables like last year, Gallagher says.
[rising3.jpg] [rising5.jpg]
The cooler was purchased the last day of the going-out-of-business sale held by the local variety store.
The counters also came from there.
Theyve hired one person to help pack gift boxes, while most members donate their time.
The buildings trim could use a coat of paint and some remodeling is needed on the inside.
Between the computer hardware and the building, developing a logo and working with a consultant to write a business plan, the nine dairy farm families havent seen much return on their investments yet.
The co-ops ability to grow is hampered by the fact that the number of dairy farm families in Wisconsin is dropping, though the number of cows milked in the state remains constant at about 1.3 million head.
Still, most Wisconsin dairy producers favor Holsteins over Jerseys.
And members like Gallagher try to do it all run the co-op, negotiate prices with the cheesemaker, pay state required bonding fees to ensure the milk checks are good, make calls on local supermarkets that offer the cheese, talk to other suppliers and distributors who are showing some interest in the Scenic Valley idea and still find time to farm.
Easy? It isnt easy.
Lets put it that way.
But its kind of fun,
Gallagher says of trying to do it all, including marketing the co-ops seven products: Cheddar, Colby, Creamy Jack and Pepper Jack natural cheeses, as well as garlic, plain and jalapeÃ¯Â¿Â½o cheese spreads.
It does take a lot of time and some- times it seems like just bits and pieces here and there.
But a lot of time and contacts and legwork.
Currently, only about 10 percent of total milk production by Scenic Valley members is separated out for production under their own label.
This year, the co-op hopes to create enough demand that members have 50 percent of their milk made into their product.
When they do, theyll improve their possibilities for grabbing a larger share of a growing national cheese market, Gallagher says.

New co-ops in town Scenic Valley might have been the first dairy co-op in Wisconsin to try to value its milk and cheese for its grazing and Jersey characteristics.
Yet, its not the only one around.
Since Scenic Valley formed, at least two other co-ops have started.
One is located outside LaCrosse, while another is located in northeastern Wisconsin, near Seymour.
Within the last two years, we became aware of some nutrients (including CLA) that were in the milk from cows on pasture that are not present in milk from cows fed typical confinement feed, notes Rick Adamski.
He and his wife, Valerie Dantoin- Adamski, operate his familys 100- year-old Full Circle Farm.
We started exploring the possibility of marketing those nutrients.
Were also learning more about the nutrients; there are more nutrients in the milk from these cows, so we have a whole new area to explore.
Typically, their milk goes to the employee-owned Antigo, Wis., Cheese Co.
In conducting experiments to determine the level and value of the CLA in milk and then cheese, the Adamskis contracted with a Green Bay cheesemaker to process it separately into white Cheddar cheese.
Testing proved the cheese retains the higher CLA levels of the milk.
Were lucky we live in Wisconsin with so many smaller cheese plants, Dantoin-Adamski says.
Rather than learning the cheesemaking process and putting in something here on the farm, we contracted with Jim to process our milk into cheese just as we do for hay making and everything else on the farm so that we can just concentrate on grazing our cows.
The Adamskis began marketing the seasonal cheese under their own label Northern Meadows Cheddar directly to consumers and have formed a cooperative with several other producers.
They market it to some natural food stores in northeastern Wisconsin and in Madison, and a few upscale delis carry the product.
However, Dantoin-Adamski wants to make it available to everyone, regardless of income, because everyone deserves good, nutritious foods.
[rising6.jpg] Seeking higher premiums Dantoin-Adamski believes the higher CLA level of Northern Meadow cheese can open the possibility of premiums based on the CLA content in milk, if the milk and related dairy products can be marketed for their CLA content.
The all-natural Northern Meadow cheddar has a flavor distinct to the region where its made, and that flavor will vary year-to-year depending on sunshine, rain and plant growth.
Full Circle sold its cheese, made at a small cheese plant in DePere, for $5 per pound.
At that price, the cheese could support a milk payment price of about $16 per hundredweight.
The Adamskis efforts may provide a model for other dairy grazers interested in adding value to their milk production, said Stan Shaw, administrator of Wisconsin DATCPs marketing division.
By focusing on a possible consumer benefit found within their cheese, they may have a firm foundation to enter the marketplace.
We have combined efforts with four other family farms to form a new cooperative called the Wisconsin Dairy Graziers Co-op, Dantoin-Adamski explains.
These farms graze cows in virtually the same way our farm does.W e are pooling our milk and cheesemaking so that we can make enough volume to reach the economies of scale needed to market our cheese efficiently.
The handcrafted cheese is made exclusively from the milk of these cows that graze on grass and clover meadows.
The Adamskis note that only when cows graze on fresh plants directly in the field can they obtain higher levels of CLA.
This superior Wisconsin cheese has a flavor that, like a fine wine, is unique to the region, Dantoin-Adamski says, pointing out that the conservation award-winning Full Circle Farm and the other members of the co-op are located about 25 miles from Lake Michigan and on the edge of the Nicolet National Forest.
Already participants in USDAs Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program in the 1990s, the Adamskis received a $20,000 Agricultural Development and Diversification grant this summer from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture.
They are using it to identify the marketing feasibility of pasture-based cheese and dairy products for the Wisconsin Dairy Grazier Cooperative, the newest such organization to form.
The Adamskis and the Gallaghers have talked about similar challenges and opportunities.
Wed like to stay right around 25 member farms, Gallagher explains.
But there are ways that our co-op could work with other groups, like the Adamskis, to offer other products they might make.
And I think all the small co-ops need to get together through an organization, like the Center for Co-ops, to talk over common business issues so that were all learning and growing.
