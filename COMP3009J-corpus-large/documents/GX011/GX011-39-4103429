INSTITUTE-SPONSORED MEETINGS, WORKSHOPS, AND CONFERENCES I. Held since January 2002 Council + The Comparative Biology of Aging Workshop (exploratory) was held February 6-7, 2002.
The purpose of the workshop was to gather information on possible comparative biology approaches to the study of aging and on relevant organisms for the study of aging.
Our aim was to stimulate new approaches toward understanding the molecular bases for differences in aging rates and life expectancy between species.
Such an understanding would make a major contribution towards clarifying the causes of the phenotypes associated with aging and what "times" aging in humans with tremendous potential impact on the quality of life of the elderly.
The workshop highlighted current and potential aging-research with a variety of organisms.
Jill Carrington of the NIA and a group of investigators, including Steven Austad, Caleb Finch, Michal Jazwinski, Richard Miller, George Taffet and Richard Weindruch co-organized the workshop.
It was divided into four major sessions titled "Comparative Biology of Aging", "Comparative Biodemography", "Toward Comparative Study of Biochemical Aging Mechanisms", and "Comparative Genomics".
The participants at the workshop shared data and information on a wide variety of species, including not only the traditional animal models used for studying aging {rats (Marco Pahor), mice (Richard Miller, Jan Vijg), fruit flies (Marc Tatar, James Carey, David Promislow), nematodes (Thomas Johnson), yeast (Michal Jazwinski)}, but also fish {including xiphophorus (Ronald Walter, Stevn Kazanis), guppies (David Reznick), zebrafish (Glenn Gerhard), rockfish (Gregor Cailliet)}, birds {Japanese quail (Mary Ann Ottinger), budgiregars (Steven Austad)}, non-human primates {lemurs, macaques, chimpanzees, baboons (Mary Lou Voytko, Caleb Finch, Marc Tatar)}, other insects {honey bees (Kim Hughes), butterflies and grasshoppers (Marc Tatar)}, and other mammals {naked mole rats (Timothy O'Connor), dogs (Elizabeth Head), bats (Jerry Wilkinson), humans (George Martin, John Postlethwait, George Taffet, Woodring Wright)}, and even plants (Deborah Roach).
All of this was placed solidly within a framework of human aging by both introductory and summary presentations.
It is expected that the information presented at this workshop will be the foundation for a 2003 initiative in comparative biology of aging.
This initiative will be presented at a future Council meeting.
In addition, an article summarizing major points of the workshop is being prepared by BAP staff to be published on the Science SAGE web site.
(Contact: Dr. Jill Carrington, BAP, 301-496-6402) + The Workshop on Genomic and Genetic Tools for the Zebrafish (exploratory) was held on April 1-2, 2002.
This was an activity of the Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee, under the leadership of NIDDK and NICHD, to bring together researchers using the Zebrafish model for discussion of future needs for research tools.
In view of the interest of the NIA in promoting comparative biology study of aging, and the outstanding utility of this model for genetic and genomic analysis, staff in the Biology of Aging Program, NIA helped to organize and support this workshop.
The agenda included updates on Zebrafish genomics projects in progress; introduction and discussion of resources currently under development (including arrays, antibody collections, and strains); and discussion of projects on systematic gene disruption.
The workshop concluded with a discussion of the need and mechanisms for possible development of a full-length cDNA set and prioritization of various resources for the research community.
Further development of initiatives will take place within the framework of the Trans-NIH committee.
(Contact: Dr. Jill Carrington, BAP, 301-496-6402) + The Growth Hormone/Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) and Aging Tissues Workshop (exploratory) was held on May 1-2, 2002.
This is the first in what is expected to be a series of workshops on aging tissues and organs organized by the Systems Branch, BAP.
These workshops are intended to gather Systems Branch grantees with other outstanding scientists in areas of common research interest.
They are designed to stimulate discussion across tissue lines and promote collaboration between researchers in a variety of related areas.
The workshop was initiated in response to the NACA BAP review report encouraging leadership to take advantage of new findings that impact multiple programs and thus, the workshop agenda cut across program lines within BAP.
The participants presented data on GH/IGF-I decline with age; IGF-I binding proteins and receptors; GH/IGF-I effects on end organs (muscle, bone, cartilage, prostate, immune system, cardiovascular system); replacing GH/IGF-I in the aged; and experimental approaches toward replacing GH/IGF-I.
It is expected that the information presented at this workshop will be the foundation for an initiative in GH/IGF-I and aging to be presented at a future Council meeting.
(Contact: Dr. Jill Carrington, BAP, 301-496-6402) + Transgenic Models of Disease Teleconference/Meeting The "Transgenic Models of Disease Meeting" was held March 6, 2002 at the NIH.
The National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) organized this informational meeting.
The intent of the meeting was to discuss the potential of using non-human primates (NHP) as alternatives to mouse transgenic models of neurological diseases.
The meeting bought together (in person or by teleconference) NIH extramural program directors and outside experts.
The discussion topics included the advantages and disadvantages of current transgenic mouse models of neurological disorders; development of transgenics in other animal species such as rats or dogs; the possible scientific advantages and disadvantages of developing transgenic non-human primate models, including technology development and choice of species; the availability and cost of non-human primates, as well as the length of time for generation of the disease model; and ethics.

+ Workshop on the Genetics of Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease The Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program and the Alzheimer's Association cosponsored a one and a half day advisory workshop entitled, "The 2002 Workshop on the Genetics of Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease" on March 18 to 19, 2002 in Bethesda, Maryland.
Approximately 100 basic science investigators, Alzheimer's Disease Center directors, and NIH program staff were invited from both extramural and intramural communities.
The workshop included presentations from NIH extramural program staff on Institute and NIH policy on the sharing of unique research resources.
With an aim to determine availability of unique resources, a recent survey that tabulated the numbers of available AD and control DNA and cell samples was presented.
Presentations were also given concerning plans for the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease Center as a repository resource.
Selected AD geneticists presented their points of view on what new research resources the field needs in order to move forward.
Substantive interactions followed during an open discussion of all participants on key issues including cell and DNA banking needs, sample and data sharing, and informed consent.
The workshop participants generated a set of suggestions for further research on the genetics of late onset AD.
For further information contact: Dr. Marilyn M. Miller at (301) 496-9350.
+ Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Meeting The Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging program sponsored a one-day informational meeting on March 29, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, to begin to bring together a consortium of experts on neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Attendees came from academia, pharmaceutical companies, imaging companies, NIH program staff, the NIH Office of the Director, the Food and Drug Association, the Alzheimer's Association, and the Institute for the Study of Aging.
The goal of this initiative is to develop longitudinal studies that will identify the neuroimaging modalities and techniques that are most appropriate for following elderly people as they develop MCI and AD.
In addition to providing natural history information, the hope is that neuroimaging markers will allow early identification of those who may benefit from emerging preventative and treatment medications.
Representatives from pharmaceutical companies, imaging companies, and advocacy organizations expressed their levels of interest and their concerns about participating in this initiative.
NIH staff discussed the conduct of a similar initiative on osteoarthritis that is sponsored by NIAMS and co-sponsored by NIA.
Topics discussed by the representatives and by the academic investigators included standardization of imaging protocols and data analysis, advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities, investigators' experience with longitudinal imaging studies, criteria for surrogate markers for drug efficacy, and data sharing.
The next meeting for this initiative is planned for June 17-18 (see below).

+ Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Meeting This advisory meeting will include 180-200 people from academia, pharmaceutical companies, imaging companies, NIH program staff, the NIH Office of the Director, the Food and Drug Association, the Alzheimer's Association, and the Institute for the Study of Aging, and will take place June 17-18, in Bethesda, Maryland.
The goal of this initiative is to foster a public-private collaboration for the development of longitudinal studies that will identify the neuroimaging techniques most appropriate for following elderly people as they develop mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
In addition to providing natural history information, neuroimaging may allow early identification of patients who may benefit from emerging preventative and treatment medications, and provide a way of monitoring treatments.
The meeting will include presentations from academic and pharmaceutical company investigators in methodological aspects of neuroimaging in the context of epidemiological studies and multi-site clinical trials as well as aspects of data collection, transfer, and analysis in these contexts.
An advisory group will be asked to provide initial recommendations about the direction of the initiative and possible mechanisms for support.
For further information contact: Dr. Susan Molchan or Dr. Neil Buckholtz at (301) 496-9350 + The Immunology and Aging Workshop (advisory) is scheduled to be held June 13-14, 2002.
The purpose of the workshop is to present and discuss research advances in immunosenescence, gaps in our understanding of mechanisms responsible for decline in function of the immune system with age and areas that appear to be promising for increased research efforts.
A discussion of strategies to recruit immunologists to these areas of research is also planned.
The workshop is expected to promote interaction between researchers working in different areas of immunology and recommendations made by workshop participants will be included in a report of the meeting to be made available to NIA staff.
