Interpretive Summary: Sunflower broomrape is a serious parasite infecting the roots of plants that causes heavy losses to sunflower crops in many areas of the world.
Adaptive evolution of this parasite to sunflower cultivars with resistance genes resulted in new virulent broomrape races.
Sources of resistance were found in perennial wild species.
This study reported the production of interspecific hybrids between two resistant wild perennial accessions and cultivated sunflower, the evaluation of their resistance to broomrape, and seed setting ability.
The immune reaction in the two wild accessions and their hybrids with cultivated line indicated a simple genetic control of resistance, and the resistant plants in the progenies of the hybrids can be selected for breeding broomrape resistant lines.
