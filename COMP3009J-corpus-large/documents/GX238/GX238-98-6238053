More On The Social Security Number Tennessee law requires the social security number for all applications.
The department is also required to maintain this information on each applicant's record.
However, you can choose whether or not to have it printed on your license.
Tennessee has a computer link with the Social Security Administration, so most applicants will not have to present proof of the social security number.
The computer will simply return a message indicating that the number matches (or not).
However, to make sure the examiner accurately records the number, you could bring one of the documents listed below.
These documents may also serve as a second piece of identification, which you will need any way, so it makes sense to bring them along when you can.
Â· Your original Social Security card Â· The Internal Revenue Service W-2 Wage and Tax Statement form Â· A computer generated payroll check or bank statement Â· Health insurance card with both name and Social Security numbers
If Under Age Eighteen First License or Learner Permit (Before July 1, 2001) Tennessee begins issuing a Graduated Driver License on July 1, 2001.
This means that if by June 30, 2001 you are under age 18 and do not have a full Class D license, the new law will apply to you.
This new law is explained in the next section.
Meanwhile, under the current law, when applicants under the age of 18 apply for a driver license, proof of previous driving experience is required.
They must either: 1.
First obtain a learner permit for at least three (3) months; 2.
Bring a certificate of successful completion for an approved driver education course offered by a public school, public institution of higher learning, or a licensed commercial driver training school; or 3.
Have been licenses to drive in another state for at least three months.
License Fees At A Glance Tennessee licenses now expire every five years on the driver 's birthday evenly divisible by five (age 30, 35, 40 . . .
55, 60, 65, etc.).
This makes it easier for drivers to remember when it is time to renew, and means they have to renew less often than before.
To get you on the "Drive for Five" cycle, your first license may be for a shorter or longer period than five years.
If so, fees will be pro-rated.
Everyone pays the same fees PER YEAR for each license.
The fees shown below as "standard fees" are calculated for a 5-year license and include an application fee.

Other Applicants New Residents People who move to Tennessee must obtain a Tennessee driver license no later than thirty days after establishing residency.
After passing the required tests, they must surrender all out-of-state driver licenses.
Tennessee law does not allow a resident of this state to hold more than one valid license or ID.
If the new resident presents an out-of-state driver license that has not expired, only the vision test is required, unless otherwise deemed necessary by the Examiner.
However, if the license has expired over six months, all tests are required.
Military Personnel If a person holds a valid Tennessee license and is in or enters into the United States armed forces, that license shall remain valid as long as the person remains on active duty, and is based outside this state.
Members of the National Guard and family members of military personnel are not eligible for this provision.
While on active duty the military person may have a "Code 30" placed on the license to indicate that the license does not expire.
To add this code, bring a copy of your military orders to the driver license station and pay the appropriate fees.
Note, after you have been honorably discharged or separated from the military, or reassigned to a duty station back in Tennessee, you have sixty (60) days following the date of separation on the DD214 form to renew your license without any penalty or added tests.

Don't Let Your License Expire.
No matter how you renew, the important thing is to do so before your license expires.
If you let 30 days go by after your expiration date, there will be a five-dollar late fee.
After six months, the late fee doubles to $10.00.
If you let five years go by without renewing, not only will you have to pay the $10.00 late fee, you will also have to pass vision, knowledge, and skills test.
NOTE: These are not "grace periods."
When your license expires, you are no longer entitled to drive, and will be subject to the same penalties as someone who has never been licensed.
It is your responsibility to maintain the validity of your license.
If you do not receive your renewal notice, you may simply take your current license to any driver license station.
The renewal notice itself is not necessary for you to be able to renew your license.
Q: How Do I Change My Address? It is important to notify the department of safety! If your residence address changes (even though you may not have moved) you are required by state law to notify the Department of Safety within ten (10) days of this change.
Sometimes addresses are changed without people actually moving.
For example, if your area installs an emergency "911" system, your address may be changed with the Post Office.
But simply notifying postal authorities will not provide the information to us.
By failing to notify us, you could miss the renewal date of your license, or even have your driving privileges suspended or revoked unnecessarily.
The law does not require the address to be changed on your actual license, just on our files.

Other Common Questions Q: How Do I Replace a Lost License? If your driver license or learner permit is ever lost, stolen or destroyed, you may obtain a duplicate by applying at any driver license station.
You must apply in person, present two pieces of proper identification, and pay the appropriate fee.
This fee may vary depending upon the number of duplicates applied for during the current renewal cycle of your license.
Q: How Do I Renew My License? The department mails every driver a courtesy renewal notice from four to six weeks before their licenses expire.
