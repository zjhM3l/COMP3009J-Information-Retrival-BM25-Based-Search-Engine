WEEK OF JULY 7 - 11, 2003 DAIRY MARKET NEWS NATIONAL DAIRY MARKET AT A GLANCE VOLUME 70, REPORT 28 CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (CME) CASH MARKETS (7/11): BUTTER: Grade AA closed at $1.1950.
The weekly average for Grade AA is $1.1667 (+.0329).
CHEESE: Barrels closed at $1.4800 and blocks at $1.5200.
The weekly average for barrels is $1.4760 (+.0866) and blocks, $1.5120 (+.0914).
NONFAT DRY MILK: Extra Grade closed at $0.8400 and Grade A at $0.8400.
The weekly average for Extra Grade is $0.8400 (N.C.) and Grade A, $0.8400 (N.C.).
BUTTER: The cash butter price at the CME continues to show strength.
Many producers and handlers anticipate that this price will remain firm and continue to inch higher.
Churning schedules across the country are lighter as cream supplies tighten.
Some producers and handlers indicate that fresh production is often not sufficient to meet all demand thus inventoried stocks are being used to supplement orders.
Demand for butter is seasonally fair.
In instances, buyers indicate that they will continue to place orders on an as needed basis, knowing that prices will probably continue to edge higher, but are basically comfortable with the increases versus carrying an inventory for future use.
During the period of July 3 11, no butter was offered to CCC under the dairy support program, but 761,570 pounds of previously offered butter were cancelled.
CHEESE: The cheese market is steady to firm.
Many in the industry continue to react to the sharp price increases in recent weeks.
Prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently the highest since early October 2001.
Some buyers and producers are having difficulty in getting orders filled.
Current supplies are tight to adequate and held with confidence.
Cheese production is steady to often lower, reflecting summer weather affect on milk output.
Cumulative January - May 2003 U.S. cheddar production totals 1.18 billion pounds, down 55.8 million pounds (-4.5%) from the same period in 2002.
Total cheese production for 2003 currently totals 3.57 billion pounds, down 27.5 million pounds (-0.8%) from a year ago.
CCC continues to purchase and cancel process cheese packaged earlier.
FLUID MILK: Milk production is trending lower throughout the nation in response to seasonal hot and humid weather.
However, milk exports from Florida persist and some milk shipments in the Midwest were rerouted due to strong storms in the area.
Class I demand is lighter after the holiday weekend.
Milk movement into Class III facilities is strong, especially in response to the higher block and barrel cheese prices reported at the CME.
The condensed skim market is unsettled.
As cheese prices increase, the price of Class III condensed skim also increases, encouraging Class III users to examine NDM as a cost effective alternative.
The fluid cream market is firm.
Ample supplies of cream are being shipped from the West to other parts of the nation to supplant regional deficiencies.
Cream prices are trending higher due to increases in the weekly average AA CME butter price and higher reported multiples.
Demand for cream is seasonally strong for ice cream and reduced for churns.
DRY PRODUCTS: Dry product prices are trending unchanged to higher with the exception of Western NDM. NDM production is declining in response to lower milk supplies.
Demand is mostly contractual with some renewed spot interest anticipated as Class III condensed skim users divert their interest to NDM. Buttermilk prices are trending higher in response to reduced supplies and increased demand from ice cream producers.
Improved export sales activity is reducing whey and WPC stocks and encouraging higher prices.
Demand for WPC is primarily from edible markets.
Lactose supplies are generally in balance on a firm market.
CCC: During the period of July 3 11, 2003, CCC purchased 13,682,523 pounds of nonfortified NDM with 1,167,296 originating from the Central region, 12,654,088 pounds from the West, and 138,861 pounds canceled in the East.
Cancellations of 761,570 pounds of Western bulk butter and 39,000 pounds of Central process cheese were also recorded for the period.
MAY DAIRY PRODUCTS HIGHLIGHTS (NASS): Butter production was 114.6 million pounds in May, 8.7% below May 2002 and 6.6% below April 2003.

The following are May to May changes for various states: CA -6.4%, NY -26.5%, PA -10.7%, and WI -13.7%.
production is lower with most producers working with cream supplies from regular sources.
In instances, butter producers are selling some of their cream supply versus churning at this time.
Some producers and handlers indicate that current production is often not sufficient to meet all demand thus inventoried stocks are being used to supplement orders.
Many buyers indicate that they will continue to place orders basically on an as needed basis, knowing that prices will probably continue to edge higher, but are basically comfortable with the increases versus carrying an inventory for future use.
Bulk butter for spot sale is in a range of flat to 2 cents per pound over various pricing basis.
NORTHEAST The market tone remains firm.
The CME cash price for butter is moving slowly higher, which, in light of recent run-up of the cash price for cheese, is a little surprising to some contacts.
Some felt that the butter price would move at little faster to "catch up" with the gains posted for cheese.
Others, however, acknowledging the tight cream supply, simply point to inventory levels.
Fresh butter may be a little harder to find, but there is no shortage of bulk butter, should it be needed.
Commercial demand for bulk butter is fair.
During Monday's (7/7) trading at the CME, 36 loads of butter were sold.
Some contacts feel that a good portion of the purchases during that trading session were speculative.
Retail orders for packaged butter are mostly steady.
Food service orders are improving seasonally.
Sales of bulk butter f.o.b.
East, are reported in a range of flat market to 4 cents over the CME price/average.
WEST Butter markets are slowly strengthening with a firm market undertone.
Part of the increase may be related to the sharply higher cheese markets noted over the last three weeks.
Cream available for churning remains tight as ice cream plants remain aggressive in searching for additional supplies.
Not quite as much pressure was noted because of the holiday weekend, but warm temperatures across much of the country are expected to continue to stimulate interest.
Demand for butter is good seasonally with fresh butter supplies becoming less available.
May U.S. butter production totals 114.6 million pounds, down 8.7% from last year.
Butter output has trailed a year ago for the last three months.
Production for the first five months of the year totals 633.5 million pounds, down 2.4% (15.6 million pounds) from the same period in 2002.
Output in the Western region is down 4.5% from May 2002.
Weekly CME butter stocks declined by 1.3 million pounds this past week.
Stocks have declined three of the last five weeks.
Current prices for bulk butter range from 3 1/2 cents under to 2 cents under the market based on the CME with various time frames and averages (includes CCC sales when applicable).
CENTRAL The cash butter prices continues to adjust higher in exchange trading.
Many producers and handlers anticipate that this price will continue to inch higher for the near term.
Many feel that supply/demand is not influencing the firmness, but rather the time of year and cream shortages for churning are the main factors.
Cream supplies remain very competitive between Class II and IV users.
Ice cream production is seasonally very strong, absorbing most spot cream available.

Through Monday (7/7) the CME trading levels of both blocks and barrels increased 35 and 33.25 cents, respectively, since June 17 (the day that the May Milk Production report was released).
Last week's gains were just under 18.25 cents on blocks and 16.25 cents on barrels.
Most cheese is sold on the weekly average and this, in all likelihood, would increase, significantly, prices on next week's orders.
Consequently, many buyers are ordering heavy this week.
However, producers/suppliers not wanting to be "picked off" are allowing only normal volume orders.
Cheese output in the Northeast is steady to slightly lower now that milk supplies are declining.
Retail sales of natural and process cheese are mostly steady, unless featured.
Food service orders are improving as it is now "vacation season" and people are frequenting the Shore and other resort areas.
WHOLESALE SELLING PRICES: DELIVERED, DOLLARS PER POUND (1000 - 5000 POUNDS MIXED LOTS) WEST All reported styles and varieties of cheese are sharply higher in price.
Some Western contacts are certainly surprised at the amount of price strength noted in such a short period of time.
Most had thought the market would firm as they were seeing a tightening in available supplies.
The quickness of the price escalation caught most of them by surprise.
They do believe that market fundamentals are in place to support the current situation.
Offerings of under grade cheese are clearing much more easily.
Production is declining more rapidly as less surplus milk is available.
Some are wondering if the current market price relationship will tend to pull milk out of butter in favor of cheese.
U.S. cheddar cheese production in May totaled 240.1 million pounds, down 7.1% from last year.
This is the lowest May output noted since 1997.
Western cheddar production in May is down 5.1% from a year earlier.
U.S. Swiss production in May totaled 22.3 million pounds, up 3.8% from May 2002.

Many in the industry, mainly buyers, have been shocked by recent price increases and are questioning the need for such a large jump in prices over just the past few weeks.
Others just try to build inventory, particularly those buying under price protection policies.
The price spread between the "brands" and store brands (generics) may narrow at food service and retail accounts due to recent increases.
Barrels remain tight to short of needs as process interest is seasonally good.
The higher prices also make nonstandardized process products using MPC more attractive compared to standardized products.
Demand for other American varieties remains strong.
Mozzarella interest is also improved by buyers trying to beat the next potential price increase.
Many plants are still running way behind on orders.
Some operations are not making spot sales, limiting deliveries to committed accounts.
Cheese production continues to decline as milk intakes decline seasonally.
Very limited spot milk supplies available to purchase are also limiting cheese production.
WISCONSIN WHOLESALE SELLING PRICES: DELIVERED, DOLLARS PER POUND (1000 - 5000 POUNDS MIXED LOTS) FOREIGN Domestic prices jumped significantly as the block cheese price (the basis for most cheeses sold) at the CME has increased dramatically since mid-June.

The following are the June 2003 Class and component prices under the Federal Milk Order pricing system: Class II $10.46 (up $0.03 from May), Class III $9.75 (up $0.04); and Class IV $9.76 (up $0.02).
The following are the product price averages used in computing Class prices: butter $1.0797, NDM $0.8040, cheese $1.1464, and dry whey $0.1396.
The Class II butterfat price is $1.1646 and the Class III/IV butterfat price is $1.1576.
Many contacts were at or on their way to a large, industry outing at mid-week and unavailable for comment.
However, there were still a lot of conversations regarding the recently enacted self-help program proposed and promoted by a large national organization.
Although the goals are nearly identical, the final version of the plan has producer costs and resulting benefits sharply lower than the original plan's.
Nearly all current market indicators point to higher milk prices and lower cow numbers in coming months, which are major goals of the organization's plan.
Milk production is moving lower in most sections of the region.
Hot, humid weather prevails over the East.
Florida's milk output is declining, but at slower than expected rates.
Milk exports from Florida actually increased slightly this week.
Milk production in other Southeastern states is dropping rather rapidly as the heat is taking it's toll on the cows.
In the Middle Atlantic and Northeast, the milk flow is easing from peak levels.
Throughout the region, fat and solids tests are at low, seasonal levels.
Bottled milk sales are slower.
Bottlers note that sales seem to have really slowed since the Fourth of July.
Surplus milk volumes are mostly steady.
The slower Class I demand and lower milk output, are combining to keep surplus milk volumes relatively steady.
The condensed skim market is unsettled, particularly for Class III.
Recent increases in cheese prices at the CME are expected to greatly impact next month's Class III condensed skim prices.
If cheese prices hold through the month, contacts expect August Class III wet solids to be priced over a dollar per pound solids.
Reportedly, users are already looking at NDM as a less costly substitute.
(Particularly in light of CCC's "powder-for-cheese" program, which may find the exchanged NDM on the market later this month.)
There is also concern about Class II condensed skim prices for August.
The fluid cream market remains very firm and prices are increasing.
Demand is back to normal levels after a slight lull during the holiday weekend.
Multiples are increasing and the CME butter average did jump more than a penny last week.
Locally, supplies are often short of needs and suppliers continue to bring in more loads from Midwest and Western producers.
Production of ice cream, soft serve mix, and frozen novelties are all at seasonal peaks.
The hot weather has given a boost to soft serve and novelty sales.
Cream cheese output is steady.
Some producers continue to look for more cream, but prices are becoming prohibitive.
Bottled cream sales are holding fairly steady.
Churning activity is easing as cream supplies tighten.

Strong cream demand has returned after the holiday weekend.
Volumes continue to move some distance to fill orders, often from West to the East.
Condensed skim interest is irregular, some accounts with good interest and others not.
Reported Class III condensed prices range from $.95 - $1.05.
Sharply higher prices reportedly have some cheese plant operators reconstituting NDM as a cheaper alternative.
Recent increases in the cheese market have caused some additional milk supplies to move out of butter/powder into cheese production due to the better returns.
Milk handlers are also concerned with the expected July Class Federal Order Class I base price is likely to be below the Class III price and will affect pooling and the PPD (producer price differential).
While some parts within the region remain dry, others have flooded fields due to several inches of rain and or several smaller showers.
The harvest of second cutting has also been hampered by the frequent showers.
The recent heat and humidity have combined to reduce milk receipts fairly noticeably at some locations as well as spur corn and other crop growth.

Milk intakes and solids' contents are trending lower as a direct result.
The cumulative effect of the hot weather is expected to further decrease output in the near future.
Manufacturing plants are generally having only limited concerns with the weather conditions with the only note of a few plants having down days for scheduled maintenance.
Generally, more milk is wanted in cheese plants.
Additional condensed and NDM are moving into cheese.
Fluid milk sales are said to be nothing special with the hot weather doing little to stimulate demand.
Hay supplies are available, but reports indicate dairies are not willing to overpay.
There are more stocks of fair to good alfalfa because of harvesting conditions.
ARIZONA daytime temperatures remain hot and the impact on milk production continues.
The weather and trend are not expected to break soon.
Plants are coping with the condition and able to handle local milk.
NEW MEXICO milk production is steady to lower seasonally after many weeks of hot temperatures have run their course on the milk cows.
Milk is being handled normally with some additional contractual loads of fluid milk being shipped to the Southeast.
Hay conditions are fair with the south starting the third cutting and the north starting the second cutting.
Heavy shipments of cream from the West continue to move to other regions of the country, especially into ice cream plants.
The good call for cream has pulled significant amounts of cream out of butter production over the past month.
The CME Grade AA butter price increased to $1.1575 on Wednesday (7/9) and has continued higher in recent weeks.
Western cream multiples are firmer and range from 123 to 139, FOB, depending on class usage.
There were no problems handling or moving cream over the holiday weekend.
Conditions are warm and dry in the PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
The stress is not bad enough to impact the milk flow very much.
Output is generally declining along normal seasonal patterns.
Manufacturing plants are discussing the possibility of moving more milk into cheese production because of the very strong run up in cheese prices over the past three weeks, but it remains to be seen if much milk will actually move.
Hay supplies are good in the region with strong carry over stocks and good current production.
The only concern is that there is not as much top quality dairy hay available as some years.
This is not a concern for all producers since many are trying to save money by dropping lower on the quality scale when making purchases anyway.
Weather patterns are very warm and dry in UTAH and IDAHO.
Temperatures above 100 degrees will be common over much of the region by the end of the week.
The heat stress is bringing down output at a faster rate.
The tests on incoming milk receipts are beginning to drop below year ago levels.
Much of the region is harvesting second cutting alfalfa at this time.
There is no chance of disrupting the harvest by rain.
Hay quality is falling into summer time levels because of the additional heat stress.
Corn for silage is also beginning to show stress as growers can't get enough water on the fields fast enough to counter the extreme heat.
It will be a race to get the crop mature before the water runs out this year.
Also, a number of irrigation districts will be pulling their reservoirs down to empty.
Even last year with the dry conditions they did not bring them down that much.
MIDWEST Weather adversely impacted parts of the region during the past week.
Strong storms caused power outages and disrupted production at plants in Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, and Indiana.
Some milk needed to be rerouted to other facilities.
Milk supplies have tightened further in the region.
Class I interest was generally lighter after the holiday weekend.
Class I interest late last week was often stronger than expected in some markets, reducing manufacturing milk offerings.
Spot milk demand remains strong for the limited supplies with some orders still going unfilled.
Reported spot prices range from to $1.25 - $1.75 over class, some DAIRY MARKET NEWS, JULY 7 - 11, 2003 -5NDM, BUTTERMILK 
NONFAT DRY MILK - CENTRAL AND EAST CENTRAL: Prices are unchanged on a steady market.
Production is mostly steady.
Some locations are drying a little less NDM as more fluid milk is diverted to the more price attractive Class III facilities.
Others are drying a little more NDM in response to the higher condensed skim prices which are deterring cheese maker buying interest and encouraging some loads of condensed skim to be diverted into dryers.
Spot loads of low heat are typically purchased from the West.
High heat movement is mostly contractual with spot interest considered to be very good into bakery accounts.
Any impact from the CCC NDM/cheese exchange is reportedly not expected until late August or September.
EAST: Eastern prices and the market tone are unchanged.
Drying activity is slowing at most plants.
Surplus milk supplies are declining as the heat and humidity in the East takes its toll on the cows.
Producer stocks are lighter and fewer offerings to CCC from Eastern producers have been noted in the past week or two.
Demand for NDM is about steady, but with the tighter supply in the East, some producers did bring in Western powder to supplement local supplies.
Many producers are commenting that demand for NDM may increase next month.
If the Class III skim milk price jumps as expected, the Class III wet solids price formulas result in prices above a dollar.
Such an occurrence could trigger condensed skim users to switch to NDM and save money.
There is still talk of the "NDM-for-cheese" situation and that offers of the yet-to-be released powder are commonplace in the market.
Rumors state that exporting may be an issue for this powder and some buyers, for various reasons, don't want to buy this powder.

DRY WHEY - CENTRAL Prices are higher on a firm market.
Milk intakes at most cheese operations are strong, encouraging steady output of condensed whey.
Interest in condensed whey is no better than fair and in some cases difficult to clear where dryers are not readily available.
Dry whey production is steady to lower in response to equipment problems at a few locations.
Consequently, supplies of dry whey are in balance to short of buyer interest.
Spot interest is good, especially into bakery and confectionary operations.
Some feed buyers are making inquiries on Extra Grade due to the limited availability of off grade product.
Resellers are reportedly offering aged stocks of Extra Grade from nearly 1 year ago.
