Public Finance Revenue Special Report U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey $85 Billion in Capital Needs I Summary Amidst the double-digit percentage passenger decline in the post Sept. 11 environment from September 2001 through January 2002, every airport in the nation has modified or is reviewing its capital improvement plan (CIP).
Based on a survey of these, Fitch Ratings calculates $85 billion in assessable short-, medium-, and long-term capital needs for its 64 Fitch-rated U.S. airports and predicts $30.6 billion of new money debt to be issued between 2002Â­2006.
This confirms that many capacity projects are being deferred in the short term, but almost none have been cancelled.
Security costs will spike but should be paid for mostly at the federal level.
Much needed capacity projects are well documented, but future security costs remain unknown as the federal government transitions into its new role of airport security.
Specifically, Fitch calculates that from 2002Â­2006 the Northeast Region has a collective $22.8 billion in capital needs and may issue up to $9.0 billion in debt; the Southeast Region has roughly $19.2 billion in total needs and may issue up to $9.3 billion in debt; the Pacific Region has roughly $18 billion of projects with $5.7 billion in debt; the Midwest Region has roughly $15.9 billion in capital projects with $5.9 billion in debt; and the Rocky Mountain/Southwest Region has a collective $8.9 billion of projects with $3.5 billion of debt.
In February 2001 Fitch assessed $88 billion in U.S. airport CIPs.
As security requirements are better documented, Fitch feels that these CIPs could be conservative.
(See Fitch Research, "U.S. Airports in the 21st Century: Secure at What Cost?" dated April 10, 2002, available on Fitch's web site at www.fitchratings.com.)
Even though security and safety projects are now top priority for U.S. airports, do not forget that in 2000, one of every four flights in the U.S. was delayed, diverted, or cancelled, largely due to insufficient airport infrastructure because of underinvestment in years past.
The capacity issue has not fixed itself since then.
Fitch believes that new money airport bond issuance will rebound in 2002Â­2003 for the following reasons: the quantitative backlog of capacity and improvement projects is $85 billion and growing; the federal government could have fewer resources to grant to airports as federal deficits return; and there is a potential funding gap for the new federally funded security requirements.
Refunding bonds should also experience a strong rebound as the succession of interest rate cuts in 2001 presents refunding opportunities and the bubble of new money debt issued in the early 1990s has call dates approaching.

dropped 1.8% before Sept. 11 because of the economic slowdown, and that Sept. 11 also kept millions of passengers from flying.
U.S. passengers peaked at 695 million in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2000 but this figure is expected to drop to 600 million in the federal fiscal year (FFY) ending Sept. 30, 2002.
During FFY 2003, however, the number of passengers is expected to grow by 14% to 684 million, and then grow by an average of 4.2% annually, reaching one billion by 2013.
A year ago, the FAA predicted that U.S. airlines would be carrying one billion passengers a year by 2010.
Overall, 22% of flights by the major airlines in 2001 were delayed, canceled, or diverted, down from 27% in 2000.
This forecast acknowledges the fact, according to the Air Transport Association, that the revenue passenger enplanements on its member carriers declined 33.7% on a year-over-year basis for September 2001, followed by declines of 23.2% in October, 19.8% in November, 14.7% in December, and 14.9% in January.

Post Sept. 11 Assessment of Airport Capital Needs This report is an update of a previous report, "U.S. Airport Debt: The Sky's the Limit," (see Fitch Research dated Feb. 9, 2001, available on Fitch's web site at www.fitchratings.com) in which Fitch calculated a collective $88 billion in total capital requirements and predicted roughly $29 billion of airport debt offerings in the primary bond markets from 2001Â­2005.
I In addition to assessing the changes in capital needs and timing for Fitch-rated airports in the post Sept. 11 environment, this year's report includes six new airports and excludes one airport from last year.
The six additional airports in this year's report are: Chicago Midway (IL), Hartford Bradley International (CT), Las Vegas McCarran International (NV), Norfolk International (VA), Palm Beach International (FL), and Tucson International (AZ).
Missing from this year's report is Little Rock National Airport (AR), as it has retired its outstanding passenger facility charge (PFC) secured bonds ahead of its original 2016 maturity schedule.
During 2001, Fitch also rated $5.8 billion of new money debt.
Post Sept. 11 FAA Aviation Forecast On March 11, 2002, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released its annual commercial aviation forecast, its first one since Sept. 11, 2001.

Capital Improvement Plan Highlights Airports nationwide continue to confront the backlog of capacity, renovation, and safety projects.
For some congested airports, such as Hartsfield Atlanta International (ATL), this lull in demand has been a chance to implement catch-up projects.
Other airports, such as Los Angeles International (LAX), are focusing more on security rather than expansion spending, and some, such as Boston Logan (BOS), are reeling in long-term plans until passenger demand has reestablished itself.
Each airport tells a different story.
I Of the $85 billion total capital needs, almost $49 billion is accounted for by the 10 largest CIPs, representing the core of construction activity.
The 10 largest by Fitch's count are John F. Kennedy (JFK), Chicago O'Hare International (ORD), LAX, ATL, Newark International (EWR), Miami International Airport (MIA), Dulles International (IAD), DallasFort Worth International (DFW), Oakland International Airport (OAK), and Sea-Tac International Airport (SEA).
Fitch now rates 17 airport credits that have $1 billion or more debt outstanding, up from 13 one year ago, and seven of these should issue at least $1 billion more through 2006.
Additionally, Fitch expects that three airport credits now will surpass $1 billion through 2006.
Northeast Region
$1 billion in needs too.
BOS has curtailed spending based on two-year plans going forward, and many of the region's small hub airports have begun their respective expansion plans.
Southeast Region
Total Capital Needs: $19.2 Billion; Debt Through 2006: $9.3 Billion.
ATL, the world's busiest airport, leads the way, but Florida's three large-hub airports represent the bulk of this region's spending.
RaleighDurham International (RDU) also has $1.5 billion in expansion projects.
Memphis International (MEM) continues on airfield expansion to accommodate Federal Express Corp.'s (FedEx) world headquarters, and Louisville International (SDF) continues to grow with United Parcel Service's (UPS) world aviation headquarters.
Pacific Region
Total Capital Needs: $18 Billion; Debt Through 2006: $5.7 Billion.
California's airports dominate this region with the San Francisco Bay area's three airports and LAX's master plan.
While LAX's master plan is being refocused for safety projects, it is still expected to contain roughly $8 billionÂ­$10 billion of projects.
San Francisco International (SFO) has completed most of its near-term projects but still faces the expected airfield reconfiguration plan that could cost billions.
Seattle, San Jose, and Oakland all have $1 billion plus plans.
Midwest Region
Total Capital Needs: $22.8 Billion; Debt Through 2006: $9.0 Billion.

Minneapolis-St. Paul International (MSP), St. Louis Lambert International (STL), and Columbus International have $1 billion in needs, and Detroit International (DTW) just opened its $1.2 billion midfield terminal in February 2002.
Rocky Mountain/Southwest Region
December 2001, 13 airport (general airport revenue bond) GARB credits, two PFC secured credits, and three airport special facility credits were put on negative outlook, and three special facility credits were downgraded (see table, page 20).
I Capacity Projects at U.S. Airports Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, capacity projects were the prime focus for U.S. airports.
Even though security and safety projects are now top priority in capital spending, do not forget that in 2000, one of every four flights in the U.S. was delayed, diverted, or cancelled, due largely to underinvestment in years past.
The capacity issue has not fixed itself since then.
While the current reduction in passenger travel has delayed some capital expansion projects, history strongly suggests that aviation demand will rebound in the near term, and Fitch believes that long queues on runways will begin again if these long lead-time capacity projects are put on hold too long.
Rising Security Costs at U.S. Airports It is important to note that almost none of the capital plans included in this report reflect the required future security enhancements under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that could cost billions and represent additional major capital expansion projects.
As mandated by the Security Act, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is accountable for crafting specifications and regulations for Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) machine installation -- which is still under deliberation -- and for hiring and managing the roughly 35,000Â­50,000 additional federal baggage screeners that are expected to be needed.
The I
Total Capital Needs: $8.9 Billion; Debt Through 2006: $3.5 Billion.
DFW plans $2.6 billion through 2006 leading the way, but Las Vegas McCarran (LAS), Houston Intercontinental (IAH), and Denver International (DEN) all have $1 billion of projects as well.
Fitch's January 2001Â­March 2002 Airport Bond Ratings Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 11, 2001, U.S. airports were in full-tilt catch-up mode for capacity-related projects, and Fitch assigned 31 ratings to primary market airport bond offerings.
Between Sept. 12, 2001 and March 15, 2002, Fitch assigned four airport bond ratings, three of which were refunding issues, as airports across the nation put the brakes on capacity spending plans and began to focus on security requirements.
I Of these ratings, $5.8 billion were new money, and $2.0 billion were refunding activity.
Additionally, Fitch assigned ratings to $1.6 billion of secondary market airport debt.
Upgrades affected about $500 million of debt, and downgrades affected $468 million of debt.
There were three airport upgrades heading into September 2001.

Public Finance regulations for EDS installation, what type of EDS machines, and the formula for how many EDS machines and security screeners per airport have not been determined, so that all current figures are merely estimates.
It is expected that terminal reconstruction costs to install the EDS machines and ancillary screening machinery could be in the billions.
Until the TSA issues these specifications and airports can assess how much terminal reconstruction may be necessary, costs that airports will face will not be known (see Fitch Research, "U.S. Airports in the 21st Century: Secure at What Cost?" dated April 10, 2002, available on Fitch's web site at www.fitchratings.com).
I Fitch-Rated U.S. Airports Capital Improvement Plan Summaries has completed the vast majority of its $2.4 billion near-term master plan (NTMP), the centerpiece of which is the new international terminal complex, and has completed approximately $3.5 billion of its $4.7 billion 1995Â­2005 capital plan.
The final element of the NTMP, the $555.3 million airtrain people mover system, is scheduled for completion in 2002.
All of the bonds for the NTMP have been issued.
In June 2001, the Airport Commission adopted a multi-year (2002Â­2006) capital plan totaling $1.1 billion, but following Sept. 11, 2001, management put this on hold.
To date, the airport has cancelled a $54.0 million renovation project for the former central terminal and has delayed all other projects, totaling roughly $800 million, except those that are already funded, under contract or are required for operational safety and security.
At this point, SFO tentatively plans to implement a variable-rate bond program in 2002 and also may issue fixed-rate debt in 2002, but the timing and par amounts are not finalized.
These financing plans do not include the cost of the Airport Commission's blue ribbon panel review, which addresses SFO's airfield reconfiguration and off-shore runway that could cost billions.
SFO collects a $4.50 PFC charge.
Port of Seattle -- Sea-Tac International Airport: The busiest airport in the Pacific Northwest and a major point of access to Alaska, SEA has a 10-year CIP (fiscal years 2002Â­2010) of $1.7 billion in committed expansion and renovation projects, $876 million of prospective projects, and $75 million of alternative finance projects.
SEA's master plan CIP was approved by the FAA in 1997, and from 1997 to 2001, $1.2 billion was spent.
Current passenger loads exceed design capacity at SEA, as the last major renovation was completed in 1974.
Major projects include the $773 million third runway, which should open in 2006, the $470 million south and central terminal expansion, and the new $209 million rental car facility.
In response to Sept. 11, SEA delayed $144 million in project spending scheduled for 2002 until 2003 and is developing cost projections for security upgrades.
In addition to the near-term expansion of SEA's existing facilities, SEA plans to build a new terminal and related facilities, the north end development program, which is demand driven; the timing and scope will depend, in part, on post Sept. 11 traffic patterns.
Costs of this program are not included in the $2.7 billion.
SEA expects to issue an additional $1 billion in debt to complete this capital program, as well as use excess cash, PFC, and AIP letter of intent (LOI) monies.
In 2001, SEA expanded U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 5
Pacific Region (15 Airports)
Dept. of the Airports of the City of Los Angeles-- Los Angeles International Airport: Part of Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), LAX is the nation's third busiest airport and the principal gateway to the West Coast.
LAX continues to develop priorities for its long-range capital plan, the LAX 2015 master plan, which was initiated in 1994.
Prior to September 2001, LAWA had released the draft environmental impact reports for the proposed LAX master plan and was gathering public input concerning several alternative approaches, with total costs estimated to range from $12 billion to $15 billion.
In the wake of Sept. 11, LAWA is developing an alternative that reduces emphasis on expansion and increases focus on security improvements.
LAX's last major improvements were for the 1984 Olympics, which targeted capacity at 40 million passengers.
LAX gridlock is forecast at 79 million passengers without expansion, and LAX served 67 million passengers in fiscal 2001.
With the Master Plan being re-evaluated, LAWA has deferred many planned projects in its $824 million short-term CIP (fiscal years 2001Â­2003).
Reversing a seven-year old policy from his predecessor not petitioning for FAA grants, the new Mayor of Los Angeles has directed LAWA to apply for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants at LAX.
Funding sources going forward can include airport revenue, AIP grants, commercial paper, GARBs, and PFC funds.
LAX collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
Airport Commission of the City and County of San Francisco -- San Francisco International Airport: The primary airport for the Bay Area, SFO
Public Finance its commercial paper program from $100 million to $250 million.
SEA collects a $4.50 PFC.
State of Hawaii, Hawaii Airports System -- Honolulu International Airport (HNL): One of the busiest airports in the Pacific, HNL serves mostly tourist passengers to the Hawaiian Islands.
The system is composed of 15 airports on six islands and has a monopoly on providing commercial airport service in Hawaii, an essential service given the state's isolation and its island configuration.
HNL, the largest airport in the system, is accompanied by four smaller airports, three of which (Kahului Airport in Maui, Kona Airport in Hawaii, and Lihue Airport in Kauai) served over one million enplanements in fiscal 2000.
The system's relatively modest 2002Â­ 2007 CIP totals $491 million, $96 million of which has been spent already.
Like other airports in the post Sept. 11 environment, Hawaii's CIP is still in the process of rescoping and reprioritization to reflect the latest security needs.
Appropriations for CIP projects must be made by the Hawaii State Legislature.
In 2001, the Airports Department cash-defeased $160 million of outstanding debt.
Hawaii currently does not collect PFCs and does not expect to issue new money debt in the near term.
California Maritime Infrastructure Authority -- San Diego Unified Port District/San Diego International Airport (SAN): The main airport for San Diego County and San Diego City, the nation's seventh largest city, SAN is implementing its $259 million short-term CIP.
Projects in this CIP are scheduled to be complete between 2002 and 2006.
In 2002, SAN is pursuing environmental review of steps one and two of its master plan that includes terminal, parking, and vehicle access improvements through 2010.
Land acquisition and airfield expansion projects account for roughly $143 million of the CIP.
The short-term CIP is to be funded through AIP grants, PFC revenue, SAN cash, and short-term borrowing.
SAN's master plan includes potential long-term development scenarios to 2020, including a potential new runway for SAN's constrained airfield.
Even if another runway is built, SAN is projected to reach operational capacity by 2020Â­2025.
California Assembly Bill 93 (AB93), creating a new San Diego County Regional Airport Authority (SDCRAA) was signed into law in 2001 and in its current form contains more questions than answers for SAN.
The title transfer of SAN from the California Maritime Infrastructure Authority to the new SDCRAA will take place on Dec. 2, 2002 barring urgency legislation.
SAN collects a $3.00 PFC.

City of San Jose -- San Jose International Airport (SJC): Renamed the Norman Y.
Mineta San Jose International Airport in Nov. 2001, SJC is the main airport for California's Silicon Valley and accounts for roughly 20% of the greater Bay Area's flights.
Prior to Sept. 2001, SJC's long-term CIP contained roughly $1.6 billionÂ­$2.0 billion in projects to handle its significant capacity constraints, expansion needs, and local transportation requirements.
This CIP is currently under review for potential changes and security projects.
SJC's second runway, 30R, was opened in August 2001, which was largely financed by series 2001 GARBs.
A new interim federal inspection service (FIS) facility is under construction and expected to be open in 2002.
Once its four transportation projects are within two years of completion, SJC is expected to begin construction on a new terminal, to increase its total gates from 31 to 40.
No additional long-term debt is anticipated to be issued until the CIP has been further reviewed.
SJC has a $100 million commercial paper limit and was awarded $81 million in LOI grants for this CIP.
In April 2001, SJC implemented its $4.50 PFC authorization.
Port of Oakland -- Oakland International Airport: Accounting for 23% of Bay Area flights, the Port of Oakland's aviation division has approximately $1.75 billion in airport improvement projects in its 2002Â­2012 CIP for the north (air cargo) and south (OAK) airports.
These projects focus on the $1.39 billion expansion of the passenger terminal, concourses, and gates, a six-level parking structure, and a two-level roadway at OAK.
The remaining $363 million will be spent on improvements to the north and south fields.
The Port's aviation CIP will be funded from $176 million in retained earnings, $163 million PFC pay-as-you go revenue, $261 million in PFC-secured bonds, $155 million in AIP grants, $148 million in commercial paper, and $640 million in port authority revenue bonds.
The Port expects to issue debt in late fiscal years 2001Â­2002 or early fiscal years 2002Â­ 2003, then possibly, every other year through 2009, though a schedule has not been finalized.
The Port collects $3.00 PFCs.
Orange County, CA, -- John Wayne Airport (SNA): As Orange County's only commercial airport, SNA is undertaking its $41 million five-year CIP (2002Â­2006).
Of this, SNA is expected to finance $24 million from airport revenues and reserves and $17 million is anticipated from the FAA for AIP-eligible projects.
JWA prioritized the
Public Finance planned airport improvement projects that are eligible for FAA grant funding.
SNA's focus is on urgent security related projects to comply with the Aviation Security Act, as well as several other projects, including seismic remediation for its parking garage and elevated roadways, and a new fire station.
SNA does not anticipate issuing bonds in the near term.
SNA does not collect a PFC charge but may apply for authorization in 2002.
Sacramento County Airport System -- Sacramento International Airport (SMF): While terminal A opened in 1998, offering 12 new gates to SMF, Sacramento's current focus is on parking capacity.
SMF is currently updating its long-term CIP and continues to implement its short-term CIP (2000Â­ 2004) with approximately $200 million in projects, $163 million of which is dedicated for SMF.
Of this, $70 million is allocated for a new 4,250-space parking garage and approximately $40 million for various airfield improvements.
Mather Airport, Sacramento's air cargo field, has $29 million of projects included in the CIP.
Almost $60 million of series 2002 revenue bond debt, $6 million of special facility bond debt, $42 million of AIP grants, and $46 million of retained earnings are anticipated to finance the CIP. SMF had a $3.00 PFC charge but began collecting a $4.50 PFC on Feb. 1, 2002.
Airport Authority of Washoe County -- RenoWashoe International Airport (RNO): RNO recently completed the final draft of its terminal area master plan, which looks at development in three time phases Â­ for the years 2005, 2010, and 2020.
This report will provide plans for long-term growth for the entire airport and its related facilities.
RNO has also completed a concession master plan that is being implemented for which new food and beverage concessions are being built and should be completed by the second quarter of 2002.
Since Sept. 11, RNO has held up on all other capital projects, which are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis on whether to move forward.
The current PFC will be amended to move a $10 million cargo ramp project out for two years and substitute that project with debt service pay-go.
The 2010 CIP has expenditures of $19 million, including improved airside signage, phase V of the terminal ramp reconstruction, and land acquisition, which will be financed by RNO revenues, AIP grants, and PFC funds.
RNO does not anticipate issuing any new debt but may refund its outstanding series 1992 bonds.
RNO collects a $4.50 PFC charge.
Dept. of the Airports of the City of Los Angeles -- Ontario International Airport (ONT): Part of Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), Ontario International Airport serves the inland empire of Southern California and is located about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
ONT is in the beginning stages of developing a 20-year master plan for the airport that is expected to take approximately two years.
As a result, estimates are not currently available for the projected cost to complete the master plan or to implement the projects that it will entail.
In the near term, several airfield projects are expected to begin construction in 2002.
These projects include the $34.2 million reconstruction of runway 26R and the $20.2 million westerly extension of taxiway N. Funding for both projects is expected to include AIP grants.
In addition, $8.4 million has been approved in PFC funds for the taxiway N westerly extension project.
ONT collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
State of Alaska -- Alaska International Airports System (AIAS) -- Anchorage International Airport (ANC) and Fairbanks International Airport (FAI): With the entire state of Alaska as its service area, AIAS has a five-year CIP (2002Â­2006) that contains $330 million in demand-driven projects at its two airports, ANC and FAI.
This CIP takes into account the events of Sept. 11 on the AIAS.
Major projects include completion of the $230 million Gateway Alaska terminal redevelopment project at ANC that is scheduled to fully open in the second quarter of 2004.
Aside from this, airfield projects at ANC and FAI account for $181 million in expenditures, $52 million in terminal projects, $47 million in environmental mitigation, and $18 million in safety projects.
ANC is one of the busiest cargo airports in the world.
Both FAI and ANC have recently begun collecting PFCs, which will assist in funding the CIP. AIAS plans to finance the majority of its CIP through two GARB issues, $143 million in the first quarter of 2002 and roughly $150 million in 2004, $120 million in AIP grants, and $13 million in PFC revenue.
AIAS collects a $3.00 PFC charge at ANC and at FAI. Spokane County -- Spokane International Airport (GEG): Serving the inland northwest area of Washington State, Idaho and Montana, GEG currently has $81 million of phase I projects from 2002Â­2005, $53 million of phase II projects scheduled from 2006Â­2010, and $242 million of long-term phase III projects from 2010Â­2020.
Through 2005, projects include rehabilitation and U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 7
Public Finance relocation of taxiways, additional cargo aprons, a new access road, and relocation of the airfield perimeter road.
These projects will be funded by AIP and PFC revenues, as well as excess cash.
No additional long-term debt is anticipated until 2007Â­ 2009.
GEG is making infrastructure improvements to enhance future capacity that should maintain effective rates and charges with use of nondebt financing.
Current phase II projects include extending the primary runway.
GEG collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
City of Fresno -- Fresno Yosemite International Airport (FAT): The main airport for California's fertile San Joaquin Valley, Fresno has a $55.5 million CIP (2001Â­2007).
Already funded with series 2000 bonds and AIP funds, the CIP includes terminal and concourse expansion and improvements, landside improvements, airside improvements, and more parking capacity.
The airport's airside/landside portion of its CIP will be completed soon, and the terminal building renovation and expansion should be completed in 2002.
Since Sept. 11, FAT has deferred a $2.1 million AIP grant for taxiway reconstruction to be used instead for security system upgrades.
Otherwise, nothing in the CIP is changed.
Fresno does not expect to issue additional debt in the near to medium term and collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
Rocky Mountain/Southwest Region (10 Airports)
that are on hold are the eighth runway project (roughly $350 million), the proposed terminal F project (roughly $840 million), and a proposed lightrail system connecting DFW to the Dallas DART and to Fort Worth's T light-rail system.
DFW collects a $3.00 PFC and has authorization to collect $1.7 billion in PFC revenue.
City and County of Denver -- Denver International Airport: Serving the largest city in the Rocky Mountains and 55% of Colorado's population, DEN has a five-year CIP (fiscal years 2002Â­2007) that contains approximately $787 million of planned projects and an additional $804 million of demandresponsive projects.
Major projects include the proposed sixth runway, a United Airlines regional jet facility, an airport hotel, and various other airfield projects and roadway projects.
Following Sept. 11, DEN reviewed its CIP and decided to defer or decelerate approximately $500 million in capital projects.
This impacted several major projects, including the United Airlines regional jet facility, a parking structure, and a hotel.
Other major projects currently underway, including the sixth runway, will continue, and the length of project deferral is dependent on air traffic.
DEN currently expects to fund the active projects through $60 million in commercial paper in 2002, replenishing the capacity together with issuing $150 million in refunding debt in 2002.
Future new money capital requirements are expected to be met through commercial paper capacity, annually converted to fixed- or variable-rate GARBs.
PFC revenues are expected to contribute $400 million, and AIP grants should supply an additional $110 million.
DEN collects a $4.50 PFC charge.
Clark County -- Las Vegas McCarran International Airport: LAS is the busiest airport in the State of Nevada and principal air service provider for the nation's largest gaming center.
Its $1.5 billion CIP (2001Â­2011) includes mostly landside projects.
About $400 million of projects (D gate expansion and consolidated rental car facility) are being temporarily deferred since Sept. 11 and should proceed when traffic rebounds.
The major assignment is a 10-gate expansion of concourse D, and another 10-gate expansion of concourse D may occur in future years.
Other projects are based on preliminary activities, such as design, engineering, land development, and utility and roadway relocation, for a new terminal -- terminal three.
At complete buildout, the county estimates the new terminal will include 16 gates and related facilities and
Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth -- Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport: DFW, the corporate headquarters for American Airlines, has a six-year (2001Â­2006) CIP with $2.6 billion in projects.
Incorporated in the CDP are $224 million in airfield projects and runway extensions, $256 million of support infrastructure projects, and $159 million of roads and parking projects, although $204 million in near-term projects are temporarily deferred.
The new $1 billion international terminal, terminal D, containing 23 international or domestic swing gates, will consolidate existing international flights, centralize the FIS facility and have a 7,000-space parking garage.
DFW's $847 million automated people mover (APM) is its second-largest project.
Terminal D and the APM, both scheduled to open in 2005, represent 77% of the CDP's total cost.
DFW expects to issue $500 million of GARBs in the spring of 2002, $400 million in the early winter of 2002, and $300 million in the spring of 2003.
DFW issued $650 million of new money and refunding bonds in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Three long-term projects U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 8
Public Finance construction of a new consolidated rental car facility.
Due to the tremendous demand and relative lack of space at LAS, Clark County is considering development of a new airport in Ivanpah Valley, NV -- about 35 miles southwest of Las Vegas, but the new airport is a long-term project and the scope and timing of the new facility are still premature.
LAS currently expects to issue an additional $600 million of subordinate revenue and PFC-secured bonds for development of terminal three, subject to aviation demand.
LAS charges a $3.00 PFC and is authorized to collect $1.7 billion by the FAA, of which roughly $340 million has already been collected.
City of Houston Airport System (HAS) -- George Bush Intercontinental, William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), and Ellington Field (EFD): Consisting of a major large-hub international airport, a medium-hub domestic airport, and a cargo airport (IAH, HOU, and EFD, respectively), HAS serves the needs of the largest city in Texas.
Its ongoing CIP (1997Â­2006), estimated at $2.8 billion, seeks to accommodate the dominant carriers at IAH and HOU, Continental and Southwest.
The current portion of the CIP (2002Â­ 2006) represents $1.3 billion in projects.
The majority of the total CIP, approximately $2.0 billion, is for various projects at IAH.
These projects include one new runway, the extension and widening of a second runway, various additional airfield projects, the terminal A/B program, terminal C rehabilitation, and the international services expansion program.
HOU accounts for approximately $408 million in improvements, including two new replacement concourses, terminal building renovations, various airfield projects, and a new parking garage.
EFD projects and HAS system-wide improvements account for an additional $175 million in projects.
Following Sept. 11, HAS expects major elements of the CIP will continue on schedule, although $335 million of projects will be delayed by at least six months through 2006.
Many remaining projects are critical elements that have already begun, have long construction periods, or continue to be required regardless of the slowdown.
Additional debt, AIP grants, and retained earnings are expected to finance the remainder of the HAS CIP.
HAS has been approved for a 10-year LOI from the FAA for $100 million in discretionary funds, subject to annual federal appropriations.
The amount of debt, which could be as much as $790 million, depends on the level of AIP funds HAS will receive.
HAS does not collect PFCs.
City of San Antonio -- San Antonio International Airport (SAT): The third busiest airport in Texas, SAT, has a $425.6 million 10-year (2002Â­2011) CIP to accommodate the expected continued passenger growth at SAT and to rehabilitate facilities at SAT and Stinson Field, SAT's general aviation airport.
The current CIP projects reflect SAT's 1998 master plan study that determined airfield and terminal capacity is insufficient and also considers adjustments in project schedules as a result of Sept. 11.
The CIP includes several runway and taxiway projects, as well as the construction of two new terminal concourses to replace the outdated terminal two.
Also included is expansion to the SAT's parking facilities and roadway system.
In addition to the series 2002 bonds, funding sources are expected to be $27 million in future GARBs, $70 million in future PFC bond issues, payÂ­go PFCs, department funds, and federal AIP grants.
Tentative bond offerings include a $100 million GARB and $38 million PFC-secured issue in 2002.
SAT collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
City of Albuquerque -- Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ): The only commercial airport in the State of New Mexico, the Sunport's 25-year master plan should be finalized by summer 2002.
ABQ is currently implementing its $396 million 2002Â­2007 CIP, much of which is for the latter years.
ABQ has excess capacity for both its landside and airside operations, with six vacant gates and capacity for 37 additional daily flights at its terminal building, and most projects will be roadway and parking projects.
Currently, ABQ has $34.8 million of renewal projects, $20.5 million of rehabilitation projects, and $340 million of new projects.
Goals of the master plan update, in addition to assessing infrastructure needs through 2025, are to implement projects only as demand-responsive or as necessary.
Based on demand, ABQ tentatively plans to issue roughly $256 million of GARBs, most of which would be for the new terminal between 2004Â­ 2007.
ABQ collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
City of Tucson -- Tucson International Airport (TUS): Serving the Tucson greater area of southern Arizona, TUS is currently implementing its $121 million 2001Â­2005 CIP. Its series 2001 bonds and PFC revenues funded the airport's 2001 projects, including a $54 million terminal expansion and an $8 million land acquisition purchase for future expansion.
All 2001 projects are funded and should be complete by January 2004.
In addition to the 2001 projects, the $55.2 million five-year CIP includes a U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 9
Public Finance $16.5 million parking garage, to be built and open in 2002, $10 million for continuation of the sound insulation program, $6.6 million of additional land acquisition, and other smaller projects.
TUS management is assessing the timeline of these remaining projects in the post Sept. 11 environment, and while some may be delayed, TUS does not expect any projects to be cancelled.
An additional debt issuance may be necessary to develop this CIP, though no schedule has been developed.
TUS collects a $3.00 PFC charge.
City of El Paso -- El Paso International Airport (ELP): ELP's five-year CIP (fiscal years 2001Â­2006) contains $104 million for four major projects.
These projects include a $6 million runway extension, an $11 million four-mile roadway extension, a new 144,000 square foot cargo facility at the airport's Industrial Park, and several aircraft parking ramps.
ELP's primary focus is on expanding and improving its cargo facilities, as it is the principal cargo airport for the maquiladora industry of El Paso and Juarez, Mexico.
This five-year capital plan will be completely funded by internal revenues and PFC revenues.
Unlike many other airports, ELP is not forced to postpone any of its capital projects in the wake of Sept. 11.
ELP collects a $3.00 PFC.
City of Corpus Christi -- Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP): The regional airport of the southern coastal area of Texas, CRP is in the midst of its $30 million 2000Â­2005 CIP, roughly $12 million has been expended as of January 2002.
Approximately $7 million of terminal improvements have been completed, and the majority of remaining projects are two runway extensions, other airfield work, and updating the airport's master plan, all expected to be funded through AIP grants and local sources.
No additional debt is expected through 2006.
CRP collects a $3.00 PFC and is currently applying for a $4.50 authorization.
Midwest Region (Nine Airports)
City of Chicago -- O'Hare International Airport: The world's second busiest airport and a hub for both United and American Airlines, as well as United's corporate headquarters, ORD has $9.66 billion in capital needs, mostly unescalated figures, through 2015.
These projects accounted for in the World Gateway Program (WGP), the Airfield Reconfiguration Plan (ARP), and the CIP.
The $1.56 billion WGP Phase I, to be developed over roughly six years and to address capacity needs U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 10
through 2012, entails construction of two new passenger terminals, two new federal customs inspection facilities, and redevelopment of existing terminals.
Terminal six and concourse K extension will add 23 new gates, providing the space necessary to relocate carriers from concourses E, F, and L to make way for the construction of terminals two and four.
The terminals will accommodate newer larger aircraft and should reduce flight delays.
Runways are not part of the WGP.
Phase II of the WGP, with plans for a new terminal four and a reconstructed terminal two, is subject to future negotiations between the city and the airlines, and costs are not yet assessable.
The city expects that WGP phase I will be funded by $200 million in federal grants, $700 million in PFC funding, and $650 of bond proceeds through 2006.
In December 2001, a $6 billion (unescalated) agreement between the Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Chicago was reached regarding ORD's medium- to long-term airfield expansion plans.
Included in the ARP agreement are: one new runway, reconfiguration of ORD's seven existing runways, a new traffic entrance on the western side of ORD, and an additional $450 million in soundproofing of nearby homes and schools.
Also, Meigs Field will remain open until Jan. 1, 2026 but could be closed any time after Jan. 1, 2006, if allowed under state law.
As long as Meigs remains open, its operating expenses will be financed by ORD's major airlines, UAL and American.
After land acquisition, construction on the ARP could begin by 2006, with construction of the south runway allowed after 2011.
Under terms of the deal, both the mayor and the governor are committed to push for construction of a new airport in suburban Peotone, IL.
In addition to PFC funds and federal grants, the city expects $6 billion in bonds will be required by 2015, as the $6 billion in construction costs is an unescalated figure.
Finally, ORD's $2.1 billion, five-year (2002Â­ 2006) CIP focuses primarily on roadways and parking projects.
Traffic entering the airport at I-90 will be redirected.
A new access to the airport will be created, and a new parking structure will be built at lot E, which will be located near the airport transit system.
The city projects $170 million in federal grants, $450 million of previously issued PFC bonds, $250 million of additional PFC funding and $1.2 billion of bond proceeds will finance the CIP. ORD collects a $4.50 PFC charge.

Northeast Region (13 Airports)
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY -- Newark International Airport, NJ -- LaGuardia Airport, NY (LGA): Together, these three airports serve the nation's largest metropolitan region and represent the main international gateway from Europe.
In 2001, EWR accounted for roughly 37% of NYC's total passengers, JFK for 36%, and LGA for 27%.
Of these, roughly 31% of the NYC passengers were on international flights.
JFK's $10 billion CIP (2001Â­2015) is currently the largest in the nation, and the majority of costs will be spent by 2005.
By the end of this program, all of JFK's passenger terminals will be virtually rebuilt, financed with Port Authority and airline funds.
Significant projects in this plan include the $1.2 billion terminal four, formerly known as the international arrivals building, which opened in May 2001, and American Airlines is financing the new $1.5 billion terminal, which began construction in 2001 and is scheduled to open in 2006.
Other major projects at JFK include the $1.7 billion JFK airtrain (roughly $1.1 billion of which will be financed by PFC funds), linking the airport to the New York City subway system and the Long Island Railroad by 2003; $270 million for a new terminal (from terminals five and six); $100 million for infrastructure improvements to terminals two, three,

Public Finance and four; $400 million for roadway and parking improvements; and major airfield and cargo facility improvements.
EWR, a hub airport for Continental Airlines, is undergoing expansion projects that total approximately $3.8 billion through 2015, approximately $1.0 billion of which has been spent so far.
Among these projects are the EWR airtrain connection to Amtrak and New Jersey Transit rail systems which opened in October 2001; major terminal investment including $280 million in terminal A; an $800 million Continental Airlines global gateway project at terminal C and cargo facility improvements; $300 million in roadways and parking structure expansion; and multiple airfield projects.
LGA, the most capacity constrained of the three airports, is modernizing its facilities, airfield, and roadways in a plan that is expected to cost $2 billion over the next 15 years, though the majority should be spent through 2005.
The Port Authority is currently reviewing its capital plan and, in light of Sept. 11, will make necessary adjustments.
To implement the CIP, the Port Authority expects to use pay-as-you-go capital and issuance of consolidated bonds based on the cash flow needs and progress of the projects, including the use of PFCs to fund a portion of the airtrain projects.
The Port Authority has traditionally expended roughly a third of its capital projects with cash financing.
Airlines have contributed a significant amount of investment at the Port Authority airports already and this will continue into the future.
The Port Authority collects a $3.00 PFC charge at each of the three airports.
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) -- Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA): Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, MWAA was implementing is 2000Â­ 2006 $4.21 billion CIP for its two airports, DCA and IAD. MWAA's Board is currently reviewing its CIP and should issue a post Sept. 11 update in the second or third quarter of 2002.
IAD, one of the fastest growing large-hub airports in the U.S., is the primary focus of the CIP, with projects that include cargo facility expansion, parking garage construction, additional concourses, a people mover system, terminal demolition, renovation and construction, a fourth runway, a new air traffic control tower, and various airfield improvements.
DCA's main projects are the renovation of historic terminal A and the pedestrian tunnel.
The timing and funding schedule of these projects will be known when the MWAA board approves its revised CIP.
Prior to Sept. 11, MWAA had proposed issuing roughly $3.0 billion of GARBs through 2006.
MWAA currently expects to issue $250 million of debt in the second quarter of 2002 and collects a $4.50 PFC charge.
Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) -- Boston Logan International Airport: Prior to September 2001, Massport was implementing its $1.7 billion 2000Â­2005 CIP for Logan International.
Due to uncertainties of short- and medium-term passenger demand at BOS, the busiest airport in New England, management revised the CIP to rely on cash and existing bond proceeds through 2003.
As such, the traditional five-year CIP is currently and indefinitely on hold in favor of a two-year CIP.
The current 2002Â­2003 CIP defers $280 million of projects, including the new FIS facility at terminal three from the five-year CIP, from $749 million to $469.5 million.
Current projects include the $322 million international gateway project, $147 million for the roadway system, $365 for BOS acquisition of portions of the City of Boston's $14 billion big dig project, and $78 million for Massport's portion of the $482 million renovation of terminal A. Massport is proceeding with the environmental permitting for the new runway although the construction schedule for the runway is not yet determined.
No BOS projects have been cancelled, though most will be delayed for possibly up to one year until full traffic demand returns, and management expects that Massport will revert to a five-year CIP forecasting.
BOS may issue up to $275 million for airfield work, parking garage work, and the third harbor tunnel payments in 2003.
BOS collects a $3.00 PFC charge for its $927 million PFC authorization, roughly $292 million of which has been collected already.
City of Philadelphia -- Philadelphia International Airport (PHL): A major U.S. Airways hub and primary airport for Pennsylvania's largest city, PHL has $775 million of capital expansion and renovation projects from 2002Â­2007.
After opening its new $221 million runway in December 1999, PHL turned its attention to its terminal expansion needs.
In June 2001, PHL opened a 38-gate regional terminal, a new 12-gate terminal is under construction, and eight additional gates will be added to existing domestic terminals over the next three years.
GARBs were issued in July 2001 to complete the financing of these projects.
Other funding approvals, including PFC approvals, are also in place.
Several security system upgrades are being added since Sept. 11, as well as related TSA security mandates.
Funding sources will be PFC revenues, AIP grants, retained earnings, and U.S. Airport Debt 2002Â­2006: A Post Sept. 11 Survey 13
Public Finance additional debt, although the volume and schedule of additional bonds has not yet been determined.
A new master plan, which will assess PHL's transportation demand and capacity requirements over the next 20 years, is schedule for completion in the second quarter of 2002.
It is expected that airfield capacity expansion will be a key element of this plan.
PHL collects a $4.50 PFC.
Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) -- Baltimore-Washington International Airport: One of the nation's fastest-growing largehub airports and the busiest airport in the state of Maryland, BWI has a $1.2 billion capital plan, with most projects expected to be complete by 2007.

Public Finance City of Manchester -- Manchester Airport (MHT): MHT's 1997 master plan covered a 20-year horizon (1995Â­2015).
As then envisioned, the work was to be completed in the following three phases: short term (1995Â­2000), intermediate (2001Â­2005), and long term (2005Â­2015).
Major projects in the master plan encompassed the rehabilitation and extension of both runways, terminal expansion to 23 gates, parking garage construction, major roadway improvements, property acquisitions, and possible fuel farm and cargo facilities expansion, as well as wetland mitigation.
Due to the 1998 arrival of Southwest Airlines, the time frame for completion became a 10-year window, versus 20 years.
Available terminal facilities had to be immediately expanded (to 15 gates, completed in mid-1999), and the garage (completed in late 1999) had to be built then rather than in the intermediate phase.
Runway 6/24 work was completed in 2001, and the completion of rehabilitation and extension of runway 17/35 has been accelerated to 2003, versus 2005.
Simultaneously, a second phase terminal expansion (three to five gates) will begin in mid-2002.
There is a potential, demanddriven third phase terminal expansion contemplated to bring the total number of gates to 23.
Current total cost estimates of the master plan are in the $320 million range, of which $180 million has been financed.
MHT expects to offer $60 million in GARBs in mid-2002 to finance the second-phase terminal expansion and for front-end cash flow financing of the $56.7 million FAA eight-year LOI for the runway 17/35 work.
MHT collects a $3.00 PFC charge.

Opinion Moody's assigns an A1 rating, with a stable outlook, to the City of San Antonio, Texas, Airport System Improvement Revenue Bonds, Series 2002, and a A2 rating to the Passenger Facility Charge and Subordinate Lien Airport System Revenue Improvement Bonds, Series 2002.
The bonds will be used to finance a portion of this origination and destination (O
The A1 rating reflects the strong economy of the airport system's service area, the airport's diverse carrier mix, the modest debt and competitive costs after funding of the capital program, and the system's strong financial position.
Moody's notes that the airport has been impacted by the reduction in
air traffic following the September 11 terrorist attacks, but has demonstrated above average resilience.
AIRPORT SERVES A GROWING AND DIVERSE METROPOLITAN AREA The airport serves the nation's ninth largest city.
San Antonio's (GO rating of Aa2) economy is diverse, containing a significant hospitality sector, a still sizable military presence, large manufacturing concerns with an increasing aeronautical presence, growing business service operations, and an expanding health care component.
Moody's expects the city's local economy to remain strong given San Antonio's popularity as a tourist destination, continued job growth driven by successful redevelopment efforts, ongoing retail, manufacturing, and service industry development, and sustained expansion of the city's residential sector.
The largest tourist destination in Texas, the city of San Antonio attracts over eight million people annually.
Ongoing development of the city's retail, manufacturing, and business service sectors has contributed to continued employment growth, which has averaged approximately 3% annually for each of the last ten years.
This growth has enabled the city to, in recent years, maintain unemployment rates below both the state and the nation.
In addition, following the announced closure of Kelly Air Force Base, the city began a redevelopment plan for that facility, now called Kelly USA, and, through privatization of existing operations and new uses, has already created an additional 4,456 jobs.
PASSENGER TRAFFIC DOWN FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2001; RECOVERY EXPECTED IN 2003 The economic stability is reflected in a historically steady enplanement growth that has averaged 3.8% per year from 1995 through 2000.
Airport utilization, which is a measure of enplanements against the population of 2.23, is just above Moody's median of 2.1.
About two-thirds of the enplanements are busines-related trips, which includes conventioneers.
With the impact of reduced air travel following the terrorist attacks, traffic for calendar year 2001 was 5.6% lower than 2000; monthly data show September 2001 was 34.5% below September 2000, but traffic was rebounding by year-end, with December traffic down about 9.3% and, January 2002 down 6.4%.The airport benefits from a balanced mix of carriers: Southwest (senior unsecured debt rated Baa1), which maintained service levels after September 11, represents about 36% of enplanements.
American (B1) and Delta (Ba3) each provide about 15%, and the balance is distributed among other carriers.
While airlines have experienced a clear decline in credit quality since September 11, San Antonio's solid O
MASTER PLAN UPDATE CALLS FOR TERMINAL REDEVELOPMENT AND ADDITIONAL PARKING; MODEST ADDITIONAL DEBT EXPECTED The airport has developed a ten year capital improvement program to replace Terminal 2, the older facility on the airport, and increase parking capacity.
The program is planned in phases and can be scaled and timed to meet enplanement growth.
The $425 million program will be funded with about $200 million in bonds, including the present offerings.
With the current issues, debt per 2001 enplaned passengers is about $60 and will rise to $83 with the additional debt.
These ratios are competitive with those of other airports.
The airport has begun collecting a $3.00 passenger facility charge (PFC) that it will leverage with bonds also secured by a subordinate lien on net airport revenues.
These bonds, which include a 1.10 times rate covenant for airport net revenues and a gross pledge first lien on PFC collections, will also have a debt service reserve fund of average annual debt service.
PFC collections based on 2001 enplanements provide three times coverage of peak PFC bond debt service.
The senior airport revenue bonds are also
secured by a gross revenue pledge, and have a rate covenant and additional bonds tests that require 1.25 times net revenue coverage.
PASSENGER AND FINANCIAL OPERATIONS ARE STRONG The airport operates under a compensatory rate making methodology that also incorporates a revenue share mechanism with the signatory airlines.
Gates are leased under a mix of exclusive and preferential use arrangements.
Airline costs per enplaned passenger were a competitive $3.53 in 2001, and are expected to remain below $5.00 through 2011.
Debt service coverage has averaged 1.97 times over the past three years, and was 2.05 times for fiscal ending September 30, 2001, reflecting some revenue loss particularly parking - and increased O
Debt service coverage on senior bonds is forecasted to hover around two times through 2011.
The airport maintains strong liquidity, with working capital of $44 million at the end of fiscal 2001, compared to $47 million at the end of fiscal 2000.
Outlook The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that the airport's solid O
The stable outlook further incorporates the modular nature of the capital improvement program that can be scaled back if traffic growth does not resume.
