Colorado State Flag Department of Law line graphic _________________________________________________________________ April 14, 2000 ATTORNEY GENERAL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SHERIFF ISSUE CONSUMER ALERT ABOUT PYRAMID SCHEMES Attorney General Ken Salazar, 7th Judicial District Attorney Wyatt Angelo, and Delta County Sheriff William Blair issued a consumer advisory today warning consumers to be wary of marketing schemes purporting to offer legitimate business and investment opportunities that may be nothing more than illegal pyramid schemes.
Under Colorado law, a pyramid scheme is any program, which uses a pyramid, or chain process in which participants pay in excess of $50 for the opportunity to receive a payoff for inducing others to become participants.
In simple terms, a pyramid scheme is a program, which derives its funding primarily from the entry fees paid by newly recruited members rather than from the actual sale of products or merchandise to individuals outside of the program.
This advisory is being issued because of a recent upswing in complaints and inquiries along the Front Range and the Western Slope.
The typical inquiries involve programs that promise immediate cash payouts to participants in the program so long as they pay a required entry fee and recruit others to do the same.
The emphasis is on recruiting new participants to invest in the operation rather than marketing a product or service.
Because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish legitimate multi-level plans from illegal pyramids, consumers should carefully investigate a program before investing any money.
Specifically, consumers should ask the following questions: * Are promoters and participants making money simply by recruiting individuals? * Are actual products being sold to consumers outside of the program or are all product sales being made primarily to new recruits/investors in the program? * Is it easy to understand the true nature of the products and services or are they vague and confusing? * Are the main promoters of the business located in Colorado, and available to provide products, assistance, and buy back unsold inventory/refund monies, if necessary? * Ask yourself what the consumer market could possibly be for the products or services.
"There are many illegal pyramid schemes being promoted in Colorado and throughout the country," warned Attorney General Salazar.
"When compensation is based not on the sale of legitimate products, but solely upon the recruitment of new participants into the program, the program is an illegal pyramid scheme."
According to Salazar, any participation in pyramid programs constitutes unlawful conduct under Colorado's civil and criminal protection statutes.
"The great danger of every pyramid scheme," explained District Attorney Angelo, "is that as the pool of potential new investors dries up, later participants will necessarily lose their money."
According to Angelo, consumers should be very careful about being lured into a potentially illegal pyramid scheme because it is a mathematical certainty that most participants in these programs will lose their money, with very little chance of ever recovering it.
The Delta County Sheriff's Office has received inquiries the past several weeks about possible pyramids circulating in the community.
"If you are approached by anyone offering the chance to get in on a seemingly risk-free investment opportunity, please examine the program carefully before investing your hard-earned money," said Sheriff William Blair.
He cautioned Delta County residents about participating in pyramid schemes because participation in a pyramidscheme is a criminal misdemeanor in Colorado.
Consumers who wish to receive more information about pyramid schemes are urged to contact their local Better Business Bureau, the local district attorney's office or the Colorado Attorney General's Consumer Protection Office at (303) 866-5189 or 1 (800) 332-2071 (outside Denver).
In addition, consumers who have lost money through pyramid schemes can file a small claims or county court lawsuit against their up-line sponsors, and may be able to recover treble damages under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act.
