Marshall Space Flight Center April 20, 2000 "We bring people to space -- We bring space to people" Marshall Center boosts Alabama economy by $735 million in FY 1999 by Marianne Higgins arshall contributed $735 million to Alabama's economy in fiscal year 1999.
That contribution included $229 million in salaries for civil service personnel and related costs, as well as travel.
It also included $506 million spent on locally procured services, prime contractor and subcontractor support, and local construction.
Approximately $68 million in retirement annuities were paid in 1999 to 2,550 Marshall retirees residing in Alabama, with 1,475 retirees in Huntsville receiving $39 million of that amount.
The $735 million spent in Alabama was significantly more than the Marshall Center 's expenditures in any other state.
In addition, NASA funding of approximately $152 million was spent in North Alabama for International Space Station hardware M Photo by Emmett Givens, NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center Nine years and counting For the ninth year, students from 11 schools in North Louisiana visited Marshall.
The students, here last Monday, are members of the space science and mathematics club.
Among their many stops was the Earth Day exhibit set up in the lobby of Bldg. 4200.

See Economy on page 7 Monday marks 10 years in space for Hubble Telescope A spectacular morning launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery 10 years ago, on April 24, 1990, ushered in a new golden age of astronomy.
The payload in Discovery's cargo bay, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, was released by the crew into Earth orbit the next day and the universe hasn't looked the same since.
"This month marks the anniversary of one of the greatest observatories ever flown.
We have watched in awe as the Hubble Space Telescope has produced some of the most amazing images about the universe that surrounds us," said U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland.
"I am so proud of the NASA team that has worked to keep it running, and I'm pleased my support has kept your efforts funded and in business."
"Get Strong on Safety" -- Safety slogan submitted by Terry Christopher, QS10 Even though initially impaired by a flaw in its main mirror (it was expertly made but to the wrong "prescription," causing its images to be blurred), Hubble's position above the distortion of Earth's atmosphere enabled it to begin making major discoveries even before astronauts repaired it in 1993.
When corrective optics were installed during that dramatic first servicing mission, the universe suddenly snapped into sharp focus, and there followed a flood of spectacular images and discoveries which have forever changed how we view the cosmos
."Hubble's rate of discovery is simply unprecedented for any single observatory," said Dr. Ed Weiler, NASA's associate ministrator for Space Science in Washington, D.C., who has been associated with the Hubble program since 1978.
"But what may be even more important in the long term is what Hubble has given to just about everyone on Earth.
Hubble's spectacular images and discoveries of black holes, colliding galaxies and bizarre objects at the edge of the universe have been brought into millions of homes by newspapers, television and the Internet."
In its first 10 years, the 12.5-ton Earthorbiting Hubble has studied 13,670 objects, made 271,000 individual observations, and returned 3.5 terabytes of data, archived as a scientific treasure trove for future generations of astronomers.
Its rapid-fire scientific achievements have resulted in over 2,651 scientific papers.
"Not since Galileo aimed a small 30power telescope into the night sky in 1609 has humanity's vision of the universe been so revolutionized in such a short time span by a single instrument," said Dr. David Leckrone, Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
"The Hubble Space Telescope has See Hubble on page 5 Marshall Star guidelines help those submitting items he size and content of the Marshall Star have grown significantly in the past year.
Many of you are contributing news items, photographs and other items for publication and we appreciate that.
To help you, here are some guidelines to make the submission of material simple and easy to understand.
T Articles Articles, no more than three, double-spaced pages, should be submitted via e-mail as Word documents.
Preferred font is Geneva, 12 point.
Include the author 's name at the beginning of the article, and add a sentence at the end giving the author 's job title and organization.
Spell out the name of the organization rather than use organization codes.
When writing a story, answer these basic questions up front: who, what, where, when, why and how.
Articles should be written with clarity, for a general readership, without highly technical or bureaucratic language, and without acronyms.
A good rule of thumb is that if someone unfamiliar with your organization and what you do can understand the article, you have succeeded in telling your story.
who appears where in the photograph, job titles and organizations, written in easy-to-understand language, what they are doing, when the event occurred, and where.
An easy way to identify people in a photo is to use this format: "From left, Jane Doe, Jim Smith, Sally Sams."
Photographs should show something happening rather than static group shots of people.
The photo should tell a story.
If a group shot is absolutely necessary, please limit the number of people in the group to five.
Groups larger than five result in images too small to see who's in the picture, making identification difficult.
Deadlines Prior coordination with the editor will help you get your news in the Marshall Star in a timely manner.
To meet our publication schedules, deadlines must be met or we don't receive the Star on time.
All articles and photographs are due to the editor no later than noon on Monday of the week of publication.
Feature articles that are not time restrictive may be held for another issue, depending on news items that must run in any given week.
Not everything submitted to the Marshall Star can always appear exactly as it is submitted.
Articles are edited according to professional standards, and editorial judgment determines when an article will appear and in what format.
Space is limited, but every effort will be made to include your news.
Thanks for helping us make the Marshall Star the best newspaper in NASA.
If you have questions, call Marshall Star Editor Debra Valine at 544-3749.
Photographs The Marshall Star uses black and white hard copy photographs for the printed version, and color digital images made from color negatives for the online version.
Sometimes digital images are used.
However, if submitting a digital image, it should be a high-resolution file to ensure the best quality.
All photographs should include caption information such as Planning for the future Jonathan Lowe, left, a Franklin, Tenn., high school student who dreams of the day when he's a rocket scientist, recently spent the day with Dr. George Schmidt, deputy manager of Marshall's Propulsion Research Center.

Photo by Doug Stoffer, NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center Hubble Continued from page 1 seen further and more clearly than any visible-light telescope before it, and has revolutionized the science of astronomy.
It already has earned a place as one of the wonders of the modern world."
Hubble's photographic hall of fame includes the deepest view ever of the universe in visible light; a peek into the environs of supermassive galactic black holes; the majestic birth of stars in monstrous stellar clouds; planetary systems forming around other stars; extraordinary arcs, shells and ribbons of glowing gas sculpted by the deaths of ordinary stars; mega-megaton blasts produced by the impact of a comet into the cloud tops of Jupiter; the surface of mysterious Pluto; and galaxies at the edge of space and time.
Hubble was conceived to tackle scientific goals that could be accomplished only by an observatory in space.
Its mission is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos.
Crucial to fulfilling this objective is a series of on-orbit servicing missions by Space Shuttle astronauts.
The first servicing mission took place in December 1993 and second servicing mission was flown in February 1997.
Last December, servicing mission 3A was performed.
These missions extended Hubble's scientific power with new instruments; modernized its systems with new technology; and performed critical maintenance and repairs of its optics, solar arrays, gyros and other components.
As a result of these improvements, Hubble is a far more capable observatory than when it was launched.
Future servicing missions to Hubble are planned for 2001 and 2003.
The telescope is named after U.S. astronomer Edwin P. Hubble who, early in this century, discovered galaxies beyond our Milky Way and made the first rough measurements of the expansion rate of space.
Now, after 70 years of debate and speculation, astronomy has come full circle: scientists using the Hubble Telescope have detected galaxies out to the visible horizon of the universe, and have accurately pinned down the size, expansion rate and age of the universe.
Hubble will be decommissioned in 2010, and replaced by the Next Generation Space Telescope.
Having a much larger mirror, the Next Generation Space Telescope will pick up where Hubble left off by searching for the faint glimmer of light from the first stars ever born in the universe.
Beyond the Next Generation Space Telescope, ever larger and more advanced telescopes will search for Earth-like extrasolar planets and evidence for life beyond our solar system.
The Hubble Space Telescope is managed and operated by Goddard for the Office of Space Science at NASA Headquarters.
The Space Telescope Science Institute manages the Hubble Telescope's science observing program under contract to NASA.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.

Now, imagine ingesting a capsule of similar size, containing microscopic sensors to detect, diagnose and treat disease inside the human body.
It sounds like science fiction.
However, NASA, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is working to turn this vision into "science fact."
The development of such technologies will improve life on Earth and one day revolutionize medicine and space travel.
The joint collaboration comes as NASA and the cancer institute each move forward with historic initiatives requiring major advances in available technology.
The institute is attempting to define cancer for the first time based on the unique molecular characteristics of tumors.
NASA is seeking to develop a new form of patient care -- "microscopic explorers" -- that would travel through the human body looking for disease.
This technology will allow NASA to monitor astronaut health and treat conditions in space, where medical test capabilities and communication with Earth will be limited.

Economy Continued from page 1 development by The Boeing Co., while approximately $41 million was spent on other NASA programs in which Marshall had a supporting role.
Marshall received approximately 17 percent -- or $2.3 billion -- of NASA's total budget of $13.7 billion during fiscal 1999.
Of Marshall's allocation, $1.32 billion was spent for Human Space Flight activities; $623 million for Science, Aeronautics and Technology; and the balance of $367 million went to mission support at the Marshall Center and other sites across the country.
Since it was established in 1960, the Marshall Center has had budget responsibility for more than $64.9 billion.
When yearly figures are adjusted for inflation, this total is equivalent to more than $160 billion in 1999 dollars.
Through September 1999, the Marshall Center paid $4.8 billion in federal salaries since its creation in 1960.
April 20, 2000 At the end of September, Marshall's permanent and temporary civil service employees totaled 2,637, including employees at resident offices at prime contractor facilities and at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, La.
Of that workforce, 2,134 were college graduates, with 1,438 holding bachelor 's degrees.
There were 154 employees with doctorate degrees and 542 with master 's degrees in fields of engineering, science -- predominantly mathematics and physics -- as well as other disciplines, predominantly business administration.
During 1999, approximately 25,188 contractor personnel engaged in work for the Marshall Center, including 2,612 in mission support, 10,249 on prime contract work and 12,327 as subcontractors and vendors.
Of the total, 6,473 worked in Alabama.
Addition- ally, 1,554 contractors were associated with International Space Station work being done by Boeing in Huntsville and other NASA work supported by Marshall.
