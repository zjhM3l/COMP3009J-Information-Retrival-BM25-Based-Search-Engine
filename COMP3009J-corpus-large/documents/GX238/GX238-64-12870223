Re:
Proposal to classify evaporated milk as a Class IV product
Dear Mr. McKee: This proposal is submitted on behalf of O-AT-KA Milk Products Cooperative, Inc.
("O-AT-KA").
O-AT-KA is owned by the farmers belonging to Upstate Farms Cooperatives, Inc., Niagara Milk Cooperative, Inc. and Dairylea Cooperative Inc.
Total membership of these cooperatives is over 2000 producers located in several northeastern states.
O-AT-KA is hereby requesting that the USDA schedule a hearing on an emergency basis for this proposal to classify evaporated milk in consumer-type packages (referred to as Evap) as a Class IV product.
The problems resulting from Evap's current mis-classification as a Class ITI product will become ever more acute in the very near future because of changes in market conditions and USDA policies relative to class price formulas and support program purchase prices.
The livelihoods of farmers owning and supplying O-AT-KA, and those farmers supplying other Evap processors, will be placed in jeopardy if this issue is not addressed administratively on an emergency basis.
Mr. Richard M. McKee January 28, 2003 Page "
The market for Evap products represents approximately 900 million pounds of milk according to the American Dairy Products Institute survey (see Attachment 1). j This survey also shows that the regular Evap market has been declining and is down by over 40% since 1979.
The largest manufacturer, Nestle, produces its product in California.
Nestle closed its other Evap plant located in New York in the early 1990s.
The higher milk cost in New York was likely a contributing factor in this plant closure.
Other manufacturers, in addition to O-AT-KA, are Diehl, Inc., which is based in Ohio with plants also in Michigan and Idaho, and Milnot Holding Corporation located in Missouri.
Historical Basis of Classification
USDA has placed Evap products in the lowest use classification for decades.
In the uniform classification decisions of 1974 that reviewed Class I, II and III classification, USDA stated:
",4 Class II classification should not apply to evaporated or condensed milk or skim milk in consumer-type containers as the cooperatives proposed.
Such storable products should remain in the lowest price class.
A Class III classification for producer milk in these products will permit such uses to remain as a competitive outlet for milk surplus to the needs of the Class I market.
Such products made from milk regulated under these orders must compete over wide areas with same products processed from ungraded milk or milk that is often priced at no more than the Minnesota-Wisconsin price.
Comparable pricing should prevail under these 32 orders.
" 49 Fed.
Reg. at 8491-8492 (1974).
When national uniform classification was considered in 1993, and specifically Class lI and Class III products were reviewed, Evap was again left unchanged in its Class III designation.
About that time, USDA created a separate and narrow use classification (IIIA) for nonfat dry milk only.
Pricing of Class m for much of this time was based on a competitive pay price survey known as the M-W price series.
In 1998 and 1999, when the Federal Order reform process was taking place, Evap yet again was left in its historical classification as a Class III milk product.
However, the lowest use or manufacturing classes were more definitively split between Class 1II and Class IV.
Class III became a cheese use class based on a cheese yield and cheese pricing formula.
A few other products such as anhydrous milkfat that are mostly butterfat were left in Class III, as the Department has considered it unnecessary to reclassify when there is the same

Mr. Richard M. McKee January 28, 2003 Page 3
mitkfat price for Class III and Class IV.
Reclassification of Evap with a high nonfat solids content to a more appropriate Class IV classification, however, was overlooked.
It is also important to understand, in contrast, the historical context for the nation's leading Evap manufacturer that is located in and operating under the California Marketing and Stabilization Plans (California State Order).
Historically in California, the lowest and residual classification of milk was Class 4 and since the early 1960s was based on butter and nonfat dry milk pricing formulae.
Until the late 1980s this classification contained not only butter and nonfat dry milk but also cheese and a number of other storable products including Evap.
When California created a separate cheese use classification, known as Class 4b, Evap remained in the residual classification which became Class 4a.
Therefore it continues to be based on butter and nonfat dry milk pricing formulas.
Thus, while Califomia classifies and prices Evap on a solids basis, the federal orders price it offthe cheese market.
Current and expected future problems in pricing Evap on a Class 1II cheese use basis will be increasingly damaging to the Federal Order marketers and are a compelling reason for reclassification.
Moreover, the expected increased disparity of treatment between Federal Order manufacturers and the market leader in California, as will be discussed, makes it all the more urgent for USDA to call a hearing promptly.
Evaporated Milk Belongs in Class IV Regular evaporated milk products are made by evaporation of water from raw milk resulting in a milk solids content of a minimum of 6.5% butterfat and 23% total solids.
Skim Evap and filled Evap are other Evap products with different standards of identity based on solids and fat.
The content or yield of Evap from raw milk is driven by the nonfat solids content of the incoming milk in a fashion similar to nonfat dry milk.
The higher the nonfat solids in the incoming milk, the less water needs to be evaporated and the more cans of product result from the raw milk.
Production of Evap is in no way related to protein-driven curd development so critical to cheese production and therefore has little relationship to the cheese yield-based Class III pricing formula.
Evap is retorted in steel cans so that it is sterile and has an un-refrigerated shelf life that can exceed I2 months.
Shelf life of a year or more with no need for refrigeration is a characteristic that historically caused USDA to identify Evap in the lowest use class.
Because of this shelf life, manufacturers have the flexibility to produce and inventory products for use in other time periods.
Therefore it made sense decades ago when USDA determined that Evap should be in the lowest use classification of storable manufactured
Mr. Richard M. tXlcKec January 28, 2003 Page 4
products, and nothing has changed in the meantime that would suggest putting Evap in other than the lowest classification.
However, there are now two manufacturing or storable product classes: Class 1II and Class IV.
Federal Order reform in 2000 made it plain that Class [II pricing is tailored exclusively for cheese products.
The decision hinged Class HI prices on the price of cheese, make allowances for cheese, and yields for cheese.
Evap in no way competes with cheese in product use.
Because evaporated milk is similar to powdered milk in that it has a long shelf life, does not need refrigeration and is based on nonfat solids rather than protein, (all characteristics more similar to nonfat dry milk than to cheese), it only makes sense that Evap, from a policy perspective, be placed in the same class as powdered milks.
The properties of storability and common with powdered milk mean that The problems resulting from the current placed in the Class IV category as soon nonfat solids-based yields that Evap shares in Class IV is now the appropriate classification.
mis-classification make it critical that Evap be as possible.
Increased Pricing Disparity Threatens Canned Evaporated Milk Manufacturers Operating Under Federal Orders The issues associated with classifying Evap as a Class 11I product instead of as a Class IV product are changing from policy considerations to harsh competitive realities because of changed regulations and market conditions.
First, the recent USDA decision (in the Class IU/Class IV hearing) will increase the Federal Order Class 111 price of milk used in Evap products - particularly the protein costs.
The difference in protein content creates a raw product cost difference between federal and non-federal manufacturers that cannot be recovered in the marketplace or on yields of product.
These changes make it obvious that evaporated milk should no longer be priced as Class Ill.
This decision also increases the average spread between Class ffl and Class IV (and California 4a) prices, making it even more disadvantageous to use Federal Order Class ffl milk for Evap products.
Second, the other major policy change that creates harsh competitive realities out of these policy concerns is the butter-powder tilt that was announced in November, 2002.
This decision reduced the nonfat dry milk support price to $0.80/lb.
Market prices of nonfat dry milk are dropping and forecasters believe that prices will ultimately fall near to the support price.
Once again, as with the Class III/Class IV decision, the average spread between Class III and Class IV (and California 4a) prices will increase.
Dr. Mark Stephenson, a leading dairy economist from Cornell University, has estimated that the
Mr. Richard M. McKee January 28, 2003 Page 5
spread may gow to as much as S2.75 per hundredweight this fall (see Attachment 2).
Thus, according to this forecast, cheese prices are expected to increase as milk supplies tighten, but nonfat dry milk prices are expected to remain fiat due to continued production particularly in California and the West Coast.
Other forecasters have suggested the possibility of an even wider spread.
The current futures markets also indicate a widening disparity this fall.
Adding urgency to this flawed classification for Evap is the presence in California of the nation's largest Evap manufacturer that pays for milk based on the Class 4a price, which is similar to and often lower than the Federal Order Class IV price.
All told the difference in raw milk prices could well soon be over $2.00/cwt.
Bids for Evap business are so competitive that they are won and lost on the basis of a few cents per case.
We believe a significant difference in price could exist for extended periods of time, giving the California plant a permanent competitive advantage.
The competitive advantage enjoyed by this California manufacturer threatens the business of O-AT-KA.
The vulnerable position faced by O-AT-KA is also faced by Milnot and Diehl, Inc.
The combined effects of USDA policy changes and market conditions threaten to force the Federal Order evaporated milk plants out of production, losing this market for the milk of Federal Order producers and causing the milk to be turned into powder that pays Class IV pricing.
Given the overall declining trend in Evap sales, clearly this is a product that cannot carry an additional burden of class prices higher than Class IV.
No Significant Impact on Blend Prices
Lowering the classification of Evap from Class 11I to Class IV will not have a significant impact on blend prices in the Federal Order system.
Based on our estimate that Nestle's market share (from its California plant) is about 50% and given a total pooled federal order supply of 120 billion pounds in 2001, we estimate that milk used to produce Evap under Federal Orders is less than Â½ of one percent of the Federally regulated milk supply.
Therefore, assuming an average price spread of $1.20 between Class 11I and Class IV, the average reduction in the blend price will be less than $0.005 per cwt.
Enabling Federal Order producers to compete for this Evap market by reclassifying Evap to Class IV would not hurt other dairy farmers by materially reducing their blend price, but failing to do so would seriously impact those dairy farmers who have invested in and/or otherwise supply milk for the Evap market.
In any event, this analysis overstates any resulting reduction because, due to the competitive factors described above, we expect of the Evap plants in the Federal Order system will stop production future unless the price of their milk is placed on a more competitive in the blend price that most, if not all, in the foreseeable Class IV basis.
If
Mr. Richard M. McKee January 28, 2003 Page 6
that occurs, milk that had been used for Evap and priced at tile Class llI price would end up as powder priced at the Class IV price (the same Class Iv" price as if this proposal is adopted).
In summary, we ask that USDA preserve the historical classification of Evap milk in the lowest manufacturing use class.
It is clear that Evap should be a Class IV product and not continue to be misclassified as a Class III cheese use.
Furthermore, given the impending price disparity discussed, the only way O-AT-K.A and its dairy farmer owners will receive relief is for USDA to call a hearing on an emergency basis and act as soon as possible in accordance with its authority under the APA (5 U.S.C.Â§ 557 (b)(2)), the AMAA, and departmental regulations.
7 C.F.R. Â§ 900.12.
The proposed change in the language of the nationwide classification provisions for Federal Orders is in Attachment 3.
The existing language of 7 C.F.R. Â§ 1000.40 (c)(l)(iii) includes condensed milk as well as evaporated milk in consumer-type packages.
not currently produce sweetened condensed products and therefore has addressed that product in this petition.
However O-AT-KA would not placing sweetened condensed milk in consumer packages in Class IV. sweetened O-AT-KA does not specifically object to also
