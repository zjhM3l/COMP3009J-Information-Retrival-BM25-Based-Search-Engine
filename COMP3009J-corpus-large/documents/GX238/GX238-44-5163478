His father was a close friend of Governor Ross Sterling, who once allowed young Briscoe to sleep in Sam Houston's bed in the Governor's mansion.
Briscoe graduated from the University of Texas in 1942 and then joined the Army, serving in the China-Burma-India theater.
He served in the legislature from 1949-57, where he promoted farm-to-market roads, which greatly enhanced the livelihood of rural Texans.
He then left politics to manage his family's ranching and business interests, becoming one of the state's leading ranchers.
He spearheaded efforts to eradicate the screwworm, a deadly menace to cattle.
Accomplishments: Briscoe was an attractive candidate to voters seeking an outsider untainted by the Sharpstown affair.
As governor, he took a conservative approach, concentrating on more efficient administration of existing services rather than adding new ones.
He kept his campaign promise of "no new taxes," the only Texas govenor of the modern era to hold that line.
He did back increased spending for highway improvements and signed into law the Texas Open Records Act, which protects the public's right to access to government agencies and records.
He was the first governor to be elected to a four-year term with his victory in 1974 (previous governors had served two-year terms).
Voters denied Briscoe another term in 1978.
Later years: Briscoe returned to Uvalde to manage his vast ranching and business interests.
Today, he serves as senior chairman of the First State Bank in Uvalde and continues to be active in all phases of cattle ranching.

Timeline
Bill Clements
January 16, 1979 - January 18, 1983
Born: April 17, 1917, in Dallas
Early Career: After his family lost their farm in the Depression, Clements worked as an oil-field roughneck before attending college.
The oil fields interested him more than school and he began a career in drilling.
In 1947, he and two partners borrowed the money to buy two oil drilling rigs, a venture that grew into SEDCO, the world's largest offshore drilling company.
Clements served as deputy U.S. secretary of defense in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
Accomplishments: Clements stunned political observers when he won an upset victory to become the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction.
He brought his business acumen to state government, insisting on sound budgeting and management policies.
He also worked for tough anti-crime measures and improvements in the teaching of basics in the public schools, and made strides in improving Texas relations with Mexico.
The beginnings of a severe economic downturn led to Clements' defeat for reelection in 1982.
Later years: Bill Clements became governor again in 1987.

William P. Clements
Timeline
Bill Clements
January 20, 1987-January 15, 1991
William P. Clements had previously served one term as governor.
In the interim, he had served as chairman of the board of governors of Southern Methodist University, a time at which the school was rocked by a scandal in the football program.
Clements spent much of his second term dealing with the continuing prison overcrowding problem.
He also was an enthusiastic supporter of the War on Drugs and other national crime prevention efforts.
The recession in Texas continued to be severe, and Clements focused his attentions on job creation, economic diversification, and the recruitment of out-of-state companies.
Texas was ordered by the courts to find a more equitable way of funding public schools between rich and poor districts, and considerable effort was spent trying to find a solution.
Later years: Today, Clements is retired from public life and lives in Dallas.
He operates two ranches in Forney and Kaufman where he raises black Brangus cattle.
