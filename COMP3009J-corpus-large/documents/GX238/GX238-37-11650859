To apply for the program contact the local Department of Social Services.
Qualified applicants must meet both the Medicaid Programs financial and medical requirements.
The local Department of Social Services determines financial eligibility.
The Medicaid Programs utilization control agent determines medical eligibility, with input from the applicants physician.
The Maryland Medicaid nursing home rate setting system was established in 1983.
The formula used to reimburse nursing homes is complex, and is based in part upon a patients need for care, including the following five activities of daily living: bathing, dressing, eating, mobility and continence; and behavioral management.
For more information regarding the Nursing Home Program, call 410-767-1444.
Frequently Asked Questions --FAQs
I need to place a loved one in a nursing facility under Medical Assistance.
What do I need to do?
First, apply for Medical Assistance through the local Department of Social Services in the county where the applicant resides (if the applicant is already in a nursing facility, the county in which the facility is located).
Generally, the applicant (or authorized representative) must apply in person.
The applicant must be certified as medically eligible for nursing facility services.
If the applicant is already in a nursing facility converting to Medical Assistance or in a hospital prior to being admitted to a facility, the facility or hospital will apply for medical eligibility.
If the applicant is in another setting, the applicant or representative must have the applicants physician complete the Medical Eligibility Review Form, DHMH 3871 and mail it to Delmarva Foundation for consideration.
The physician must also complete the MR/MI Screen Form as required under PASRR and contact the Adult Evaluation and Review Services (AERS) unit if necessary.
What does medically eligible mean? What are the medical eligibility criteria for Medicaid nursing facility benefits?
The Maryland Medical Assistance Program pays for nursing facility services only when it is medically necessary, that is, when a persons health condition is such that he requires care under the full-time supervision of a licensed nurse.
The need for intermittent, part-time services (for example, home health nursing) does not qualify one as medically eligible for nursing facility services, nor does the need for unlicensed care (e.g., personal care) even if care is needed full-time.
If a persons health condition is such that full-time care under licensing nursing supervision is needed, that person is said to be medically eligible for nursing facility services.
What is PASRR?
PASRR stands for Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review.
Congress instituted PASRR in 1987 in an effort to ensure that individuals with mental retardation (or related conditions) and mental illness receive services in the least restrictive appropriate setting.
PASRR is also designed to make sure that these individuals get the services they need to meet their unique needs.
Under PASRR, nursing facilities cannot admit or retain an individual who has a serious mental illness, mental retardation, or a related condition unless the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) or the Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA) has determined that a nursing facility placement is appropriate for the individual.
PASRR applies to all new admissions to nursing facilities that participate in the Medicaid Program, regardless of how the individuals nursing facility stay is being paid for.
During the admission process, the discharging hospital or admitting nursing facility screens potential new admissions using the MR/MI Screening Form.
If the individual has a serious mental illness, mental retardation or a related condition (also known as a positive screen), the hospital or nursing facility will contact the Adult Evaluation and Review Services (AERS) unit to evaluate the individual.
The AERS team consisting of a nursing and a social worker will evaluate the individuals medical and functional condition and special needs.
The team will send its findings to DDA or MHA, who will determine whether nursing facility admission is appropriate and what, if any, specialized services the individual requires.
Once admitted, if the residents condition changes, the nursing facility will contact AERS for a new evaluation and determination regarding continued stay in the nursing facility.
How much does Medical Assistance pay nursing facilities?
Maryland pays its nursing facilities under a case-mix system.
This means that, rather than paying all facilities one set rate, Medical Assistance calculates separate sets of rates for each facility.
These rates depend on the individual facilitys operating costs; the amount and type of care that each resident needs, and other factors.
How can I lodge a complaint about the care my loved one is receiving in a nursing facility?
If you have reason to believe that an individual is not getting the proper care, you may do one or more of the following: * Contact the long-term care ombudsman in the Department of Aging office in the county in which the facility is located.
The ombudsman will investigate the complaint.
* File a complaint with the Office of Health Care Quality.
This Office will investigate your complaint.
If your complaint is found to be valid, the Office may take sanctions against the facility.
My loved one needs more care than I can give, but I do not want to admit him/her to a nursing facility.
