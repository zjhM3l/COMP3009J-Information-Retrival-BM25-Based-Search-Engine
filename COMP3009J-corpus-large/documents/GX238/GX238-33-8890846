[USEMAP:LRL-plain-banner.jpg] Last edited June 2001 Resources on Minnesota Issues Financing Professional Sports Facilities This guide is compiled by staff at the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library on a topic of interest to Minnesota legislators.
It is designed to provide an introduction to the topic, directing the user to a variety of sources, and is not intended to be exhaustive.
In particular, it is focused on items available in the Legislative Reference Library.
According to Mandy Rafool of the National Conference of State Legislatures, 24 professional sports facilities were built between 1990 and the present.
Many are debating whether a new baseball stadium or football stadium should be built in Minnesota and whether public financing should be part of the debate.
Public financing of large public facilities is always a challenge.
Will it be worth the cost? How will the construction costs be funded? Is it an appropriate use of public funds? Advocates for new sports facilities often stress the economic benefits that a new facility can bring to the community.
Opponents frequently point out that many economic impact studies on the topic have found that the benefits may not be substantial.
However, the intangible benefits a professional sports team can bring to the community also play a large part in any decision to build a new sports facility.
In Minnesota, funding alternatives have included a cigarette tax, a ticket tax, use of casino or lottery proceeds, and public ownership of the professional team.
Funding options that have been used in other states include: hotel/motel taxes, a general sales tax, new excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, car rental taxes, state lottery funds, and money generated from the sale of luxury seating and rights to purchase season tickets.
The issue of whether public funds should be used to build a new baseball or football stadium and the sources for such financing continues to be an issue in Minnesota.
The Minnesota Legislative Reference Library has compiled several guides to current and past stadium debates in Minnesota: * Baseball Stadiums in Minnesota * NHL Hockey in Minnesota * Target Center Arena and the Minnesota Timberwolves
