Perfect.
Chairman Muris' arrival at the FTC in 2001 brought a renewed focus on both state action and NoerrPennington immunity.
Although both doctrines are
intended to prevent the economic objectives of the antitrust laws from encroaching on the political arena, they are also intended to achieve a rational balance.
Expansive interpretations of the doctrines by some courts have raised concerns that this balance has been upset.
Although both the state action and Noerr-
Pennington doctrines protect important political rights, expanding the scope of the doctrines is not necessarily an unambiguous good.
After a certain point, incremental increases in the scope of immunity no longer offer any meaningful additional protection of political conduct.
At that
point, the doctrines merely immunize additional anticompetitive conduct without offering any countervailing benefit.
In order to address these concerns on a systematic basis, the Chairman assembled two task forces of FTC staff in the Summer of 2001.
Both the state
action and Noerr-Pennington task forces have endeavored to address immunity issues through law enforcement actions, amicus briefs, and competition advocacy, and

So I will begin with the work of the state action task force.
The state action doctrine was first The
articulated by the Supreme Court in Parker v. Brown.
Parker case is rooted in federalism, and holds that in passing the Sherman Act, Congress intended to protect
competition, not to limit the sovereign regulatory power of the states.
Therefore, the court held, regulatory
conduct that could be attributed to the state itself is immunized from antitrust scrutiny.
This rule seems clear enough at first, but becomes substantially less clear when applied to delegations of state authority to private parties.
It is
clear, for example, that the Sherman Act was not intended to reach the conduct of a state legislature.
It is less
clear that it was not intended to reach, for example, the conduct of a state board of professional licensure, which may be dominated by market participants with a vested financial interest in particular regulatory outcomes.
The Supreme Court provided some guidance on this issue with its 1980 opinion in Midcal.
The Midcal
case sets forth two important limitations on the scope of state action immunity, both of which are intended to ensure that the conduct at issue is truly that of the state itself.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 First, the proponent of immunity must demonstrate that the conduct in question was in conformity with a clearly articulated state policy.
second, the proponent must demonstrate that the state engaged in active supervision of the conduct.
So with that background, I will now turn to some of the problems associated with the doctrine.
Parker, the scope of the state action doctrine has increased considerably.
Among other possible Since And
explanations, the work of the state action task force suggests that steady erosion of existing limitations on the doctrine has been a contributing factor.
A review of recent state action case law suggests that some courts have substantially expanded the doctrine through interpretations of Midcal that weaken both the clear articulation and active supervision requirement.
With respect to clear articulation, this trend is best exemplified by the willingness of some courts to infer a state policy of displacing competition from a legislative grant of general corporate powers.
States
will often empower subsidiary regulatory authorities to enter into contracts, to make acquisitions, and to enter into joint ventures.
Although it is clear that the exercise of such
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 powers merit no special antitrust treatment in the private sector, some courts have reached the opposite conclusion when the powers are granted through legislation.
Thus, courts have concluded that exclusive
contracts are the foreseeable result of the general power to contract, and other courts have concluded that the exclusion of competitors is the foreseeable result of the general power to make acquisitions.
With respect to active supervision, the problem has not been sins of commission so much as sins of omission.
Because of a lack of guidance as to what this
factor actually requires, it has not functioned as a significant limitation on grants of immunity.
In Midcal, for example, the court held that the state must engage in a pointed reexamination of regulatory conduct.
In Patrick v. Burget, the court
clarified that a state is required to exercise ultimate control.
And most recently in Ticor Title, the court
noted that a state must exercise independent judgment and control.
Without guidance on how to implement these various verbal formulations in terms of actual state regulatory procedures, the active supervision requirement has continued to have a minimal impact.
So those are And I
some of the problems with the current doctrine.

State action task force is currently considering a number of possible approaches, and some of the most promising are those that are outlined on this slide.
First, clarify the proper interpretation of the clear articulation requirement.
The goal here would be
to ensure that the state truly intended to displace competition by authorizing the anticompetitive conduct at issue.
Second, elaborate clear standards for the active supervision requirement.
This will ensure that
the requirement has teeth, and will prevent private entities from restraining competition free from meaningful government oversight.
Third, advocate a tiered approach to govern the application of the clear articulation and active supervision requirements.
The goal here would be to
ensure that these tests are applied most strictly where the threat to competition and consumer welfare is greatest, and less strictly when the threat is less severe.
And finally, consider explicit recognition of a market participant exception to state action immunity.

So having focused a bit on some of the things that the task force would like to do, I will now move on to some of the things that the FTC has actually done in the state action area.
And I'll focus this morning
particularly on the recent activities in the health care area.
I should begin by noting that in addition to bringing law enforcement actions, the Commission has a long tradition of engaging in competition advocacy.
Occasionally, decision-makers at both the federal and state level will request the Commission's views on the likely consumer impact of a particular law or rule.
number of the Commission's most recent competition advocacy efforts have involved potentially anticompetitive state regulation, including regulation in the health care area.
One of the task force's first efforts in this area involved the sale of replacement contact lenses.
Early last year, the Connecticut Board of Examiners for Opticians opened a proceeding to determine whether A
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 various categories of contact lens sellers should be required to obtain a license before selling to Connecticut consumers.
Although the issues raised by the
proceeding were broader, FTC staff limited their participation to the issue of whether such a requirement would actually benefit consumers.
In March 2002, staff filed an activity comment with the board.
The comment reviewed current federal and
state prescription requirements, and concluded that they were sufficient to address any potential health concerns.
The comment further noted that enacting additional requirements would raise prices, reduce consumer convenience, and potentially endanger consumer health as consumers would be inclined to replace their lenses less frequently than recommended.
Finally, the
comment noted that unnecessary regulatory hurdles could serve as a significant barrier to the expansion of e-commerce in the State of Connecticut.
Because the board is still deliberating and has not yet enacted, much less attempted to enforce, any particular rule, this matter has not yet blossomed into a full-fledged state action case.
The same is true of a
second competition advocacy matter, although it nevertheless managed to raise an interesting active supervision issue.

15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 This second matter involves state legislation rather than a board rule.
Over the past two years, three
states -- Alaska, Washington, and Ohio -- have requested the FTC's views on legislation that would create an antitrust exemption for physician collective bargaining with health plans.
In each instance, Commission staff filed a comment asserting that the proposed legislation was likely to harm consumers, as it was likely to raise prices without necessarily improving the quality of care.
Each of the state officials requesting the FTC's views, however, also inquired as to whether physicians acting in conformity with the legislation, that is, physicians engaging in price-fixing, would potentially be subject to antitrust liability.
On this issue, the staff comments uniformly asserted that the key issue is one of active supervision.
If the physicians could demonstrate that they were being actively supervised by the state, their conduct would be immunized.
However, the staff comments also conveyed the
concern of the state action task force that the exact requirements of active supervision had not yet been defined with sufficient clarify.
The Commission subsequently returned to the issue of active supervision and attempted to address this

16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 continuing lack of clear standards in its most recent state action effort, which, if you all will indulge me, is a non-health care matter but it does address the active supervision issue, and that is the Indiana Movers case.
The Indiana Movers case involved conduct by Indiana Household Movers and Warehousemen, Inc., an association representing approximately 70 household goods movers.
One of the association's primary functions is to
prepare and file tariffs on behalf of its members with the Indiana Department of Revenue.
According to the Commission's complaint, however, the association exceeded its role as a mere tariff-filing agent.
The complaint alleges that the
association actively engaged in the establishment of collective rates to be charged by competing movers.
It
further alleges that the association coordinated meetings between its members for the purpose of establishing uniform rates.
Although the case was resolved by consent order, thereby obviating the need to litigate the state action issue, the Commission nevertheless took the opportunity to advance one of the proposals being considered by the state action task force.
Specifically,
in the analysis to aid public comment that accompanied

Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the proposed consent order, the Commission endeavored to elaborate clear standards for the active supervision requirement.
As the analysis states, the elements the
Commission will look to in future cases to determine whether the active supervision requirement has been satisfied will include those that are elaborated on this slide.
So that would be, first, the development of an adequate factual record, including notice and an opportunity to be heard; second, a written decision on the merits; and third, a specific assessment, both qualitative and quantitative, of how private action comports with the substantive standards established by the state legislature.
The analysis further
clarifies that the third factor -- that is, this assessment of qualitative and quantitative compliance with state policy -- is not an attempt to impose federal standards on state decision-making.
Compliance with the
state policy, whatever it may be, remains the benchmark.
However, if the state policy expressly encompasses protecting competition or protecting consumer welfare or similar criteria, the Commission will look for something resembling an antitrust review.
So I believe with that, I've covered the waterfront with respect to state action, and I will now
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 turn for a moment to the activities of the Commission's Noerr-Pennington task force.
Unlike the state action doctrine, which applies to delegations of government authority, the NoerrPennington doctrine shields a limited range of private conduct from antitrust scrutiny.
The doctrine was first articulated in a pair of Supreme Court cases, holding that a party's genuine efforts to petition government are immune from antitrust liability.
The Noerr case involved efforts to petition a
legislature, while Pennington involved efforts to petition the executive branch.
The doctrine was
subsequently extended to efforts to petition government through administrative and judicial proceedings as well, including the filing of lawsuits.
Like the state action doctrine, the goal of the Noerr doctrine has always been to prevent antitrust enforcement from halting or even chilling legitimate political conduct.
As interpreted by some courts,
however, the expanded doctrine shields from the antitrust laws conduct that, by reason of misrepresentation, fraud, or simple government non-involvement, has no political content whatsoever.
So I will now once again spend a moment on some of the problems with the doctrine as it's currently
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 articulated.
The task force's review of recent Noerr
case law suggests that the expanding scope of Noerr immunity has a familiar cause.
While certainly not the
sole cause, as in the state action context, the erosion of existing limitations on the doctrine appears to be a significant contributing factor.
The first of these limitations in the definition of petitioning itself.
This definition, the
first and most fundamental limitation on the scope of Noerr immunity, has in many instances been pushed to its limits.
In Coastal States Marketing, for example, the Fifth Circuit held that mere threats of litigation, whether directed to specific parties or published generally, constituted immunizable petitioning.
were communications that entailed no government involvement whatsoever.
While other courts have retreated from the view that immunized petitioning may entail no government involvement at all, they have yet to specify the precise level of involvement that is required.
Some litigants have suggested that in order to qualify as petitioning, pre-litigation conduct must be a proximate prologue to actual or imminent litigation.
Others have suggested that it must be indispensable to These

To date, however, no court has adopted As a
either rule or proposed an alternative formulation.
result, the category of conduct immunizable as incidental to litigation continues to grow.
While the definition of petitioning continues to grow, the other key limitation on the scope of Noerr immunity, the sham exception, continues to shrink.
The
sham exception, which was first articulated in the Noerr case itself, was most recently revisited by the Supreme Court in Professional Real Estate Investors.
The PRE
court set forth the well-known two-pronged test for sham petitioning.
First, a party must demonstrate that the If this
petitioning effort is objectively baseless.
objective prong is satisfied, the party must then satisfy a second subjective prong by demonstrating that the petitioning effort reveals an intent to use the governmental process, as opposed to the outcome of that process, as an anticompetitive weapon.
Due to some courts' extremely restrictive interpretations of the first prong, that is, the objectively baseless prong, the sham exception has increasingly been limited to a single step.
The Eighth Circuit, in Porous Media Corp., for example, has held that mere denial of a defendant's summary judgment request conclusively demonstrates that a

In practice, PRE's first prong has
almost always proven insurmountable for a single petition.
So again, with those problems with the doctrine as the background, I will now turn to some of the approaches for clarifying the doctrine and improving its functioning that the task force has been exploring.
the state action task force, the Noerr task force is currently examining the feasibility of promoting certain developments in the law.
To date, these efforts have Like
focused primarily, though not exclusively, on clarifying the validity and scope of various non-sham exceptions to the Noerr doctrine.
Some of the most promising are
outlined on this slide.
The first would be to apply a more restrictive view of the varieties of conduct that constitute immunized petitioning.
This would involve looking to
cases concerning tariff filings and private settlements, and applying the definitions of petitioning developed in those situations to broader contexts.
Second, apply the Walker Process exception to Noerr beyond the patent prosecution context.
In Walker
Process, the Supreme Court created a Noerr exception that was broader than the traditional sham exception.
The
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Court's decision was based in part on the fact that the Patent and Trademark Office has limited informationgathering capabilities and consequently relies heavily on the accuracy of parties' representations.
Applying
Walker Process in other contexts simply recognizes that these limitations on information-gathering capacity are not unique to the PTO.
Third, advocate full recognition of an independent, material misrepresentation exception to Noerr.
The goal here would be to confirm the continuing
existence of a misrepresentation exception, separate and distinct from the two-pronged sham analysis set forth in PRE.
And finally, clarify the parameters of a pattern or repetitive petitioning exception to Noerr.
Pursuant to this approach, the Noerr exception would be rooted not in the objective baselessness of a single petition, but rather in a pattern of repetitive petitioning without regard to the merits of individual claims.
Well, for better or for worse, since the formation of the two task forces, the FTC's docket has involved many more cases involving Noerr issues than state action issues.
And as a result, the Commission has
had many more opportunities to advance the objectives
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that were outlined by the Noerr task force.
And so the
task force, in conjunction with the Commission's litigation staff, has had some degree of success in doing this.
Today, the Noerr-Pennington issues raised by the Commission's actions have tended to arise most frequently in the context of Food and Drug Administration approvals for the marketing and sale of generic drugs.
In particular, the Commission has been involved in a number of cases addressing anticompetitive gaming of the Hatch-Waxman regulatory framework.
Because the operation of Hatch-Waxman is substantially complicated, I won't attempt to describe it in detail today.
it.
But I will note that -- two aspects of
First, the Act requires innovator drug companies to
list certain patents in the FDA's Orange Book, and the consequence of this is that the listed patent can then be used to trigger an automatic stay of FDA approval, which can bar a competing generic product from the market for up to 30 months.
So this was the backdrop for the Noerr
task force's most successful effort to date, which was the FTC's amicus participation in the In Re Buspirone case.
The Buspirone case involved allegations that an innovator company, in this case Bristol Myers Squibb, had

court agreed, holding that Orange Book filings are analogous to tariff filings and simply do not constitute petitioning.
The court then advanced a second objective of the task force by holding that even if Orange Book filings did constitute petitioning, application of the Walker Process exception would nevertheless preclude a finding of immunity in this particular case.
Notably, The In
the Buspirone case, which addressed conduct that was before the FDA, is one of the first to extend Walker process beyond the PTO context.
In addition to

this matter was resolved by consent order.
On March 7th, The
Commission's action against BMS was substantially more complicated than In Re Buspirone, and encompassed a

medication BuSpar, which I had mentioned previously, as well as two anti-cancer medications, Taxol and Platinol.
The Commission alleged a complicated course of conduct, which is set forth on this particular slide, and included the following acts.
First, the Commission
alleged that during the patent prosecution process, BMS deceived the PTO to receive unwarranted patent protection.
Second, that during the new drug approval
process, BMS deceived the FDA by listing on the Orange Book patents that did not satisfy the statutory listing criteria.

inclusive agreements to further delay generic entry.
Because the case was resolved by consent order, the Noerr-Pennington issue was not litigated.
However,
as in Indiana Movers, the Commission used the analysis to aid public comment that accompanied the proposed order to provide substantial guidance on the immunities issue.

The analysis further states that "just as repeated filing of lawsuits brought without regard to the merits warrants Noerr immunity, so, too, do the repeated filing of knowing and material misrepresentations with the PTO and the FDA."
So taken together, the Buspirone and BMS cases have encompassed three of the four recommended approaches of the Noerr task force.
Although the fourth approach,
advocating recognition of an independent misrepresentation exception, has not received much attention it may have a role to play in the Commission's recently filed Unocal case, which again, if you'll indulge me, is a non-health care matter.
The Unocal case is the most recent in a line of FTC cases seeking to impose antitrust liability for socalled patent ambush conduct.
Specifically, these cases
involve the nondisclosure and subsequent enforcement of intellectual property rights in conjunction with industry-wide standard-setting proceedings.
The allegations against Unocal are thus similar to allegations against Dell, and more recently Rambus, in prior FTC cases.
The principal difference is that while
Dell and Rambus involve private standard-setting

It is consequently
likely that Unocal will argue that its conduct is protected by Noerr, and indeed, recently Unocal did assert a Noerr defense.
In addition to presenting an issue of utmost importance to California consumers, the Unocal case presents an opportunity to clarify some fundamental aspects of the Noerr doctrine.
As previously mentioned,
the facts alleged in the complaint could potentially support application of an independent misrepresentation exception to Noerr.
Also, like In Re Buspirone, they
could potentially support a non-PTO application of the Walker process exception.
So with that, I believe I have covered the waterfront with respect to Noerr as well, and I believe I've come to the end of my time, so I will turn the program back over to David.

spent a year at the FTC in '78-'79 in a capacity somewhat like David Hyman's status this past year.
That was, of
course, a time when the Commission was just getting its act together in terms of what to do about antitrust violations in the health care sector, and I was privileged to be part of those discussions.
I had earlier in that decade filed an amicus brief in the Goldfarb case, arguing at the stage where the court was considering whether to grant certiorari that this case was really important from the standpoint of the health care industry as well as the legal profession, and that the court ought to hear it on that basis, which, obviously, it did.
So I have a certain proprietary feeling about the whole antitrust enforcement campaign in the health care sector, and David gave me the chance to participate in these hearings at some point, and I decided that state

And these are quite random comments.
They come under, I think, ten headings, and if you lose the thread on one, you can probably pick it up on the next one.
These are things that have been -- have struck me about state action immunity over time, and several themes emerge, I think, that may be helpful to the staff and to others in thinking about these extremely interesting questions.
I mean, they are truly fundamental to our federal system and to our whole antitrust and competition policy.
And so they are -- I enjoy teaching these
matters, and I enjoy thinking about them from time to time, though I've never made this a principal area of

The first slide, I take it, is up.
I thought
I'd say a few things about the general nature of state action immunity.
The key is, and I think the staff
report says as much, from Mr. Delacourt's comments, that this is a -- the doctrine flows from an interpretation of the statute.
It is not directly, at least, a result of some constitutional limit on congressional power.
Indeed,
Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce and could do so more extensively than the courts have deemed it to have done.
So we have here a statute that is now regarded as limited by an implied intention by Congress not to preclude legitimate state regulatory activity.
seems to me about right.
Now, the Parker against Brown case and the Eleventh Amendment both say that the state itself is not subject to private suits in federal court for Sherman Act violations.
But the doctrine of Parker against Brown is And that
a whole lot broader than the holding in Parker against Brown.
It's always seemed to me that the doctrine of -- state action immunity doctrine potentially immunizes not subordinate state agencies that don't

And that immunity results from reading the statute narrowly so that the general federal policy favorable to competition in the whole economy doesn't override the prerogative of states to carve out specific sectors for regulation under the police powers.
And that
seems to me a happy outcome, way of resolving this potential conflict.
When you understand the doctrine this way, as an effort by the court to leave room for states to regulate responsibly in the interest of consumers but not irresponsibly by empowering private interests to harm competition and harm consumers, then that supports the view that the stringency of the clear articulation and the active supervision requirement shouldn't -- should vary with the circumstances, and should expressly vary with circumstances, though particularly the circumstances that affect the ability of private interests to harm competition.
So I think of this doctrine as an accommodation between the federal preference for competition and the state's freedom to choose alternative ways to protect consumers.
Under the doctrine, it seems to me important

Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 to remember federal policy, federal antitrust policy, still operates to the extent of requiring first that the states take clear responsibility for setting competition aside, and second, that if the state directly or indirectly empowers private interests to restrain trade, then it must provide oversight to preclude abuses of those powers, to protect consumers in a way other than the ways in which competition would protect them.
And it
seems to me that conceptualization should be kept in mind as we proceed.
The next slide, please.
I wanted to comment on
the parallels with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which limits the reach of the Sherman Act in the insurance industry, in the business of insurance, insofar as that business is regulated by a state.
Now, interestingly, the statutory test in McCarran strikes me as being very close to the one that the court subsequently adopted as the general rule to provide for other cases, where a state has substituted regulation for competition.
Because McCarran was enacted well before the Supreme Court devised the Midcal test, it seems to me that the state action doctrine can reach as far as the McCarran doctrine does.
In other words, the fact that
this McCarran test is embodied in explicit legislation,

So I think of McCarran as
a legislative precedent that confirms the court's ascribing to the Congress of an intent not to displace responsible state regulation.
Next slide, please.
Comity.
Well, in
international law, you find the principal of comity dictating deference by one sovereign to the policies and concerns of other sovereigns.
And the state action
doctrine presumes comparable deference on the part of Congress to the legislative policies of states, and provides some principles for defining the extent of that deference in particular cases.
Interestingly, the Hartford Fire case from 1993 is a case in which the Supreme Court gave a whole lot less deference to a foreign government's policies governing its reinsurance industry than comparable state policies receive under the McCarran Act or under the state action doctrine.
You'll recall that Hartford
Fire held that reinsurers in the U.K. were not immunized by a clear and strong U.K. approval of their anticompetitive activities.
And the court said that as
long as you can comply with both U.S. antitrust law and the law of the U.K., then there's no problem in applying U.S. law, that there has to be an actual direct conflict
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025

Anyway, one interesting thing about the Hartford case is that Justice Scalia would have read the Sherman Act to incorporate notions of international comity just the way the state action doctrine presumes congressional respect for the values of federalism.
And
that always seemed to me a much more sensible way to deal with the problems of conflicts with the law between U.S. competition policy and the laws and policies of other nations.
And I think the notion of comity ought to be kept alive in talking about the state action doctrine, but the contrast in the way it's been handled in the international sphere is, I think, notable.
Next slide.
The treatment of municipalities.
The Supreme Court has been quite generous in providing antitrust immunity to municipalities.
There are a lot of
cases, but what's emerged is a willingness to treat foreseeability of anticompetitive regulation in the exercise of general municipal powers conferred by the state on the community as being sufficient to meet the first prong of the Midcal test.
And in addition, again
in the Town of Hallie case, the court relaxed the active supervision requirement because municipalities are, I

Indeed, it's been my thought that the leniency towards municipalities should be linked more explicitly than it usually is to the accountability of municipalities to public opinion, the media, and to voters in the municipal elections.
The local politics
provides a kind of active supervision, if you will, and indeed a presumptively reliable kind.
And this may not
be the kind of active supervision we usually look for in applying the state action doctrine, but I think in this context it should be deemed to be quite adequate to meet the concerns of the court in establishing the active supervision requirement.
And I think many people have recognized how fundamentally the direct political accountability of municipalities distinguishes them from state agencies and boards, especially those that are beholden to the very interests they regulate.

At any rate, this case extended the Town of Hallie reading of the state action doctrine from municipalities to state boards.
And I find that highly
problematic, and I hope the staff report will find it so as well.
One thing that they did was to overrule a 1978 case or '79 case called U.S. against Texas State Board of Accountancy, where the Department of Justice found a state board to have violated the law in adopting a regulation against competitive bidding.
I think the state board was clearly controlled by the accountants, and they even put the rule out for vote by the accountants before they adopted it.
This is,
of course, similar to the restraint in the Professional Engineers case, and was, I think, a sensible outcome.
Now, the Earles case involved a restraint that was perhaps less egregious than that one, and you might be able to argue still in the Fifth Circuit that if the agency issues a blatantly anticompetitive rule like the one in Texas Board, then they're not immune unless they have explicit legislative authority.
But it's still -- the case troubles me because it seems to give much too much weight to federalism values and too little weight to antitrust policy.
And I

board's actions means there is little danger of a cozy arrangement to restrict competition."
Gosh, I think that's a naive view of the way state boards operate, and the notion that their activities are highly public and therefore protected.
mean, it's quite distinguishable, it seems to me, from the cases of the municipalities.
Indeed, I think the error in this case was in borrowing from the Supreme Court's lenient treatment of restraints imposed by municipalities.
Indeed, I think it I
makes no sense at all to equate state licensing and regulatory boards that are controlled by the people they regulate with municipalities in deciding how explicit the legislature needs to be in empowering them to limit competition.
So in cases like these, I would say the clear articulation requirement should be enforced with special rigor.
Obviously, the foreseeability test, which may be
appropriate for municipalities, is clearly inappropriate in dealing with state boards.
Indeed, few things are
more foreseeable than that empowering a trade or profession to regulate itself will yield anticompetitive regulations that harm consumers.
So that's a case that

The supremacy clause:
These cases are always discussed in terms of whether a state or its officers or agencies has violated federal antitrust laws.
And it doesn't often come up in the more
straightforward form of the question of whether the state law or regulation is preempted by federal antitrust policy.
But in some cases, the action at the state
level may be so offensive to federal policy that it's invalid and unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.
And so I've long thought it might be possible to invoke the Sherman Act in preemptive terms when a state has created a regulatory board that's so dominated by the regulated interests that it amounts to a self-regulating cartel, precisely what the Sherman Act was designed to prevent.
And the court has said several times that states can't just authorize dangerous combinations of competitors or -- I think the Midcal court said you can't cast a gauzy cloak over a cartel.
And so when states
appoint regulators that are nominated by the regulated interests, I think federal policy could be invoked to trump the federalism concerns and invalidate the program.
Now, that may not really happen.
But I think

Just to comment on why lower
courts seem to have misused the state action immunity doctrine so often, and Mr. Delacourt's comments indicate that there's a lot of misuse, what you find, I think, is that the lower courts use state action immunity as a way to avoid addressing antitrust issues they prefer not to confront.
They've done this in other respects, too, and with other doctrines, too, interstate commerce for a while, and there are two or three others where you can sort of see the courts jumping at easy ways to get rid of cases that they don't want to hear -- staff privileges cases, for example.
In some cases, they simply are looking for an easy way to grant summary judgment because they don't want to try this time-consuming case.
And in other
instances, I think they think they could be incorrect but they may think that the law would require them to condemn some arrangement that they regard as either innocuous or so unimportant as not to be worth their time.
At any rate, the courts' decisions to use the

So I think clarifying antitrust doctrine would sometimes enable them to deal with these cases more confidently on the merits, and that they would be less inclined to -- but you need to give them, you know, safe harbors and some rules that allow them to act summarily in cases where real competitive harm is not really apparent.
Okay.
The next slide brings us to hospital
staff privileges, and particularly in public hospitals.
There are a lot of cases here, and I haven't read them all.
But the risk is, as always, that the medical staff
will administer privileges in the interest of its members, particularly their interest in avoiding competition, and not in the interest of the hospital itself.
Now, one finds, of course, that the public hospital's authorizing legislation usually authorizes denial of staff privileges.
But that is not enough to
immunize the hospital from suit because not all denials of privileges are necessarily suspect under the antitrust

Indeed, one should think of the hospital in deciding whether to allow a doctor to use their facilities as being in a vertical relationship as either a purchaser of the doctor's services or as a supplier of facilities to the doctor, whichever, but in a position where he can -- the hospital can refuse to deal or not for reasons of its own, commercial reasons of its own, and there is usually no antitrust issue.
Indeed, it is competition itself that is operating here, the hospital deciding whether to deal with a particular doctor and the doctor deciding whether to deal with a particular hospital.
This is the market
at work and not something anticompetitive.
In addition, of course, the statutory authority of the hospital to deny privileges shouldn't have any immunizing effect on anticompetitive actions the medical staff might take because the staff, of course, comprises private parties with commercial interests of their own.
Next slide.
I would suggest -- and I think
this is a new thought, and maybe it isn't, but if it is, I hope someone will take a note and think about it -- the thought is that the active supervision requirement could be used to ensure that the hospital's governing body, state-appointed governing body, oversees the actions of
For The Record, Inc.

And as far as I know, no court has yet viewed the medical staff of the hospital as a combination of competitors whose actions need to be actively supervised by the hospital to establish their immunity under the state action doctrine.
I also happen to think that active involvement by a hospital governing board should defeat antitrust claims on the merits, even by summary judgment.
And that
should be the case with private hospitals as well as public ones.
The key factor is whether this is a
vertical transaction or one in which the competitors of the applicant are the principal decision-makers.

Staff privileges in private
I don't have a lot to say there, but I do
think the Patrick case -- I've never known how to pronounce the second party in the Patrick case; Burget, I guess.
The case is interesting and it might be mentioned in the staff report in this respect because I think the Supreme Court created some confusion by skipping over the first prong of the Midcal test to the second one in finding no immunity for the private

And that left the impression that the first prong test was satisfied.
It was not an appropriate
impression, but necessarily people seemed to assume that the reason you go to the second prong is that the first prong test is satisfied.
Now, the Oregon law in that case, which the hospital invoked, didn't contemplate any restrictions on competition that would contravene federal antitrust policy.
Indeed, the Oregon legislature expressly gave
the responsibility for screening physicians for maintaining the quality of care in hospitals to the hospitals themselves, and not to physicians that were acting on their own.
And thus the statute provided, I
think, no predicate for the exemption argument in that case.
The next slide.
A little more on this.
It's
always seemed to me regrettable that the court chose to rest its decision on the lack of state supervision since in doing so, it seems to suggest that all privileges are somehow at odds with antitrust policy.
And what I've
been trying to say is that they really aren't, and that it would have been healthy for the lower courts to understand a little more clearly that this is not as

So the case could have provided a good opportunity to observe that the problem in Patrick was physician domination of the privileges process, that the state law wouldn't exempt or didn't exempt that domination from scrutiny under the antitrust laws, and finally, that antitrust law is appropriately invoked when and only when the applicant's competitors are making the decision rather than the hospital itself.
Okay.

Comment on
provider cooperation laws.
The staff report, I think,
should refer to the several laws in several states where the states have sought to enable health care providers, mostly hospitals, to merge or otherwise collaborate without being subject to federal antitrust laws.
And they do this by trying to satisfy the two requirements of the Midcal doctrine.
They first express
very clearly the legislature's desire to override federal competition policy.
And second, they try to provide some
form of state oversight, usually by the state attorney general, of any anticompetitive actions that providers might take pursuant to the authority the states give them.
Now, these laws haven't been much used, as far

And that may be because the hospitals haven't
found that the option of being actively supervised by the state AG is particularly attractive, and that maybe they think their merger is more likely to pass muster with the feds in any event, and they can then go forward without being supervised thereafter.
But I've been curious as to whether the FTC and the Justice Department, in looking at mergers of hospitals, feel somewhat constrained by the possibility that the parties can go to the state if a merger is not approved.
And I'd be kind of interested in some comment
on whether the FTC has been inclined to -- I guess they wouldn't admit it, but I'd be interested in the dynamics here.

And I guess I'd be
I hope the staff report will say something
about those laws.
It does, I gather -- and the next slide, please -- I gather from what Mr. Delacourt says that they're going to say something about the statutes that allow doctors to engage in collective bargaining with

These statutes seem to permit
collective bargaining, at least in circumstances where competition among health plans is somehow deemed insufficient to prevent the exploitation of doctors.
But they stop short of authorizing strikes or concerted refusal to deals or group boycotts of health plans.
And that seems to be a significant limitation on
their effectiveness in solving the doctors' problems, as doctors see them.
If the doctors lack both the right to strike and also the protections of federal labor law, then it's unlikely that payors will be willing to sit down with them and actually negotiate with them in good faith over whatever agreements they may have.
But the Commission has opposed these in a number of instances and should continue to do so.
And I
continue to be interested in how serious these laws are as exceptions to the usual antitrust rules.

The last topic in the next slide, And

private interests to limit and raise the costs of entry into the various licensed occupations by virtue of the state agency's reliance on private accrediting of

The typical case, of course, involves the state making successful completion of privately accredited training a prerequisite for licensure in the field.
that provides the -- gives the private interests an important role in defining the field and in setting the terms of entry.
No one seems ever to have doubted that the state action doctrine permits state regulatory boards to delegate control over educational programs to private interests.
And the current law now seems to privilege And
the sponsors of accrediting programs under the NoerrPennington doctrine by treating their collaboration as exempt petitioning activity.

cases, but this seems to be the rule from the Massachusetts School of Law case, and is troubling to me.

approve -- we only license people who've gotten accredited training.
And the accreditors raised the
standard from five to six, so everybody is now a doctor of pharmacy.
There are no more bachelors degrees, at I think we will see the last of those

programs.
So the point is that there's now a huge shortage of pharmacists, and this has raised the costs and has contributed to overwork, to burnouts. the quality of service has declined.
I think
And this is a
direct result of a restraint imposed using the licensing system by the pharmacists themselves.
So I think this is an example that demonstrates the need for antitrust law to impose some limit on the ability of private interests to control education and training in their respective fields.
Last slide suggests that there may be some doctrinal solutions available here.
First, I would
question whether the state action doctrine permits a state to delegate accrediting authority to a private body that's both subject to capture by special interests and

Second, I question whether the Noerr-Pennington doctrine protects a narrowly based joint venture that monopolizes accrediting in a particular field.
Petitioning government is one thing, but domination of the supply of information and opinion concerning educational programs is something quite different.
And I think antitrust law should be available to challenge dominant joint ventures in educational accrediting that exclude from participation all interests other than supply side interests.
In other words, the American Council of Pharmaceutical Education, the ones that raised the standards in training requirements in pharmacy, that council could, I think survive attack under the antitrust laws if it included, what, chain drug stores, included health insurers and HMOS, pharmaceutical companies.
All they include, however, are the practicing pharmacists.
And, of course, their view is that the more
training the better, and higher costs and wages are not a concern of theirs at all.
So I think there's a role here for antitrust.
I've written about this in the past but nobody has ever seemed to take it seriously, as I think they should.

do not belong to the State of Maryland, the Attorney General, or to any other state official.
I'm going to
talk today about state action immunity, and in a couple of different contexts.
First, the state attorney general in Maryland and in other states has two basic roles.
The first is
that of -- at least in the antitrust enforcement context.
First is that of a prosecutor.
We enforce the antitrust
laws, and that is both the federal and the state antitrust laws.
And the second role is as counsel or
representative of the state itself, and that includes

Maryland has a unique program, and I'm quite certain that it's unique because I have talked about it quite a bit at National Association of Attorneys General meetings, and that is we actually counsel our regulatory and licensing boards on the antitrust laws.
In the health care area, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns an assistant attorney general to each licensing board in the health care profession.
So each board is represented by an AAG, and
each AAG at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is tutored by the antitrust division on both antitrust violations and state action immunity.
Also, each board
is counseled by the antitrust division when problems arise.
And that is my job, one of my jobs, that I've
been performing for about twelve years.
Now, licensing boards are creatures of statute.
Their powers are enumerated in the statute.
Their
authority is subscribed by the powers that the legislature has given them.
Board members are appointed
by the governor and board members and competitors of the licensees they regulate, and that creates a certain amount of anticompetitive tension.
There are on all
boards also consumer members who sort of serve as a

For licensing boards, the Midcal test -because licensing boards are quasi-state agencies or entities, it's not absolutely clear whether they need to satisfy both prongs of Midcal.
And the Supreme Court has
not been very helpful in clearing that up for us.
We know that they have to satisfy the first prong of Midcal, that is, the clear articulation prong.
The question comes to me, when a board is considering taking a certain course of conduct, the first area that I look at is what does the board's enabling act say? gives us the statutory authority? If the conduct is in the statute itself explicitly, I have no issue.
board can do it.
There's no problem.
The What
The problem areas are when the statute
does not explicitly authorize the conduct that the board wishes to take.
And in such a situation, while it's not
clear whether or not the foreseeability test of Town of Hallie and Omni apply to regulatory and licensing boards, that is what I counsel them.
In other words, if the statute does not explicitly authorize the conduct, it must be at least reasonably contemplated within the statute itself.
If it
is not, I advise my board to take other action, and in very difficult situations, to actually go back to the

Active supervision has never been required, at least as far as I know, in the case of licensing and regulatory boards.
I will say, however, in Maryland,
that were the Supreme Court to decide that regulatory and licensing boards need active supervision, they get it.

The regulation of out-of-state
licensees has often been an issue in board regulation.
Regulations, as I said, governing sub-specialties and practice limitations raise anticompetitive concerns.
Advertising restrictions: If the board
determines to take action against a practitioner who is advertising in a particular way that the board feels is beyond the scope of their professional authority, it might take action.
One example that I'd like to use here, because I think that it illustrates the problem for you, prior to my tenure, I guess in the late '80s, in the state of Maryland we had the emergence of a new profession -- it was probably emerging all over the country at the same time -- and that is massage therapists.
And in Maryland, the board of physical therapists found that the massage therapists were, in fact, advertising their services and advertising utilizing the word -- using the word "therapy."
The
Physical Therapy Board ascertained that the use of the word "therapy" was not allowed by massage therapists, who

The Maryland Association of Massage Therapists sued the Physical Therapy Board and the state in state court, alleging an antitrust violation.
was ultimately settled.
Now, the case
I was not involved in the case.
But it seems to me fairly clear that the word "therapy," which was not explicitly defined in the physical therapist statute as pertaining only to physical therapists, you can't restrict the use of the word "therapy" in someone's advertising.
And so how we counsel the boards is that as a regulatory board, your parameters are you may not restrict advertising that is truthful and not misleading to the public.
In addition, this was mentioned by Professor Havighurst, the delegation of board authority to non-state organizations such as trade associations or accrediting programs.
I think that, yes, I mean, the
state can by statute delegate authority, for example, for an examination to an accrediting program or educational program.
My concern is in the trade association and how closely the trade addition is aligned with a particular

Bottom line, my counsel is, it is the
board who must make all decisions and not a trade association.
Obviously, a trade association is welcome to consult with and advise regulatory boards, and they offer valuable insight in many situations.
But again, bottom
line, it is the board who must make the decision and not the private trade association.
And disciplinary proceedings.
These are
licensed revocations, suspensions, et cetera, that pose an anticompetitive impact maybe for one practitioner, but yes, it's a competitive impact.
This is relating to statutory authority that relates to the first prong of Midcal.

counseled my boards that if they find that the authority is not explicit, it must be at least reasonably contemplated.

the state action analysis that was performed in this case.
The state action defense -- and we've already talked about it -- state officials, state agencies, have to pass the first prong of Midcal.
A statute is -- in
this particular case, in the Article 2(b) in the Maryland Code, the liquor laws clearly articulate an anticompetitive scheme and that is notwithstanding any anticompetitive effect.
The General Assembly
acknowledged this was anticompetitive, acknowledged that it did not comport with the antitrust laws, and enacted it, anyway.
In the TFWS lawsuit, there were no allegations whatsoever of any private conduct.
No collusion, no
agreements, no discussions about pricing at all.
Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit held that this was a hybrid restraint, a per se violation of the Sherman Act, and there was -- the reason was it was not immunized is

Now, the court did articulate a preemption test, that is, that the particular law in question -- if it either mandates or authorizes conduct which constitutes an antitrust violation in all cases, or it places an irresistible pressure on private parties to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute, it articulated that test.

What it did say is that because there was no active supervision -- and it didn't even say of whom -there was no immunity, and therefore the statute would fall under the antitrust laws.

saying that I disagree entirely with the result of the case.
But I think that the analysis is a little bit
incomplete.
In conclusion, I'd like to say state licensing boards, in my view, must pass the first prong of Midcal; that is, there must be clear articulation and affirmative expression of state policy.
And secondly, the authority,
while it must not be explicit in all respects, it must be reasonably contemplated by the board statute.
I think Professor Havighurst said that perhaps the Town of Hallie test for foreseeability should not

I mean, the board
would be frozen if every single act or decision that they had to make had to be so explicitly outlined in the statute.
I think it's unworkable.
Thirdly, I believe that boards must be counseled by the state.
And finally, I think that challenges to state law as a per se violation of the antitrust laws should not be confused with challenges to state agencies or private parties.

And just as a basis
for moving forward, to make sure it is clear, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing is an association and not a regulatory body.
Before I get into our concerns, I think it would be helpful to share with you some background information on clinical nurse specialists as advanced practice nurses.
A clinical nurse specialist is a
professional nurse, registered professional nurse, who holds a masters degree in nursing from an accredited school of nursing that prepares clinical nurse specialists for specialty practice in nursing.
essence of clinical nurse specialist practice is specialty practice, unlike nurse practitioners, who are educationally prepared as generalists in primary care.
There are currently over 40 specialty areas of practice that have evolved to meet societal needs for expert nursing care.
And just some examples of these are The
oncology, orthopedics, HIV/AIDS, rehabilitation, women's health, incontinence, diabetes, and pediatrics.
It's estimated by the Division of Nursing and the American Nurses Association that there are over 60,000 CNSs in the US.
CNSs have been providing expert
nursing services to the public for over 50 years, practicing within the scopes of practice authorized by
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025
62 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the R.N. license, which include autonomous nursing practice in the provision of nursing care -- not medical care but nursing care -- and delegated medical authority.
CNS practice is characterized by the provision of expert research and theory-based direct patient care to patients who have specialty needs.
It bridges the
gaps between new knowledge and actual practice at the bedside by staff nurses, thereby advancing the practice of the discipline for the benefit of patients.
And it
facilitates system changes on a multi-disciplinary level that help hospitals and other health care facilities improve patient outcomes cost-effectively.
There are some CNSs -- psychiatric, congestive heart failure, diabetes, for example -- who have obtained prescriptive authority so that they may order medications to help patients manage or control symptoms or functional problems in conjunction with an M.D. specialist.
You
must be clear here that this prescriptive authority for medications extends beyond the scope of practice authorized by the R.N. license, and therefore additional regulation such as licensure beyond that license for these CNSs is warranted.
Currently, there is a critical shortage of CNSs in the U.S.
Some hospitals are now offering $20,000 Recently the number of universities and
sign-on bonuses.

Now to the regulatory credentialing issues.
Some state boards of nursing -- for example, Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, and Arkansas -- are requiring all CNSs to obtain a second license to practice.
This requirement
represents over-regulation for the vast majority of CNSs, who do not want or need prescriptive authority and who hold an R.N. license.
It also creates insurmountable barriers for the CNS to practice with or without prescriptive authority when obtaining the second license requires specialty certification as a CNS by exam only, thus denying the public access to needed services.

Therefore, the vast majority of CNSs will never be able to obtain certification in their specialty area.
It is not economically feasible to develop exams in areas where there are not large numbers of nurse practitioners.
It takes a minimum of $100,000 to develop an exam, and then almost an equal amount to maintain it per year.
Thus, is it impossible for the vast majority of CNSs to meet this regulatory requirement.
Some examples of the consequences of these insurmountable barriers: In states such as Texas, Ohio, There are over 40 CNS The
Only nine CNS specialty exams
and Arkansas, there are hundreds, if not collectively thousands, of CNSs who have stopped practicing as CNSs because they cannot obtain recognition to practice, or are forced to go back to school to take nurse practitioner courses to learn competencies not used in

In states such as Texas, there are schools of nursing who are closing much-needed CNS programs because there is no certification exam in the specialty area.
The most recent example in Texas is that a little over -oh, about two years ago, hospitals in the Austin area and surrounding area came to the University of Texas at Austin requesting the school to develop a women's health CNS program.
Now, women's health is a specialty CNS area And to meet this need,
existing for many, many years.
the University of Texas at Austin got this program approved.
They had 32 applicants to the program to begin
this fall, and the executive director of the Texas State Board of Nursing visited the school informing them that the Texas Board of Nursing would never recognize women's health CNSs because there is no certification exam, and therefore the school is no longer pursuing that degree.
It is also imperative to note that requiring certification by exam for entry into a specialty area precludes the evolution of new specialties to meet evolving societal needs because certification exams are not developed in an a priori manner.
I just want to
insert here as a sidebar that there are other ways to demonstrate competency besides exam.
These insurmountable barriers only worsen with

the new compact language passed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, again an association, in August of 2002.
This compact language is called, titled,
the "Uniform Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) License/Authority to Practice Requirements."
The multi-state compact language for the recognition of advance practice nurses, including clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, registered nurse anesthetists, and nurse midwives, only recognizes certification exams as the mechanism for demonstration of competence.
Now, the intent of this compact language is One is to increase uniformity of regulations The problem

is the National Council of State Boards of Nursing treats these different, very distinct, different practice areas as the same, and then therefore in part creates insurmountable barriers, which again I will get into again.
The important matter here is that the NCSBN, as an association, has developed language that the regulatory bodies, the state boards of nursing, must adopt in order to be part of this compact.
The National
Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice registered nurse task force has proposed that if there is

We believe there are important legal defensibility questions of requiring or accepting an exam that does not test for competencies in the specialty area, and there are multiple examples of this that just, frankly, in our view make it nonsensical.
The effects of the regulatory barriers described are devastating to thousands of CNSs and result in: first denying the public's access -- and we define
public both in terms of patients as well as CNS employers -- to much-needed CNS services; schools of nursing not developing new graduate degree specialty programs to meet societal needs; and wasted dollars, with CNSs taking unnecessary additional course work to become nurse practitioners.
In essence changing the scope of
CNS practice to include competencies they do not use, to achieve advanced practice recognition so that they can provide CNS services.
Currently, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing advanced practice task force is advocating the development of a standardized, generalist exam to

No other
nursing group is supporting development of a uniform generalist examination for advanced practice.
The actions of the NCSBN as an association, in our view, raise important Noerr-Pennington concerns, which are: The association, made up of members of state

The association has a vested
economic interest in changing the licensure process, examination or certification development, as it develops and provides testing products.
These are our Noerr-Pennington-related questions: (1) Is it appropriate to provide an association which provides testing products to state licensing agencies and mandates membership to obtain the testing products with unfettered access to state licensing agency staff and appointed members? (2) Is it
appropriate for such an association to develop policy, lobby its membership for the adoption of the policy, and subsequently develop the required products for sale to its membership? (3) Is it appropriate for the

We do not believe the Noerr-Pennington exemption was created for this purpose.

Good morning.
Thanks
for the opportunity to say a few words about the National Quality Forum.
Let me just preface my further comments with reiterating what I suspect you well know and have heard lots about already, that there's a paradox in American health care at this point in time, as there indeed has been for some time.
There's lots of good things that we
do in health care here in the U.S. as far as training of our practitioners; having lots of diagnostic and treatment technology diffused throughout our community; our biomedical research program is the envy of the world and the engine that's driving development throughout the world; and lots of technology.
We spend, by any measure,
more than anybody in health care and clearly, some people get very good care.
But we also know that things aren't all that

Lots of people don't have guaranteed or There are growing questions
predictable access to care.
about the value of the care, or all the money that we spend on health care.
There is an increasing
dissatisfaction with the system from all perspectives -patients, providers, payors.
And we certainly know from
a number of major studies since 1998 in particular that the quality of American health care is not what many had thought it was prior to that point in time.
Now, in the few minutes I have with you, I'm not going to talk about the state of American health care quality or the lack of information that consumers and purchasers ideally would have for a real health care market to operate and what many of the barriers are to improving health care quality because it's my understanding that those topics have already been covered in sufficient detail already.
What I will talk about in quick fashion is the National Quality Forum, how it came about, what it is about, what some of the work is that we currently have underway, and then just end with a few of the challenges that currently confront the National Quality Forum.
What is the NQF? Well, we are a private,
nonprofit, voluntary consensus standard-setting

I have to confess that three or four years
ago, if someone came up to me in the street and said, "Hi, I'm from a voluntary consensus standard-setting organization," I would have probably asked about their Haldol level and kept walking.
But voluntary consensus standards, while they are new to health care, are certainly not new elsewhere.
There are tens of thousands of them.

They exist in most
But they are not -- have not been used
previously in health care to any significant degree.
More specifically, the National Quality Forum was created to standardize health care performance measurement and reporting to come up with an overall national strategy for how quality of care would be measured and reported.
And then finally, to do other
good things to make it all happen.
The specific genesis of the forum is that we came out of a presidential advisory commission where the consensus of that group was that the issue of quality of American health care should be vested in the private sector.
The commission also proposed the creation of a
federal entity that would work in many ways like the SEC.
Indeed, the SEC was the model that most closely parallels the thinking behind the creation of the National Quality Forum.

reporting.
The commission released its report in 1998.
Subsequently, a committee was convened by the White House to plan a governance structure and some basic operational details of the forum.
This resulted in the forum being And
incorporated in the District here in May of 1999.
subsequently, I joined the organization and we became operational in February of 2000.
I might also note that the corresponding federal or government sector entity that was recommended has not progressed.
Indeed, there has been no expression
of interest by either the prior or the current administration, or by anybody in Congress in creating the council that was recommended as setting national priorities and other things that was viewed as being a partner with the forum.
The intellectual thinking behind the creation of the forum is not terribly profound but worth mentioning, that basically, if we want to have wholesale quality improvement, which everyone agrees is needed in American health care, we need a systematic approach.
To have a systematic approach, you need a You need performance measures.

A few things about the structure of the forum.
We are a membership organization.
As of last month, we
had nearly 200 organizations that belong to the forum.
This ranges the gamut from all the usual health care suspects like the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association and the American Nursing Association, et cetera, to General Motors and Ford Motor Company and Glaxo and Merck and a number of pharmaceutical companies and lots of other entities in between.
We are in essence an organization of organizations, to try to bring all the parties to the table.
One of the ways of thinking about the forum is It's an

experiment in democracy in a number of ways.
How do we bring government and the private sector together? How do we balance the common good
against the individual agendas of the various organizations? How do we achieve equity between the
various stakeholder entities, like consumers and purchasers and providers? Indeed, all of the members of the forum, all the organizations -- and there are individual members as

That's notable in that each of those councils then elect a chairperson who then has a seat on the board of directors.
The determinative body for the forum is
the board of directors.
The board at the current time is composed of 29 individuals.
There are 23 voting and six non-voting.
For all intents and purposes, though, it's not a real distinction since we have yet to come to closure on a matter where it was so close that the difference between voting and non-voting members would have made a difference.
The heads of three federal agencies
sit on the board of directors, the administrator of CMS as well as AHRQ, and then the head of the Office of Personnel Management, which purchases health care for federal employees.

The six liaison or non-voting members include the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, FACCT, who I understand you'll be hearing from, and the physician consortium on performance improvement of the American Medical Association, which in essence represents the specialty societies.
By our bylaws, consumers and purchasers constitute a majority of the board, albeit a slight majority.
But this is done in recognition that
historically these entities have not been at the table or felt to have a voice at the table as much as it's viewed that they should have.
We're unique in a number of ways.
One is that
anyone can join the forum, any individual or any organization.
It's open to everyone.
There is both
public and private sector representation on the governing board, and as I'll come back to in a moment, that is not only allowable under relevant federal statutes but is overtly encouraged because of the nature of the organization.
As I've already mentioned, there's an equitable status among the stakeholder sectors.
We are not focused

And indeed we place a priority on
looking at performance measures or standards that go, like patients do, through the continuum of care, one day maybe at home and the next day in the hospital, in a nursing home, et cetera.
Finally, the thing that most distinguishes the forum is that we have this formal consensus process and what we produce are known as voluntary consensus standards.
This is governed by a specific piece of
federal law known as the National Technology and Transfer Advancement Act of 1995, which defines what is a standards-setting body.
met to meet that test.
Five attributes that have to be The significance of voluntary
consensus standards is that they actually have legal status, which is different than most standards in health care and what we typically think of as quality of care standards or other standards.
Indeed, under the National Technology and Transfer Advancement Act, the federal government is obligated to adopt voluntary consensus standards when they are setting standards in an area, or specifically justify why they are doing something that is governmentspecific.

That's why CMS,
AHRQ, and OPM sit on the board, as well as NIH.
Some of the activities that we are currently involved in are included on this in the next slide.
And
this is not a complete list, but it gives you some sense of the range of activities.
One of the first things we were asked to do was to identify a list of those things that -- in the terms of the letter from CMS and AHRQ Â­ the serious, egregious, preventable adverse events in health care that should never happen.
That is a little bit much to say without Some
taking a breath, so we call them the never events.
people objected to that, so we finally came to the more politically neutral term, serious, reportable adverse events in health care.
This is a consensus document, and I'm pleased to say while this consensus document was released in March of 2002, the State of Minnesota, the governor signed a law last week that puts this list of reportable events as mandatorily reportable in the State of Minnesota, the first such state to do this.

We were asked to also come up with a list of "safe practices."
What are those practices that health
care facilities should have in place to minimize the likelihood of errors? We released a few weeks ago a set
of 30 practices that meet that criteria.
The appeals process, and part of built into this national -- or the consensus process, is a formal appeals process after something has been endorsed by the board.
That will run its course next week.
We will at
that time send this over to CMS, who contracted for it.
Whether this ends up being a condition of participation or whatnot remains to be seen.
We know that many of the
private entities, like Leapfrog and others, are already operationalizing this.
We were asked to develop a set of national performance measures for hospitals, acute care hospitals, so that we would actually be able to compare the performance of hospitals in Portland, Oregon versus those in Portland, Maine and places in between.
That again, I'm pleased to say that we completed work on that a few weeks ago, and there are 39 measures there.

Those ten
Indeed, part of that
agreement is that they will use NQF-endorsed national performance measures.
Last October we endorsed a set of performance measures or consensus standards for the outpatient care of diabetes.
Those are just now being re-looked again.
We have worked with CMS on the nursing home performance measures.
As you know, CMS is now reporting information
on all 50 states to the media and to the public on performance measures in nursing homes.
We worked with them on the pilot.
We are
currently under contract to re-look at the initial set of measures.
Likewise, we have a contract with CMS to
develop or to endorse performance measures on home health care.
We expect to start work on that probably in
October or November.
We've done some work with NCI and are in hopefully the final throes of negotiating a large contract with NCI on quality of care performance measures for cancer, and seven specific areas in particular in cancer.

somewhat astounding that given the importance of nursing, that there are not nationally endorsed performance measures for nursing.

Or at least coming up with an We're
idealized method of credentialing physicians and other independent licensed practitioners that would get rid of much of the waste and incredible duplication of effort that currently is involved in this process.
And there's a bunch of other things, but I think that this gives you a sense of the scope of work that the forum is currently involved in.
Just in closing, the last couple of things: In
the three years that the forum has operated, a number of issues have come to the fore.
One of the -- on the list
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025

We are a private nonprofit.
Everyone agrees
that the work that we are doing is both of high quality and good and long overdue and very much needed, but no one is rushing to pay for it.
Indeed, it's the only
instance I know where the federal government explicitly notes in their contracts that they are under-funding the contract because they would like to see the private sector partners step up to the plate as well.
Some of the other issues we're confronting is how do we coordinate with other standard-setting bodies like the Joint Commission and NCQA and a myriad of others, from CMS to the state licensing boards to the American Board of Medical Specialties, and go down the list of other folks who are involved in setting standards and overseeing quality of care and overall health care performance, and providing information to the public.
What's the role in establishing national priorities? As you probably know, the Institute of
Medicine has recommended some priorities to AHRQ and, in turn, to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
In many ways -- well, let me just send on an editorial note comment that lots of good people have been working very hard for many years to improve the quality

considerable sentiment that the forum, given our role in bringing people together and the unique attributes that we bring to the table, should be involved in that process.
What should be the role of the forum actually in the implementation of performance measures and standards? Originally, as the forum was thought about
and how it was conceived, it was felt that this should be left entirely to the private sector or regulatory bodies or accreditation bodies.
And indeed, that is happening.
Many of our performance measures are now embedded in contracts that the various purchasing groups and others are putting in play.
But there seems to be a sentiment,
particularly by many of the provider organizations, that the forum should have a more active role in the actual implementation of things that come out of our endorsement process.

other good work that is being done by others, what should be the role of the forum in actually collecting and reporting information on the various standards that are endorsed by us.
And then finally what role can we play
in devising or in defining an overall coherent, coordinated, and consistent approach to health care quality improvement.
Again, lots of entities doing lots of good work all over the board, but rife with redundancy and waste of effort and an undue burden on providers in many cases.
How could we bring some coherency to this as well as perhaps some efficiency? Those who would like to know more about the forum, you can go to our website.
I would note, though,
that as a membership organization, there are two portions to the website, the public and the members-only portion.
The members-only portion is much more robust than what is on the public side, although there's lots of information on the public side as well.
And finally, I would just close with this quote from the Institute of Medicine quality of care committee that notes: "Fundamentally, what we need to be looking
for in health care is a new system, a new way of

With that, thank you.
DR. McCLURE: My name is Mark McClure, and
thank you for allowing me to talk to you about this very important topic, mercury and dentistry and the potential consumer fraud and antitrust problems of organized dentistry surrounding this issue.
As you can see from my resume, which you can't see because I don't know how to operate e-mail in time, I'm a practicing local dentist and involved in integrated medical education.
Twenty-five years ago I worked with
the FTC on advertising and organized dentistry's roadblocks to implementing capitation, or HMO dentistry, as we called it then.
Now we're calling it managed care.
The work of the FTC at that time -- history reveals accelerated competition and change into the medical and dental industries.
I come before this
Commission to help you understand another consumer problem perpetrated by organized dentistry, which

As some of you in this room probably know, there's a controversy in dentistry according to the -concerning the use of mercury in filling materials implanted into yours and other patients' mouths.
Other
governmental groups, namely, Congress, FDA, EPA, are charged with investigating the personal safety and environmental toxicity of mercury in dentistry.

But antitrust Giving patients

full access to scientific and clinical information through their dentist and any other means is why this Commission needs to know some of these issues.
First, I'd be willing to bet that there is not a single dental patient in this room who has ever heard a dentist describe a mercury filling or a mercury amalgam.
No, dentists describe them as silver fillings, silver amalgams, or just plain amalgams.
Secondly, would you be concerned if I informed you that 50 percent of your amalgam filling is mercury; that mercury is a highly -- mercury in the filling is

from your filling when you chew is absorbed into your mucous membranes and lungs very efficiently at the tune of about 80 percent.
The mercury accumulates very
tenaciously in all the tissues of your body, especially brain and nerves, passes through the placenta if you are pregnant or your milk if you are nursing; and that mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive metal to biological tissues? Now, if some of that was true, and there are thousands of articles in the world medical toxicology literature to support this and much more, should I as a dentist, who has researched and practiced mercury-free dentistry, be able to mention any of this to my patients, to you, or to any others? These are the problems, and I'm thrilled the FTC is conducting these hearings to take a look at these.
The American consumer is being deceived about the mercury amalgam filling, and it's evident that the ADA, my professional organization, is complicit in the fraud and coverup.
Now, how does that happen? The public is
deceived by the word "silver" to describe dental fillings that are primarily mercury.
Dental amalgam is 50 percent

from the consumer when organized dentistry uses the term "silver."
It's also important for consumers to know that mercury -- that the amalgam is mainly mercury, that mercury, as I mentioned, is the most toxic non-radioactive material, is very volatile, is banned and phased out of most other health products.
Dental offices And
are the largest polluter of mercury in waste water.
the FDA, Health Canada, major amalgam manufacturers, have recommended that mercury fillings not be given to children, pregnant women, kidney, and hypersensitive patients.
The ADA has taken no position on this.
However, the mercury filling controversy remains relatively unknown to the public.
And a recent
poll stated that the safety of amalgam debate is still unknown to about 60 percent of the public.
Number four, the ADA has a vested economic interest for promoting -- for the promotion of mercury as silver, and fails to disclose its royalties from amalgam manufacturers.
The ADA has a seal of acceptance program The ADA claims

There are no peer review articles but only
anecdotal claims that the product must be safe because it's been used for the last 150 years.
The ADA publishes
a brochure calling the fillings "silver," burying the mercury content of amalgam and then making scientifically unfounded comments about its safety.
Number five, the FDA should stop the ADA, in my opinion, from the deception of promoting filling material as silver.
The safety is not within the scope of the
FTC, but the Commission has frequently acted to stop misleading claims of drugs and devices that the FDA has approved, and I think we've had examples of that today.
If all patients, but especially pregnant mothers and patients of young children, knew that these fillings were mostly mercury, it is unlikely that many would choose alternative materials -- or it is likely that many would choose alternative materials.
Furthermore, the ADA is explicit in suppressing information about mercury fillings.
Through its
tripartite structure, the ADA at the national, state, and local level, information and approval plows from top down.

The gag orders have been instituted by some dental boards to prosecute or intimidate mercury-free dentists from informing patients about the existence of mercury in dental fillings and the risk of such fillings.
Maryland is one of those states.
In summary, the issues that we are bringing before the FTC is that your consumers and our dental patients are: one, not properly being advised that the
metal fillings that are being placed in their mouths are mercury mixtures; two, the ADA has, through its promotional materials, falsely and misleadingly called the dental amalgam silver fillings when silver is only 25 to 30 percent of the mixture; and three, consumers are unaware of the highly toxic mercury being placed in their mouths and contributing to their toxic load.
Dentists
who wish to inform their patients of the fact are subject to ethics violations and regulatory action.

The Maryland dental board still has a gag rule, in writing, although enforcement has temporarily been abated.
In summary, the FTC should be interested in the ADA's mercury ethics and state dental boards' gag rules because it has the result of keeping consumers and dentists in the dark, and it violates the First Amendment rights of mercury-free dentist advocates.

what they were looking for.
if this was to be immunized under the state action doctrine, I think what the court would have sought was the state actually setting the prices or at least ascertaining that the prices were reasonable.
And because the state did not do that, allowed retailers to set their own prices, and the state was not actively monitoring what those prices were for reasonableness, that therefore there was no active supervision.
And I found that the analysis was incomplete because it didn't solve the issues that I had about well, was there an agreement in the first place? I mean, were
the private parties actually setting prices or simply complying with the statute? And that's why I said, David, I thought it was more relevant for a preemption analysis than a state action immunity analysis.

first wanted to give you the opportunity to respond, if you wanted to, to anything that Professor Havighurst or Ms. Andrus said, and then second, wanted to invite you to talk a little bit more about the competition advocacy project and the extent to which it's been successful or not in persuading both state and federal authorities of the merits of the Commission's views.
MR. DELACOURT: Well, I guess on the first
point, which was, you know, if there was anything I wanted to follow up on with respect to Professor Havighurst's testimony and Meredyth Andrus's testimony, and I guess it would be to point out one area where there was some divergence, and that was with respect to active supervision of state boards.
And it appeared to me from Professor Havighurst's testimony that he was more of the view that such boards were not analogous to municipalities, that they had very different sorts of electoral accountability, that the fact that a city government is directly responsible to voters makes it a different animal from a state board, and therefore would put the state board in the category of active supervision where a municipality is not.
And if I understood Meredyth

I guess I would -- as far as the debate is concerned, I would come out more on the side of Professor Havighurst.
And I think that's one of the fundamental
issues that the task force has really looked into, is what is the function of the active supervision requirement, and have the opinions found in the Supreme Court's opinion in Hallie really gotten away from what the active supervision is all about.
I would contend, with Professor Havighurst, that active supervision is about electoral accountability.
And with that as the standard, I think
you have a situation where state boards and other subsidiary regulatory authorities, which are not looking to public approval, at least directly, would need to be supervised by a higher government authority.
MS. ANDRUS: May I clarify my position, John,
I don't -- given the two choices,
whether you have to pass the active supervision prong of Midcal or not if you're a state regulatory board, I come somewhere in between.
I think there should be a more
rigorous scrutiny placed on whether or not a board is acting within its statutory authority than is placed on a

municipality for those very reasons that Professor Havighurst cited.
But I do not believe that a state board rises to the same level of scrutiny as, say, private parties do when you're talking about whether or not the state must actively supervise.
So I think there's a middle ground,
and I think state licensing boards fall into that.
MR. HYMAN: Do you want to -Yes.
With respect to advocacy,
MR. DELACOURT:
I think we -- just briefly on that, I think we have had very good success with the Commission's competition advocacy program.
One of the particular matters I
mentioned was state physician collective bargaining legislation, and I think we have a fairly strong track record there.
Two of the pieces of legislation we commented on ultimately were not enacted into law, and a third was enacted only after significant limitations were placed on the collective bargaining in the form of more rigorous active supervision by the state attorney general's office.
So I think that is -- that particular example is
characteristic of the overall success we've had.

Well, it is the
official policy of the Commission to only participate where we've received an invitation from an authorized state legislator or other interested state official.
in all instances, we've had an invitation.
However, I will -- you know, I think your point is still well taken in that in some instances, we've had an invitation from an individual who is clearly in the minority as far as the particular piece of legislation is concerned, and certainly have a tougher row to hoe there.
But I think, by and large, that policy has been a good one in that when our comments are submitted, typically they have been sought and are given some significant scrutiny before action is taken.

not sure we could ever make these state boards accountable in an effective way, and so I guess I'd require the legislature to step up and be clear.
Now, Ms. Andrus says her test is whether the anticompetitive regulation is reasonably contemplated in the legislation.
I think that's too generous.

John, Meredith, and Clark.
Professor Havighurst talked earlier about how he could possibly see a supremacy clause overriding the

I think we could all see
that in terms of a multi-state metro area, where the state said, to advantage our accountants or our chiropractors, we're going to do the following, that that might be viewed as anticompetitive and overridden.
Yet there are some other state actions that could be seen as relatively anticompetitive, yet within some reasonable stretch of the mind could be seen as regulation.
that? What comes to mind is the vast differences that some states have in admitting out-of-state lawyers, to the point where local counsel is a cottage industry in some states, and there doesn't necessarily seem to be any reason for that other than the strength of the local bar in those states.
Where would we see the line between the acceptable behavior and what would clearly trigger the supremacy clause? MR. HAVIGHURST: My idea was to focus And where really would the line be with
particularly on these boards that seem to be created in a way that makes them accountable to the licensed profession.
I suppose it's impossible to think that
nominations for board membership would not be vetted with

But somehow,
when the statute says that the nominees shall come from a list submitted by the association, that bothers me a lot.
I would probably call that -- I would say that's preempted.
It's a good way of sending a signal.
And I
think that the staff and the Commission ought to at least raise concerns about that kind of thing and sort of threaten using the antitrust laws that way, even if it's not likely a court would agree.
As to other things, I don't suppose the supremacy clause is going to be useful very often.
I
don't think you could use it to deal with the problem of out-of-state lawyers trying to get admitted on motion to another bar.
But I certainly agree that -- with the statement of the problem.
And again, I think a clear
articulation requirement of some kind would perhaps help there.
I have no further thought on that.
MS. ANDRUS: On the thought about the
nominations of a state board being legislatively mandated to come from the trade association, I think that's not a prudent policy.
But if the state decides that that is
the policy they wish to promote and follow, I think that's the state's right.

But I think that the states -- it is the
state's right to decide whether or not it wants to take that action.

argument, and I think that at that point the state's rights should be preempted.

differently.
MR. DELACOURT: I guess I would add to that You would analyze it a little bit
that I don't know that I would move immediately to the supremacy clause argument.
And I would note that the
particular issue of interstate spillovers is a big one, and the answer -- the example you used of lawyers being restricted from moving from one state to another I think is a good one.
Perhaps a better example is the Parker case itself, which involved a raisin marketing program, and 90 to 95 percent of the raisins that were affected were sold outside of the state of California.
So clearly the costs

So this has been a continuing problem with the way the state action doctrine has been implemented.
by way of improving upon the doctrine, and perhaps addressing that problem, I would make two recommendations.
One would be referring to the tiered approach that I'd addressed during my presentation, which would be to look to various factors that would counsel applying the clear articulation and active supervision requirements with greater rigor.
And I would say that And
the presence of interstate spillovers, particularly significant interstate spillovers, would be one factor counseling in favor of such an approach.
MR. DELACOURT: MR. HAVIGHURST: And I agree with that.
While we're still on that
point, let me make one observation about the Parker case, which has always struck me as a quite peculiar decision because it appeared that federal agricultural policy at that time expressly contemplated and approved exactly the kind of marketing orders that the California pro rata program was involved in.
And thus you didn't have, in
fact, the kind of conflict between federal policy and state policy that is necessary to trigger a state action issue.

Now, in other words, I suggest you reread Parker and you'll discover that there really isn't the conflict that is essential to any case where the doctrine, so-called doctrine, of Parker against Brown is to be applied.

their ability to lobby that? DR. LYON: Just to clarify, the association
that we're concerned about, again, is not -- it's not state nurses association, but the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, which we referred to as an association rather than a regulatory -- it is an association rather than a regulatory body.
MR. DELACOURT: I guess my analysis there would
be the relationship between the association and the state board or other authority that is actually passing the requirement into effect.
And I guess perhaps the distinction would come back to this issue of what in fact constitutes petitioning, and whether the government authority is really doing anything or whether they are just ministerially passing on what the private association has done.

And I think you've got an
analogy there to the tariff-filing cases, in which the private associations decide what the rate would be and then merely file that with the government authority.
However, if there is a lot of political content to what the association has done, that may be a tougher row to hoe. MR. HYMAN: If I could follow up on that

I think it's trying to keep
to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing for just a moment? And just to again reiterate, for clarity
purposes, that this National Council of State Boards of Nursing produces testing products that are sold to state boards.
So this association has an economic vested
interest in creating requirements that, in essence, will generate income for them, and then requiring state boards to, in essence, purchase these products and use these products.

they're a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, but that's pretty close to a nurse practitioner.
And those individuals, unfortunately their lens is pretty narrow.
And there's a political difficulty
here in that they view the future of the discipline as being nurse practitioner practice, and in essence substituting for the practice of physicians, and not clinical nurse specialist practice.
MR. KELLY: This would go to John and Meredyth.
We talked a little bit about physician collective bargaining and some of the problems that that can result

Obviously, that meets the first standard.
It would
take explicit legislation to authorize it.
But the
active supervision could be extremely difficult in terms of how the state would supervise the process of the physicians negotiating.
But my question really relates more to a related issue.
I've had physicians tell me on several
occasions that rather than collective bargaining for the actual price they're paid, it might be better for them if they could simply collectively deal with the government and some of the private payors in regards to how they're treated in non-economic issues -- timely payment, standardization of forms, and those kind of issues.
And I'd just like to see what John and Meredith see about the problems with implementing that kind of a program as opposed to a full-blown physicians collective bargaining.
MS. ANDRUS: Just to clarify what the question
is, the physicians then would collectively bargain with the government? Is that what you're saying? They're saying not to collectively
MR. KELLY:
bargain, but just to work together to resolve paperwork issues and standardization issues with the government and with large insurances, not the actual economic factor.

not seeing a problem with that.
MR. DELACOURT: I would second that Meredyth is
indeed not dense, and also note that that argument frequently comes up with these pieces of legislation.
And the way we've dealt with it is to suggest that if the physicians are merely interested in coordinating on factors that don't affect price, then an antitrust exemption is not necessary.
And furthermore, these types of arrangements, including messenger model type of arrangements, have been endorsed by the FTC/DOJ guidelines on health care, or the health care statements I guess is the term for it.
MR. HYMAN: Meredyth, when you spoke, you made
a point that in Maryland, the board is counseled by a state AAG, and further, that Maryland is the only one that actually does this.
And I guess the obvious
question that raises is what's going on in the other 49 states, given your involvement in the National Association of Attorneys General? I wonder if you could speak about that a little bit, and then talk about the risks of alternative models from the one you've outlined.
MS. ANDRUS: Okay.
I can generally.

To that end, if each is -- I
don't know the answer to this, but if each is assigned an assistant attorney general in their respective health departments to counsel the boards, that's great.
What I was saying is unique about Maryland that I am fully confident is not going on in other states is an ongoing instituted program whereby the antitrust division goes to the boards and says, you guys got a problem or potential problem and this is how we're going to fix it.
That's what I'm thinking is not happening in
other states.
And the risk of that is -- I mean, there's a couple of problems.
First, your AAGs, who are counseling
the boards on contract issues, on promulgation of regulations, or whatever it is, are not versed -- they're not -- they don't understand the antitrust laws.
So they
would not necessarily recognize a red flag if it was raised in the course of counseling the board.
Our assistant attorneys general in Maryland do know when to call me and say, we have a potential problem, because I've been on them for over ten years about potential anticompetitive issues that confront the board.
And they confront them over and over again So you have to

In other states, I think that they do -- on a case-by-case basis, as a problem arises, the attorney general or the antitrust division or bureau or section or whatever it is would come in and probably take care of the problem, or represent them if they were sued.
But I
do not believe that they instituted an ongoing problemshooting situation, which I think we're ahead of the game in that and I'm proud of it.
MR. HAVIGHURST: May I ask a question on that?
Meredyth, is it your thought that your involvement in this activity constitutes active supervision of those boards for purposes of the state action doctrine? MR. HYMAN: MS. ANDRUS: Clark stole my next question.
I know.
I know.
Well, you know,
we haven't articulated clearly what active supervision would constitute for this type of entity.
But I
certainly believe that I am actively supervising the board with respect to any issues that raise competitive concerns, yes.

whether you're giving policy advice or simply telling them not to violate the law and counseling them as to what it takes.

talked about several activities that the FTC might undertake as a result of the state action and NoerrPennington reports when they're prepared.
In terms of both of those, where do you see the greatest potential for improvement in prosecuting anticompetitive behavior if the FTC is able to fully implement their agendas? MR. DELACOURT: Well, I guess before answering
that one, I'll reiterate the disclaimer that these are my views and not the views of the Federal Trade Commission.
But one area has been already teed up with the last question posed to Meredyth about whether the AG's office in Maryland is engaging in active supervision.
I
mean, I think that's a very useful role that can come out
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301)870-8025

And if Meredyth could be
out there carrying the banner or, you know, encouraging others in the National Association of Attorneys General to be talking about what sorts of conduct would provide adequate supervision, that would be great.
And the
reason I say that is that in our Indiana Movers case, we attempted to set forth the elements that real active supervision would entail, but we're kind of doing that at a very high level and we need input from the state AGs to say what the specifics would look like.
I think they
have a much better idea of how active supervision can be carried out efficiently and how it can be carried out with minimal burden.
So I think that's one area where we MS. ANDRUS:
can see a lot of movement forward.
Can I second that, too, and also mention the fact that the states and the federal government, both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, are working very cooperatively together.
that that suggestion is a very good one.
MR. HYMAN: Let me follow up with Dr. McClure.

There's obviously been a fairly extensive array of private litigation about these issues against state boards and, I gather, the American Dental Association as

And you were involved, I gather, in one such piece
of litigation in Maryland.
I wonder if you could just talk very briefly about how you all have fared in the private litigation, including the one that you were involved in.

Let me Okay.
And that terminated how long
follow up on that question and just a somewhat more narrow one.
As I understand the various ethics rules
that the American Dental Association has, and I'm not going to get the language exactly right, but their position seems to be that it's unethical or fraudulent for a dentist to advise a patient that the fillings that they have should be removed and replaced with mercury-
For The Record, Inc.

122 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 free fillings.
DR. McCLURE: MR. HYMAN: Or they could be toxic to them.
Or using the magic -- what we in
antitrust call the nine no-nos, the language that is problematic.
Maybe we should put it that way.
But
they've also sought to limit advertising just generally of mercury-free dentistry? DR. McCLURE: MR. HYMAN: That's correct.
Now, do you see a distinction
between patients who come in needing fillings and the option is given to them at that time, versus patients that come in with fillings and the dentist counsels the patient about the, from your view, toxic nature of those fillings? DR. McCLURE: The problem is that a patient
coming in with the request to the dentist to be able to remove fillings, the dentist is perfectly able to be able to proceed on that from an informational standpoint as well as a, you know, procedural standpoint.
But the dentist is not able -- as I read the ethics rules and try to abide by them, the dentist is not able to mention the toxicity of mercury if that's not brought up by the patient.
So it puts an uneducated
patient at a decisive disadvantage to be able to advance that agenda.

And so for that
part of it, I mean, that's the major point that I'm trying to make, is that the consumer is left in the dark.
This scientific and academic debate is being squelched by -- you know, in my -- by the ADA in this particular situation.

who came in and asked what kind of filling he could get, and you tell him, you can get the mercury or the other, and he says, well, gee, which one is better for me? mean, are you allowed to -DR. McCLURE: Sure.
Once they bring it up, I'm I
allowed to take care of that, to answer the question.
And in my situation, since I've been mercury-free for 20 years, I have a different population base that comes in to me.
However, I'm kind of carrying the banner for
people that are just getting into this process that don't have -- that don't realize, you know, that this person -that they have a choice.
MR. KELLY: I'll get back to John.
That was an
excellent answer on the state action part of the question.
Let me give you a chance to give us a response

MR. DELACOURT: Right.
Well, I guess on the
Noerr-Pennington side, I think perhaps the development in the law there that would be potentially the most useful would be clarification of the continuing existence of an independent misrepresentation exception.
I think right now establishing that a piece of litigation or some other petitioning effort is objectively baseless is so difficult that those sorts of efforts are virtually never successful.
And so scaling
that back to a misrepresentation analysis I think not only will achieve the result we're looking for, but in addition to that I just think it's properly related to the goals of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.
The Noerr-Pennington doctrine is directed towards protecting communicating with government, and those are viewed as having some sort of political content.
But when you've come to the position of filing
a lawsuit or otherwise engaging in petitioning that is infused with misinformation and misrepresentations or key omissions, I think that clearly that sort of conduct no longer really has any bona fide political function and really can be viewed under the auspices of the antitrust laws.
MS. ANDRUS: One additional clarification to

Noerr that I would love to see is in the context of the patent and generic pharmaceutical litigation, the patent infringement lawsuits, where the two parties settle an infringement suit and then take the settlement and have the court essentially rubber-stamp it and then call it therefore Noerr protected.
I would like to see that
particular position disqualified as deserving of Noerr protection.
MR. HYMAN: I've got another question for
When you described what NQF does, it sounded
like they divide broadly into two distinct categories.
One is developing performance measures and the other is developing standards for treatment.
And I don't have a sense of the sort of comparative size of those two categories, but my question is really directed at the second category, that is, treatment standards or guidelines.
A complaint that
we've heard repeatedly is that there are too many guidelines out there, and the problem is figuring out which ones you should use, and particularly when you get into a litigation setting.
But the specific question I wanted to ask you to address is the comparative advantage of NQF in developing defensible guidelines or standards.
You've
already spoken of one, which is the speed with which you

And I just wanted to give you an
opportunity to talk a little bit more about NQF's advantage in developing these things.
DR. KIZER: terminology there.
Yes.
Let me clarify some
First of all, we have not engaged in
actually developing treatment guidelines or quality of care standards, if you will.
By definition, as a
voluntary consensus standard-setting body, what comes out of our pipeline are consensus standards.
That's often
confusing to the provider community because those are often confused with -- the consensus standard may be a performance measure or quality indicator or other terms that often have just -- have different meaning based on nuances of language but are not really quality of care or standards of care, which is what people often think of in terms of standards.
So we're not engaged in that.
The endorsing --
and likewise, while we have recently taken on some projects to develop some performance measures, most of our work is focused on endorsing performance measures that either are tied to national priorities or what will reasonably be expected to be national priorities when those are set, where there is an evidence base supporting them and some other criteria.
There's a plethora of standard-setting groups

out there.
One of the problems is that there are so many I hope that we can
that there's a lot of confusion.
contribute to this by endorsing a set of national performance measures that has agreed-upon specifications, et cetera.
These standards will both reduce the burden
and increase the value and the meaning of what comes out of that pipeline because they will have been agreed to during the endorsement process.
MR. KELLY: Dr. McClure.

With your litigation that you were involved
in, you indicated it's no longer going through the court system.
How did it end? DR. McCLURE: I'm not versed in the legal -- I
believe that it was put -- you know, the legal term for it, it was dismissed, probably, or it was put aside because there wasn't enough -- they didn't feel that they should be getting into the -- there wasn't enough value for them to enter into the argument, I believe.

I have a question for Professor Havighurst.

Obviously, leave aside the antitrust elements But the logic of delegating these sorts of things
to medical staff in the first place was a lack of expertise and knowledge on the part of the executive body of the hospital.

explain in a little more detail what the governing board is going to be able to do to prevent the anticompetitive possibilities of having the medical staff making the decisions.
MR. HAVIGHURST: Sure.
You recall that I said
that I think this is both a requirement of subsequent antitrust law as well as the state action doctrine.
It
would apply to private hospitals as well as public ones.
And so the question you ask is, well, what should boards do to minimize the risk to competition posed by putting the doctors in charge of their competitors' access to the hospital? Well, there are a lot of things.

I mean, each Sometimes the
issue is what happened in the operating room on the night of such-and-such, and you have to interview the nurses and you have to -- and the stories go on and on.
And you
can rely on the medical staff for their version, but it might also be useful to have a committee of the board

Sometimes, in getting -- making a judgment about whether a doctor is competent or not, it would be useful to get an outside doctor's opinion, get somebody else to review the charts and see if the medical staff's view is the same as the outsider.
many other things.
There are probably But what
It depends on the case.
you're looking for is conscientious attention by the board to the interests of the hospital the board should make sure that the doctors its getting are good doctors, that they are doctors that it wants for its own commercial reasons.
I've seen cases where the medical staff wanted to get rid of a doctor, but he was a big admitter.
And
the board might have had a very different view based on the economics, the incentive presented by the chance to get all these patients.
There's a tradeoff there, but
the hospital's judgment is more reliable, to my mind, and more appropriate than that of the medical staff.
there's a lot a board can do and the conscientious counsel could tell the board how to handle each case to make sure they're doing their duty.
And on the other I think
hand, if you've found over time that your medical staff is highly reliable, then you don't have to do as much.

But I think there is a need for that oversight, both as an antitrust matter and as a state action, community matter.
MR. KELLY: How would that be different in the
case of a private hospital? MR. HAVIGHURST: I don't think it would be much
The question you're asking is a little
different, but I think the private hospital can escape virtually all of the antitrust risks that are involved in credentialing if the board has taken its responsibility and made a hospital decision in the hospital's interests on the matter.
And I think those cases should be dismissed summarily if the hospital has done its duty in that regard.
Most hospitals historically have not, but this
is a way in which antitrust law can make sure that hospitals are taking charge of this matter in the ultimate sense, relying on their doctors for advice but not letting them call all the shots.
MR. KELLY: I guess my follow-up question would
be even if you were to establish that as the case, you're always going to have some doctor come along and say, well, that's all true, but in my case they really conspired against me.
MR. HAVIGHURST: Yes.

I mean, the way to think about this whole
thing is to think about the hospital and the medical staff are independent entities engaged in a joint venture.
And they set up the joint venture using the
least restrictive possible alternative, namely, that the hospital ultimately makes these decisions rather than the medical staff.
So once you've set up that decision-
making process, and assuming you follow through on it, then these cases -- there's no conspiracy.
There's
simply a joint venture doing its job, running a hospital with medical input on one hand and the hospital's inputs on the other.
And I guess those cases ought to be thrown out real fast if the hospital board has done its duty and can show that it exercised independent judgment.

And it should be possible
for counsel to tell the board what it takes to defeat that claim and get the hospital board then to do its duty.

guess as a final thought, I would like to note that both the work of the state action task force and the NoerrPennington task force are motivated by the premise that both of these immunities have been expanded too broadly.
And I think that, you know, perhaps it's too simple, but one way I think that we could get back to the appropriate scope of these immunities is to import a notion from the constitutional law context, which is that of narrow tailoring.
And if we look to the political
objectives that are sought to be advanced by these two different immunities, in the case of state action, that would be advancing the state policy, and in the case of Noerr that would be advancing the right or protecting the right to petition.

We are trying to develop issues that look at the quality that's found in the long-term care situation, the information that consumers are able to find, whether there are better avenues to get that information to them, and the other issues that we have listed in our description.
I would like to introduce our panelists, who are very -- who without this we couldn't have a panel today.
We don't spend a lot of time on the introductions And this does, of course,
because we want to spend more time on the questions and answers and the presentations.

Thank you, Sarah.
Good afternoon, Thank
It's a pleasure for me to be here
today on behalf of the National Center for Assisted Living.
My name is Jan Thayer, and I have been a provider of a variety of long-term care services over all of my professional life, dealing as I am, as a trained registered dietitian and also as a nursing home owner and administrator.
I no longer own the nursing home, but
have now moved into the ownership of assisted living and retirement communities, and also as the president and CEO of a company that manages, develops, and consults with assisted living facilities and other kinds of retirement

here today.
What I would like to bring to you is a discussion about the long-term care spectrum and the role that assisted living plays in that long-term care spectrum.
Obviously, you see that for most of us, we However, So indeed, it's a pleasure for me to be

as we move into our later years and as we begin to see our needs increased, we enter many times into independent living on a retirement campus.
There are a variety of services that are supportive that can occur at that level, but most of them begin to occur as we see the second and third box.
The
acuity increases as we move to the right of the slide, with those services that are available to people in assisted living, where we still see lots of choice, where we still see lots of independence.
And when people come to me as I was sitting in the chair of the executive director for my facility, they would say to me, what's the difference between assisted living and a nursing home? And I used to explain it the
best way I knew how to lay people who were shopping for the first time: In assisted living, we assist you to In a nursing facility, primarily

we take care of you.

There was lots for them to read and lots for them to absorb, but that, I thought, was a phrase that they could take home and remember.
Obviously, when we have needs that are so increased that we cannot meet those in an assisted living facility, along the long-term care spectrum the next logical step is the nursing facility and then the subacute and moving on to the acute care area.
We also know
that there's a very large place in the long-term care spectrum for home care, adult care, hospice care, all of the variety of community-based services that can be brought in.
It would be interesting for you to know that there are about 36,000 assisted living licensed residences in the United States.
The average residence
houses 40 to 50 residences, but many are much smaller than that.
We see lots of three- and four-bed units.
And we see those that are very small, very homelike, in fact, take place in a building that looks like a large family home that maybe our grandparents occupied at one time in their lives.
Statistically, it shows that about 60.5 percent of the units that are available for folks are studios.
That means that they are simply large rooms, but they are

that's what people like about assisted living.
And
About a
third of them are one-bedroom, and then a little over 8 percent are two-bedroom.
Our statistics tell us that across the country, there is about an 87 percent average occupancy rate, and that it costs about $26,000 a year to live in these facilities.
However, fees can vary, and that is
something that we emphasize that people need to find out when they're doing their search and their comparison.
This fee schedule varies quite significantly depending upon whether it's in a rural area of the country or a more urban area of the country.

ADLs, we
talk about, those of us that are in this business.
Eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring are the things that people begin to need help with as they age.
And it might be an interesting tidbit for you to know that bathing is the most common activity of daily living that nursing home residents and assisted living

144 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 residents both need help with, in varying degrees, but that is the one thing that we see in common, along with the other items, but that the most.
Transferring, we simply mean being able to move from one chair to another, or from a chair to a bed, or to get up from bed in the morning.
There are approximately 900,000 assisted living residents, of whom 69 percent are female.
The typical
resident, about 83 years old, needs assistance with 2.25 ADLs.
However, it's interesting to note that 19 percent
require no assistance whatsoever.
Nearly two-thirds of these folks have incomes of $25,000 or less, and so if we look at the -- and remember the statistic on the previous slide, where it costs about $26,000 to live in a facility, one of the challenges we have in this country is to find a way to provide affordable assisted living for many, many of our residents.

So if we look at the dependence, you can see the numbers and the percentages there for yourself that even -- you see, as I stated before, bathing is the most common ADL for which residents need assistance.
But you

On the other hand, how about the activity of daily living independence? About 28 percent of people
can bathe themselves in assisted living facilities, while only 6 percent in a nursing facility, and on it goes down the line.
As I said, only about 2.25 activities of daily
living we need to assist people with in our assisted living facilities, where that's about an average of 3.8 in a nursing facility.
It also would be interesting to you, I think, to know that nursing homes and assisted living facilities vary in nature depending upon the state in which they're located.
They also vary depending on the overall
policies and procedures of that assisted living facility.
We insist and coach our people all the time with not only what we publish but in all of our communications, how important it is to be able to carefully spell out what it is that our facility does.
Only about -- about two out of every three nursing home residents require and depend upon Medicaid to help support them in a nursing facility, while another 10 percent rely upon Medicare.
And conversely, only
about 10 percent of assisted living residents receive any kind of support through government assistance.

Seniors are less disabled today than they used We know that according to the study published by

The assisted living work group was a two-year exercise that was -- just finished its work.
And any
discussion of assisted living must be prefaced by mentioning this report.
It was about assisted living
quality, and it was presented to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging on April 29th.
In 2001, then-chairman Senator John Breaux asked assisted living stakeholders to develop recommendations designed to ensure more consistent quality in assisted living and in those services nationwide.
And as a result of this, the assisted living
workgroup was organized with nearly 50 organizations, stakeholders representing providers, consumers, long-term care and health professionals, regulators, and accrediting bodies.
Meetings began in 2001, and a report was presented that was entitled, "Assuring Quality in

Federal Policy, and Operational Models."
those recommendations adopted by the ALW related to consumer protection, and we'll reference those today.
In 1999 there was a report issued by the General Accounting Office that found that some assisted living providers were not disclosing all of the information deemed important for consumers in order for them to make informed choices when choosing a community.
The assisted living profession took that very, very seriously, and in order to be able to answer that, NCAL did some important things.
One of them was to issue "The
Power of Ethical Marketing," which is part of our testimony.
The kind of disclosure that we believe in builds trust between the residents and the consumer, and marketing materials are extremely, extremely important.
Here's an example of another kind of document that we have produced in order for us to be able to inform our marketers when they are out looking.

is something that's also in our testimony, which is a
state-by-state comparison of regulations as they exist today.
Defining quality, which is something that we're all about, is not simple.
We say in our workgroup, and
we say it in the National Center for Assisted Living, that it's very, very hard for us to judge quality because we don't have enough research yet.
We promote research,
and we're saying you are out shopping, how can you really determine whether or not what you're looking for is going to be met? It's a challenge to provide an environment
where residents feel the greatest satisfaction possible and also have the greatest kind of independence.
So are we to judge on a process or an outcome Despite the challenges that we have, we need to
continue to look at how we're going to measure quality in the future.
According to a recently published issue brief, there are these kinds of issues that -- I see my time is running out, and I don't have time to explain all of them

It
And she says there
are currently two types of outcome measures used by assisted living residences: resident assessment interest
instruments, and satisfaction surveys.
And she goes on to say that those two can have potential inherent conflict, and that we must identify areas for improvement that are candid, not based on giving the caregivers the guideline, the picture, for what they need to do to have a very good grade because then they will aspire to that, just like we did in college.

I wanted to go on to say with the last slide, choosing a lot of -- choosing an assisted living facility requires a lot of involvement by the consumer and the family.
It's a process that involves the choice of home
and staff who provide services.
It involves being very candid on both sides of the issue, with what you need and what the person can provide.
And if you refer to the assisted living

And in closing, I would say that a high involvement decision is one that requires in-person visits, being sure that you have all of your answers -or questions answered, to observe personally residents and staff.
Because it's a complex process.

values, needs, and preferences must always be considered by all of us when any time we are making a decision as important as choosing an assisted living facility.

we deal directly with these challenges, we will continue to be mired down in approaches that are not likely to yield us what all of us want, which is quality of care and quality of life.
What are those challenges? Well, it seems to And
me that they rest on five competing sets of values.
this is a theme that some of you may have heard me talk about before.
But let me tell you explicitly what I
think those competing values are and why I feel they are so important to assisted living.
The first of those is safety versus autonomy.
Many of you know that I have studied and thought about this particular set of competing values for quite a while.
But it is central to many of the discussions
about regulation and oversight.
In our society, we want to maximize, which is virtually impossible.
A good friend of mine, Bob
Appelbaum, who is very well known for his work in quality and long-term care, said, what we want most for ourselves is autonomy, and what we want for those we love is safety.
And that's very true.
The problem is, we seldom can have the maximum

And yet when we approach how to deal with risk,
how to deal with independence, how to deal with choice, we act as if we can.
So we must find ways of dealing
with the conflict inherent in maximum safety and maximum autonomy.
The second set of competing values
are the rights of the individual and the rights of the community.
rights.
We're all familiar with the issue of resident
We're all familiar also with the concept of what
it means to live in an institution or to work in an institution, whether that be a church, a school, a family, or other organization to which we belong.
We
find ourselves often wanting things or needing things that others don't care about, others don't agree with, that others find disruptive to their life.
And we find
ourselves having to balance what we want, what we prefer, what we need, versus what others want, need, and prefer.
And when people live on a long-term basis in a setting, those that live there and those that operate them face the same challenge of balancing competing and often conflicting desires, needs, and preferences.
The third challenge -- and this is really a difficult one that many states are experiencing a bitter lesson, including my own state, about how to deal with -this is what I call the expectation of standards versus the ability to pay.

confronting so severe crisis that even minimum standards are at risk.
many, or any.
And yet minimum standards do not satisfy So the dilemma that we have is that we
have and we want things that we are not or cannot pay for.
The fourth challenge that I think that we face, and despite the valiant efforts of the assisted living workgroup I believe we still face, is what assisted living is and who it serves.
Many would say that a Others
three-bed-unit house is not assisted living.
would say that you only have assisted living if they have the capacity to deliver XYZ services.
So we have not yet
reached consensus at any level about what assisted living should be, how it should be defined, and who it should serve.
So having said that, then, let me suggest to you what I will put forth as a recommendation.
And bear
with me because now -- I want to read this part because I think it will go faster and I'll be sure to say what I want.
Recommendation one: Recognize the value of and First we
continue to develop uniform disclosure forms.
should recognize that efforts taken to implement a

These efforts were
undertaken in response to the 1999 JO report, as it's called, for written information regarding cost, service agreements, discharge criteria, and grievance procedures provided to consumers before a contract is signed.
Many states have developed instruments to access this information.
Industry trade associations I believe this

tool can be useful for states to weed out sites that are willingly -- and I underline the word willingly -engaging in fraudulent behavior, and help consumers think through their options in an organized manner.
But disclosure is not likely to ensure consumers fully understand what they are buying or answer questions about what it will really cost, how much control they will be able to exercise over their care and their environment, or when they will be told they cannot live there any longer.
Second: Recognize the benefits of negotiated
risk agreements and continue to develop a mediation process for consumers and providers to address and reconcile differences in service delivery decisions.
A second strategy worth further exploration in relation to aging with choice, as some have begun to call

attempts by consumers to assert their rights to age in place and exercise greater decisional autonomy.
This
strategy calls for investigating the various forms of a negotiated risk process.
States such as Michigan, Louisiana, and Texas have already adopted legislation designed to facilitate this negotiation at one level by saying that consensus reached between physicians, consumers, and providers about specific individuals remaining in assisted living could be legally honored.
At least 28 states have incorporated negotiated risk language in their regulations governing assisted living, recognizing them as a potential mechanism to facilitate discussion between consumers and providers when disagreement looms over what the consumer wants and what the provider feels can be accommodated both in terms of autonomy and individual rights.
This approach has been a topic of considerable Some of my colleagues believe negotiated risk to
be dangerous, misleading, and serves to protect providers of any liability if harm results from poor quality care.
Others think they're hard to do, harder to implement, and make enforcing rules of any kind harder.
But to me, what
is truly dangerous is a categorical refusal to recognize that quality in the truest sense can never be achieved

Some have written about negotiated risk assessment, have stressed the underlying issues associated with legal issues.
But I am more persuaded by
ethical arguments that sees negotiated risk as a process that facilitates systematic discussion of choices, options, and consequences.
Having a written, signed agreement, in my view, should be a mechanism to remind parties of their discussions and agreements.
These agreements are signed
both by the provider and the consumer in acknowledgment that a consumer has chosen to continue or discontinue a certain service or care plan even though doing so may result in a negative consequence.
Consumers agree to
accept some responsibility for outcomes that may occur under the agreement stipulations.
The guiding principle
behind such written agreements is that risk is a natural element of adult life and successful negotiations can occur to ensure a higher degree of autonomy for consumers as they exercise their rights.
This does not mean that
providers are or should be exempt from providing high quality of care.
Community standards of care must still

is make sure it stays that way.
Research has shown that family involvement can have beneficial impact on the quality of life for assisted living residents and can also create positive experiences for the provider as well.
By tapping into What we need to do
this resource and finding ways to motivate and encourage the involvement of families and friends, we can address the controversies of negotiated risk agreements and ensure a higher degree of quality both for individuals and for others who call assisted living home.
Fourth strategy: Retool the existing survey
process to include quality of life measures and to more accurately represent the findings of surveys.
Retooling

Robert Mollock in his
review of state regulations describes the overwhelmingly process-oriented nature of current state survey methods.
While anecdotal evidence abounds, little empirical evidence exists about what the actual survey results indicate for assisted living.
In my own work, the
evidence suggests that the state surveys seldom address quality of life, and quality of care citations often focus on process measures such as food storage and records documentation.
To complicate the issue more, the integrity of severity rating systems, which classifies at-risk consumers, are based upon the citations issued during a survey, are compromised when restricted distribution of scores indicated in such scales do not act to discriminate among providers.
Further, many times surveys are done in a manner that raises appeals against the citations the appeals are often successful and the citations are ultimately removed from the record.
Many accessing
public records are not aware of how this process works and may place too much confidence in their accuracy.
Yet
to my knowledge, nowhere are consumers made aware of the limitations of such information.
In my view, the survey

Particular attention should be paid to the over-reliance on so-called quality reports that do not establish more precise parameters.
States should be
encouraged to evaluate rigorously the quality of information they have gathered.
Consumers should be
encouraged to engage regularly in their own sensory test evaluation.
Fifth and last, train family members, consumers, personal advocates, and surveyors to holistically assess quality measures, including quality of life and quality of care.
Make more training
available to family members, consumers, personal advocates, and surveyors to comprehensively assess quality of care and quality of life measures.
Prospective residents and their families should have access to information that helps them become better sensory surveyors to help them inform themselves of what is really happening in residences.
We need to recognize that quality of life is an equal component in the quality of care and general quality indicators, which means accepting sometimes that providers will have to make a tradeoff between safest procedure, yielding to the needs of consumers that they

The importance of this recommendation is in the training of consumer advocates and surveyors for a new generation of elders who won't be accepting of regulations that ignore quality of life and their firm belief in the continued autonomy in later life.

Let me talk a little bit today about assisted Jan mentioned a number of these studies.
One is
a study that was led by Katherine Haas, the national study on assisted living.
And in part of her report, she
notes that 90 percent of residents believed they were able to stay in an assisted living residence for as long as they wished.
And we know that's not accurate.
Most were also uninformed about a facility's policies on retention and discharge.
In 1999, the GAO
report found a number of items relating to marketing: One, that consumers generally relied on the providers for all of their information; secondly, that providers did not always give consumers information sufficient to determine whether or not the assisted living residence itself could meet their needs; thirdly, that the marketing material, contracts, and other written materials weren't always complete and they were sometimes vague; and lastly, that 25 percent of facilities routinely provided contracts before a resident moved in.
So that means that they didn't really have an opportunity to review the material ahead of time.
As I said, that was in 1999.
And I think there
has been a lot of progression and movement forward in that arena.
A lot of these issues are relevant to all
sizes of the assisted living residences, but the majority

owner/operator.
The Consumer Consortium has run a national help line since 1998, and it has manned a website message board since the beginning of 2001.
So we have an
opportunity to hear from people all over the country about, you know, what their experiences are, what their concerns are.
And it's been our anecdotal experience
through those two arenas that the marketing problems most often occur in the larger facilities, not so much the smaller ones.
And typically, when I say larger
facilities, these would be 40 beds or larger.
And we think that to a large degree, the reason that is is because the way the marketing operations are designed.
And four specific areas: One, that marketing
staff often aren't well-oriented to the care function of the residence.
A lot of time and attention is spent on the marketing component, you know, selling the actual facility, but not really so much on the other side.
So
there's a gap in understanding of what the services and support are that residents can -- this is so hard for me.
At ALW, we really wrestled over, you know, do we call
For The Record, Inc.

staff can feel pressured by management to keep beds filled.
And this can lead to sometimes marketing staff
giving promises in order to lure people -- lure isn't the right word, but to attract people into their facilities to keep the census up.
Thirdly, that a high turnover in marketing staff can create an environment where the staff aren't there long enough to really know the residence and the population and what it can and can't do.
And then lastly, that the size and volume of a facility itself makes it harder for the marketing staff maybe to spend adequate time.
So, for example, a
marketing staff for a facility with 40 residents will have more time to spend than one that is trying to fill a 90- or 120-bed facility.
So sometimes it's just a matter
of time available to spend reviewing contracts, et cetera.
The assisted living workgroup that we've referred to had a number of recommendations that came out of it that I think were really fantastic.
One is that it
requires all assisted living residences to have a written contract between the residence and the residents.

Thirdly, that all prospective residents have the right to review the contract prior to admission, and that includes having a third party, maybe an elder law attorney or somebody else within the family, have an opportunity to review it.
And fourthly, that the majority of the ALW felt that providers should not use a universal standardized contract.
Instead the recommendation was: here are the
key issues of importance the contract should cover, and then allowing the residences themselves to customize and add.
But just to give you a little bit of statistics why we feel, CCAL feels, it's important to have at least some guidelines, 28 percent -- according to Robert Mollecko's report, 28 states do not require any kind of written material -- or any information about resident rights in their written material; 30 states do not require any information on admission or discharge criteria; 34 states don't require any information on grievance procedures; and 36 states don't require any information on termination of contract provisions.
So
there really is a need to give some push to those states

We also discussed a recommendation to develop a model for states to use in producing consumer reports.
And this, unfortunately, did not reach majority consensus.
A minority felt that this was a function that
should be done through the public regulatory agencies.
CCAL did support that recommendation, though.
We felt that that was an excellent opportunity to provide more information and help make it a little bit more available to the public.
Going back again to my over two decades of experiences, my experience and belief is that what really fosters and sustains quality of care in a long-term care environment is caring, enlightened leadership.
For this
strength, the most important foundation -- or from this strength, the most important foundation is staff.

you don't know your residents, you don't care about your residents, you're there just to get a paycheck, you're exhausted, maybe you've worked a number of double shifts, and you're concerned about paying your electric bill.
these things are really important considerations as we look at how we're actually running and operating these facilities.
I have had the opportunity to run assisted living and nursing home facilities, and I found that instituting and maintaining a supportive environment, or what we often call culture change, costs no more.
there's no down side economically to doing this.
But often the money savings are in non-direct For example, when you run a really wonderful So So
facility, you tend to attract people, so your census is higher.
When you don't have a lot of staff turnover, you're not spending the money in recruitment, hiring, training.

trained, you tend to have lower rates of workmen's compensation and unemployment insurance.

I am Barbara Manard,

I've been asked to address Every
a number of questions and issues with respect to nursing homes.
First, a few words about the market in general.
As of 2002, there were more than 16,000 licensed nursing facilities in the U.S., serving some 1.5 million patients or residents on any one day.
Most, 65 percent of these,
are proprietary, but a substantial number, about 23 percent, are privately owned nonprofits.
The remainder
are government-owned, typically by counties.
More than two-thirds of the residents are paid for by Medicaid, a joint federal-state problem.
The
federal program, Medicare, covers an additional 10 percent.
Private payments contribute about half of
facilities' revenues, although private payors make up

After a decade of declining occupancy due to a variety of factors, including the growth of alternatives such assisted living and a healthier, wealthier elderly population, occupancy has stabilized nationally at a median of about 88 percent, exactly where assisted living is, I saw.
There are, however, wide variations across the nation with respect to nursing home occupancy.
Hawaii,
Minnesota, and Connecticut, as shown, are the top three states in the nation with respect to occupancy, with medians in the mid-90s, while Texas, Arkansas, and Oregon, the bottom three, are in the mid to low 70s.
These differences tend to reflect a combination of public regulatory and payment policies.
Turning now to the specific issues you raised, the first inquiries about the type of information that consumers have about cost and quality.
Disclosure of
full and accurate information to consumers is not the same sort of issue in the nursing home field as it is in some other health care areas, including assisted living.
There is virtually no debate over the appropriateness of full disclosure in the nursing home field.

per se is not the issue.
This document, which is about 50 pages singlespaced, contains the federal regulations regarding a nursing home's obligation with respect to resident rights, many of which refer to information on matters such as covered services, associated charges, and access to federal assessments of nursing home quality.
We are not aware of substantial problems with regard to residents, potential residents, or their families having information about the cost of services, although understanding Medicare and Medicaid payment and coverage policies can be a challenge.
In addition, there is a wealth of information available on the internet, including the federal site, Nursing Home Compare, which I hope that Barbara Paul will describe in some detail.
Nearly all states maintain Volume
similar sites, with at a minimum a link to the federal site.
As of last year, at least twenty of the state sites contained detailed information such as full survey reports on individual facilities.
Several states, such
as California, Texas, and Maryland, have developed their

seeking out information from multiple sources such as those mentioned above, nursing home ombudsmen, and state regulatory agencies.
Those who are able to avail themselves of these resources should not lack reasonably adequate information to make well-informed purchasing decisions.
On the other
hand, those who need nursing home care are by definition frail, frequently suffer from cognitive impairments, and often lack informal supports to help them with decisions.
We do not actually know how well-informed these and other consumers are when they choose a nursing home or how much more or better information would matter to their choices, though it may be important for other reasons such as general public awareness.
Research on consumer choices of nursing homes is limited, but consistently points to the primacy of location and affordability as key factors.
Furthermore,
nursing home residents rarely vote with their feet after

Transfers among residents are
rare, about 5 percent of all admissions.
Those factors suggest the continued need for mechanisms in addition to publicly available information, consumer choice, and market forces to enhance and sustain nursing home quality.
Some do hope that in the future,
better information and decision support systems, among other things, might improve the operation of market forces in the nursing home field and hence improve quality.
That, in fact, has been one of the driving
forces behind implementation of the new federal nursing home quality measures across the nation.
Suffice it to say at this point that the quality indicators available, particularly through the federal efforts, to potential consumers available over the internet are generally state-of-the-art, although they have widely recognized limitations.
These
limitations, discussed later, are for the most part inherent in the state of the art itself in the complexity of the subject.
As efforts are made to improve the state of the art and quality of the information, so too should the opportunity be seized to determine the effect of the unique national experiment we have undertaken with publication of these measures.

While much of this information is available from individual facilities and at some state websites, the challenge has been to develop reliable measures and uniform reporting formats for cross-facility comparisons.
Research is underway to address these problems.
The way in which information is presented is at least as important as the quality of the information itself in terms of the effectiveness of the message.
This is one area where problems are perhaps less a matter of lack of research than the inconsistent application of what is known.

We are blessed in the nursing home field by a

But to This basic
tool was state of the art 20 years ago when first conceived, but today, despite some updating in the tinkering sense, it does not fully capture the type of information that experts now believe is necessary to track and evaluate quality.
This is not a call for more questions appended to an already lengthy assessment form, but for investment in information technology that can ultimately make the collection, storage, retrieval, and use of clinical data for quality monitoring and other purposes seamless, accurate, and efficient.
In large part because of the existence of this MDS database of clinical information, recent developments in nursing home quality measurement have focused intensely on clinical outcome measures such as those published by CMS.
The industry, including AAHSA, has
strongly supported CMS in its quality initiatives, and

The key problems with the CMS measures and outcome measures in the nursing home field in general are related to the difficulty of finding ways to measure performance that is attributable to an individual nursing home rather than the types of patients it serves.
Does this home have more patients with decubidi than others because it specializes in treating those at high risk for skin breakdown or because it has failed to implement appropriate skin care and other clinical procedures? That's the real question.
The difficulty in finding appropriate measures to provide answers is in part related to the lack of clear linkages between care processes and outcomes.
We
know less than we all want to with respect to what works.
In addition, where there is better information about the causal chain leading to adverse outcomes, we often lack the right information to develop optimal risk adjusters, given the administrative data at hand.
Additional issues include the challenge of dealing with instability over time and the general lack of objective benchmarks of expected performance.
There
are a number of other technical problems that researchers have attempted to deal with related to developing

Most experts, including prominently those who developed the current CMS measures, would agree that entirely satisfactory solutions await further work.
For those who would be hard-pressed to define selection bias, attribution bias, or censoring, terms used by experts to describe various technical problems, one common-sense problem is apparent to any who scan the current measures available over the internet.
It is
typical for homes to score high on some quality measures and low on others.
Does that reflect the multi-
dimensional nature of quality and homes actually being better at some things than others, or does it further suggest problems with the validity of the measures? Structure and process measures, such as the number of deficiencies or staffing patterns, also have known problems, some of which can be dealt with through multi-variant analysis, but some of which -- staffing is the best example -- require better data collection systems.
Despite the romance of most people with
outcome measures, we are actually less concerned about the risk of using structure and process measures than the risk of ignoring these potentially useful indicators.

How would competition on quality measures affect cost, prices, and decisions by payors and customers? As noted, the nation has recently embarked on
an experiment in which a set of well-researched, if not optimal, quality measures is widely available to the public.
We do not know what effect they will have and
hope that appropriate research will be addressed to the question you have posed.
Existing research suggests that the effect of these measures on cost and prices is likely to be minimal, in part because Medicaid, and to a lesser extent Medicare, are the dominant price-setters in this market.

Attention to those payment systems, not just
the amount of money but how the incentives are structured, may be a more certain way to achieve desired goals.
Despite recognized distortions in the operation of nursing home markets related to supply constraints, regulated prices, and imperfect, asymmetrical information, researchers have found evidence that these markets are not entirely anomalous.
For example, a set
of researchers from Brown University has recently found that substantial deficiencies on the federal survey predict low occupancy, low private pay use, and both voluntary and involuntary terminations from the program.
The study authors conclude: "This study
provides evidence that public reporting may indeed be a mechanism to promote overall quality in the sense of forcing some facilities from the market, but the plight of the most at-risk facilities should not be ignored.

But it also demonstrates
that simply raising public rates does not necessarily translate into better quality -- more nursing staff, for example.
Public payment systems can, and AAHSA believes they should, be structured to encourage spending on direct care staff.
Research on other types of

I think it's extremely noteworthy that the FTC and the Department of Justice have combined long-term care and assisted living in today's hearing because from my perspective, the line between nursing homes and assisted living is blurring.
Assisted living is becoming less a housing option for relatively healthy and relatively wealthy older people and more a health care option for a population that is considerably less healthy and less wealthy.
In terms of residents' needs and their needs for assistance with activities of daily living, assisted living facilities increasingly serve a population that looks more like nursing homes than ever before.

facilities.
The regulatory structures are, of course, Nursing homes are largely creatures of the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, and although participation in both programs is voluntary for most facilities, the overwhelming majority of nursing homes choose to participate in one or both.
As a result, the
primary locus of regulation has been the federal standards.
These are set by the nursing home reform law
and they're very prescriptive.
Assisted living facilities, in contrast, are a relatively new participant in the long-term care continuum.

I think nursing homes and assisted living facilities differ enormously in the availability and quality of information that's made available to the public.
There is a lot of information about nursing
homes, but people are often unaware of it or unable to use it.
Ironically, in contrast, I think people want
information about assisted living, but there's comparatively little information and the information that's available is not uniform or consistent from state to state or even within a state.
In the nursing home area, the federal government has made a tremendous amount of information available.
As part of President Clinton's nursing home
initiative in July 1998, HCFA developed a website called Nursing Home Compare that includes information about each certified facility, nursing staff, deficiencies cited by the state survey agencies, and the residents who live there.
Most of that information has been consistent since 1998.
But what I want to focus on is the part that
has been changed recently, and that's about resident characteristics.
Resident characteristics is the part of

It is the
assessment information that facilities complete about each resident as part of the care planning process.
One concern about the MDS information, as it's called, is that it's found to be inaccurate, sometimes willfully, but perhaps more often because of confusion on the part of facilities about how to complete the MDS.
For example, facilities seem to be very -- have very different ideas about how to report whether residents are in pain.
Some facilities identify residents in pain only
if the pain is not controlled by medication.
Other facilities identify residents in pain if they need medication to control their pain.
Facilities' different ways of completing the MDS forms makes it difficult to compare facilities.
People might want to know about the care needs of people who live in facilities before they place a relative, but it's hard to know what the information actually means that appears on the website.
The resident characteristic portion of the website has changed the most since 1998.
The nursing
home quality initiative from the Bush Administration has added new risk adjustment measures to the resident data.
The principle of using risk adjustment is, of course,

But it's the specific factors that are
used to make risk adjustments that can be very controversial.
Last year at a meeting on the initiative, a nursing home administrator was very critical of the way the weight loss adjuster was used for residents who need assistance in eating.
He said that many residents in his
facility need to be fed, but residents don't lose weight because the staff feed them.
He argued that factors
within a facility's control should not be adjusted, and I think most people would agree with that.
The other very significant change in the nursing home quality initiative is how the resident assessment data are reported and publicly described.
When the data were first introduced into the survey process in the 1990s, they were called quality indicators.
And HCFA stressed at surveyor training that the indicators were only intended to help surveyors when they conducted a survey.
They would help surveyors identify
potential care issues as well as specific residents whose care should be evaluated in depth during the survey process.
Under no circumstances were surveyors told should they consider the information a statement about

The indicators were
just pieces of information that needed further evaluation.
Today, under the new initiative, the risk adjusted quality indicators are called performance measures and they are reported publicly as describing the care provided by nursing facilities to residents.
And I
think that is an overstatement from the perspective of the Center for Medicare Advocacy.
When data are made available to the public and are described as statements about quality, they need to be more accurate and refined than when they are used by surveyors and facilities.
At a meeting of the National
Quality Forum earlier this spring, two very competing sets of indicators with very different research findings about their validity were discussed, and the members of the steering committee were choosing among the indicators for the public reporting.
It became very apparent, I thought, at the meeting that the quality indicators are political and philosophical as well as scientific.
That information
about resident outcome data, while available, really cannot be oversold as more valid and meaningful than it really is.
I think this concern and some of the others
led the General Accounting Office to conclude that

Although there's been a lot of discussion these days about outcome measures, I think the distinction between process and structure and outcome is a false one, and there seems to be quite a bit of agreement among the people who've spoken so far today that we do need all.
We shouldn't abandon process and structure as we move to outcome focus, although obviously the whole point of the system is to get good outcomes for residents.
I think we
all agree about that, and that process and structure are intended to make good outcomes more likely than not.
The additional information that I think most consumers would like to receive is information about staffing.
Consumers intuitively know that having
sufficient numbers of adequately trained and supervised staff is most important.
So they want to know how many staff are working in a facility, but in addition, they want to know about staff credentials, staff turnover, whether staff are permanent employees or from an agency, which staff in particular are responsible for family members' care.
They want to know about nursing staff, including professional nursing.
And I think they also
want to know about other health care professionals.

I've been discussing information solely from the perspective of nursing homes and that's because for assisted living, there's nothing comparable at the federal level.
The primary source of information for
consumers about what an assisted living facility provides is the contract, and as a number of people have already discussed, the GAO and others have found a lot of fault with the contracts that have existed and been in place.
And although I think there is agreement -certainly, the assisted living workgroup agreed that contracts and marketing materials need to be the same, and Karen expressed very clearly the consensus recommendations of the assisted living workgroup on those points -- I think we're not there yet.
And the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform found similar problems that the GAO has found and prior people who've looked at the contracts.
California
Advocates found these same problems in their March 2003 report.
So we have made some progress by recognizing
what contracts should be, but the contracts are not

In the policy principles for assisted living, nine members of the ALW set out an alternative method for regulating assisted living.
We felt we could not endorse
the model that we thought the ALW was proposing, which set few standards of care and relied primarily on contracts to fill in the details.
From our perspective,
we thought such a model was inadequate and unfair to consumers.
We think consumers need to be able to rely on
a particular level of services set by law and should not have to negotiate independently and individually with facilities to establish a standard of care.
I think there are significant problems in stability, certainty, and continuity of care if standards are set by contracts because contracts are written.

But it's It's They
First, people don't have all the tools or
the time to look at the information that's available.
Few people plan to move to a nursing home, and placement is usually made at a time of crisis -- an elderly person falls, breaks a hip, goes to the acute care hospital, and the decision is made by the physician, the family, somebody, that this person can no longer live alone.

You have to leave within days, if not
So it's a very difficult time and people have no
choice but to take whatever facility is willing to admit them.
There seems to be some difference, I think, in advance planning for assisted living.
Some people,
especially the adult children, are looking in advance at assisted living facilities before they need to make a placement.
I think the problems for these consumers are
the lack of reliable information and the lack of consistent definition.
A second problem with a public strategy focused primarily on information is that people don't have full and complete choice about where they'll live.
In the
nursing home area, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries are often denied admission based on their source of payment.
