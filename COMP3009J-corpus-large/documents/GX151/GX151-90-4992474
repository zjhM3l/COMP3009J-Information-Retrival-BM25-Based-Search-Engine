Columns: __________________________________________________________________ PENTAGON WAGER PLAN IS JUST PLAIN STUPID A lot of crazy ideas get dreamed up in Washington -- but this one takes the cake.
Last week, it was revealed that the Pentagon was planning a sort of futures market where investors could place bets on the possibility of terrorist attacks, assassinations or even military strikes against U.S. soldiers.
The Defense Department hoped to gain intelligence from the predictions, while the investors who guessed right would make profits.
Like the agriculture futures market in Chicago , investors would be able to buy and sell contracts or predictions of future events.
But the future events in the Pentagon gaming scheme wouldn't involve the price of pork bellies or barley.
It would involve the time, place and manner of the deaths of other human beings.
Apparently, some in Washington think that patriotism alone isn't enough of an incentive for people to try to help protect fellow Americans from terrorism.
They think that only the profit motive is a strong enough incentive for people to help thwart future attacks.
The public outrage that accompanied word of this scheme had Pentagon planners back-pedaling as if it was just some concept that was never very serious.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told concerned Senators, "I share your shock at this kind of program.
We'll find out about it.
But it is being terminated."
But, the fact of the matter is it was more than just some water cooler concept.
It was a very serious program that was up and running.
It has been reported that $600,000 has already been spent on the program, and the Pentagon plans to spend another $149,000 this year.
The Department of Defense requested $3 million for the program next year and $5 million for the following year.
Registration for investors in the program was supposed to start on August 1^st, with trading commencing on October 1^st.
It should come as no surprise that this unseemly scheme was the brain child of none other than Retired Admiral John Poindexter.
Poindexter is the man who was caught red-handed during the Iran-Contra scandal, in which administration officials secretly sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to finance Nicaraguan guerrillas.
Poindexter was initially convicted of lying to Congress in an effort to cover up this illegal scheme, but got off on a technicality.
Normally, someone with such a sordid background of deceit and purposeful deception would have trouble finding a job in the private sector, let alone the highest levels of the federal government.
But strangely, our government placed this one in charge of national security.
And look where it got us.
Well it seems there is a silver lining.
Now that word about the Poindexter Lotto has leaked out, the Pentagon appears poised to pull the plug on the program for good.
And Admiral Poindexter has announced he's leaving his post.
In this instance, Democracy did prevail.
Public opinion did influence public policy - as it always should.
A backroom brainchild was exposed for what it was - a really stupid idea.
As always, please let me know what you think about this, and other important issues.
