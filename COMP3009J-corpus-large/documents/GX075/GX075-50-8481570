First, there are several competing technologies and companie
For simplicity I will discuss only the concept of vector based web images here.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a vector graphics format created by Adobe and proposed to the W3C as a new image standard.
The advantage of this is much the same as with PDF files except that individual images could be place directly on a web pages just as Gifs and Jpegs are today.
If SVG is accepted as a new standard image format then browsers would build in the ability to decode and display them without the need for plug-ins or stand alone viewers.
Vector graphics, unlike GIF and JPEG images which use a fixed grid of pixels to represent an image, can be enlarged and printed at the resolution of the local output device.
