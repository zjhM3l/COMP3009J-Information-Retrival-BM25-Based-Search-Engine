Included herein are systems that transform an image for the purpose of (a) enhancing its visual quality prior to recognition, (b) locating and registering the image relative to a sensor or stored prototype, or reducing the amount of image data by discarding irrelevant data, and (c) measuring significant characteristics of the image.
(1) Note.
Automated document pattern* analysis or verification, which includes detection of alphanumerics, is classified in this class.
(2) Note.
To be classified herein, no actual recognition or identification need be performed.
It is sufficient that substantial digital image processing, such as a coding, enhancement, or transformation process, be performed on the image data for classification herein.
SECTION II - LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES AND WITHIN THIS CLASS
Pattern* analysis or verification limited to the intrinsic properties of a document is classified elsewhere.
Documents that are analyzed or verified by information content, such as pattern*s or alphanumeric characters, are classified in this class (382).
Document verification limited to a photocell system is classified elsewhere.
See References to Other Classes, below.
Alphanumeric characters and other pattern*s are to be distinguished from coded indicia.
Coded indicia are designed specifically to facilitate reading by machine and are not intended to be read by humans (e.g., the Universal Product Code on grocery items).
Reading or sensing of coded indicia which does not include the recognition of any alphanumeric character or pattern* is classified elsewhere.
However, reading or sensing of pattern*s or alphanumeric characters in combination with coded indicia is classified in this class (382).
Example: Reading a credit card that contains a printed name plus a magnetic code is classified in Class 235 if only the magnetic code is read.
Otherwise, if both the printed name and the magnetic code are read, classification is herein.
The images analyzed and processed herein are images that are representative of a "real" scene (such as images obtained by a camera, scanner, or image detector), including obtained images of people, places, and things, wherein the image represents the actual scene.
The presentation or generation of images that are (a) computer generated or otherwise artificial, or (b) a combination of computer-generated images and real images is properly classified elsewhere, including for computer graphics and control of data presentation with creation or manipulation of graphic objects or text performed by a computer or processor, and operator interfaces.
See References to Other Classes, below.
The specific processing of television pictures and signals, where a television system is an integral part of the system, is properly classified elsewhere.
See References to Other Classes, below.
When images generated by a television camera are processed, and the television system is not an integral part of the overall system, and the system is either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, proper classification is herein.
For systems directed to the processing of a displayed image, where the processing is directed to the altering of the display image or of the display system itself, proper classification is elsewhere.
See References to Other Classes, below.
The testing or measuring of distances, areas, volumes, thicknesses, or defects in objects is excluded from this class.
However, where the measurements of these parameters are either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, classification is in this class.
Image analysis* having specific and significantly claimed utility in art environments external to this class is classified in the appropriate external classes unless it is specifically excluded therefrom.
For example: radar, facsimile, color facsimile, coded record sensor; and purely optical systems for image processing are all excluded from this class.
See references to Other Classes, below.
Subcombinations specific to image analysis* or pattern* recognition are classified herein.
