What does this data set describe?
Title: Internal Surface-Water Flows Abstract: Proposed modified water deliveries to Indian Tribal Lands, Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A require that flow at critical points in the interior be measured.
The goal is to provide flow data to supplement the current gaging station network in the area south of Lake Okeechobee and to maintain the status as an integral component of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD)/Seminole Indian Tribal Agreement.

Why was the data set created?
The accurate determination of flow through the interior canal networks south of Lake Okeechobee and the C-139 basin remains critical for water budgets and regional model calibrations as defined by the Everglades Forever Act of 1994 and due to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) initiative to reroute Big Cypress Preserve flows.
The implementation of strategically located stream flow gaging points and associated data collection for nutrients has helped define future surface-water flow requirements and has provided valuable baseline flow data prior to the establishment of the recently constructed northern Storm Treatment Areas (STAs 5 and 6) and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area.
Generating continuous flow data at selected impact points for interior basins has complemented the existing eastern coastal canal discharge network, and has allowed for more accurately timed surface-water releases while providing flow and nutrient monitoring after recent STA implementation.
A unique multi-agency experiment was conducted with much success with the focus on cooperation and development of new instrumentation and acoustic flow-weight auto-sampler protocols.
The original data collection and processing was provided by three separate entities at each site with responsibilities originally allocated between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and SFWMD.
USGS provides calibration, analysis and processing of acoustic velocity meters (AVMs) and side-looking Doppler systems and stage shaft encoders, SFWMD provides data loggers with real-time flow-weighted algorithms, and radio frequency (RF) telemetry instrumentation.
The Seminole Tribe provides auto-sampler service and funds nutrient load analysis through the USGS Ocala Lab. __________________________________________________________________

How were the data generated, processed, and modified?
Date: 2000 (process 1 of 4) Three sites were located at critical water delivery points to Tribal Lands for which information was previously lacking (reduced to two sites in FY 2000).
The original data collection and processing was provided by three separate entities at each site with responsibilities allocated between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes, and SFWMD.
All three sites were originally instrumented with USGS acoustic velocity meters (AVM's), stage shaft encoders, data loggers with real-time flow-weighted algorithms, and radio frequency (RF) telemetry instrumentation provided by the SFWMD.
RF telemetry, maintained and operated by SFWMD, was used to record and transmit all data from the field into data bases of the USGS Miami Subdistrict office through SFWMD data bases.
The USGS mean-channel-velocity/AVM index-calibration refinement has continued by performing a series of periodic streamgaging measurements utilizing the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) when appropriate streamflow velocities were available.
Continuous records of discharge have been computed by the USGS and published in SFWMD/Seminole Indian Tribe data reports on a semi-annual basis.
Autosamplers, installed by SFWMD at each USGS AVM site, have been maintained and operated by the Seminole Tribe (two sites) and the Miccosukee Indian Tribe until September 1999(one site) for sampling of real-time flow-weighted nitrates and phosphates based on USGS/SFWMD AVM algorithm triggers.
All autosampler data has been processed and quality assured by the respective Tribe with direction and training to the Seminoles provided by the SFWMD and with nutrient loads computed by a separate agreement between the Tribes and SFWMD.
In addition Seminole Tribe nutrient sample analysis was performed by the USGS Ocala laboratory.
The implementation of strategically located streamflow gaging points and associated data collection for nutrients helped define future surface-water flow requirements and provided valuable baseline data prior to the establishment of the recently implemented northern Storm Treatment Areas (STA's 5 and 6) and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area.
Generating continuous flow data at selected impact points for interior basins complemented the existing eastern canal discharge network, and allowed for more accurately timed surface-water releases while providing flow and nutrient monitoring after recent STA implementation.
Date: 2001 (process 2 of 4) Three sites have been gaged successfully for up to 4 years with one site discontinued at the end of the 1999 water year.
The three Tribal Reservation sites (2 Seminole and 1 Miccosukee provide baseline discharge, stage, and flow weighted nutrient data prior to and after the implementation of the Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) 5 and 6.
Responsibilities for these sites are shared between USGS (avm/flow data collection, analysis, computations), Ocala Lab (nutrient analysis for 2 sites), SFWMD (telemetry/nutrient total load calculations), and Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes (nutrient data collection/lab analysis from Florida International University.
The L28U site, located between the Seminole and Miccosukee Reservations, served as one of the primary final data collection points used to monitor flow and TP contributions to WCA 3A, and as an exit and entry monitoring point from the Seminole to Miccosukee Reservations.
Higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations at the L28U compared to the upstream USSO site suggest that additional water with higher TP concentration than that of USSO water, enters the canal downstream of USSO.
At L-29IN, new acoustic doppler current profiling (ADCP) instrumentation, and recalibration and recomputation has been done to correct data discrepancies.
TP load analysis and subsequent load flow-weighted calculations by SFWMD from the L28IS site, located on the western boundaries of the Miccosukee Reservation, were included in the fifth annual Semi-Annual Progress Report.
This site was discontinued September 30, 1999 by the USGS and will be re-instrumented by the Miccosukee Tribe.
STAs 5 and 6 have been completed and close to a year of operational flow-weighted nutrient loads were collected.
Experience from several velocity index alternatives tested by SFWMD at similar upstream gaging sites were used to reconfigure a broad-crested weir as one of the products.
Quality assurance has been, and continues to be, refined to better quantify mass balance.
An AVM/flow-weighted auto-sampler protocol publication was proposed by SFWMD after results of new instrumentation were reviewed.
Date: 2002 (process 3 of 4) Three sites have been gaged with acoustic flow sensors and flow-weighted nutrient auto-samplers successfully for up to 6 years with one site (L-28IS) discontinued at the end of the 1999 water year.
From their inception in 1996, these three Tribal Reservation sites (2 Seminole and 1 Miccosukee) have provided baseline discharge, stage, and flow weighted nutrient load data prior to and after the implementation of the upstream Storm Water Treatment Areas (STA) 5 and 6.
Responsibilities for these sites are coordinated and shared between USGS staff (flow data collection, analysis, computations), the USGS Ocala Lab (nutrient analysis for 2 sites), SFWMD (telemetry/nutrient total load calculations for all sites), and Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes (nutrient data collection/lab analysis and flow funding).
The now discontinued L28IS site, previously located on the western Miccosukee Reservation border, served as one of the primary final data collection points used to monitor flow and TP contributions to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3A and also as a flow and load budgeting verification point for the upstream Seminole Reservation site, L-28IN.
A new acoustic side-looking Doppler velocity indexing system was installed at the L-28 IN site (L-28 Interceptor Canal), and data collected in tandem with the existing AVM velocity indexing system for the six month period which followed.
This test along with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling (ADCP) calibration effort produced a new flow-rating resulting in a much more accurate and reliable total and instantaneous flow computation.
Quality assurance has been, and continues to be, refined to better quantify mass balance for flows and nutrients to both reservations and WCA 3A.
Date: Not complete (process 4 of 4) FY2003 planned work
Calibration and analysis of stage of flow data at two sites.
Velocity rating refinement will continue as well as calibration of both the travel-time Acoustic Velocity Meter system at the L-28U site and the side-looking Doppler acoustic system at the L-28IN site.
This task is to monitor telemetered velocities and channel area so real-time auto-sampler flow-weighted nutrient load volume triggers are maintained.
Provisional discharges will continue to be analyzed and processed and forwarded to the Seminole/SFWMD Working Group.
Final quality assured water-level and flow to be published annually in the publication, Water Resource Data, Florida, Volume 2A.
