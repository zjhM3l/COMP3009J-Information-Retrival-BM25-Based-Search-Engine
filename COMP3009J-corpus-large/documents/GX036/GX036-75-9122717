TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ RED IMPORTED FIRE ANT CONTROL FOR TROPICAL FISH FARMS Author(s): OI DAVID H WATSON CRAIG A WILLIAMS DAVID F Interpretive Summary:
Tropical fish farms provide a prime habitat for the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, which is an invasive, stinging ant that has spread throughout the southern United States
.
It can be a serious health hazard to hypersensitive individuals, and the presence of large populations can interfere with operational activities.
Fish farmers typically work barefoot along the pond banks and because the banks provide an ideal habitat for fire ant colonies, the probability of being stung is very high.
Fire ants are not controlled because of the fear of detrimentally impacting fish being raised in ponds with insecticides.
Scientists in the Imported Fire Ant and Household Insects Unit of the ARS Center for Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology in Gainesville, Florida were contacted by the University of
Florida Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory to develop a program for controlling imported fire ants in tropical fish farms.
Areas around fish ponds were treated with a fire ant bait that contained the insect growth regulator methoprene.
This bait was selected because of its low toxicity to fish and that methoprene formulations are used for mosquito control in aquatic ecosystems.
Fire ant nest densities declined 57% within 4 months.
In contrast, nest densities increased 86% in untreated areas.
Fire ant populations declined an average of 68% and increased 110% during the summer for treated and untreated areas, respectively
.Employees at the facility also perceived a substantial reduction in the number of fire ants in treated areas Fire ant nest densities and populations began to increase by December.
No fish mortalities related to the ant baiting were observed during the study.
