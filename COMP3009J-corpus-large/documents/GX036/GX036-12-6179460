Your ears ring.
A stinking blast of burning black gunpowder stings your face like hot salt as the battle lines grow closer.
Three thousand men stand rank and file.
You fall face down, dead.
Again.

Dr. Jim Minor dies a lot.
As a Civil War re-enactor, he assumes the role of a Confederate Army private, a front-line combatant who all too often is killed or taken prisoner.
The final outcome is always the same.
Several times a year, thousands of modern Americans dress in authentic period clothing and march off to war.
A few fight in the name of their ancestors.
Many more do what Minor did.
He created a character to portray on the battlefield.
The Clinical Center pharmacist researched the Civil War history of his own hometown and assumed the role of Charlie Gibson, the 17-year-old son of a haberdasher from Reidsville, N.C.
[civlwar25.jpg] Dr. Jim Minor, CC pharmacist and Civil War history buff, participates in Civil War battle reenactments authentically dressed as Confederate Army private.
"When you talk to observers after the re-enactment, you stay in character, you keep your mind in the 1860's," Minor says.
"Children may ask what I watch on television.
The answer is, 'What is television?' I love to watch the surprise on their faces when I say that."
Getting ready to take part in a re-enactment isn't easy.
The uniform, an authentic reproduction, is handmade of wool and lined in heavy cotton.
The 9-lb., .58 caliber Enfield musket, crafted in England, is identical to the weapons used by the Confederate Army.
Minor's glasses are actual Civil War period frames carefully fitted with his present-day prescription.
A tin cup, leather belt, canvas haversack, bayonet scabbard, and rough leather brogans complete the ensemble.
Altogether, the uniform, weapons, and accessories cost each participant over $1,000.
"We are not a bunch of people who get together to hoot 'n' shoot," he explains.
"Participants are well-educated students of Civil War history.
They aren't involved in order for the South to rise again.
There are no sides, really.
Most men and women participate to share the history of this important time in our nation's past with interested adults and especially with children."
Re-enactment activities are well organized.
Participants must attend the "School for Soldiers," an annual, 2-day formal field training seminar, at their own expense.
Both sides study Hardee's Manual for Infantry Tactics, first published in 1860 -- mistakes and inaccuracies are not allowed.
Even the food they eat is chosen for the time period -- dried bread, peanuts, and fruit -- items Charlie Gibson would have eaten.
Recordkeeping during the Civil War was amazingly accurate, Minor notes.
Re-enactments unfold almost exactly the way the real engagements took place, usually occurring on the weekend closest to the actual battle date.
Senior officers from both sides meet the night before to plan the outcome.
Minor will be told if he lives or dies.
He will know at which point in the hour-long confrontation Charlie Gibson will fall or be taken prisoner.
"It's an emotional experience to go through.
You are always aware that this really happened with dire consequences," Minor adds.
During the first 30 minutes of most Civil War battles, the casualty rate averaged about 40 percent.
It was the last war fought using Napoleonic tactics.
Soldiers advanced shoulder-to-shoulder for massed fire power.
The weapons of the time -- cannons, muskets, and bayonets -- created brutal injuries.
Foot soldiers often fought man against mounted-horse cavalry and in many instances, the horse won.
The painstaking accuracy of the re-enactors paid off in 1992 when Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting media mogul, began production of his movie, Gettysburg.
Turner put thousands of Civil War enthusiasts in his movie and at times the re-enactors corrected inaccuracies in the scripted battle.
Minor and his 49th Virginia Infantry are veterans of that movie re-enactment.
History has always interested Minor, but his participation in re-enactments resulted from a conversation 5 years ago with a CC patient and artist from Clifton, Va.
She shared Minor's love for antiques and suggested he attend Clifton Days in Virginia.
It was there that he witnessed his first Civil War battle encampment.
The rest, of course, is history.
Minor says it gets so hot standing in ranks -- waiting for the artillery barrage and the cavalry charges to end before his part, the infantry assault, begins -- that he usually loses about 6 pounds during each re-enactment.
"I got the worst sunburn in my life one day as I lay dead on the New Market [Virginia] battlefield," he says.
"I fell face up and had to lay there for almost an hour in full sun."
After that experience, Minor learned how to survive the fall -- drink large volumes of water, wear hats with wider brims, and lie face down to avoid the sun.
"Another time I just fell out.
I was sick with heat prostration.
So I crawled under a captured cannon to get in the shade.
A woman in period costume came up to me with a basket of ice and handed me a few pieces to rub on my head to cool off."
Soon, Minor, who holds a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, will leave the Clinical Center for a new job.
He returns home to North Carolina where he will join Glaxo Wellcome Co. and Charlie Gibson will join the 26th N.C.
Regiment.
"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history."
Abraham Lincoln said it.
Jim Minor lives it.
