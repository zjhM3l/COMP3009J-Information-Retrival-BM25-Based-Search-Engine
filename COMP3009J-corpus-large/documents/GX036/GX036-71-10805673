DISASTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) adopts the repeal of Â§Â§6.1-6.3, 6.101-6.105, 6.201, and 6.301-6.306; and adopts new Â§Â§6.101-6.109, 6.201-6.222, 6.301-6.311, 6.401-6.418, and 6.501-6.511 in its Disaster Assistance Program chapter.
New Â§6.203 is adopted with changes to the proposed text published in the January 24, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 645).
The repeal of Â§Â§6.1-6.3, 6.101-6.105, 6.201, and 6.301-6.306; and new Â§Â§6.101-6.109, 6.201, 6.202, 6.204-6.222, 6.301-6.311, 6.401-6.418, and 6.501-6.511 are adopted without changes to the proposed text.
Justification for the repeals and new sections is to delete obsolete rules from the rule base and implement provisions of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, 42 United States Code Â§Â§5121-5206.
The new sections were undertaken as part of a DHS project to rewrite agency rules in plain language format to make them easier for the general public to use and understand.
DHS received no comments regarding adoption of the repeals and new sections.
DHS corrected a publication error on page 649 in the proposed text of Â§6.203, which was not structured properly.
This correction is included in the adoption.
