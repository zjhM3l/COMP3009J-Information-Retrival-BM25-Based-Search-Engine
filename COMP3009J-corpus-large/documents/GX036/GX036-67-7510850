1) Customer Comment Card Update:
Kathy and Shannon are re-organizing the data for presentation at the next CUT meeting on March 18^th.
Action: Kathy and Shannon will bring information to March 18^th CUT meeting.
2) Vision and Values Review:
Brian will present at the March 18^th meeting.
This will be training for goals, visions, and values of the partnership.
Action: Brian will bring for a future meeting.
3) WTS Membership System:
Gary Smith provided an overview of the new membership system that will be in effect starting Feb. 27^th in Oak Harbor (The new computers will be changed out on Feb 25^th and 26^th).
The new membership system ensures compliance with the state wide system which will enable a more comprehensive and usable database that will tell us who our customers are and what services they are utilizing.
New forms: WorkSource Whatcom initiated a new form that captures the information needed for SKIES.
WorkSource Whidbey will begin utilizing this form on Feb. 27^th for all new membership cards.
The information will be collected and entered into SKIES by Joyce or Bob.
The new form allows us to record the jobs that people are getting and helps our UI customers get credit for job search.
Do not refer to the new membership system as "swipe card" or "tracking" system.
WorkSource Whatcom staff have found that membership system has a more positive connotation and it makes customers feel as though they are a part of our system.
If a customer refuses to provide their social security number, we can provide an alternate form of their membership number.
The formula is as follows:
1) WDA Numeric identifier (i.e. Northwest = 3)
2) First two characters of the last name
3) First two characters of the first name
4) Birth month (2-digit format)
5) Birthday (2 digit format)
6) Gender (M/F)
When/If duplicates occur, append a single digit number (1-9) at the end.
It is imperative that we encourage customers to protect their card as their social security number is embedded into the magnetic strip on the back.
While we can provide them a new card there are machines that can access this information.
Center staff need to double check the daily list of activities to ensure that all activities for that day are listed on the sign-in kiosk.
This is important for proper tracking of activity participation.
The new touch screen kiosk is sensitive to touch and we need to remind customers to use their fingernail or the corner of their card when they are selecting daily activities.
When making membership cards staff need to capitalize first and last names so that the database is uniform.
4) Business Survey:
Bob will distribute updated version (via e-mail) for discussion at next CUT meeting.
Action: Bob will bring updated survey for March 18^th meeting.
5) WorkSource Whidbey - Center Issues:

Joe Hudon had created a separate website as a link to WorkSource Whidbey's calendar of events.
The decision has been made to cancel this site (sponsored by Tri-pod) and create a link from the go2worksource website.
Action: Kathy will work with partnership webmaster to create for Whidbey a site similar to Whatcom.
Kathy will contact webmaster to establish link to new website.
Kathy will let Jonette know when the site is operational and Jonette will cancel tri-pod site.
Â· Job Fair update:
