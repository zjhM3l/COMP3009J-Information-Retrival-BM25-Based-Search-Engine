USAID seal USAID Mission to Ecuador _________________________________________________________________ Signs in Ecoutourism paths, Isabela Galapagos, Conservation Program "Biodiversity Conservation in selected protected areas, indigenous territories, and their buffer zones" Description: With only 2% of South America's geographical area, Ecuador contains numerous habitats of globally and regionally notable biological value.
This environment, however, is seriously threatened.
USAID's efforts focus, through technical assistance and training, on conserving Ecuador's rich biological resources by improving the country's environmental policy and legal framework; developing improved natural resource management practices; and strengthening the capabilities of local groups to carry-out effective conservation action.
USAID supports activities in and around several of the country's most important parks and protected areas, including an important effort in the Galapagos Islands.
New activities are planned through 2008.
USAID's new program will focus on three major components: The first component is conservation of the Tropical Andes and Quito's water supply, which focuses on working with local partners, communities, other donors and the Government of Ecuador to help consolidate and improve management of the region's five protected areas.
Another high priority program area is conservation of the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR).
Planned activities in this UNESCO world heritage site include technical assistance and training to further enhance local governance, implement the GMR zoning plan, and increase tourism contributions to conservation by providing alternatives to illegal and over-fishing.
The third component includes expanding work with indigenous groups along the fragile northern border and Amazon Basin region, to increase their technical and administrative capabilities to manage these rich biological resources and reduce vulnerability to the pressures from overexploitation and Southern Colombia.

Program Activities
Protection of Quito Watershed/Tropical Andes: This component includes activities in the Condor Bioreserve, in coordination with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) under the Parks in Peril Program.
The paramo protected by the Condor Biorreserve is the source of water for Quito and its metropolitan area.
The main goal is to integrate five protected areas and their buffer zones in a management unit that contains more than one million hectares.
The areas for conservation are: Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve, Antisana Ecological Reserve, Cotopaxi National Park, Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park, and Llanganates National Park.
It also includes the northern area of Cayambe-Coca.
A separate new activity is planned for 2004 to deepen impact of watershed management and expand a conservation fund for its protection.

Galapagos Marine Reserve/Galapagos Islands Currently, activities are being undertaken through the Charles Darwin Foundation, in collaboration with the Galapagos National Park.
The goal is to promote the conservation of the Galapagos Marine Biological Reserve (GMR).
Activities have been organized under two major components: (a) Applied Research; and (b) Capacity for Collaborative Management.
Other activities are also being carried out through the Galapagos National Park for the management and re-establishment of the lagoons and wetlands of the southern areas of Isabela Island.
Additionally, support has been provided to the local population of Puerto Villamil and its surroundings for the development of local based ecotourism activities as a productive alternative to fishing.
Furthermore, equipment is being purchased and training provided through the U.S. Department of Interior to enhance enforcement and monitoring activities in the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
New program activities will also include conflict management.Back to top
Protecting Biodiversity Habitats: the Awa Territory: Activities under this component are carried out through World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in collaboration with FundaciÃ¯Â¿Â½n AltrÃ¯Â¿Â½pico and the Awa Federation.
This program includes technical assistance and training for the Federation to improve its capabilities to manage their territory.
Activities are organized around five foci: (a) Territorial protection, (b) Institutional strengthening, (c) Forestry and wildlife management, (d) Environmental education, and (e) Construction of a research center.

CAIMAN - Conservation of Managed Indigenous Areas This activity supports indigenous groups living in significant biological areas in the Northern and Eastern Ecuador.
Organizational strengthening will contribute to biodiversity conservation at the local level.
This program is being implemented by Chemonics International in coordination with indigenous groups and local NGOs.
Activities are organized around three foci: (a) Territorial integrity and consolidation, (2) Capacity-building, and (3) Sustainable financing.
Two major cross-cutting themes will be included in all activities: environmental education and a competitive small grants program.
