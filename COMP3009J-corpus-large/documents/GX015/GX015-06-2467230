Mr. Stephen D. Floyd Senior Director, Regulatory Reform Nuclear Energy Institute Suite 400 1776 I Street, N.W. Washington, DC, 20006 __________________________________________________________________
Good afternoon, Chairman and members of the committee.
I am Steve Floyd, Senior Director of Regulatory Reform at the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), where for the past year I have focused on the excellent security of our nations commercial nuclear plants.
On behalf of the Nuclear Energy Institute, I welcome the opportunity to discuss security issues vital to the industry and the nation.
Mr. Chairman, the industrys 103 nuclear power plants provide electricity for one of every five homes and businesses in America.
Nuclear energy is the largest clean source of electricity in America.
The security of nuclear plants and the public safety of Americans living near them are our industrys top priorities.
In the four months since NEI testified before this committee at its December 5, 2001 hearing, the industry has sustained the highest level of alert and readinessÂ¾a level it initiated voluntarily after the events on September 11.
Sustaining the highest level of security means that electric companies have added more qualified security personnel, increased surveillance patrols in owner-controlled areas, increased the distances at which vehicles are checked for explosives, reduced visitor access and, in some cases, temporarily closed visitors centers and public recreational facilities on plant property.
Notwithstanding the events of September 11, there is no credible evidence that the nuclear industry should be unique on remaining at the heightened security levels or that there is a specific risk of a terrorist attack or sabotage of a nuclear power plant.
There has been no specific credible threat against a nuclear power plant, or against any component of our national critical infrastructure.
Rather, the industry, and the nation as a whole, is maintaining a constant state of readiness against the generalized potential of terrorist activities in this country.
On February 25, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission formalized voluntary security enhancements taken by the industry by requiring companies that operate nuclear power plants to sustain a heightened level of security until the commission notifies the industry that a significant change in threat environment occurs.
Although NEI continues to coordinate industry efforts to comply with NRC orders, nearly all of the commissions requirements were, and continue to be, met.
Additionally, the industry continues to function at this heightened level while other industries and federal entities, including U.S. Armed Forces, have been permitted to reduce their readiness levels.
Generally, the more stringent security requirements issued by the NRC on February 25 are in the areas of additional security personnel and physical security barriers.
These requirements supplement a substantial security strategy that makes nuclear plants extremely secure.
These measures will make it even more difficult to enter the protected area of a nuclear power plant.
The primary purpose of our plant security strategy is to prevent unauthorized entry into the protected area of the nuclear plants.
Every employee granted unescorted access to our facilities undergoes fingerprinting and a criminal background check, and is subject to both a Fitness for Duty Program (random drug and alcohol screening) and a Continual Behavioral Observation Program.
Entry into the plant is controlled at hardened checkpoints through the use of keycard or hand-geometry access scanners, metal detectors and single-access turnstiles monitored by armed security force personnel.
No one can enter the protected area of the plant without a hand geometry scan or keycard password on file.
These areas are not like airport screening stations, where someone has a chance to run past security personnel.
That is impossible at nuclear plants due to a combination of physical barriers and well-trained security personnel.
Unauthorized access is controlled by a comprehensive perimeter boundary consisting of fences topped with razor wire, remote surveillance cameras and motion detector systems.
Security personnel continuously monitor the integrity of the boundary.
The nuclear energy industrys security strategy employs a combination of robust physical protection; an experienced security force of more than 5,000 qualified officers, who are well-armed and well-trained in anti-terrorism tactics; and emergency response capability unsurpassed in the industrial sector.
Robust Containment Structures
Nuclear plants are among the most secure commercial facilities in the United States, even exceeding the protection found at most military installations.
Design and construction of nuclear power plants include containment structures that are among the strongest, most impenetrable facilities built by man.
Further, reactor fuel is protected by a combination of up to 12 feet of concrete and steel between the exterior of the building and the fuel itself.
Containment structures that house the reactor were designed to contain the fuel and radiation even in the event of a potential accident within the reactor core.
Therefore, these structures, which include multiple layers of steel and concrete, are strong enough to prevent the release of significant radioactive material in the unlikely event of an accident.
The robust construction of the plant structures is designed to withstand the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other phenomena delivering substantial force.
Because of the combination of highly skilled plant security forces and the robust nature of these facilities, the FBI considers them hardened targets.
A look at some of the physical construction specifications at boiling water reactors (BWR) demonstrates their robust nature (see attachment).
For example: * the shield building wall has 3-foot thick concrete reinforced by 2.5-inch diameter steel rods spaced one foot apart.
* the containment vessel is a 1.5-inch thick steel cylinder standing 182 feet tall.
* the dry well wall has 5-foot thick concrete reinforced with, 2.5-inch diameter steel rods spaced one-foot apart.
* the bio shield is 4-foot thick leaded concrete with one-inch thick interior and exterior steel lining.
* the reactor vessel is high tensile steel 4 to 8 inches thick.
* the reactor pedestal is a 6-foot thick concrete structure with one-inch thick interior and exterior steel lining.
All of these structures serve as barriers to the reactor core.
Used Nuclear Fuel Pools and Dry Storage
On-site used fuel storage containers also consist of large, robust containers made of steel or steel-reinforced concrete.
By virtue of their design, construction, and their locations within the power plant complex, steel-lined used fuel pools where used fuel rods are stored are well-protected against external threats.
These structures typically are 4- to 5-foot thick reinforced concrete with an additional steel liner.
They are located within robust buildings located within the heavily secured protected area of the plant.
They are protected by, among other things, a combination of well-trained security force, physical barriers such as fences, razor wire, concrete vehicular barriers, electronic surveillance, detection systems and controlled access to the plant.
The areas are guarded 24 hours a day by heavily armed security personnel trained in anti-terrorist tactics.Used fuel pools are typically about 2,000 square feet and, from the standpoint of potential air attacks, have a profile that is 100 times smaller than the World Trade Center.
Dry cask containers are made of steel or steel-reinforced concrete, 18 or more inches thick.
The containers are placed upright on a three-foot thick concrete pad or horizontally in a steel-reinforced concrete vault.
The dry storage facilities for used reactor fuel that exist at about 15 nuclear power plant sites are also designed to withstand severe events, such as hurricanes and acts of sabotage.
All used fuel storage facilities, as well as those involved in the transport of used fuel containers, have plans in place to respond to emergencies, drawn up in consultation with appropriate emergency planning officials.
Airborne Assaults
Commercial nuclear reactors are designed and constructed to withstand natural disasters and to deal with reactor accidents.
While only a small number of plants were specifically analyzed for aircraft impacts due to their proximity to airports and military bases, all nuclear reactor containment buildings are like bunkers, built of thick, steel-reinforced concrete.
Inside the containment building, the reactor core is surrounded by heavy equipment, concrete shielding and a steel pressure vessel up to a foot thick.
This defense-in-depth safety strategy minimizes the risk of penetration from outside forces, and helps prevent the release of radioactivity in the event of an accident.
In November, the industry funded the Electric Power Research Institute to study the likely result of an airliner impacting a nuclear plant.
Results are expected later this summer.
The studies are evaluating the ability of various plant structures to withstand the impacts from a range of aircraft types traveling at realistic speeds.
Each nuclear power plant site and design is different.
Due to the surrounding terrain and the location of ancillary structures, not all of the important buildings of the plant can be struck by an aircraft.
Additionally, nuclear power plants are designed with multiple back-up systems physically separated so as not to be vulnerable to damage from a variety of accidents or from fires.
Backup systems are located in other compartments within the same building or in other buildings altogether.
The study will provide screening criteria to enable each plant owner to evaluate possible impact areas and to assess likely damage states.
From this, each owner can then devise strategies to use undamaged or alternative equipment to mitigate any resulting damage.
We understand that the NRC is conducting similar studies and we look forward to comparing results.
Unrealistic Speculation and Poor Communication Creates Problems
The industry commends the NRC for its efforts to review security practices at nuclear power plants.
However, the commission should be able to analyze and answer questions from the public about security without addressing unrealistic or worst-case scenarios.
It is essential that the NRC be allowed to do its job without being beleaguered by every impractical, speculative concern that arises.
This causes unnecessary burden and distracts the agency from the important tasks of analyzing credible scenarios and coordinating with other agencies within the federal government and the military to coordinate federal response to enemies of the state.
Industry resources can be best used if threat scenarios and postulated damage states are as realistic as possible.
Neither the industry nor the NRC should have to expend resources on widely speculative scenarios that divert attention from more likely issues of concern.
The industry needs to have a closer working relationship with the NRC than it has experienced to date on the security issue.
Industry efforts to provide input have been somewhat constrained when addressing security.
The NRC has been reluctant to discuss preliminary changes in security requirements with the industry.
The NRC has ordered the industry to accommodate more stringent security conditions on scenarios that plants have never before encountered.
This has required a major manpower and financial investment to ascertain the potential scenarios and what methodology to use to counter them.
Meaningful dialogue before requirements were promulgated would have resulted in a much clearer set of requirements and a better understanding of expectations within both the industry and the NRC.
Conclusion
Maintaining high levels of safety and security are the industrys highest priority.
We continue to incorporate additional measures to improve security preparedness at the nations nuclear plants.
Given the importance of the nations 103 nuclear power plants to meeting Americas electricity demand, it is vital that we maintain safety and security to allow these plants to continue to serve one of every five homes and businesses.
The industry continues to meet all federal requirements for security and safetyand coordinates with state and federal law enforcement, the military, and intelligence officials to assure that there is a fully protective shield around nuclear power facilities.
However, at some point, a commercial entity reaches a limit as to the size and nature of the threat it can, or should, solely contend with.
Reasonable expectations on the limits of commercial security capabilities need to be defined to better integrate and augment those capabilities with government resources.
Thank you for this opportunity to share the industrys perspective.
I will be pleased to answer any questions that you have.
