DIA to Require Boarding Passes at Security Checkpoint
Under Secretary of Transportation for Security Adm. James M. Loy today announced that Denver International Airport (DIA) is participating in the Transportation Security Administration's "Selectee Checkpoint" program, which enhances security and convenience by transferring the screening of selectees from aircraft boarding gates to security checkpoints where screening equipment and personnel and law enforcement officers are concentrated.
Security checkpoints at DIA have been reconfigured to accommodate passengers who are selectees through a special lane.
As a result, TSA now requires boarding passes at the security checkpoint.
Currently, 84 airports across the country are now requiring boarding passes at the security checkpoint with more airports being added every week.
At these airports, passengers must now have their boarding passes in hand before they reach the security checkpoint.
E-ticket receipts, itineraries and vouchers will no longer provide access through the checkpoints, and boarding passes will no longer be issued at the gates.
Boarding passes may be obtained at ticket counters, through airline computer kiosks, or at skycap curbside stations.
In addition to a boarding pass, passengers must show a valid government issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or passport at the checkpoint.
In keeping with TSA's multi-level security system at all airports, TSA screeners will now choose gates, flights and passengers at random for additional screening at the gates.
