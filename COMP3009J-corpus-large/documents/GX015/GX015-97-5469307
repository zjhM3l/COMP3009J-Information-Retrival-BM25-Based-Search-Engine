Dear Colleague:
You and your staff are invited to attend a Congressional Human Rights Caucus (CHRC) Members Briefing on human rights violations in Saudi Arabia.
The briefing will take place on Tuesday, June 4th, 2002 from 3:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. in Room 2255 of the RHOB.
The briefing will be chaired by Representative Constance Morella.
On March 11, 2002, fourteen Saudi Arabian girls burned to death inside a public intermediate school in Mecca.
Efforts to rescue several of these girls were thwarted by local members of the Committee to Preserve Virtue and Prevent Vice.
Witnesses reported that any girls who were not wearing abayas, the traditional head-to-toe coverings, were pushed back into the burning dormitory.
This unfortunate loss of life is a result of extremist interpretations of Islamic dress code.
This is just one example of the many egregious human rights violations that Saudi Arabian women suffer.
Women are denied the basic right of receiving medical care at a hospital without the permission of a male relative.
Although the Saudi law prohibits violence against all innocent people, the government does not document reports of spousal abuse, and hospitals frequently record cases of battered Saudi women.
In addition to this women are forced to comply with laws that severely infringe upon their freedom of movement.
Saudi women cannot obtain a license to drive an automobile, and are not allowed to travel within the country without a male relative.
Religious freedom within Saudi Arabia is not tolerated.
Under Saudi law, people are restricted to publicly practicing Wahhabi Islam.
All other forms of Islamic practice are discouraged and discriminated against.
Shia Muslims constitute nearly eight percent of the Saudi population, but are subjected to discrimination by employers and restrictions that severely limit the practice of their religion.
Non-Wahhabi jurisprudence books and scholarly works have been prohibited for public use.
The punishment for trying to convert someone to a non-Islamic religion is the death penalty.
To discuss these important issues, we welcome as expert witnesses:
Felice D. Gaer, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom
Ali Al Ahmed, Director of the Saudi Institute
Dr. Peter Mandaville, Professor of Political Science, George Mason University
Dr. Ali H. Alyami, Human Rights Activist
Dr. Gwenn Okruhlik, Professor of Political Science, University of Arkansas
Representative, Amnesty International USA
We look forward to your attendance at this briefing.
For further information, please contact Michael Vrakatitsis (Rep. Lantos) at x5-3531, Kate Dickens (Rep. Morella) at x5-5341, or David Dettoni (Rep. Wolf) at x5-5136.
Sincerely, __________________________________________________________________
