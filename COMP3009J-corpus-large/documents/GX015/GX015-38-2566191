Chapter 2 - General Sports Franchise Examination Techniques
Overview
This chapter addresses general sports franchise examination techniques.
More detailed examination techniques and issue guidance are contained in the specific issue chapters of this guide.
General Accounting Considerations
Even among sports franchises in the same league, the financial statements for the sports franchise are generally unique.
There are often significant differences in accounting for the acquisition of the sports franchise and in the accounting policies for major items such as player contracts and contingencies.
There are also varying levels of vertical business integration.
The financial statements often reflect significant related party transactions which are common for most sports franchises.
The amortization of player contracts is almost always a material audit issue.
Player contracts are typically structured to include signing bonuses and deferred compensation arrangements.
For most sports franchises, ticket revenues and broadcasting rights constitute the majority of revenue.
Many teams also have favorable lease arrangements in which the team receives revenue from parking, concessions, and stadium naming rights.
Advance sales of upcoming season tickets are typically reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that gate revenues be recorded in the period in which the fans attend the games so that they are matched against period costs.
As with other industries, the GAAP timing of income and expenses for sports franchises often differs from that for tax purposes.

Return Identification and Entity Background Information
There are usually a limited number of sports franchises located within a specific district.
For purposes of an approved district compliance initiative, sports franchise returns can often best be identified through the examiner's personal knowledge of the sports teams located within their district.
The main problem in identifying returns, however, is identifying the owner's entity name under which the tax return is filed, as opposed to the sports franchise's "doing business as" (DBA) name.
This can be a difficult and time consuming task in situations in which the entity operates as a partnership.
One way to identify the ownership entity is through the use of the incorporation library (INCORP) on Lexis-Nexis.
By accessing the XXBIZ file (where XX represents the state abbreviation; for example, FLBIZ for Florida) examiners can usually locate the records for the ownership entity by utilizing the DBA name as the search term.
The BIZ file can provide a wealth of information about the entity, including the entity's registered name; the form of the entity, for example, corporation or partnership; the officers of record; and the federal employer's identification number (EIN).
The INCORP records will also indicate whether or not the entity is still active, or if it has been dissolved (voluntary or involuntary).
Additionally, historical data is provided which, if applicable, would include name changes or whether a merger had occurred.
The BIZ file will often cross reference related entity records.

Preplan and Issue Identification
The following information is presented to assist in assessing the audit potential of a sports franchise return.
It should only be used as supplemental information during the preplanning stage of an examination.
Since it is not all inclusive, in no way should it restrict the examiner from identifying other potential return issues that may be present.
Intangible Assets
The balance sheet is an integral part of any preplan.
Aside from normal preplan audit considerations, a specific review of the allocation among amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets is especially important in sports franchise examinations.
A sports franchise's non-amortizable intangible assets may, upon examination, be determined to be significant.
The ratio of non-amortizable intangible assets (TV broadcast rights, goodwill, going concern value, and franchise costs) to amortizable assets (primarily player contracts) will depend on how long the franchise has been in existence and the number of marque players employed by the team.
Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, should be viewed to ascertain if amortization has been claimed on non-amortizable intangible assets.
An inspection of Form 4562 might also indicate potential problems regarding the amount of the original franchise cost (whether by purchase or by expansion) allocated to player contracts, the useful life assigned to player contracts, and the placed in-service date for these contracts.
Deferred Revenue and Deposits
In order to identify deferred revenue and amounts that may have been improperly treated as non-taxable deposits, a detailed review of balance sheet current liabilities and long term liabilities is recommended.
The detail attached to the return may identify the make up of any deferred revenue.
For example, the detail may state that long term liabilities include deferred broadcast revenue and deferred sponsorship revenue.
Look at long-term liabilities to determine if any deferred revenue is included.
Sources of income such as ticket revenue for games which may extend beyond more than one season are often inappropriately deferred.
Amounts treated by the taxpayer as non-taxable deposits, which may in fact be taxable advance payments for services, may be included in long term liabilities or other liabilities.
The deposit/advance payment amounts for multiple year season ticket holder agreements (regular season ticket holders, club seats, and skybox or executive suites) can be quite significant.
This is especially the case for new sports franchises resulting from league expansion or team relocations and sports franchises that have or are trying to improve or expand the stadiums in which they play their home games.
Accrued Expenses
As part of the examination of the balance sheet, large accrued expense items should be considered.
Accrued expenses may include such items as accrued bonuses or compensation to related parties to which IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply.
Additionally, accrued compensation costs will often fall under the purview of IRC section 404 (deductions for deferred compensation) or IRC section 419 (deductions for contributions to welfare benefit funds).
Also, a large accrual of rent for a stadium or an arena should be reviewed to determine whether it qualifies as an IRC section 467 rental agreement, and if so, that the requirements of IRC section 467 are in compliance.
Other Deductions
As with any examination, excessive repair expenses claimed may indicate capital improvements are being improperly expensed.
The same can be said for excessive professional fees claimed, which may represent fees connected with the acquisition of the sports franchise, a lease agreement, or similar capital asset.
The audited financial statements should reflect any loans to related parties and the terms of the loans.
A review of this information may indicate an IRC section 7872 issue involving related party debt having below market interest rates.
Schedule M-1
Schedule M-1 should be inspected to determine the sports franchise's differences between taxable income and book income.
As with other taxpayers, these differences warrant consideration.
A taxpayer's tax accounting and book accounting are the same for items not reflected in Schedule M-1.
Accordingly, awareness of the sports franchise accounting areas for which there are usually differences in tax accounting and book accounting (which raise questions by their absence from Schedule M-1) can assist the examiner in identifying areas of audit risk.
An example is the absence of a Schedule M-1 adjustment for amortization.
Generally, a sports franchise's amortization will be less for tax purposes than for book purposes.
This is especially the case for new franchises, whether through expansion or purchase.
Related Party Transactions
Related party transactions are common for sports franchises.
Concession arrangements, local television contracts, and stadium lease arrangements to related entities are common in the industry.
It is not uncommon for the owners of the sports franchise to have an interest in these and other businesses that have financial dealings with the sports franchise.
The audited financial statements are a good source of information.
Generally accepted accounting principles and more specifically Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 57, Related Party Disclosures, require disclosure of related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements.
This includes information on: (1) their affect on the financial statements, (2) the dollar amount of each transaction, and (3) any amounts due to or from related parties along with the terms of the debt arrangement.
Often, the underlying documents will be needed to determine the substance of related party transactions.
- Return to Table of Contents - _________________________________________________________________
Issue Development
Issue development is the key to any examination.
This means the facts should be fully developed to support the underlying issue, and to the extent possible, the taxpayer should acknowledge agreement with the facts.
Exhibit 2-1 is a sample Form 4564, Information Document Request, that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the examination.
Depending on the issue, the examiner may need to retain a copy of many of the documents and agreements inspected during the examination for the case file workpapers.
Factual development starts with the initial interview.
The interview should be conducted with the party having first-hand knowledge, usually the chief financial officer or comptroller.
It is important to develop initial interview questions which fit the particular facts and circumstances of the sports franchise.
Exhibit 2-2 is a sample interview questionnaire that can be tailored to the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances.
This sample interview questionnaire contains generic, initial interview questions, as well as questions specific to sports franchise examinations.
The questionnaire is by no means all inclusive.
Rather, it is meant to be used as only a guideline.
As with most examinations, a key to good issue development is a tour of the business.
Regardless of how many stadiums or sports arenas the examiner has visited, each is unique in its own way.
Moreover, visiting a stadium or sports arena as a spectator is quite different from touring the facility as an examiner, where one has the opportunity to ask questions about the lives of assets, financing arrangements, and income producing activities.
It is preferable that the examination take place at the sports franchise's place of business.
A day-to-day observation of the business operations can lead to a more thorough understanding of the facts, clear up potential misunderstandings, and facilitate obtaining information from the taxpayer in a timely manner.
This usually minimizes the time expended on the examination and inconvenience to the taxpayer.
Make specialist referrals as early as possible.
Because a Computer Audit Specialist (CAS) referral is mandatory on all cases with Activity Code 219 and above, sports franchises typically require a CAS referral.
Asset valuation issues are usually identified early in the examination.
If asset valuation assistance is warranted, make the engineering referral early in the examination.

Required Filing Checks
There are usually related entity returns that should be inspected and perhaps examined.
This often includes the tax returns of the owners of the sports franchise.
The single largest expense of a professional sports franchise team is its salaries and wages.
This is due to ever increasing player costs.
It is, therefore, important for examiners to ensure the proper filing of all employment tax returns.
In addition, the policies for issuing Forms 1099 should be reviewed in conjunction with a determination that all required Forms 1099 were issued and that employees and subcontractors were properly classified.
Among other things, examiners should ensure that any relocation expenses paid to new players, coaches, etc., are included in the employee's W-2.
Additionally, examiners should determine if taxable fringe benefits have been properly handled.
For example, if all employees are provided season tickets at no cost, the value of the tickets given should be included in the employee's W-2, and proper FICA and FUTA paid.
If appropriate, the assistance of an Employment Tax Specialist should be requested.
Player Personal Service Corporations
A potential issue area is whether the sports franchise's players have formed personal service corporations (PSCs) through which their services are offered to the sports franchise.
A PSC may have a tax impact on the individual player under IRC section 269A and IRC section 482.
In addition, a PSC is likely to have a major employment tax impact on the sports franchise.
In the case of a sports franchise and a player employed through his PSC, there is no issue as to whether the player is an employee or independent contractor.
The issue is whether the player is an employee of the sports franchise or the PSC for employment tax purposes.
An analysis of the evidence generally establishes that a sports franchise controls its players not only as to the result, but also as to the means and methods of accomplishing the result.
Under the player contracts, players may not offer their services to any other sports franchise in the league.
Additionally, the sports franchise normally pays for the players' expenses when the team is on the road.
Generally, a sports franchise will be determined to be the employer of its players.
Accordingly, the sports franchise is usually responsible for FICA and FUTA taxes on the compensation paid for player services even if they are paid to a PSC.
See Leavell v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 140 (1995).

Compliance Strategies
If you believe there may be a lack of compliance in your area for one or more of the issues covered in this ATG, you may want to recommend a district compliance initiative.
In determining the appropriate compliance initiative strategy, consideration should also be given to taxpayer education, guidance, and assistance.
