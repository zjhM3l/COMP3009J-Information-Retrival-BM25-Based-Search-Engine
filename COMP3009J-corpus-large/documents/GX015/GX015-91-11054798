DOT News Masthead REMARKS FOR THE HONORABLE NORMAN Y.
MINETA
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION
CONGRESSMAN MEEHANS NINTH DISTRICT DAY
WASHINGTON, D.C.
MAY 21, 2002
Thank you Congressman Meehan for that generous introduction, and thanks to all of you for your warm welcome.
I had the privilege of briefly serving with Marty in the House, and I can assure you he has earned a reputation in this institution as a straight shooter, and as someone willing to work hard to develop innovative solutions for the people of Massachusetts.
As all of you know, because of the ruthless terrorist attacks last September, America has entered a new era in transportation.
At the Department of Transportation, we have worked literally day and night for the last eight months to prevent terrorists and other criminals from ever again using any facet of our transportation system as a weapon against any American, anywhere.
Before September 11^th, the Department viewed transportation security as one of our strategic goals.
After September 11^th, we found that we needed a new, broader, overarching security focus.
President Bush has directed us to build a transportation security system that will provide a strong defense against all external threats most importantly, against terrorists, but also against drugs, disease, and other dangerous elements.
At the same time, the President expects us to develop an efficient approach to transportation security, one that avoids unnecessary and unreasonable obstacles to legitimate trade and travel.
As a part of that commitment, the Bush Administration worked with Congressman Meehan and his colleagues to pass the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.
This law makes security for all modes of transportation, for the first time, a responsibility of the federal government.
To carry out this critical new responsibility, Congress created a separate agency within DOT called the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and President Bush appointed one of Americas leading law enforcement professionals, John W. Magaw, to head it up.
Last week, we named retired Coast Guard Rear Admiral George Naccara as the Federal Security Director for Logan International Airport.
In this position, he will serve as the TSAs personal representative to travelers at Logan, answering directly to Under Secretary Magaw.
Some of you may already know George from his tenure as Commander of the First Coast Guard District in Boston.
In building this new organization, we have made a core commitment to providing both world-class security and world-class customer service.
For example, we recently designated Baltimore Washington International Airport as a test site for developing better passenger screening procedures.
We implemented a number of common-sense changes, such as providing chairs and shoehorns for passengers whose shoes we inspect, and hardwiring the screening equipment into an outlet in the ceiling, so it does not get unplugged inadvertently.
These new procedures have resulted in measurable success.
We cut wait times during peak hours from 20-plus minutes down to 10 or 15 minutes.
We reduced the maximum number of people in line at peak times by a third.
As a result, customer satisfaction with the security process has increased significantly.
And, were enjoying comparable results elsewhere, as we apply the lessons learned at airports across America.
Thats good news for every traveler, but especially for the business traveler, for whom time is money.
We fully expect that, when we roll out these new screening procedures at Logan and at regional airports throughout New England, we will see similar success.
Immediately following September 11^th, we established as our most urgent objective the need to counter the vulnerabilities in our air transportation systems.
But, we have made substantial progress in other modes of transportation as well.
Considering that nearly 7 million passengers and more than 6 million cargo containers enter the United States through our seaports each year, our Nations maritime system presents one of our greatest security challenges.
The Coast Guard has developed a three-year Maritime Security Plan to further heighten security at our ports.
This plan will provide long-term tools for security planning and international coordination.
And, we have established, jointly with the U.S. Customs Service, a Container Working Group to address the security challenges posed by cargo containers.
Even as we address todays security concerns, we must also prepare for the transportation system of tomorrow.
We have not lost sight of the fact that the demand for both passenger and freight transportation continues to grow steadily, and that it already strains the capacity of much of our existing infrastructure.
Amtrak service in the Northeast has shown that rail service constitutes an irreplaceable part of a regional transportation system.
As demonstrated in the aftermath of September 11th, intercity passenger rail provides for flexibility and redundancy in the Nation's passenger transportation system.
The Bush Administration remains committed to working closely with the Congress to develop a comprehensive, long term plan that addresses the concerns of all those involved in Amtraks future.
However, Amtraks current financial and operational condition evolved over thirty years, and does not lend itself to a quick and easy solution.
Simply put, we need a radical overhaul of our Nations passenger rail system if we want passenger rail to remain a viable means of transportation.
Sound business principles, and not a band-aid approach, must guide Amtrak's future.
Of course, all of you know about the Boston Central Artery/Tunnel project, known affectionately as the Big Dig, the largest and most technologically challenging highway project in America.
Weve had a few bumps both literally and figuratively along the way.
But, I do believe we are on the right path.
The Federal Highway Administration has approved the Massachusetts Turnpike Authoritys finance plan for the project, and we will continue to work with the state of Massachusetts and the project office to achieve the project goals.
As part of the effort to build a transportation system for the 21^st century, Congress must reauthorize surface and air transportation programs by the end of fiscal year 2003.
Congressman Meehan played a significant role in the passage of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21^st Century, or TEA-21.
Together with its predecessor, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, or ISTEA, this landmark legislation revolutionized federal transportation programs and funding.
I expect key elements of the Administrations surface transportation reauthorization proposal will seek to preserve and build upon the intermodal reforms of ISTEA and TEA-21.
But, we have an opportunity to do even more.
We welcome active involvement by all the stakeholders in this reauthorization process, including all of you, and the best time for that involvement is right now.
I look forward to working with Congressman Meehan and his colleagues as this process moves forward.
September 11^th left no one unchanged.
One answer to the events of that horrific day is to continue strengthening the right of all Americans to enjoy the freedom of mobility.
