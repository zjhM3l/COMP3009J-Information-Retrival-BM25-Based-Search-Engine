Chapter 12 - Sales And Exchanges Of Individual Player Contracts
Industry Practice
Occasionally, a sports franchise will sell a player contract.
However, more frequently, a sports franchise will trade one or more player contracts for player contracts owned by another sports franchise in the league.
Future draft picks are often included in these trades.
The special provisions under IRC section 1245(a)(4) and IRC section 1056 for the transfer of player contracts on the purchase/sale of a sports franchise are addressed in Chapter 10.
Transfers of player contracts in a sports league expansion are addressed in Chapter 11.
This chapter addresses the tax treatment of player contract trades among established sports franchises in a sports league not associated with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise.

Audit Issues
Potential audit issues for purchases, sales, or trades of player contracts not connected with the purchase/sale of an established or expansion sports franchise include: 1.
Whether the seller or transferor (player trades) properly reported the amount of IRC section 1245 and IRC section 1231 gains.
2.
Whether the purchaser or transferee (player trades) properly computed its tax basis under IRC section 1012 and IRC section 1031in the player contracts acquired.
Tax Law Application
Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up
Player contracts constitute intangible personal property.
As addressed in Chapter 9, if the player contract has a useful life of more than a year, it must be capitalized and amortized over the life of the player contract under IRC section 167.
Gains and losses on the sale or exchange of player contracts held by the sports franchise for more than a year constitute IRC section 1231 gains and losses.
However, to the extent of amortization claimed under IRC section 167, player contract gains are subject to IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture.
In general, player contract trades qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition treatment for like kind exchanges.
Gains recognized on player contract trades are limited to the amount of boot and, if applicable, non-qualifying property received by the transferor.
Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291 and Rev. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104, specifically address these general provisions for sports franchise player contracts.
IRC section 1031(a) provides that no gain or loss is recognized if property used in a trade or business is exchanged solely for like kind property.
Under IRC section 1031(b), any realized gain is recognized to the extent money or property that is not like kind is received in the exchange.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.1031(b)-1(c) provides:
Consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability) is to be treated as "other property or money" for the purposes of section 1031(b).
Where, on an exchange described in section 1031(b), each party to the exchange either assumes a liability of the other party or acquires property subject to a liability; then, in determining the amount of "other property or money" for purposes of section 1031(b), consideration given in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a receipt of property subject to a liability) shall be offset against consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability).
See section 1.1031(d)-2, examples (1) and (2).
To the extent of IRC section 1245 recapture, gains recognized on player trades are ordinary gains.
The IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule for player contracts (addressed in chapter 10) only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise.
Accordingly, the IRC section 1245(a)(4) amalgamation rule does not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts by a sports franchise to another sports franchise.
This means the IRC section 1245 recapture provisions are applied on an individual player contract basis versus an aggregate player contract basis.
Accordingly, the tax treatment to the transferor on the sale or exchange of a player contract is the same as the tax treatment given the sale or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business.
In the sports franchise's tax year in which a player is cut, the sports franchise is entitled to an ordinary deduction under IRC section 165 for its adjusted basis in the player contract.
Generally, a sports franchise does not have an ascertainable tax basis in future draft picks given up in a player trade (treated as an inseparable part of the franchise intangible asset).
Accordingly, in determining the sports franchise's basis in player contracts acquired in trades, a zero adjusted basis should be used for future draft picks given up in the trade.
To the extent a gain on a future draft pick given up in a trade is recognized under IRC section 1031, the gain is an IRC section 1231 gain.
A potential emerging issue, that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031, is addressed at the end of this chapter.
Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts
If a sports franchise purchases a player contract, the cost basis provisions of IRC Section 1012 apply.
If a sports franchise acquires a player contract in a player trade, the basis provisions of IRC section 1031 apply.
In a player trade the sports franchise's basis in the player contract(s) acquired is: 1.
its adjusted basis in the player contracts given up in the trade, 2.
less the player contract liabilities transferred, 3.
plus player contract liabilities assumed in the exchange, 4.
plus any gain recognized due to the receipt of boot.
IRC section 1056, which is addressed in Chapter 10, only applies to player contracts transferred in connection with the purchase/sale of an entire sports franchise.
Accordingly, the IRC section 1056 sports franchise buyer basis rules do not apply to the sale or trade of two or more player contracts among sports franchises.
A sports franchise acquiring future draft picks in a player trade will have a tax basis in the draft picks acquired based on the application of IRC section 1031.
The sports franchise's tax basis in the future draft pick becomes part of the sports franchise's capitalized cost basis in the player contract signed as a result of the draft pick.
Accordingly, except for the future draft pick basis "wrinkle" addressed above, the tax basis rules on the acquisition of player contracts is the same as the tax basis rules on the purchase or exchange of tangible personal property, such as machinery, used in any trade or business.
Example -- Player Contract Trade
Sports franchise A and sports franchise B are unrelated calendar year TEFRA partnerships.
Sports franchise A trades the player contract of athlete Strong (Strong player contract) for sports franchise's B player contract of athlete Fast (Fast player contract) on January 1, 1996.
Sport franchise A's Strong player contract was entered into on January 1, 1994.
On January 1, 1996, there are 2 years remaining on the original 4 year contract.
A's original amortizable basis in the Strong player contract was $800,000, and A claimed $200,000 of amortization for the year 1994 and $200,000 for the year 1995.
Accordingly, A's adjusted basis in the Strong player contract on January 1, 1996, is $400,000.
The payments remaining on the Strong Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $300,000.
Sports franchise B's Fast player contract was entered into on January 1, 1995.
On January 1, 1996, there are 3 years remaining on the original 4-year contract.
B's original amortizable basis in the Fast player contract was $600,000, and B claimed $150,000 of amortization for the year 1995.
Accordingly, B's adjusted basis in the Fast player contract is $450,000 on January 1, 1996.
The payments remaining on the Fast Player contract on January 1, 1996, are $400,000.
Due to the team needs of both sports franchises, and taking into account the relative fair market values of the two player contracts (based on Strong's and Fast's prior season performance) on January 1, 1996, sports franchise A agrees to an even trade (no cash or other property consideration by either A or B) of its Strong player for sports franchises B's Fast player.
Sports franchise A and sports franchise B agree that on January 1, 1996, the fair market value of the Strong player contract is $500,000, and the fair market value of the Fast player contract is $600,000.
The gain computed by sports franchise A and sports franchise B is determined as follows:
Consideration Received: Sports Franchise A Sports Franchise B FMV of Fast Player Contract $600,000 Strong Contract Liability Transferred $300,000 FMV of Strong Player Contract $500,000 Fast Contract Liability Transferred $400,000 Total Consideration Received $900,000 $900,000 Less Adjusted Basis In Contract Transferred $400,000 $450,000 Gain Realized $500,000 $450,000 Gain Recognized $0 $100,000
Sports franchise A does not have a gain recognized because it received no boot.
It received no boot because the player contract liability assumed of $400,000 exceeded its player contract liability transferred of $300,000.
Sports franchise B has a recognized gain of $100,000 since this is the amount of boot received.
Sports franchise B received $100,000 of boot in the exchange because the player contract liability it transferred of $400,000 exceeded the player contract liability it assumed of $300,000.
Due to the $150,000 amortization claimed in 1995, all of B's recognized gain of $100,000 is IRC section 1245 recapture ordinary income.
Sport franchise A's and sports franchise B's tax basis in the player contracts acquired in the trade are computed as follows:
Sports Franchise A Sports Franchise B Adjusted Basis In Contract Given Up $400,000 $450,000 Less liability Transferred (300,000) (400,000) Plus Liability Assumed 400,000 300,000 Plus Gain Recognized 0 100,000 Tax Basis in Contract Acquired $500,000 $450,000
Sport franchise A's tax basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract is $500,000 as computed above.
This is comprised of its $400,000 adjusted basis in the Strong player contract it traded to B plus the additional $100,000 player contract liability A assumed in the trade.
A amortizes its $500,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Fast player contract over the three years remaining on the Fast player contract.
Sport franchise B's tax basis in its newly acquired Strong Player contract is $450,000 as computed above.
This is comprised of its $450,000 adjusted basis in the Fast player contract it traded to sports franchise A less the net $100,000 contract liability relieved of on the trade plus the $100,000 gain it recognized on the trade.
Sports franchise B amortizes its $450,000 adjusted basis in its newly acquired Strong player contract over the two years remaining on the Strong player contract.

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained include: 1.
A copy of all player contract sale or trade agreements for the tax year under examination.
2.
The sports franchise's workpapers and schedules on the computations of gains and losses for the tax year under examination.
This includes workpapers and schedules which reconcile with the return Form 4797 amounts.
3.
For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1.
the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2.
the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3.
the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract, b. to the extent not included in (a), copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization.
This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.
Gains and Losses on Player Contracts Given Up
For player trades, focus on the player trades in which your sports franchise received cash or other taxable boot (such as player contract liabilities given up in excess of player contract liabilities assumed) in the IRC section 1031 exchange.
Detailed guidance on the computation of the IRC section 1231 and 1245 gains on player contracts is not addressed in this guide because it is the same as for sales and exchanges of tangible personal property by any business taxpayer.
For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application.
IRC section 165 abandonment losses on players cut shortly after the player's contract was acquired may warrant consideration.
If the player contract was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise (either the purchase of an existing sports franchise or an expansion sports franchise), consider the basis allocated to player contract in the acquisition.
To obtain IRC section 165 loss deductions, a new sports franchise may allocate more of the purchase price than warranted to players contracts of players it plans on cutting.
A common examination technique is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent year's player contract listings, depreciation, and amortization schedules.
Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules
Tax Basis in Acquired Player Contracts
Detailed guidance on the computation of the tax basis under IRC section 1012 and 1031 on player contracts is the same as for tangible personal property of other business taxpayers.
For general guidance, refer to the coverage given earlier in this chapter under tax law application.
In player contracts acquired in a multiple player contract trade, you may want to ascertain that more basis than warranted is not allocated to the player contracts acquired with the shortest useful lives.

Potential Emerging Issue On Future Draft Picks
The coverage given above on IRC section 1031 exchanges assumes that a player contract and a future draft pick are like kind property.
There may be a potential emerging issue on whether this is, in fact, the case.
This potential emerging issue impacts whether the trade of a single future draft pick for a single existing player contract can qualify for IRC section 1031 nonrecognition.
For multiple future draft and player contract trades, it impacts whether other property (nonlike kind) is received in the exchange.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(1) provides the general rule that exchanges of intangible personal property qualify under IRC section 103
*** only if the exchanges of properties are of a like kind.
No like classes are provided for these properties.
Whether intangible personal property is of a like kind to other intangible personal property generally depends on the nature or character of the rights involved (e.g., a patent or a copyright) and also on the nature or character of the underlying property to which the intangible personal property relates.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.1031(a)-2(c)(2) provides "The goodwill or going concern value of a business is not of a like kind to the goodwill or going concern value of another business."
The underlying property for both a future draft pick and a current player contract is the future or current contractual services of a professional athlete.
However, while a sports franchise has a separable ascertainable value and basis in player contracts (separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset), this does not appear to be the case for future draft picks.
It appears that future draft picks of a sports franchise are inseparable from its franchise intangible asset.
Accordingly, it appears that future draft picks and existing player contracts do not constitute like kind property for purposes of IRC section 1031.
