PROPOSAL FOR IMPLEMENTING LOCAL ACTION STRATEGIES AND OTHER ACTIONS FROM THE PUERTO RICO RESOLUTION
Roger Griffis National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Co-Chair, USCRTF Steering Committee
Summary of presentation: * How can the Task Force better support implementation to reach goals and objectives * Four needs: Prioritize actions, increase coordination and collaboration, track performance, build capacity * Prioritize actions: focus on 6 key threats * Increase coordination: 3-year Local Action Strategies on 6 threats.
Regional Subcommittees link to national plan * Track performance: improve metrics.
Build tracking system * Build capacity: increase support (funding, detailees, joint efforts, tech assistance) * People would like to have more thoughts about the resolution and will discuss it on October 6 in Guam
Comments:
Tim Keeney:
* Comment the Steering Committee, the All Islands Committee, Task Force members and others for implementing the Puerto Rico resolution * The changes we adopted are critical to improving the effectiveness of the Task Force and effective implementation of the National Action Plan * NOAA remains committed to support development and implementation of the local action strategies and the overall process.
RESOLUTION 2: IMPROVE PACIFIC WATER QUALITY
Lelei Peau Chairman, All Islands Committee
Summary of presentation: * The Coral reef resources are a cornerstone of the economy, tourism, fisheries, and traditional cultures of the U.S. Pacific Islands and the Freely Associated States.
* Coral reefs can only thrive under a narrow range of environmental conditions including light, salinity, temperature, water quality, and nutrients, and are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic inputs to nearshore waters.
* In some of the Pacific Islands, current wastewater treatment systems are in bad conditions that spill incidents cause adversely affects to coral reef health and the public health of residents and visitors.
* Coral reefs of the Pacific Islands are exposed to the effects of erosion, sedimentation, runoff from construction and unpaved roads, and other poor land-use practices and these activities can seriously impact coral reef health.
* Immediate and effective action is needed to ensure the coral reefs' survivor and thrive.
* The U.S. Pacific Islands have developed local action strategies that identify strategic short-term actions needed to reduce the threat of land-based sources of pollution on coral reef ecosystems.
Resolution: Asks the CRTF to work with the local jurisdictions to support addressing wastewater treatment, erosion, sedimentation, and runoff problems in the Pacific Islands.
Comments:
Tim Keeney: * Suggest to bring the road runoff issue to the Department of Transportation colleagues
RESOLUTION 3: SUPPORT FOR PACIFIC REEF ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING PROGRAM
Erica Cochrane Coral Reef Coordinator, CNMI
Summary of presentation: * The Coral reef resources are a cornerstone of the economy, ecological diversity, tourism, fisheries, and cultural practices of the U.S. Pacific Islands and the Freely Associated States.
* Jurisdictions in the region have varying capacities to conduct comparative, comprehensive, long-term monitoring and assessment across both locally-accessible and remote coral reef ecosystems.
* Many remote areas provide a unique opportunity to observe and better understand the effects of climate change, disease, and natural processes as compared to reefs in populated areas.
* Federal agencies have capabilities in assessing, monitoring and implementing actions to protect U.S. Pacific coral reef ecosystems and are key partners in building coral reef ecosystem assessment, monitoring and management capacity within the region.
* There is a need to coordinate and conduct monitoring and assessment programs with the on-going efforts in each jurisdiction and to share and compare data between the remote and populated sites.
Resolution: The CRTF supports continued long-term assessment and monitoring each of the Pacific island jurisdictions on at least a biannual basis; expansion of long-term assessment and monitoring efforts to include coral reef ecosystems of the Freely Associated States; continued and expanded comparative study of remote coral reef ecosystem and more populated sites; and continued and expanded allocation of funding and other resources.
Comments:
Judge Craig Manson: * This Resolution is significant because it emphasis efforts on local jurisdictions.
* It's important for DOI to understand the health of the coral reef ecosystem.
* Urge the CRTF members to take a careful look at this Resolution.
Tim Keeney:
* Strongly support this Resolution

PUBLIC COMMENT
1.
Pete Tenorio, CNMI Resident Representative
I am here to support the work of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
I have been following the group's activities for years and am familiar with their general intent and objectives.
I know that funding has always been a problem and I recognize that many proposals require tremendous amounts of funds.
I think the members should get together as a region and try to address the funding problem.
DOI and NOAA have been very generous, but looking at the long term objectives and plans, we need a much higher investment, especially if we are going to take into account the land infrastructure.
We need to keep land-based pollutants from harming the coral life of our islands.
I am based in DC and am prepared to help.
I want to let my fellow Americans know that the CNMI is a part of America.
We are a Commonwealth, but we do not have a vote and are not represented in Congress.
I was elected by my people, but I am not a voting member of Congress.
I ask you folks from the other Territories to help us lobby in Washington for a non-voting delegate, similar to that of each of the other U.S. insular areas.
Another representative in Washington would add strength to the voice of the Territories in asking for funds, especially for projects of this nature, and for other island issues of concern to our islands.
Ariel Mike Villagomez, Hopwood Junior High School Student
Save Our Reefs
We live in an island with fringing and barrier reefs.
The reefs protect us from natural events.
They are delicate ecosystems.
I am going to tell you my thoughts about the reef and why they should be protected, and what can be done to help the reefs.
We can be part of the solution to the problem.
We pollute the beaches, need to clean up after the weekends.
Also need to take into account tourist recreational activities.
Water skiing, jet skis, boats, etcÃ¢Â¦ can put oil into the reef, tourists take the corals for souvenirs, tourists break the corals.
The solution is to train and educate the tourism companies in proper behavior.
Another is to increase enforcement.
Fishing boats and fishing can also harm coral reefs.
The fishing rods pollute.
Fishermen can break the reefs.
Solution is to limit the areas in which people can fish - limit the boats to a certain distance to the reefs (or off shore?).
Designate anchor areas to keep boats off the reefs.
We enjoy the reef and need it to survive.
The earth is full of supplies, but to make sure that we have enough, we need to treat the environment with respect.
If the reef were dead, the food chain would be broken and we would not have food from the ocean.
We need the reefs and must work together using common sense to protect them.
Our future depends on them.
CNMI has valuable underwater resources.
At the same time, we must take good care of them.

Alma Ridep-Morris - MAREPAC, Palau
MAREPAC was formed to conserve coastal and marine environments and for sustainable use of marine resources.
Through participation in this group, a board was formally created in 2000.
We get funding through DOI, Office of Insular Affairs.
Board includes government agencies and organizations.
We have a 5-year plan to coordinate marine actives, fill gaps, and maximize resources.
Goals: * Promote wise, appropriate, and sustainable use of resources through management, capacity building * Understand the status of our commercial and non-commercial resources with up to date info.
* Enhance communication and coordination between stakeholders
Select projects each year with small grants (up to $5,000).
* Monitoring Jellyfish Lakes since 1998 - found lakes are very dynamic and vulnerable to climate change.
* Water temperature monitoring network in Palau.
Discovered largest internal waves in the ocean (200+ m amplitude).
* Ngaremeduu Conservation Area monitoring program * Field studies in Malco Harbor looking at dugongs.
* Public awareness program on diversity and importance of mangroves.
* Fact sheets about traditional Palau and other sustainable farming practices to reduce sedimentation and its impacts * Bibliography and database of marine resource documents.
GIS coral reef layer and database development - to develop a CRE GIS layer map to assist with development of a baseline assessment of marine resources.
A short-term solution until they can get help with more ambitious mapping.
5.
Francis Matsutaro, Chief Executive Officer of Palau International Coral Reef Center * The Palau International Coral Reef Center was created to be a self-sustaining center for marine research, education, and training.
* National Long-Term Monitoring Program is based there.
to examine change and provide accurate pictures of reef condition to policy makers and managers, and to look at recovery after the 1998 bleaching.
* Water and Watershed Project established to examine the effect of land-based activities on coral reefs.
* MPA Effectiveness Study - to guide management of 16 MPA sites in Palau.
* Coral Reef Spawning - to examine reproductive cycles and degree of spawning synchronicity.
What conditions does spawning occur in, how will predicted stresses/change impact reproduction.
* Crown of Thorns - study outbreaks * Fisheries Assessment - what is the contribution of each type of fisheries? For management and economic valuation.
* Educational Programs - for K-12, school outreach, internships, etc.
* International Roles - focal point for CRTF, global CRE monitoring network note, Marine Resources Pacific Consortium.
6.
Ruth Tighe * It's nice to see agencies working together and promoting conservation of coral reefs.
* I never heard talk during this conference of the interrelation of coral reef ecosystems.
What happens with one affects others.
Preserving each is important, but we need to link all of them.
We need to acknowledge the linkages as well as the individual areas.
7.
Dr. Richard Dodge, NCRI, NOVA Southeastern University Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project in Southeast Florida.
NCRI report to the Task Force * Expanding the FL Keys to SE FL. * Goal - to provide relevant and timely information on status and trends of FL's reefs.
* 43 sites include hard bottom, patch reef, and offshore reefs.
* FL is important b/c big percentage of nation's resources are in FL and available to a large % of the nation.
Mixed blessing.
* Many milestones - started in 1994, first data in 1996, and expanded Northward in 2003.
* New info on the extent of the resources, based on new bathometric maps, we know that the Reef Track extents farther north than thought - at least 500 mi from the Dry Tortugas reef tract.
* Expanded form 3 stations in the Dry Tortuga into Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties - 10 stations covering 3-depth transects.
* Looks at coral cover, biodiversity, and disease.
2-4 stations per site.
Species inventories and digital videos.
* Value of expanding FL monitoring to include full extent of resource, address recently developed LAS strategies, consistent with USCRTF National Actioni Plan and Straetgy, increases knowledge and management.
8.
John Furey, Northern Mariana College * The scientists at the local agencies support a proposal I am leading to put together a marine and conservation science center here.
* A Mall is closing, but will offer the opportunity to demonstrate mariculture, etc.
* I noticed that there is a 10-year old government building just down from the Mall, directly on the water.
* I am here to solicit funding.
* NOAA is working with regional folks, esp. UoG and NMI College to establish a Western Pacific Regional Sea Grant Consortium.
* Hawaii has a Sea Grant, but we are so remote.
* Establishment of a new Sea Grant here is important - will help with staffing, funding, and to make a focus center for our own scientists.
9.
Dave Raney, Pacific NGO Representative, HI Sierra Club and Reef Check * You have my written report.
Want you to notice the picture of 200 people volunteering in Waikiki to address an invasive species project.
* I noticed that you have a similar problem here with invasive algae.
* As people remove the algae, they build a long-term commitment to the reef.
There are also NGO and community projects that are site specific.
Reef Check works by getting people into the ocean to learn about their own reefs.
They take very basic measures.
* But getting those measurements educates them about their reefs.
Gives us more eyes and ears to help with education and enforcement.
* We do monitoring, but want to stress prevention of damage in the first place.
Looking for opportunitie4s to restore watersheds and reduce stressors to the reefs.
* When you talk about local, in Hawaii, this means county governments - ie. Zoning and grading ordinances.
* We have real sedimentation problems.
This gap might be filled through the CZM program.
* Reef Check and others are trying to go one community at a time to do a threats based analysis and identify opportunities for restoration.
Where possible, come up with a project and monitor how we do.
We look for help from our partners.
10.
Rosemary Godfrey, RARE Center for Tropical Conservation (in DC)
Over the last 25 years we've been developing conservation programs.
Based on a flagship species, i.e. the Fiji petrol, the St. Lucia parrot, manatees in Belize, napoleon wrasse, and tortoise.
We operate all over the world in 13 countries.
We have funding for a student to come to the UK to learn methodology and then return to their countries and implement a project for 12 months.
Also have funding to support local education materials (posters, bumper stickers, etc.).
We reach a wide range of stakeholders - goal is to raise pride and awareness.
Past projects have set up new protected areas, promoted better use of resources.
In a past project a village implemented regulation in response to a project - stopped the use of cyanide, dynamite, and coral mining.
Other villages then requested similar policies.
All community led, we provide the tools from which the counterpart chooses what is appropriate to that area.
Starts with a community meeting, we help pick what will work.
Campaign involves puppet shows, legislation booklets, campaign sheets, mass marketing, etcÃ¢Â¦ Starts in January at Kent University.
Funding is available for a project in the Western Pacific.
11.
Ellyn Tong, Hawaii Audubon Society * Thanks to Athline Clark for making the star a check [completion of implementation of the HI "Lack of Awareness" Local Action Strategies].
* Recent actions to increase awareness and help relieve local fishing problem.
* HI is behind Guam and Saipan with regard to MPAs.
We printed a 28-page brochure on why we need MPAs, a poster, and a video.
In the last legislative session, a bill was introduced to increase MPAs in Hawaii.
We got a severe flashback from fisherman.
Need to increase public awareness.
* Asked Fishermen what we can do.
They said we needed to address the gillnetting problem.
Legal size is 2.75 hole size deployed for 4 hours, checked every 2 hours.
Some want a soak time of 12 hours (bad), but others would like to see a complete ban.
We are coming up with a poster and video to regulate gillnetting.
* I am the resident artist.
I digest science for fishermen.
Poster shows the actual size of a fish that lays eggs.
Fishermen often didn't know.
We're also holding a State of Hawaii Aquatic Conference - Nov. 1 and 2 at Maui Community College.
Includes a fisherman turned PhD scientist in the Philippines.
* Also represent the Maliki Foundation - for moorings.
We drilled holes in the reef and established a series of mooring buoys.
Great collaboration, little funding, and you can adopt a buoy for $250.
12.
Thorn Abbott, CNMI Coastal Zone
How can we be more effective? You have been very gracious - provided almost $1M in 4 years, but federal grants can't support enforcement or writing of regulations.
Now we can enforce no fishing in Sanctuaries, net bans, etcÃ¢Â¦
Attended World Parks conference - protected areas are better when local, pro-people, pro-development, Filipino industry, Chinese garment factory workers, indigenous fisher folk, etcÃ¢Â¦
Management and regulatory plans can't be funded by FWS. Working on multiple use zones.
Ask that you support DFW's proposals, endeavors, and leading role in MPA regulation and coral conservation.
13.
John Gourley, Environmental Consultant, Micronesian Environmental Service
I thought the compensatory mitigation program talk was interesting - need to use a cautious, and slow movement to develop this program.
It seems like a good idea, feel good program.
But you need to follow the program through the people it effects - things get out of hand and compensatory mitigation is used as a penalty for those who dare submit applications.
If you don't have good guidelines, it will kill a project or add so much cost as to frustrate the developer.
Our infrastructure needs improvement.
Rota has 3,000 people with a small and dangerous harbor.
Planes don't go there so they depend on ships for everything.
Talk of opening the entrance channel - involves taking out a piece of a fringing reef.
I can imagine that the mitigation could be very punitive.
We have many cases in the CNMI where this will be an issue.
Take home message is that, as you progress with the Compensatory Mitigation Program, you need to recommend area by area basis guidelines.
14.
Tony L.G. Reyes, Saipan Resident
Thank you for spending your money on Saipan.
But I am ashamed of our island.
The first thing you see is sewage coming out of a pipe and it stinks.
You stay in a big building - tourists come to enjoy the beautiful island.
Local politicians must get together to do something.
I retired 10 years ago and built a house.
The water in my house flows so slow that you can't take a shower - When are we going to fix the problem? Do we need others to fix the problem for us? My shower is bad.
I told the government but the government has never done anything.
I told the Governor, but he has not done anything about this.
The system does not work.
We have to do something.
We need clean water.
The newspaper discusses it.
DEQ and CUC need to work.
For the past 10 years I haven't been drinking water from the tap.
I feel sorry for people who can't afford bottled water.
All I ask is that you work together.
Let's have clean water and clean beaches.
Don't want stinky water coming out from the sewage line.

Semona Ann Igama, Marians High School Marine Biology Club
The 2003 - 2004 Marianas High School, Marine biology club would like to focus on accomplishing several projects, but most importantly we would like to concentrate on the project working with teen talk live.
The youth and the people of Saipan should be educated about our coral reef protection plan.
If we have the privilege to speak out in teen talk we would talk about importance of two major problems or subject, which is fisheries and coral reef resources management.
We would also be able to do a series especially if there is a big issue we need to solve.
For the subject fisheries management our club could be trained to scuba dive with an approved license.
We could analyze the reefs for the people of Saipan and visitors.
We could solve why a decrease in the numbers and average sizes of fishes have changed in the past years, and if we are fortunate to find a new discovery we would share our research.
We can also draw to emphasize the problem and add a current/moon chart on a calendar as we did last year.
For the subject coral reef resource management, our club would gladly be trained as mentioned previously and we are willing to survey the coral reefs and tally the current/moon chart on a calendar for the curious people of Saipan.
When we let all of Saipan be aware of the problems with our most precious resource (the ocean), we protect and reserve our beautiful island.

TASK FORCE BUSINESS ITEMS - PART 1: DECISIONS
Tim Keeney Deputy Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere with NOAA; Co-Chair, USCRTF
Consideration of Resolution 2
Comments:
Judge Craig Manson: * This resolution is very similar to the Caribbean Water Quality Resolution from February, 2003
Donald Schregardus: * What about the 60 days [for jurisdictions to submit a list of the top infrastructure needs to reduce impacts to CRTF]? Will the list include costs?
Lelei Peau: * Most jurisdictions are aware of their major needs and can provide a list within 60 days.
I have no problems with supporting an amendment to do that.
Have all the jurisdictions made that evaluation of the impacts of the sewage treatment plan or storm sewer etc. on the coral reefs.
* The identification was part of the Local Action Strategy, however, because the costs were so great, these requests were not included in the LAS.
* The jurisdictions are ready and it's in their best interest to provide the list as soon as possible.
* Will the list include costs - it varies by jurisdiction.
John McCarroll: * Some of the problems and some of the solutions are well beyond the scope of the USCRTF.
However, maybe the spirit of this is that it is going to elevate the visibility of this issueÃ¢Â¦.
And will help dovetail the efforts that are going on separately by helping to add a coral reef lens to some of these other discussions.
Bill Rohring: * Many of these costs cannot be estimated over a long period of time because populations grow and things change.
A lot of the cost estimates aren't possible unless you come up with a discrete time period.
Resolution 2 is passed.
Consideration of Resolution 3
Comments:
Tim Keeney: * NOAA is very supportive of this Resolution.
Mack Gray: * I know that monitoring is a great thing to do.
But what about funding?
Tim Keeney: * We are just expressing an interest in proceeding in a direction we're interested in going in if there is funding available.
* Expression of appreciation for the support we've received in the Northwest Hawaii, just want to confirm that these are included in the current resolution.
Resolution 3 is passed.
TASK FORCE MEMBER REPORTS - PART 2
State of Florida Bob Ballard, Deputy Secretary, Land and Recreation, FL DEP
Summary of presentation: * Florida engaged in the largest public works project in the history.
* Florida passed the Fiber-optic Rule.
Governor Bush and his cabinet unanimously passed this Fiber-optic Rule in September.
The Rule prevent any fiber optic cable from being laid in the Florida Keys or southern Dade County.
It allows cables in other counties, but provides incentives to route through natural breaks in the coral reefs.
There are steep economic incentives.
* This is huge for Florida.
One of the ways we were able to get this done was by mapping the reef area.
* With the LAS, they have brought together a core group and 2 large stakeholder meetings; the enthusiasm and participation of this group was excellent and we expect to have another meeting in December.
* We created new LAS Focus Area.
* Totally happy with what's going on in the Florida Keys Sanctuary * All 17 state marine patrol officers are now hired and operating.
* PSSA (Particular Sensitive Area) was implemented in the Florida Keys, restricting ships over 50 m long from entering the sanctuary.
Department of Agriculture Mack Gray, Undersecretary for Natural Resources, USDA Summary of presentation: * 2002 Accomplishments: + The largest program is EQIP + Most practices applied through EQIP in the Pacific Basin, Hawaii, the Caribbean Area and Florida, will benefit water quality and coral reefs.
+ Including o Animal waste storage facilities o Waste treatment lagoons o Composting facilities o Conservation cover crops o Conservation buffers o Critical area plantings + EQIP funding in 2002 o Pacific Basin - $500 K o Hawaii - close to $1 - 1.2 M o Puerto Rico - close to $2 M o Florida - about $10 M + Other programs are available to benefit coral reefs o Wetlands Reserve Program o On-going Conservation Technical Assistance o Plant Materials Centers * Conclusion The points I have discussed today point to a better future for coral reef ecosystems: EQIP and other farm bill programs continue to grow each year, meaning ever more progress in implementing land-based conservation measures.
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
Aileen Velazco, Coordinator, Programa de Arrecifes de Coral, Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales, PR
Summary of presentation: * Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) worked with NOAA to formulate goals, short and long-term objectives, and activities.
* Identified needs to have a well-trained and prepared Ranger's Team focused on coral reef issues to strengthen enforcement.
Selected 8 DNER Rangers to create the Coral Reef Enforcement Team.
* Strengthen natural reserves and advance coral reef management are taking shape in no-take Luis PeÃƒÂ±a Channel Natural Reserve in the Island Municipality of Culebra.
* Community-based management plan will serve as a model to follow in natural reserves involving stakeholders.
* NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office provides funding to DNER to perform zoning studies for the location of mooring buoys at the Canal Luis PeÃƒÂ±a Natural Reserve and mooring and marker buoys at the La Parguera Natural Reserve.
* PR House of Representatives passed legislation to designate the Tres Palmas Natural Reserve in RincÃƒÂ³n.
* With support from NOAA, Puerto Rico started work on the development of Local Action Strategies to address key threats in consultation with stakeholders from government, universities, private industry, NGOs, and public.
* Encourage the Task Force members to continue seeking innovative and creative ways to support Island efforts and actively participate in any way possible.
