Aerospace Education In Civil Air Patrol GENERAL OVERVIEW Aerospace Education is that branch of general education concerned with communicating knowledge, skills, and attitudes about aerospace activities and the total impact of air and space vehicles upon society.
Civil Air Patrol has both Internal and External Aerospace Education programs.
The Internal Program has two parts: Cadets and Senior members.
Cadets have a mandatory aerospace education program, governed by Civil Air Patrol Regulation 52-16.
Cadets must pass [aeseal_web.gif] written tests to progress through the achievement levels..
Aerospace education opportunities should be part of squadron meetings, encampments and field trips.
They can include guest speakers, model building and flying.
As the Aerospace Education Officer, you need to know what cadets need to do.
They should discover that aerospace education is a fun, esteem-building experience.
Your partners in the Cadet aerospace education program are the unit commander, the cadet program leaders, the cadets and any other senior member or expert from outside Civil Air Patrol who can assist with aerospace education learning.
Senior members have an elective aerospace education program.
The publications containing information on aerospace education for senior members are Civil Air Patrol Regulation 50-17, Civil Air Patrol Regulation 280-2, and Civil Air Patrol Pamphlet 215.
Senior members may participate in the Aerospace Education Program for Senior Members (AEPSM) and earn the Charles E. `Chuck' Yeager Aerospace Education Achievement Award.
They may earn the "Technician," "Senior," or" Master" ratings in the 215 Aerospace Education Officer Specialty Training Track and may use attendance at a National Congress on Aviation and Space Education, attendance at a Region Aerospace Education Conference or preparing an aerospace manuscript for publication, to fulfill certain Senior Member Training Program progression requirements.
The External Program is community outreach.
Civil Air Patrol has focused on schools and teachers as an excellent way to promote aerospace.
Teachers can use aerospace themes and experiences to excite students, to teach a variety of subjects, and to develop special activities such as field trips, science competitions, model building, art contests, science fairs, etc.
And, it is an excellent way to expose students to aerospace career opportunities.
An important part of Civil Air Patrol's external program is the Aerospace Education Member (AEM) Program.
This program is designed primarily for teachers from kindergarten through twelfth grade who want to promote aerospace education in their schools using CAP educational products and resources.
For their $30 annual membership dues, Aerospace Education Members receive a membership certificate, lapel pin, periodic newsletters, special educational products, and the opportunity to participate in Civil Air Patrol's Middle School AE Program.
Aerospace Education Members are restricted from regular participation in Civil Air Patrol unit activities and are not required to be screened by the FBI or to complete the Cadet Protection Training.
Aerospace Education Members who transfer to regular membership status, may transfer without charge and complete the screening and training requirements for regular membership.
As an Aerospace Education Officer, you are encouraged to personally promote this program in local schools and to encourage Civil Air Patrol cadet and senior members to recruit a teacher for Civil Air Patrol.
Aerospace Education Member recruiting brochures are available from your Region Director of Aerospace Education.
Beyond the school system, there are many other places for Civil Air Patrol members to promote aerospace education in the community.
There are community service organizations such as Boy and Girl Scout groups, Boys and Clubs, Rotary, Kiwanis, Modeler Clubs, Hobby Shops, Environmental Clubs, Art Associations, 4-H, and so on.
Through service organizations such as these, plus business organizations, aerospace organizations, and aerospace industry, Civil Air Patrol has worked to promote the importance and usefulness of aerospace education.
In May, 1998, Civil Air Patrol's National Executive Committee modified the Aerospace Education Membership program to allow reputable organizations to join Civil Air Patrol and for a designated individual in that organization to receive the Aerospace Education Membership benefits.
Since then, many schools have used other organization's funding to join Civil Air Patrol as an Aerospace Education Member, thereby allowing their entire staff to enjoy Aerospace Education Member-ship benefits via their designated representative.
A new Civil Air Patrol Form 13, Aerospace Education Membership Application, accommodates these organizational applicants.
In addition, businesses may either join Civil Air Patrol as Aerospace Education Members or they may sponsor one or more teachers to be Aerospace Education Members.
The Aerospace Education Officer Position
Aerospace Education Officers serve at all organizational levels from squadron through region.
When you accept assignment as Aerospace Education Officer on the Commander's staff, you accept responsibility for learning, knowing and helping do aerospace education in your unit.
The aerospace education program is an active one.
Aerospace Education Officers must learn the regulations, know the reporting system, and understand the procedures and processes required to do the job.
Documentation of the unit program is important.
At the squadron level, you must learn the program and make it work.
The squadron commander and your fellow squadron members are counting on you.
The members, cadets or seniors, respond to your leadership and do the aerospace achievements, activities, or events and earn the awards.
The community gets as much aerospace education outreach as your activity and leadership produces.
The Aerospace Education Officer inspires and instructs others as they instill aerospace knowledge and build an enduring aerospace education program.
You must lead by doing.
Your interest, activity and enthusiasm with cadets, seniors, and the public are essential in making the aerospace education program work.
Your example should cause Civil Air Patrol members and the public to be willing to act to support you and the aerospace education program you are promoting.
The Aerospace Education Program
The unit Aerospace Education program needs goals, plans and action to meet the goals and a review process.
Many of these goals are defined in Civil Air Patrol regulations and manuals.
Other goals may be proposed by unit members, by you, or even by people outside of Civil Air Patrol.
These goals are considered and approved by the commander for implementation.
You then publicize the unit's aerospace education goals.
Your next step is to develop the plans to achieve the goal.
If you need help to do this because you lack expertise or experience, find and enlist the help you need from within your unit or community.
Developing plans and processes to achieve your goals in aerospace education is essential to success.
But, remember that you need the commander's approval to start.
The Aerospace Education Officer provides the leadership, guidance, training, support, evaluation, and reporting necessary to the program.
Your leadership will make the difference in whether or not the program succeeds.
Evaluate the program.
Consider the next step: do you continue, change or stop? Remember, as the Aerospace Education Officer you should always be at the center of the program.
The commander needs to be your strongest ally.
And lastly, the program works when you can get people to act in support of the goals.
The Cadet Aerospace Education ProgramCAP commanders are responsible for leading the cadet program staff in conducting the overall program in accordance with Civil Air Patrol Regulation 52-16.
Aerospace education for cadets is a combined self-study and group-study program.
Instructors should conduct classes and group study sessions that support the cadets' self study.
Each cadet in Phase I and II should be assigned an aerospace education mentor.
Senior members, Cadet Sponsor Members, and Phase III or IV cadets should be identified and used to act as aerospace mentors.
Starting with achievement eight, the cadets must serve as an aerospace education mentor to cadets studying their Phase I or II aerospace materials.
Mentors should take an active responsibility for the individual cadet's success.
Aerospace education chapter tests do not have to be taken sequentially, but all tests must be taken.
Once passed, the tests must be corrected to 100% by going over the questions missed with the cadet and the mentors.
Records should indicate what the cadet originally scored to evaluate the cadet's on going performance.
Comprehensive aerospace education tests are given for the Mitchell, Earhart, and Spaatz Awards .
Phase IV cadets instruct in aerospace education in their squadron and have the opportunity to serve as the squadron Cadet Aerospace Education Officer.
Squadron commanders will provide opportunities for cadets to test for their achievements at least every 30 days.
Achievements require a minimum 60-day separation between completion of each of the achievements.
Unit commanders may reproduce a reasonable number of aerospace education test booklets and answer keys as long as test control procedures found in Civil Air Patrol Regulation 50-4 are followed.
Aerospace education is a required part of each cadet encampment.
CAP cadets 17 or younger are authorized to participate in the flight orientation program (nine flights - five front seat and four back seat) to become exposed to general aviation.

The External Aerospace Education Program
The external Aerospace Education program presents aerospace education to the public through academic programs within the education system and contacts between the Civil Air Patrol members and their communities
Civil Air Patrol supports aerospace education school system and college workshops.
The workshops are designed to provide educators with a basic knowledge of aerospace.
Civil Air Patrol has numerous educational materials to enhance and supplement academic curricula.
These materials are available to educators and community organizations.
Civil Air Patrol annually conducts the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education to promote an understanding of aviation and space education and motivate and encourage educators and others to incorporate aerospace education into their curricula or programs.
Aerospace Education Membership is a special category of Civil Air Patrol membership open to any reputable individual or organization that has an interest in supporting Civil Air Patrol's aerospace education program.
The objective of the external program is clearly defined "providing aviation education ...to encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities."
The way we provide for this is multifaceted and requires support from the receiving people and organizations in the community as well as from the Civil Air Patrol membership and paid staff.
Civil Air Patrol connects with educators in all regions across the country in several ways.
The Regional Directors of Aerospace Education (paid Civil Air Patrol staff members) support and participate in workshops that teach teachers how to use aerospace themes, materials, and resources (like airports and air museums) to teach their students subjects ranging from art, to language, to mathematics, to science, to history.
As a follow-up to workshops in the regions, Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters annually plans and conducts, with volunteer helpers, the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education.
The National Congress provides teachers who use, or are planning to use, aerospace in their classroom with finished instructional materials and instruction from master teachers in preparing and implementing lessons.
Further, teachers are provided the latest information on national progress in air and space initiatives; and, are offered opportunities for personal discussions with famous aviation and space personalities.
Civil Air Patrol tries to support any teacher, individual, or organization that is attempting to use aerospace to educate or inspire their audience.
To do this, a variety of free (or inexpensive) materials are made available to the general public.
The Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters paid staff has developed two aerospace education textbooks with instructor guides for use as teaching texts or as fact books.
These are sold at near production and shipping cost.
Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters has over thirty free lesson plan kits, activity books, concept posters and related materials which are sent to any person requesting the material.
The Civil Air Patrol Supply Depot, in a special Aerospace Education section of their sales catalogue, offers hundreds of educational kits, supplies, models, computer programs and books at deeply discounted rates.
Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Members are a national association of aerospace education advocates.
These members pay Civil Air Patrol national dues, receive all aerospace education materials and services, have special authority to fly on United States Air Force airlift supporting Civil Air Patrol aerospace education, and can, with special Civil Air Patrol Headquarters / Director of Operations permission, fly in Civil Air Patrol aircraft.
These members are supported by the Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters paid staff.
Civil Air Patrol partners with aerospace education programs and activities conducted in schools and by private and public community, state, and federal organizations.
Throughout the year, Civil Air Patrol units and Civil Air Patrol volunteers regularly participate in airshows, museum programs, school presentations that highlight, demonstrate, and present aviation and space information.
The Civil Air Patrol staff of paid Regional Directors of Aerospace Education conduct, with an invitation, school visitations that include aerospace presentations or aerospace activity programs.
Special regional aerospace events like "rocket launches" conducted annually in Delaware and Wisconsin by the state aeronautic division, and one-time events, like the John Glenn Aerospace Invitational conducted at Ohio State University with the 4-H Organization, are supported by a combined Civil Air Patrol team of volunteers and paid staff.
Nationally, special annual aerospace promotional events like the "International Aviation Art Contest" sponsored by all state aviation organizations, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Federation Aeronautique International are supported by the Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters staff.
As the Aerospace Education Officer, you are the key to Civil Air Patrol's Aerospace Education program in you local community.
You, along with other members of your unit will be the one to make contacts with the local schools, museums, and airshows.
You and your fellow unit members will present the special programs, provide the available Civil Air Patrol materials, speak to the teachers.
Through your efforts, they will learn what support resources are available from the Supply Depot or the benefits of becoming Aerospace Education Members.
Community outreach is an active process.
You must always be looking for opportunities to participate in the activities of the community while presenting the many and varied ways aerospace can enliven, enrich, and improve the community.
Aerospace Education Members are Civil Air Patrol members affiliated at the national level.
These members come from local communities.
They receive valuable aerospace education support from Civil Air Patrol.
Historically, the teachers have been recruited via aerospace education workshops sponsored by Civil Air Patrol and by direct recruitment from Region Directors of Aerospace Education.
You, as the unit Aerospace Education Officer, and all the members in your unit should be recruiters of Aerospace Education Members.
If you find a teacher, individual, or organization who wants to support aerospace education, but does not want to be a "regular" uniform wearing Civil Air Patrol member, recruit them as an Aerospace Education Member.
You will be promoting Civil Air Patrol's aerospace education outreach program and expanding Civil Air Patrol membership.
This identification and recruitment is important to sustaining the external aerospace education program in Civil Air Patrol.
It is often said, "Civil Air Patrol is the best kept secret."
This may be true.
Aerospace outreach has a great potential to get Civil Air Patrol recognized and appreciated for its great service to America.
It can be a great way locally to get good press in the schools, intrigue school children to come out and take a look at Civil Air Patrol, and create an image that will get public support and even donated resources.
As the Aerospace Education Officer, share this thought with your commander and the members of your unit.
Involve all the unit members in actively promoting aerospace outreach.
It can revitalize a unit and open many new avenues for growth and enrichment.
Unit Aerospace Education Bulletin Boards
A unit aerospace education bulletin board is a way to share information through a visual reminder of the importance of aerospace education for Civil Air Patrol members.
As the Aerospace Education Officer, you should utilize this tool.
It is an effective and interesting way to disseminate information, to expose aerospace topics to unit members, and it allows the Aerospace Education Officer to post information to reach the widest possible audience.
Determine what purpose the bulletin board will serve.
Determine how often updating will be done and who will maintain the bulletin board.
Survey unit membership for input as to items/topic areas/themes for the board.
Assign someone the responsibility for doing the bulletin board Provide training, guidance and feedback.
Make the bulletin board look professional.
Does it need background paper, border paper, frame painting, special effects? Gather articles, pictures, and other materials to be displayed on the bulletin board.
Arrange the items in a pleasing format.
Does the bulletin board "catch the eye" of unit members? Regularly review materials posted; assess effectiveness; remove outdated items; add new items.
Are people reading, discussing, and using the information? Is the information current? Some suggestions for items/information to include on an aerospace education bulletin board: Copy of the most recent wing and / or region aerospace education newsletter.
News articles and pictures of unit members and others involved in aerospace activities.
Chronology of upcoming aerospace events (air shows, fly-ins, field trips, speakers, special aerospace activities, upcoming TV specials, Internet sites, etc.) with details about time, location, purpose, cost information (if available).
Aerospace Education Program Schedule for Senior Members -- testing dates, sign-up for group study, listing of recent Yeager Award winners in the organization.
Information from National Headquarters relevant to new or ongoing aerospace education programs.
Civil Air Patrol aerospace education workshop / conference / seminar / National Congress information.
Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Excellence Award information and activities planned for the program.
Book reviews, aerospace publications or a list of "classics" to read.
Trivia corner.
Scholarship and individual aerospace awards programs individuals can enter with instructions on how to enter or where to find the details to enter.
Aerospace Current Events Discussion
An aerospace current events discussion is an important part of each unit meeting.
It is conducted among the members to promote critical thought and share information concerning aerospace events and issues.
Such discussions broaden members' knowledge and focus their thinking about the importance of aerospace to the security and prosperity of our nation and mankind.
Determine how often / how long you will have Aerospace Current Events discussion
Get the commander's agreement to follow the frequency plan.
Without the commander's support, the plan is ineffective.
Determine procedures for preparing for and conducting Aerospace Current Events discussion
Determine the amount of time to be allotted to topic presentation and discussion.
Determine a process to identify potential discussion topics and to collect "source pieces."
(Note: A proven, easy, fast, reliable way to find "source pieces" is to have members clip aviation and space articles from newspapers or magazines and bring them to the meeting.
Place the articles in a "grab bag" and pull out an article at random as the source piece for the discussion.
The same can be done with recorded television or radio tapes.)
Determine a process to pick a member to initiate the discussion once the "source piece" is selected.
This does not necessarily have to be the person who brought the article.
Designate a timekeeper to keep the discussion within the planned time block.
Establish a process to keep track of topics discussed by the group
Simple spread sheet with date, topic(s) discussed, discussion leader(s), provides a good record.
Evaluate AE current events discussion period Were the members involved throughout the lesson (interested and attentive)? Did the members grasp the main points - the "so what" or the "why this is important"? Was the discussion too long or too short? Did the support materials work well for the lesson (attention grabbing, changed pace, added value)?
NOTE: You will be repeating the discussion process with your group.
Take time to replace any processes or procedures that did not work well.
Try alternative techniques.
Mix up the routine so the process stays fresh.
Keep notes on the discussions, the group reaction, any special successes or experiences which you can apply when "freshening up" the process in the future.
How to Do It All
Utilize materials such as slides, films, videotapes, and computer programs to teach and to enhance lessons.
Recognize areas of individual expertise by bringing in guest speakers, other unit members, or Civil Air Patrol members from other units to provide instructional support.
Use the talents of your community.
Enlist assistance and support from:
Other Civil Air Patrol personnel National Aeronautics and Space Administration Federal Aviation Administration Community resources Local teachers
Participate in aerospace education conferences for training, program strategies, and idea sharing
National Congress on Aviation and Space Administration -- an annual educational symposium
Region Aerospace Education Conferences -- consult the RDAE for scheduled conferences in your area.
