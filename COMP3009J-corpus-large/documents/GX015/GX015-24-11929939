Plant viruses are important impediments to productive agriculture, and several plant viruses affect the plants we grow for food and fiber.
Many approaches have been used to control virus diseases, but none are perfect.
One of the new approaches for controlling diseases caused by plant viruses is to grow crops that are genetically-engineered for specific virus resistance.
This approach has received Federal approval for a few crops, including squash with resistance to watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV).
One of the questions associated with using genetically engineered virus resistance is whether new viruses will develop as a result of this approach.
We will attempt to answer this question, in part, by examining the population structures of viruses in California cucurbits (squash, melons, cucumbers).
We will utilize contemporary, molecular epidemiological approaches, including single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis, to determine the population structure of WMV, CMV and ZYMV in susceptible and resistant cucurbits.
We will assess the virus population structures in virus-resistant cucurbits including those developed by conventional plant breeding and by genetic engineering.
We will compare the viruses found in these different environments and attempt to determine whether or not specific viruses arise or result from selection exhibited by genetically-engineered virus resistance.

A major concern in the development of herbicide-resistant crops is the potential for accidental or unintended transfer of resistance genes to related species and the possibility of resistant wild plants becoming even more noxious and invasive weeds.
Genetic resistance to commonly used imadazolinone (IMI) herbicides has been recently introduced into cultivated sunflower by Kansas State University and the USDA/ARS through classical breeding methodology.
Seed companies will release IMI-resistant sunflowers in the near future.
Herbicide-resistant sunflower crops could transmit the herbicide resistance genes into wild sunflower since these species occur in proximity, have overlapping flowering periods, and crossing between cultivated sunflower and its wild relative is known to occur.
The overall goal of this research is to quantify the risks associated with the introduction of this beneficial gene into crop plants.
To achieve this goal, we will use field and greenhouse studies to determine how often and under what conditions the IMI-resistance genes will spread to two wild, related species of sunflower.
Also, in preparation for the possible escape of those genes, we will determine their impact on the weediness, fitness, and competitive abilities of two wild sunflower species.

Corn rootworm management is currently limited to two principle strategies--soil insecticides and crop rotation.
Both strategies are in jeopardy, given corn rootworm adaptation to crop rotation, and health, environment, and food quality concerns over insecticides.
Amid these concerns, Monsanto and Pioneer have announced the development of transgenic corn resistant to corn rootworms.
While offering a convenient solution to these problems, the previous track record of corn rootworms in developing resistance to both insecticide and crop rotation suggests precautionary risk assessment.
Weedy grass hosts for corn rootworms, combined with current weed management strategies, may accelerate resistance development to transgenic corn.
This project investigates the potential for weedy grass hosts to facilitate development of corn rootworm resistance to transgenic corn.
We will conduct a series of greenhouse and field studies to generate basic risk assessment data for this situation.
Specific studies will: 1) evaluate the relative host quality of current and emerging weedy grasses; 2) explore how one weedy host, green foxtail, influences colonization, interplant movement and survival of corn rootworms; and 3) assess how timing of grass removal under different weed management strategies influence corn rootworm survival.
These studies will provide insight into whether weedy grass hosts function as refuges, decoys, or delayed sources of infestation.
These insights, combined with grass, corn rootworm, and corn phenology models, and weed management data, will identify possible risk situations for resistance development by corn rootworms.
9904000 Assessing Risk of Bollworm Adaptation to Bt Crops by Stable Isotope Analysis

It is generally accepted that sustaining the long term effectiveness of insecticidal, transgenic crops requires that a portion of the crop acreage be planted with cultivars that are not insecticidal.
Insects that are susceptible to the plant-produced toxin can survive on the non-toxic plants (i.e. refuges) and will mate with any toxin-resistant insects that survive on the toxin-producing plants.
The offspring from matings of the resistant and susceptible insects will only be partially resistant and will not be able to survive on properly engineered, insecticidal crops.
The resistance genes in these offspring will, therefore, not be passed down to future generations.
This will significantly decrease the rate of pest adaptation to the transgenic crop cultivars.
One major problem with establishing refuges is determining how large a refuge needs to be to produce enough susceptible moths to mate with most of the resistant moths.
This is especially difficult if the insect involved feeds on a number of different crops and wild hosts, because it is hard to determine the percentage of the insects that are produced by the various plant hosts.
We have developed a technique that uses stable isotope analysis of adult Helicoverpa moths to determine the identity of the hosts that they fed on as caterpillars.
Currently our technique can distinguish moths coming from corn and cotton and should also be able to identify those that fed on soybean.
A new technique will be developed that should be able to determine if moths that feed on corn in the Midwest migrate to cotton in the south.
This information will help clarify the size of large scale refuges for these moths and will enable the EPA to set more accurate refuge requirements for Bt crops.

A widely acknowledged risk associated with transgenic crops is that crop-to-wild gene flow could introduce beneficial traits into populations of weedy relatives, perhaps making these weeds more abundant and difficult to control.
Cultivated sunflowers with transgenic resistance to various insect groups (e.g., moths, weevils) have been field-tested by private industry and may soon be considered for deregulation.
Cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) crosses freely with wild sunflower (H. annuus) and crop genes are known to persist in wild populations.
The overall goal of this research is to investigate the extent to which wild sunflower populations are regulated by head-feeding insects.
Because wild sunflower heads are damaged by many of the same insect groups as cultivated sunflowers, it is important to know how release from this damage (due to transgenes) could affect the population dynamics of wild plants.
Wild sunflowers occur as weeds in a variety of natural, semi-natural, and agricultural areas, including fields of wheat, sunflower, corn, soybean, sugar beet, and other crops.
One phase of the research will be a multi-year, multi-state survey to determine the prevalence of damage from head-feeding insects, which can destroy 
A second objective is to carry out seed addition experiments to determine the effects of enhanced seed production (such as might result from one or more Bt transgenes) on local recruitment and dispersal.
Our third objective is to use all available data in a mathematical model to explore the potential consequences of insect resistance on the regional abundance of wild sunflowers.
9903989 Gene Flow from Transgenic Cucurbita pepo into Free-living Populations

Although the recent commercialization of numerous transgenic crops (i.e., crops containing introduced genetic material) has provided many benefits for U.S. agriculture, further study of the potential risks posed by the introduction of engineered traits is needed.
In the U.S., squash (Cucurbita pepo) is presently the only example of a crop in which commercial transgenic cultivars are grown in close proximity to "free-living" (i.e., living in wild habitats and weedy habitats) cross-compatible relatives.
Studies of this crop will answer critical questions regarding the genetic impact of commercial transgenic plants on cross-compatible relatives in wild and weedy environments, thereby forming a risk-assessment model for the release of other transgenic crops where cross-compatible relatives exist close to agricultural production in the U.S.
To characterize the consequences of the movement of transgenes into free-living populations, we will study wild and weedy populations of C. pepo, particularly the consequences of natural hybridization with squash cultivars possessing transgenic viral resistance.
Experiments and data collection under controlled field conditions and in native wild or weedy habitats will allow the determination of: 1) the extent of pathogen pressure (particularly viruses) on free-living C. pepo populations; 2) the natural ability of free-living populations to withstand pathogen (particularly virus) infection; 3) the fate of a virus-resistance transgene introduced into free-living populations; and, 4) the competitive and reproductive success of commercial vs. free-living hybrid genotypes under a weedy agricultural field setting.
Techniques will include viral assays, and the use of DNA genetic markers.
Various gene flow and population fitness experiments will be conducted.
9904002 Field Testing a Hypervirulent Entomopathogenic Fungus

Widely publicized environmental concerns and health risks associated with the use of synthetic chemical insecticides have stimulated efforts to develop biological control agents-- including the very promising entomopathogenic fungi--as alternatives or supplements to these chemicals for control of insect pests on agricultural crops.
Unfortunately, their natural mode of action is usually too slow to compete with chemical insecticides.
To remedy this deficiency, we have enhanced the lethal nature of the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae by increasing production of one of its own insecticidal proteins.
Evidence from an extensive battery of preliminary laboratory studies suggests that the release of this particular modified Metarhizium poses no environmental risks.
However, it provides an excellent opportunity to develop means to assess the safety of fungal biocontrol agents and the reliability of laboratory studies.
We will perform a field trial with the engineered strain that also contains a readily tracked molecular marker--the green flourescent protein gene from jellyfish.
We will develop methods to detect genetically engineered fungi in the environment and evaluate their usefulness in tracking individual fungal strains after release.
We will employ these methods to assess environmental risks, such as the potential for establishment and dispersal of a genetically modified fungal pathogen, and potential displacement of native fungal populations.
We will also determine the potential for gene transfer to indigenous soil organisms.
This research will permit informed risk assessment of transgenic hypervirulence and help to establish the expected performance of a released strain into a natural population.
It should also provide a valuable data base and model for risk assessment predictions of transgenic fungi.
