DOT News Public Affairs Masthead FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, December 14, 1999 Contact: Jeff Nelligan Telephone: 202-366-6312 OIG 22-99 Transportation Inspector General To Review Airline Practices On Overbooking, Access to Lowest Fares Under the Transportation Appropriations Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-69), the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has been given legal authority for fiscal year 2000 to review consumer access to information on airline ticket prices and airline practices of overbooking flights.
The OIG is "to report on the extent to which actual and potential barriers exist to consumer access to comparative price and service information from independent sources on the purchase of air transportation."
For the report, the OIG will be seeking information from the public and the airlines concerning: (1) differences in air fares offered through different ticket outlets, such as airlines, travel agencies or the Internet, and (2) airline disclosure of overbooked flights.
The method to be used for compiling report data is being developed.
A specific form to provide information on these issues will be available to consumers on the OIG web site in January 2000.
The web site address is: http://www.dot.gov/oig .
The OIG is also reviewing the airlines' implementation of their Airline Customer Service Commitments, which take effect Dec. 15.
Each air carrier that provides scheduled passenger air transportation and that is a member of the Air Transport Association has developed individual Customer Service Plans.
The plans include such issues as canceled or delayed flights, on-time baggage delivery, and ticket refunds.
The OIG has been asked to evaluate these plans and the extent to which each air carrier has met all of its commitments under its plan.
An interim report to the Congress is due June 15, 2000 and a final report due by Dec. 31, 2000.
