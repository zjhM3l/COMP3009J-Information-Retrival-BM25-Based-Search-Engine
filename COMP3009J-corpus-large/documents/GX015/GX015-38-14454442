Chapter 9 - Amortization
Overview
Amortization issues are likely to have more examination potential for sports franchises than for most other categories of taxpayers.
There are two reasons for this.
The first is the significance of player contracts to a sports franchise.
Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant asset category of a sports franchise.
Because player contracts are amortized over the useful lives of the individual player contracts, which typically range from 3 to 6 years, this is likely to represent the greatest expense category of the sports franchise.
With respect to player contracts not acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise, issues arise on the tax treatment of player signing bonuses, performance bonuses, and other contract contingencies.
In addition to determining the amount subject to amortization, issues arise in the determination of the useful lives of the individual player contracts and the dates the contracts are placed in service.
The second reason amortization has greater audit potential for most sports franchises than taxpayers in other market segments is the fact that IRC section 197(e)(6) provides that if a franchise is engaged in professional sports, any item acquired in connection with such a franchise is excluded from IRC section 197 amortization.
Because a sports franchise does not have a determinable useful life, the franchise intangible asset is not eligible for amortization under IRC section 197.
Issues exist on whether items treated as separate intangible assets are, instead, part of the franchise intangible asset.
For items determined to be separate from the franchise intangible asset, the question then becomes whether the intangible asset has an ascertainable value and a determinable useful life.
Although the government has not always been successful in arguing that an intangible asset does not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing most separate intangible assets do not have determinable useful lives.
For example, as addressed in this chapter, the government has successfully established in court that broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization because they do not have determinable useful lives.
The following summarizes the likely intangible asset categories of a sports franchise and their general amortization periods:
Intangible Asset Category General Amortization Period Organizational expenses Amortized over 60 months if an IRC section 248 or 709 election is made Player contracts Amortized over the useful lives of the specific player contracts (which average between 3 to 6 years) The franchise No amortization, not an IRC section 197 intangible, has an indefinite useful life Other intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of the sports franchise Not an IRC section 197 intangible, only eligible for amortization if it has: (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) has a determinable useful life; this usually results in not being amortizable Start-up expenses Amortized over 60 months if IRC section 195 is elected Lease and loan costs Amortized over the life of the lease or loan

Player Contracts
Audit Issues
1.
Whether the cost basis of player contracts not acquired in the acquisition of the sports franchise have been properly computed.
2.
Whether the useful lives used for the individual player contracts are proper.
Tax Law Application
A player contract is an intangible asset to the sports franchise.
Player contracts are likely to represent the most significant costs incurred in the operation of a sports franchise.
A player contract is a contract for the services of an athlete employed by the sports franchise.
A player contract is likely to obligate the player to: (1) play the sport solely for the sports franchise, (2) not participate in certain other sports, (3) attend team practices, meetings, and perhaps promotional events, and (4) keep himself in top physical condition.
Player signing bonuses have become common.
Some player contracts may contain performance bonuses.
More than the specified period of the player contract, most player contracts contain renewal and team option provisions which extend the useful life of the contract.
The provisions of IRC section 461 are applied in determining a sports franchise's cost basis for player contract amortization.
Under Treas.
Reg. section 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), a liability is incurred, and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes in the taxable year in which all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.
Under IRC section 461(h)(2)(A), economic performance for services provided to a taxpayer occurs as the services are provided.
The cost of a player contract to a sports franchise is the total amount incurred by the sports franchise on the player contract under IRC section 461.
Signing bonuses are included in the cost of the player contract.
Performance bonuses and other contingent payments are not taken into account until the sports franchise's obligation to pay becomes certain.
While the contractual terms of player contracts vary with the type of sport involved, the typical contract will provide employment for more than one year.
Even when the player contract is just for one year, the employer usually has a unilateral option to renew the contract an additional year or more at a specified percentage of the player's previous salary.
Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer is entitled to deduct unpaid expenses for the taxable year in which all the events have occurred which determine the fact of liability and in which the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy.
Under this general rule, accrued salaries would ordinarily be deductible expenses for the taxable year in which the salaries are earned by the employees, even if paid in the following taxable year.
Any expenditure, however, that results in the acquisition of an asset having a useful life which extends beyond the close of the taxable year may not be deductible for the taxable year in which the liability for the expenditure was incurred.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.263(a)-2.
The cost of a player contract having a useful life of more than a year must be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the contract.
The sports franchise's player contracts are amortized under IRC section 167.
Amortization is computed on each individual player contract based on the useful life of the individual player contract.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.167(a)-1(b) provides the estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which it may reasonably be expected to be useful to the taxpayer.
In general, the period over which the cost of a player contract is amortizable includes periods in which the club controls the player through options to renew the contract or restrictions on the ability of the player to contract with other clubs.
In Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127, the Service ruled that due to reserve clauses, a player contract often has a useful life extending beyond the taxable year in which the contract was acquired.
The Service ruled the same for option clauses or any other clause which gives the sport franchise the opportunity to unilaterally extend the existing contract.
Although the useful life varies from sport to sport and player to player, the sports franchise's player contracts typically have useful lives averaging from 3 to 6 years.
The placed-in-service date of the player's signing bonus is the date all required signatures are affixed to the contract.
Accordingly, a sports franchise begins claiming amortization on the player contract, including the signing bonus, when the necessary signatures are affixed to the player contract.
General guidance on the amortization of the sports franchise's player contracts can be found in:
1.
Rev. Rul. 67-379, 1967-2 C.B. 127,
1.
Rev. Rul. 70-318, 1970-1 C.B. 113, and
2.
Rul. Rul. 71-137, 1971-1 C.B. 104.
In amortizing player contracts, care must be taken to distinguish payments made to third parties to acquire a player contract, as opposed to payments made to a player pursuant to the underlying contract.
Payments made to acquire a player contract are to be amortized over the life of the contract.
Payments made to a player pursuant to the contract may constitute straight salary which is deducted as economic performance occurs.
On the other hand, such payments may constitute disguised payments for other contract rights (for example, options to extend the contract, exclusivity agreements extending beyond the "salary" payment period, etc.).
In such cases, the ostensible salary payments should be divided into two portions; amounts allocable to services and amounts allocable to other contract rights.
Amounts allocated to payments for services should be deducted as economic performance occurs.
Amounts allocated to other contract rights should be amortized over the life of the contract.
Example -- Player Contract Amortization
BCD sports franchise, a calendar year taxpayer, and STAR athlete agree to a player contract for STAR.
The player contract is signed by all parties on July 1, 1994.
The player contract is for 3 years from the signing date and includes 2 renewal periods.
BCD sports franchise has the option to extend STAR's contract to a fourth and fifth year.
Under the contract, STAR can request salary renegotiation at the end of the third year.
If STAR chooses salary renegotiation, and STAR and the BCD sports franchise do not agree on the renegotiated contract terms, then BCD sports franchise has the right to sell or trade STAR's player contract to another sports franchise in the league.
Under the player contract, STAR receives a $200,000 signing bonus.
STAR's base salary (payable monthly) is $150,000 the first year, $120,000 the second year, and $150,000 for the third year, and each season runs from July 1 to June 30.
The base salary for the fourth and fifth years (renewal option years) is $150,000 each year.
The examiner makes a factual determination that $50,000 of the first year's "salary" is actually a disguised payment for the option to extend the contract for the fourth and fifth years.
The contract also provides for both team and player performance bonuses.
In any season in which the sports franchise's team meets a specified team goal, STAR is paid a team performance bonus.
In any season in which the team plays in the league conference championship game, STAR receives a $30,000 team performance bonus.
In any season in which the team wins the league's championship game, STAR is paid an additional team bonus of $50,000.
In any season in which STAR is named to the league's all star team, STAR receives a $20,000 performance bonus.
In any season in which STAR is voted the league's most valuable player, STAR is to receive an additional $50,000 player performance bonus.
In year two, STAR made the league's all star team ($20,000 player performance bonus).
In year three, the sports franchise made it to the league's championship game ($30,000 team performance bonus).
The useful life of the player contract is 5 years (the 3 year contract period plus the two 1-year renewal option years).
Amortization begins on July 1, 1994, the date all parties signed the player contract.
The amortized player contract tax basis does not include performance bonuses since these are contingencies.
Accordingly, the amortized tax basis in the player contract consists of the $200,000 player signing bonus and the $50,000 disguised first year payment for options.
BCD's amortized tax basis in the STAR player contract is computed as follows:
$200,000 Player Signing Bonus $ 50,000 Disguised First Year Payment for Options --------- $250,000 Amount to be Amortized
BCD's yearly amortization on its STAR player contract is:
First Tax Year $ 50,000 Second Tax Year $ 50,000 Third Tax Year $ 50,000 Fourth Tax Year $ 50,000 Fifth Tax Year $ 50,000 Total Amortization $250,000
Additionally, salary amounts are to be deducted as economic performance occurs.
Because ratable amortization is allowed as STAR furnishes the services to the BCD sports franchise, economic performance occurs under the provisions of IRC section 461(h) as the ratable amortization is allowed.
BCD is also entitled to additional deductions for the second year player performance bonus ($20,000) and the third year team performance player bonus ($30,000).
The tax year in which BCD deducts these bonuses is the year in which these are allowed under BCD's overall method of accounting (which is usually the cash method or the accrual method of accounting).
Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports franchise player contract amortization issues include: 1.
For the prior, current, and subsequent tax years: a. the sports franchise's schedules and workpapers reflecting: 1.
the player contracts owned by the sports franchise, 2.
the sports franchise's tax basis in each player contract, and 3.
the useful life used by the sports franchise for each player contract.
b. to the extent not included in "a," copies of the schedules and workpapers used to compute player contract amortization.
This should include any schedules and workpapers necessary to reconcile this with the total player contract amortization amount reflected on return Form 4562.
2.
Depending on the number of player contracts owned by the sports franchise, copies of all or a sampling of the player contracts.
To reduce taxpayer burden and sharpen your examination focus, you may want to address the sports franchise's player contract business practices before deciding which player contract to request.
For sports franchises with a large number of player contracts, you should consider conducting a skewed sampling of player contracts based on their likely issue potential.
For example, consider first focusing on: 1.
the sports franchise's marque player contracts (likely to be higher dollar contract amounts and more likely to have bonuses, options, and contingencies), 2.
player contracts that have certain characteristics (such as bonus provisions, options, or contingencies), and 3.
player contracts with short useful lives.
A common examination technique many examiners use for taxpayers claiming significant amounts of depreciation or amortization is to analyze the taxpayer's prior and subsequent years' depreciation and amortization schedules.
Due to the significance of player contract amortization, this is likely to be a good examination technique for most sport franchise examinations.
Check to ensure the cost basis and useful lives used are consistent from year to year.
Player contracts on the prior or current year's schedule that are omitted from the current or subsequent year's schedule should be reconciled to the sports franchise's player contract gain and loss return schedules.
The following player contract issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for player contracts: 1.
a change from expensing to capitalizing all player contracts or categories of player contracts, and 2.
a change in the sports franchise's method or policies in determining its tax basis in player contracts under IRC section 461.
The IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation procedures (versus the allowed or allowable depreciation rule) apply to player contract change in method of accounting issues.
Because the change is a change in the useful life under IRC section 167 versus a change in recovery period under IRC section 168, a change in the useful lives of individual player contracts is not a change in the method of accounting.
Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation rule applies to player contract useful life changes.

Intangible Assets Acquired in the Acquisition of a Sports Franchise
Audit Issues
1.
Whether in the acquisition of a sports franchise, the allocation of the purchase price among player contracts, the franchise, other intangible assets, and other assets is proper.
This is addressed in Chapter 10.
2.
Whether intangible assets other than player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have an ascertainable value and determinable useful life: A major issue area is broadcasting rights, which the government has successfully argued do not have a determinable useful life.
Tax Law Application
The franchise intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise are specifically excluded from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible.
Accordingly, unlike most other taxpayers, a sports franchise is not entitled to 15 year amortization on the intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of the sports franchise.
This includes goodwill, going concern value, the franchise intangible asset, and other intangible assets such as broadcasting rights.
This means that pre-IRC section 197 law applies in determining whether the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of sports franchises are eligible for amortization.
To be subject to amortization, the sports franchise's intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) a determinable useful life.
IRC section 197(f)(4)(A) uses the definition in IRC section 1253(b)(1) for the definition of a franchise under IRC section 197.
IRC section 1253(b)(1) states "the term 'franchise' includes an agreement which gives one of the parties to the agreement the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or facilities, within a specified area."
IRC section 197(e)(6) excludes from the definition of an IRC section 197 intangible, "A franchise to engage in professional football, basketball, baseball, or other professional sport, and any item acquired in connection with such a franchise."
After stating the above IRC section 197(e)(6) statement, H.R. Rep. No. 103-213, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), 1993-3 C.B. 560, states:
"Consequently, the cost of acquiring a professional sports franchise and related assets (including any goodwill, going concern value, or other section 197 intangibles) is to be allocated among the assets acquired as provided under present law (see, for example, section 1056 of the Code) and is to be taken into account under the provisions of present law."
To be subject to amortization, the intangible asset must have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill and going concern value, and (2) a determinable useful life.
Because the franchise intangible asset acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise has an indefinite useful life, it is not subject to amortization.
Player contracts acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise do have an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset.
Player contracts also have determinable useful lives.
Therefore, the non-IRC section 197 intangible issue centers on whether intangible assets other than the franchise intangible asset and player contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of a sports franchise have: (1) an ascertainable value separate and apart from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, and (2) have a determinable useful life.
This is addressed further by covering the tax treatment given to broadcasting rights.
Broadcasting Rights
One of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of a sports franchise is the right to share in the income from national broadcasting rights along with the other sports franchises in the league.
The national broadcasting contracts are between the commissioner of the respective league, on behalf of the league's sports franchises, and the networks.
A sports franchise in a particular league confers a right to receive a pro rata share of this revenue as long as the sports franchise is a member of the league.
National broadcasting rights acquired with the acquisition of a sports franchise are not subject to amortization under IRC section 197.
Thus, to be depreciable or amortizable as a "wasting asset," intangible property must have (1) an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, and (2) a limited useful life ascertainable with reasonable accuracy.
See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, 507 U.S. 546, 113 S. Ct. 1670 (1993).
The burden of proving that an intangible asset has these characteristics is on the taxpayer.
In Laird v. United States, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014 (1978), one of the issues addressed by the Fifth Circuit was whether amortization was allowable on the national broadcast intangible asset acquired on the taxpayer's acquisition of a National Football League (NFL) sports franchise.
The Commissioner of the NFL had executed a 4-year contract on behalf of the league's sports franchises with the CBS Television Network under which CBS received the right to televise the NFL's games.
The NFL sports franchises ratably shared the revenue generated under the national broadcasting contract.The taxpayer argued the broadcast intangible asset was a wasting asset, and therefore amortizable, because it had a proven value (present value of the guaranteed future income under the contract) and a limited useful life (the 4-year term of the contract).
Although the Court rejected the government's argument that the broadcasting rights did not have an ascertainable value separate from goodwill, going concern value, and the sports franchise intangible asset, it noted the television rights were to continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NFL.
The court adopted the government's "link in a perpetual chain" analogy and stated:
"As the government correctly points out, the rights under the CBS contract were only a 'four year link' in a 'perpetual chain' of television income.
Though the existing contract provided a measure of [the purchaser's] television rights over a particular four year period, nevertheless the rights were to continue indefinitely.
*** Because the rights pursuant to the CBS contract were only a link in a chain of revenue which would continue as long as the Atlanta Club chain holds an NFL franchise, they did not constitute a wasting asset."
The tax court reached the same conclusion, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981).
This case involved the purchase of a National Basketball Association (NBA) sports franchise.
Included among the rights acquired in the purchase was the right to an equal share of all revenues from national broadcasting of NBA games.
In response to the claim that the current broadcasting contract was a wasting asset, the Tax Court held the contract was not amortizable because it merely represented a "link in a continuing chain of national television income" which would continue as long as the sports franchise remained a member of the NBA.
The Sixth Circuit also reached this conclusion in McCarthy v. United States, 807 F.2d 1306 (6th Cir. 1986).
This case involved the purchase of a Major League Baseball (MLB) sports franchise.
Included among the inherent rights acquired in the purchase of the sports franchise was the right to broadcast the sports franchise's games.
The three broadcasting contracts at the time of purchase were: (1) a network contract among the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Commissioner of MLB, (2) a local television broadcasting contract with the sports franchise, and (3) a local radio broadcasting contract with the sports franchise.
In deciding the broadcast intangible assets were not amortizable because they did not have limited useful lives, the Sixth Circuit stated "the current broadcasting contracts likewise are merely links in a perpetual chain of broadcasting revenues" which the sports franchise will have the rights to as long as it remains in the MLB.
Although the government has not yet been successful in arguing that a broadcasting right intangible asset is not separable from goodwill, going concern value, and the franchise intangible asset, the government has been successful in arguing the broadcasting rights acquired on the acquisition of a sports franchise do not have a determinable useful life.
Accordingly, like the franchise intangible asset, broadcasting rights are not subject to amortization.

Organizational Expenditures and Start-Up Expenses
Audit Issues
1.
Whether expenses treated as organizational expenses and start-up expenses are qualifying expenditures under IRC sections 248, 709, and 195.
More specifically, whether expenses directly connected with the acquisition of a sports franchise are improperly amortized under these IRC sections.
2.
Whether organizational expenses and start-up costs are improperly characterized by the sports franchise as current period deductions.
Tax Law Application
IRC section 248 for corporations and IRC section 709 for partnerships prescribe that organizational expenditures be treated as deferred expenses amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months.
Both sections define "organizational expenditures" as any expenditure which: 1.
is incident to the creation of the corporation or partnership, 2.
is chargeable to a capital account, and 3.
is of a character which, if expended incident to the creation of a corporation or partnership having a limited life, would be amortizable over such life.
Costs of issuing stock in a corporation, syndication fees in the case of a partnership, and expenditures connected with the transfer of assets are examples of costs that are not organizational expenditures.
Under IRC section 195, start up costs are defined as any amount paid or incurred in connection with investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business, creating an active trade or business, or any activity engaged in for profit or production of income before the day on which the activity begins, and which, if paid or incurred in connection with the operation of an existing active trade or business, would be allowable as a deduction for the tax year in which it was paid or incurred.
Start up costs are amortizable over a period of not less than 60 months.
Potential Emerging Issue For Start-up Expenses
For a league expansion sports franchise there may be a potential emerging issue of whether amortization of qualifying IRC section 195 start-up expenses begins when: 1.
the sports franchise first solicits ticket subscriptions, 2.
the league awards the sports franchise, or 3.
the sports franchise plays its first league game.
