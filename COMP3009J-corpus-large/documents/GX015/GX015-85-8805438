Five New Airports Participating in "Selectee Checkpoint" Program to Consolidate Screening and Reduce Passenger Delays
Under Secretary of Transportation for Security Adm. James M. Loy today announced additional airports that are participating in the Transportation Security Administration's "Selectee Checkpoint" program.
The program enhances security and convenience by transferring the screening of selectees from aircraft boarding gates to security checkpoints where screening equipment and personnel and law enforcement officers are concentrated.
Checkpoints at these airports have been reconfigured to channel selectees through a special lane.
TSA now will require boarding passes at the checkpoint in 57 airports.
The following airports have or will soon begin requiring boarding passes at the checkpoint:
Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ), Albuquerque, NM (launching on Jan. 7)
Charleston International Airport/AFB (CHS), Charleston, SC (launched Jan. 1)
Myrtle Beach International Airport (MYR), Myrtle Beach, SC (launched Jan. 1)
San Antonio International Airport (SAT), San Antonio, TX (launching on Jan. 10)
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), Seattle, WA (launching on Jan. 7)
At these airports, passengers must now have their boarding passes in hand before they reach the checkpoint.
E-ticket receipts, itineraries and vouchers will no longer provide access through the checkpoints, and boarding passes will no longer be issued at the gates.
Boarding passes may be obtained at ticket counters, through airline computer kiosks, or at skycap curbside stations.
In addition to a boarding pass, passengers must show a valid government issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or passport at the checkpoint.
In keeping with TSA's multi-level security system at all airports, TSA screeners will now choose gates, flights and passengers at random for additional screening at the gates.
