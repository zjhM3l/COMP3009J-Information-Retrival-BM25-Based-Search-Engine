Please join the Congressional Human Rights Caucus at a briefing on the human rights situation of the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq.
The briefing will held Wednesday, November 20, 2002 at 2:00 p.m. in 2200, Rayburn HOB.
Between 3 and 5 million Kurds reside in the mountainous northeast region of Iraq, about one-fifth of the total Iraqi population.
Under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, Kurds have suffered horrendous attacks at the hands of the government.
The regime has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide against the Iraqi Kurdish population to crush any suspicion of insurgency.
In 1987 and 1988, shortly after the ceasefire that ended the Iran-Iraq War, Baghdad released a campaign of ethnic cleansing known as Anfal upon villages and forced the relocation of tens of thousands of Kurds.
The Iraqi air force bombarded villages with poisonous gas and trucked away large numbers of civilians to be summarily executed.
Human Rights Watch estimates that some 4,000 villages were destroyed and possibly as many as 100,000 persons -- many of them women and children -- were killed between February 1987 and September 1988.
In Halabja, a Kurdish town in northern Iraq, the Iraqi military subjected Kurds considered to be a threat to the greatest attack of chemical weapons ever used against a civilian population.
Five thousand people were killed out of a population of 45,000.
In 1991, shortly after the Gulf War, Kurdish rebels rebel against the regime of Saddam, but the uprising failed.
Saddam retaliated by unleashing indiscriminant malice and widespread destruction upon the Kurds, killing thousands and creating two million refugees fleeing into the mountainous regions of Northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey.
The devastating conditions of refugees in the freezing remote mountains prompted President Bush Sr. to order forces to direct immediate relief assistance, and to conduct humanitarian operations in Northern Iraq.
This operation, known as Joint Task Force Provide Comfort, deployed in April 1991.
In addition, the UN established safe havens for Kurds in Northern Iraq, ordering Saddam's forces to remain out of this region.
In the fall of 1996, the Iraqi army violated this order and entered the safe havens, while Saddam ordered the death of all foreign aid workers.
Immediately, U.S. and foreign organizations began pulling out of the region, leaving behind Kurdish employees working for those NGOs.
The Kurdish region will again play a vital role in a war against Iraq, as it could become a base for attacks against Baghdad.
Given their experiences during the Gulf War, Kurds seek pledges of protection in the event of an attack by Saddam's forces and assurances of autonomy in their region under any future government in Iraq.
To discus these important issues, we welcome to the Caucus:
Mike Amitay, Executive Director of the Washington Kurdish Institute
Professor Carole A. O'Leary, Middle East Initiative, The American University Center for Global Peace, Middle East Studies at the School of International Service of the American University
Ambassador Peter Galbraith, former U.S. Ambassador to Croatia and Cabinet Minister, East Timor Transition Government
Bayanne Surdashi, Kurdish refugee from Northern Iraq
We look forward to seeing you at this important briefing.
