Electrodialysis seems to be applicable for treatment of effluents from washing after cyanide galvanization or galvanization with other substances.
For the purpose of establishing a closed system for the effluents discharged during the treatment processes for metallic surfaces, techniques for industrialization of electrodialysis have been developed not only for the recovery of useful components, but also for recycled use of water.
