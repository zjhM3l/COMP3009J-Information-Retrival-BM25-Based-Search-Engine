Chapter 4 - Broadcast Revenue
Industry Practice
Broadcast revenue is one of the single largest revenue generators for a sports franchise.
Generally, national broadcasting contracts are consummated at the league level, with each sports franchise receiving a pro rata share.
Additionally, sports franchises usually negotiate and enter into local broadcasting agreements on an individual basis.
The income generated by local broadcasting agreements is usually not shared with the other sports franchises in the league.
National Broadcasting Contracts
The leagues normally enter into multiple year contracts with various television networks for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played among its sports franchises.
The money received under these contracts is normally divided equally among each sports franchise in the league.
Payments under the league contracts are generally made on a per-season basis; that is, the networks pay a fixed amount for the broadcasting rights for each season covered under the contract.
The payments for each season may be made in installments, often quarterly.
Depending on the sports franchise's tax year period, one or more of the installments may be received in a tax year immediately preceding the year in which the season takes place.
Local Broadcasting Contracts
Individual sports teams usually enter into broadcasting agreements with both local television and radio stations for the sale of broadcasting rights to the games played at the home stadium.
Similar to the national contracts, the local agreements are usually for multiple years.
Additionally, the agreements may include other special programs; for example, a coach's show, pre-game show, post-game show, etc.
The local agreements may also include team sponsorship; for example, an official team station.
Generally, these contracts require a substantial payment upon contract execution, as well as periodic payments (normally annual) through the contract term.
Again, depending on the tax year period, a sports franchise may receive a periodic payment in a tax year preceding the year to which the payment relates.

Audit Issue
It is important to determine whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of broadcast revenue.
More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 because the advance payment is for property rights, rather than for services provided by the sports franchise.
Tax Law
Whether broadcast revenue is received for services or property rights is addressed in this chapter.
The general prepaid income tax law and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, are addressed in Chapter 3.
The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5.
Services or Property Right?
In Pittsburgh Athletic Co. v. KQV Broadcasting Co., 24 F.Supp.
490 (W.D. Pa. 1938), the court addressed the issue of a baseball team's interest in the broadcasting rights to its games.
Employees of a radio station were standing on a hill overlooking the stadium and broadcasting a play-by-play description of the games.
In granting an injunction against the broadcast of the games, the court held:
It is perfectly clear that the exclusive right to broadcast play-by-play descriptions of the home games played by the 'Pirates' at their home field rests in the plaintiffs.
*** That is a property right of the plaintiffs with which defendant is interfering when it broadcasts the play-by-play description of the ball games.
*** The Pittsburgh Athletic Company by reason of its creation of the game, its control of the park, and its restriction of the dissemination of news therefrom, has a property right in such news.
In Uhlaender v. Henrickson, 316 F.Supp.
1277 (D. Minn. 1970), the defendants marketed a baseball table game.
The game employed the names, numbers, and statistics of the players in major league baseball.
The players sued to enjoin the use of their names and statistics for profit.
The court held:
It is this court's view that a celebrity has a legitimate interest in his public personality.
A celebrity must be considered to have invested his years of practice and compensation in a public personality which eventually may reach marketable status.
That identity, embodied in his name, likeness, statistics and other personal characteristics, is the fruit of his labors and is a type of property.
In Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), the Supreme Court considered the interrelationship between a performer's right to publicity of his performance and the First Amendment.
A television station had aired as a news clip the entire performance of a "human cannonball."
The performer sued for compensation for the use of his professional property.
The Court agreed that the First Amendment did not prohibit such a suit and described the plaintiff's interest as follows:
*** the State's interest in permitting a 'right of publicity' is in protecting the proprietary interest of the individual in his act in part to encourage such entertainment.
As we later note, the State's interest is closely analogous to the goals of patent and copyright law.
In Board of Regent of the University of Oklahoma v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, Civil No. 81-1209 (W.D. Okl. 1982), the court considered television contracts entered into by the NCAA for the broadcast of its member schools' football games.
The plaintiffs, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association, claimed that the contracts violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. sections 1 and 2.
In holding the contracts violated antitrust laws, the court held:
The right to telecast college football games is the property of the institutions participating in the games, and that right may be sold or assigned by those institutions to any entity at their discretion.

Tax Law Application
Regardless of whether the payments received by a sports franchise are from a national broadcasting contract or from a local broadcasting contract, the tax treatment is the same.
In the case of a sports franchise, the right to receive the advance broadcast income is fixed for the tax year in which the amounts are received.
Based on the court cases cited above, the payments received under television and radio broadcasting contracts are made not in exchange for services but in exchange for property rights (the sports franchise's proprietary rights in the publicity of its enterprise).
The networks, local television stations, and local radio stations are not paying for services but rather for the right to exploit the sports franchise's property right.
Accordingly, the Rev. Proc. 71-21 provisions that allow the deferral of income from services do not apply to the broadcast revenue of a sports franchise.
Example
Sports franchise ABC receives a pro rata share of the league's national television broadcasting revenue.
The contract entered into by the sports league and the national television broadcaster for the 1994 through 1997 seasons was entered into on April 15, 1993.
The national broadcasting contract provides for quarterly payments of the annual amount, payable the first day of each quarter.
The first payment was to be paid October 1, 1993, with the last payment due July 1, 1997.
The sports franchise received $7.5 million on October 1, 1993 applicable to the 1994 season.
The sports franchise did not include the $7.5 million in gross income on its 1993 tax return.
Instead, the $7.5 million was reflected in the balance sheet as a current liability.
A supporting statement characterized it as deferred revenue.
The sports franchise received $7.5 million on January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994, applicable to the 1994 season.
Additionally, ABC received $10 million on October 1, 1994, applicable to the 1995 season.
On its 1994 tax return, ABC reported $30 million of broadcast revenue (the four $7.5 million payments received on October 1, 1993, January 1, 1994, April 1, 1994, and July 1, 1994).
The $10 million received on October 1, 1994 was treated as deferred revenue.
The sports franchise received $10 million on January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995, applicable to the 1995 season.
Additionally, ABC received $12 million on October 1, 1995, applicable to the 1996 season.
On its 1995 tax return, ABC reported $40 million of broadcast revenue (the four $10 million payments received on October 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, April 1, 1995, and July 1, 1995).
The $12 million received on October 1, 1995, was treated as deferred revenue.
In summary, the sports franchise's tax return deferred broadcast revenue balances attributable to the league's national television broadcast contract as follows:
December 31, 1993 $7.5 million December 31, 1994 $10 million December 31, 1995 $12 million
During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994 calendar year tax return, the examiner determined sports franchise ABC was not entitled to defer the reporting of its broadcast revenue under Rev. Proc. 71-21.
The examiner's report adjustments are as follows:
1994 1995 IRC section 481(a) Adjustment $7,500,000 - IRC section 446 Adjustment $2,500,000 $2,000,000 Total Adjustment $10,000,000 $2,000,000
The IRC section 481(a) adjustment is the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the year of change (1994) of $7.5 million.
The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2.5 million increase in the deferred liability account balance from $7.5 million at the beginning of 1994 to $10 million at the end of 1994.
The 1995 IRC section 446 adjustment is the $2 million increase in the deferred liability balance from $10 million at the beginning of 1995 to $12 million at the end of 1995.
Because the broadcast revenue issue is a change in method of accounting, the examiner also picked up the sports franchise's 1996 tax return to make the IRC section 446 adjustment.
Since the examiner's case was closed unagreed, the examiner prepared a Form 5346, Examination Information Report, for the sports franchise's subsequent tax years which were not yet filed or due to be filed when the examiner closed the case.

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in determining whether you have one or more deferred broadcast revenue issues include: 1.
All agreements, contracts, and other documents with national and local television and radio broadcasting regarding rights to broadcast the sports franchise's games (including special programing) that remain in effect for the tax year under examination.
2.
Workpapers and schedules reflecting the amount of revenue recognized and the amount of deferred revenue at year end for each separate broadcast contract in which advance payments were received.
The precise nature of the broadcast payments can be determined by analyzing the contracts.
Usually, the contracts do not provide for the performance of any particular service.
Instead, the contracts expressly provide for the sale of the rights to broadcast games.
Generally, under the broadcasting contract terms and conditions, the broadcasting contracts are not service contracts within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 71-21.
The primary argument is that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply, because the advance payments are for property rights, not services.
Then, if applicable, an alternative argument that if it is in fact an advance payment for services, then Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the subsequent tax year.
Because the broadcast revenue issue involves the timing of the sports franchise's reporting of broadcast income, it constitutes a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for sponsorship revenue.
Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising this issue.
The IRC section 481(a) adjustment amount is the deferred income balance at the beginning of the first tax year examined.
The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined.
This is illustrated in the example given in this chapter.
