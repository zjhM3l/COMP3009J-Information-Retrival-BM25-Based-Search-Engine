FLORIDA CITRUS View Table Data Most areas of Florida's Citrus Belt received abundant rainfall during September.
During the month, a few groves were actually too wet for growers to work in or drive.
The abundant moisture levels have produced new growth on trees of all ages.
New crop fruit is making very good progress with excellent sizes for the first of October.
However, there are reports of some fruit splitting as a result of the rapid uptake of moisture along with the skin's inability to grow fast enough.
Fresh fruit packers started the 2002-03 season by shipping some Fallglo tangerines.
By the second week of September, Navels, Ambersweet and Hamlin oranges, and grapefruit were being packed and shipped.
The early maturity of the new crop is the result of a sufficient early bloom, plentiful summer rains, and warm tropical temperatures.
Caretakers have been very active cutting cover crops that have made aggressive growth with the help of a lot of rainfall.
Growers have been applying sprays to crops that will be going to the fresh markets.
Fall herbicides and fertilizations are still being applied.
Dead trees are being cut out, pushed, and burned.
Some resets are being planted in the larger groves.
