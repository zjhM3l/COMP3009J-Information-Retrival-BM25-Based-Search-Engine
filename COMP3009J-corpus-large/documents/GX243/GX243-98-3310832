Electronic Product Code To Replace SKUs?
The Uniform Code Council (UCC) and EAN International have set up a not-for-profit organization named AutoID, Inc., that aims to speed the adoption of radio frequency identification technology (RFID) via the adoption of electronic product code (EPC) standards.
The EPC coding system, which can be stored on RFID chips, uniquely identifies products and their manufacturers.
EPC could be the next evolution of the universal product code (UPC); however, whereas UPC identifies SKUs, EPC can identify individual products uniquely, giving a different electronic signature to, for example, every individual bottle of beer to come out of a brewery, reported Line56.com.
A 96-bit numbering system means that EPC can identify, uniquely, every single product now existing, and has the mathematical potential to number all future products as well.
After running field tests the Auto-ID Center, UCC, and EAN are ready to universalize the EPC standard for RFID chips.
According to Michael Di Yeso, EVP and COO of UCC, such a move would have important results.
"RFID technology used in supply chains has information contained on chips.
Were carrying the information within the network as opposed to the chip."
In such a scenario, Di Yeso says, the price of chips themselves could fall to a nickel a unit, down from the $1 and up prices dating from the beginning of the technology.
While obviously excited about these ideas, Di Yeso points out that EPC for RFID has not yet been proven beyond the field test stage.
Private Label Brands Account For 17% of the $729 Billion Grocery Industry
Private label brands have increased market share in nine of the past 10 years and now represent approximately 17% of the $729 billion grocery industry, according to a report from the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), Building Shopper Loyalty With Store Brands.
Consumers see improving quality with private label products and many believe that they are a better overall value than name-brand products.
Nearly 70% of consumers say they place a high importance on store brands when selecting a primary grocery store.
Furthermore, shoppers who are loyal to a stores private label brand are much more loyal to the store.
Eight in 10 of these shoppers visited the store frequently.
Store-loyal shoppers are also less likely to buy another stores own brand.
Among shoppers who were more likely to buy another stores private label, the top reasons include better price, more selection and higher quality.
Traditionally, the heaviest store brand shoppers tend to be from larger and less affluent households, however, more affluent shoppers are now purchasing store brands.
This is especially noticeable among premium store brand shoppers.
Although ethnic shoppers may agree with some of the value propositions of store brands, they are generally less inclined to purchase private label products overall and have yet to demonstrate strong store brand loyalty.
This could be due to a lack of familiarity with the brands, particularly among recent immigrants.
However, according to the study, retailers can find success with ethnic customers by targeting marketing campaigns to reach them.
Lower prices are major driver of store brand sales, but product quality is just as important to consumers.
Therefore, the ways in which store brand products are packaged and marketed can directly affect consumer impressions of the products.
About 46% of all shoppers think the packaging of a store brand makes it appear to be of a lesser quality than the national brand.
Better packaging could attract new users, particularly younger shoppers.
