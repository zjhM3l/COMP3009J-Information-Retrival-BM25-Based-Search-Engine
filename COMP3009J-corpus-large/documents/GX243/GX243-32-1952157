WHY B ECOME A CLEAN MARINA ? Maryland Clean Marinas Underway is a quarterly newsletter published by the Waterway and Greenways Division of the Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service, Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas and recreational boats.
The Initiative is coordinated by DNR in partnership with the marine industry.

"The Clean Marina certification makes a statement about your entire philosophy of doing business.
You will be perceived as a company that treats customers and their property in the same fashion that you treat the environment."
Art Willis, The Sailing Emporium "The type of clientele we have begun to attract has more than paid for what we had to invest to become a clean marina."
Clark Lutz, Coltons Point Marina UNDERW WINTER 2002 Maryland Clean Marinas AY If it sounds too good to be true.
. .
It has come to the attention of the Clean Marina staff that a private consultant is offering to walk marina operators through the Clean Marina certification process.
Please be aware that no outside consulting services are necessary with one exception.
That exception relates to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plans.
If your marina has the capacity to store 660 gallons of petroleum in a single above ground tank, an aggregate of 1,320 gallons above ground or 42,000 below ground, then federal law requires that your marina have an SPCC plan.
The plan must be certified by a professional engineer.
The Clean Marina Initiative has hired the firm of Purdum and Jeschke to certify SPCC plans at no cost to marinas.
To take advantage of this service, you must sign the Clean Marina Pledge and submit a completed copy of the Clean Marina Award Checklist to DNR.
Be wary of any consultant that offers to "get you certified."
A vendor with no connection to DNR simply does not have the depth of knowledge nor the authority to advise marinas with regard to Clean Marina certification.
Clean Marina staff and committee members, on the other hand, are readily available to guide you toward Clean Marina status.
Templates for commonly needed plans have been developed, educational materials for marina staff and customers have been produced, and Clean Marina staff are happy to make informal assessments of how well your marina meets the Clean Marina criteria.
And these services are free! Call the Clean Marina office at 410-260-8770 for more information.
] BMP Spotlight: Handle Solvents Appropriately The "BMP Spotlight" is intended to help marina operators understand what the Clean Marina staff are looking for when visiting a marina.
Items are drawn directly from the Clean Marina Award Checklist and the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook.
The question for this issue is, "Do you handle solvents appropriately?" That is, do you store, use and dispose of hazardous products in a safe and environmentally-responsible manner? Hazardous materials include acetone, solvent-based paints, and paint thinners.
They are considered hazardous because they are ignitable, corrosive, reactive and/or toxic.
The State Fire Marshall's Office has adopted the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards as the state fire code.
In particular, NFPA standard 230 relates to the storage of flammable liquids and standard 30 relates to flammable and combustible liquids.

According to the State Fire Marshall's Office, it is not critical that a facility with a small quantity of hazardous materiala couple small cans and one drum, for instancehave a fire proof container.
Fire Marshalls expect materials to be properly marked and reasonably neat, however.
Marinas with larger quantities should store their flammable liquids in a fire-safe container.
No more than one drum of a particular flammable liquid should be in the work area at one time.
Multiple drums are allright as long as each contains a different chemical.
Additional drums of hazardous products should be kept in a specially designed outbuilding.
Following these storage guidelines will protect marina staff from accidental exposure to dangerous chemicals.
It can also save the marina money.
A fire marshal can cite a facility for breach of the fire code.
Also, in the event of a fire, many insurance companies will not pay claims to a facility that did not meet the fire code.
To determine whether or not your marina is in compliance with the state fire code, call the State Fire Marshall's Office at 800-525-3124 or 410-339-4200.
Tell the person that answers that you want to schedule a "basic fire inspection" and he or she will refer you to the proper regional office.
continued on page 2 1 Clean Marina Workshops The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative will be sponsoring four workshops this winter.
The focus will be on "removing stumbling blocks to Clean Marina certification."
Over the first three years of the program, Clean Marina staff identified several items on the checklist that marina operators frequently lack.
These items include Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans; Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans; emergency response plans; and employee training.
During the workshops, Clean Marina staff will lead attendees through preparation of these various plans.
Staff will also discuss how to structure employee training.
Participants will leave with thorough drafts of each of these plans, materials to help guide employee training, and a clear understanding of what additional work, if any, is needed to meet the Clean Marina criteria.
Tentative dates for the workshops are January 29 and 31 and February 5 and 7.
Look for an invitation in the mail soon! Hazardous Products, continued from page 1 MARINAS WITH FUEL DOCKS MAY BE REQUIRED TO F ANNUAL HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL INVENTORY ILE THE S AILING EMPORIUM AND POINT PATIENCE MARINA ARE CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS ! Marinas with the capacity to store greater than 1,250 gallons of gasoline or diesel must submit a "Tier Two Report" to state and local emergency planning organizations.
This filing requirement is an element of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).
EPCRA was the United States' congressional response to serious chemical incidents that occurred in Bhopal, India and Institute, West Virginia in the two years prior to its enactment in 1986.
The incident in Bhopal resulted in 2,000 immediate fatalities.
While the accident in West Virginia caused no fatalities, the circumstances were similar and aroused concerns.
EPCRA requires each state to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ establish a state emergency response commission (SERC), designate local emergency planning districts, and appoint a local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for each district.
U SE AND To minimize risk and hassles, order only as much product as can be used in a short period of time, e.g., one to two months.
The Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook offers these additional suggestions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cap solvents and paint thinners whenever not in use to minimize air pollution.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use only one cleaning solvent to simplify disposal.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use only the minimal amount of solvent (stripper, thinner, etc.) needed for a given job.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ For small jobs, pour the needed solvent into a small container in order not to contaminate a large amount of solvent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Allow solids to settle from used strippers and thinners so you can reuse solvents.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Store waste solvents and rags in covered, UL-listed or Factory Mutual-approved containers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hire a licensed waste hauler to recycle or dispose of used solvents.
Refer to pages 32, 54 and 58 of the Guidebook for further information about storage and use of hazardous products.
Pages 59-62 summarize "recommended disposal methods" for a variety of wastes typically found at marinas.
] D ISPOSAL Industries are required to provide the government with information about their activities with hazardous and toxic chemicals.
The SERC and the LEPCs use the information in their emergency planning and make it available to the public.
To comply with this regulation, marina operators who exceed the 1,250 gallon threshold simply submit a one-time notification letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and an annual Tier Two reporting form by March 1 of each year.
The reporting form is available from MDE at www.mde.state.md.us/pia/fs_epcra.htm or 410-631-3800.
The completed form should be submitted to MDE, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the local fire department if different from the LEPC.
A list of emergency planning committee chairpersons, arranged by county, is also available from MDE.
Additional information, including frequently asked questions, fact sheets, and guidance are available from the Environmental Protection Agency: www.epa.gov/swercepp/ep-epre.htm.
] With the certifications of The Sailing Emporium in Rock Hall and Point Patience Marina in Solomons, the total number of Clean Marinas has increased to 36.
Two state parks have also recently been certified as Clean Marina Partners, bringing that total to 8.
"We take pride in doing the `right' thing," said Sailing Emporium President Art Willis.
"We want to meet legal requirements and, more importantly, protect the resources that support boating in Maryland."
The Sailing Emporium is a family owned and operated marina in Rock Hall Harbor.
Mary Sue Willis, wife and coowner, has made a personal commitment, which is apparent when walking around the impeccably clean and beautifully landscaped grounds.
Over the years, the inherited, dilapidated remnants of previous ownerships have been replaced with elements of design that are functional, attractive and emphasize a clean Chesapeake Bay.
Most recently a 200Art Willis.

species.
The Sailing Emporium is a working boat yard with 25 employees and is managed to minimize pollution.
Outside contractors are required to clean up all trash, dust and other debris resulting from work.
Point Patience Marina is part of Naval District Washington's Solomons Recreation Complex, a recreation area for U.S. military personnel.
The Navy is entrusted with protecting our nation's interests and this responsibility encompasses issues from national security to water quality.
In order to minimize environmental impacts from this recreational site, Marina Manager John Kenny keeps close tabs on all hazardous products and uses the least toxic options available.
He also maintains 5,000 feet of boom at the ready in the event of a large fuel spill.
Patrons are asked to do their share as well.
For instance, on-water maintenance is prohibited and boaters are advised to follow a series of clean boating tips.
Susquehanna State Park was certified as a Clean Marina Partner in October.
The park's year-round boating facility, Lapidum Boat Ramp, is on the Susquehanna River about three miles north of Havre de Grace.
Visitors to the boat ramp will find educational signs and composting toilets.
The park managers' environmental stewardship efforts are not limited to the shoreline.
For example, they collect plastic and aluminum from campers for recycling, practice "no-till" farming on hay fields, and avoid the use of toxic lawn and garden chemicals.
of The Sailing New Germany State Park in Grantsville Clean Marina was certified as a Partner several weeks later.
New Germany State Park lies within the boundaries of Savage River State Forest.
The park features a 13-acre lake that was created when Poplar Lick Run was dammed for mill operation in the mid-nineteenth century.
Today the lake is open to non-motorized craft, such as canoes, kayaks and rowboats.
To maintain the natural resources of the area, park manager Michael Gregory insists that staff minimize the use of pesticides; recycle used oil, antifreeze, paper, and aluminum; and fuel the park's rescue boat while the boat is on a trailer away from the water.

It will be replaced with a new permit that is similar in most regards.
The one significant change is that marina operators will now be able to treat and discharge oily bilge water as long as the oil and grease concentrations within the discharge are below 15 mg/l.
Properly operating oil-water separators should easily provide this level of treatment.
Marinas that conduct vessel maintenance and/or pressure wash vessels are obligated to have the General Permit for Discharges from Marinas.
To obtain the permit, submit a Notice of Intent (available from MDE) and the required filing fee to the Department of the Environment, Industrial Discharge Division, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, MD 21224.
