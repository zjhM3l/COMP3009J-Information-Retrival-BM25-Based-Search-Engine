Report from the President and Chief Operating Officer President Zeltmann introduced Mr. Thomas Warmath as the Authority's new Vice President and Chief Risk
Officer and welcomed him to the Authority.
President Zeltmann explained that Mr. Warmath would be responsible for establishing a formal Energy Risk Assessment and Control unit that would report directly to the President's Office.
At President Zeltmann's request, Inspector General Johansen then reported on certain security matters.
Mr. Jo hansen reported that the Authority had received certain recommendations from Kroll Associates which are being reviewed by senior management.
Mr. Johansen noted that a security manual is being prepared by staff, and that based on frequent meetings with security officials from other organizations, he believes that the Authority is well positioned on security matters.
President Zeltmann confirmed that the recommendations from Kroll are being studied and analyzed to determine any areas for possible improvement, and he stressed that NYPA security personnel are working in conjunction with the Authority's various Regional Managers at the facilities on this initiative.
At President Zeltmann's request, Mr. Crouch then reported on the overall status of fiscal matters related to the 500-megawatt combined -cycle plant at the Poletti site.
Mr. Crouch reported that the Authority had recently solicited bids for work to be performed but that only two bids had been received and that they were much higher than anticipated.
He also reported that similar high costs are being encountered by other utilities seeking to construct power plants.
Mr. Crouch stated that, consequently, staff is re-examining the submittals.
Responding to questions from Acting Chairman Ciminelli and Trustee McCullough, Messrs. Crouch and Hoff explained that, although bids were solicited by NYPA from over 30 firms and a public notice had been published in the Contract Reporter, only two firms had bid.
Responding to questions from Acting Chairman Ciminel li, Mr. Hoff explained that there is currently limited competition for this type of work and that many construction firms do not want to take on the high costs associated with working in New York City.
Responding to further questions from Acting Chairman Ciminelli, Messrs. Crouch and Hoff confirmed that the increased plant cost that could result from acceptance of either of the high bids is substantial.
President Zeltmann stressed that this is an introductory informational report to the Trustees and that no formal action by the Trustees is requested.
A general discussion of the Authority's plant expenditures to date among the Acting Chairman, Trustees and Messrs. Hiney, Crouch and Hoff followed.
Acting Chairman Ciminelli and Trustee McCullough then requested that a full presentation on potential costs and alternatives be provided at the Trustees' next regular meeting.

SUMMARY "In accordance with Section 1004 of the Public Authorities Law (the `Power Authority Act'), the Trustees are requested to elect Chairman Louis P. Ciminelli of Buffalo, New York as Chairman of the Authority, effective April 30, 2002.
The Trustees are also requested to elect Eugene W. Zeltmann as President and Chief Executive of the Authority, effective the same date, as well as to elect certain other non-statutory officers of the Authority.
BACKGROUN D AND DISCUSSION "In accordance with Article IV, Section 6 (B) of the Authority's By -Laws, Mr. Ciminelli, who became an Authority Trustee in 1995 and who thereafter served as Vice Chairman, became Chairman, effective January 3, 2002, after Trustee Joseph J. Seymour stepped down as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Authority on January 2, 2002.
"Section 1004 of the Power Authority Act provides that the Trustees may select from among their own a Trustee to hold the position of Chairman of the Authority.
Section 1003 of the statute also provides that when a Trustee is selected to serve as the Chairman, he or she is eligible to receive an annual salary to be set by the Trustees of the Authority and which shall not exceed the salary prescribed for the positions listed in paragraph (f) of subdivision one of Section 169 of the Executive Law.
Trustee Ciminelli has advised that he wishes to serve as Chairman without compensation, and that he declines any eligibility for the prescribed salary.
"As a result of Trustee Seymour's resignation as Chief Executive Officer on January 2, 2002, the Authority has been without a senior executive in that position.
In addition, under Article IV, Section 2 of the Authority's By Laws, the Trustees are required each year at their annual meeting to elect certain non-statutory officers of the Authority.
Section 3 of the same Article provides that such non-statutory officers shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual Trustees' meeting or until their successors are elected.
RECOMMENDATION "Based on his substantial knowledge of Authority matters as well as his strong expertise and record of exemplary service to the Authority as a Trustee, Vice Chairman and Chairman, it is recommended that Louis P. Ciminelli be ele cted to fill the vacancy of Chairman created by Trustee Joseph J. Seymour's January 2, 2002 resignation from that office.
"In addition, based on his very solid, professional and competent service as President Officer of the Authority o ver the past four and one half years, it is further recommended under Laws, that the Trustees elect Eugene W. Zeltmann as President and Chief Executive Officer of the non -statutory position vacated by Trustee Seymour's resignation, for a term expiring at the of the Trustees in April 2003, or until his successor is elected.
and Chief Operating Article IV of the By the Authority to fill next annual meeting

Mr. Ciminelli recused himself from that portion of the vote concerning the office of Chairman.
Trustee McCullough then extended the Trustees' co ngratulations to Chairman Ciminelli, President Zeltmann, and Messrs. Blabey, Hiney and Vesce and commended their outstanding work and results achieved during their tenures with the Authority.

April 30, 2002 POWER AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK ANNUAL REPORT OF PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Power Authority of the State of New York ("Authority") is a diversified energy corporation committed to meeting the electrical needs and challenges of New York ("N.Y.")
State by providing lower cost electricity as well as being a leader in conservation, energy efficiency, electro -technologies and small scale renewable energy forms.
A nonprofit, public energy corporation, the Authority does not use tax revenues or State funds or credit.
It finances construction of its projects through bond and note sales to private investors and repays the debt holders with proceeds from operations.
A major achievement for the Authority during 2001 was the completion of installation of ten (10) LM6000 Gas Turbines and balance of plant equipment in New York City, with one (1) additional unit installed in Brentwood, Long Island.
These Power Now! Projects were completed in less than one year, as compared to a two year schedule for a project of that magnitude.
The units were available to provide electricity to New York City and Long Island during the summer of 2001 to help meet the electricity demand as identified by the New York Public Servic e Commission ("PSC") and the New York Independent System Operator ("NYISO").
In 2001, the Authority undertook a major effort to install new energy efficient lighting fixtures and ballasts in State and city facilities, public schools throughout the State, and municipal and local governments in N.Y.
State.
Other Energy Efficiency efforts include the Non-Electric End Use Program and the Electrotechnologies Program in public facilities throughout N.Y.
State employing alternative fueled energy technologies; a Coal Conversion Program for New York City Schools and Buffalo Public Schools to replace obsolete coal boilers with modern boilers using optimized dual- fuel (gas or oil) technology and to replace the existing climate control distribution systems; a program for supplying super-efficient refrigerators for certain Authority Public Housing customers; an Electric Vehicle Program promoting the use of electric vehicles (cars, pick-ups and buses) throughout N.Y.
State; installation of Photovoltaic ("PV") Systems on several facilities throughout N.Y.
State, and installation of fuel cells power plants ("FCPPs") at several locations throughout New York State.
Since their inception at the Authority, Energy Services 
In the course of constructing and operating its facilities, the Authority requires the services of outside firms for accounting, engineering, legal, public relations, surveying, and other work of a consulting, professional or technical nature to supplement its own staff, as well as to furnish varied goods and services, and perform construction work.
Many of these contracts are associated with the construction, maintenance and operation of the Authority's electric generating facilities and transmission lines, and support of the Energy Efficiency Projects noted above.
PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES In compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2879 of the Public Authorities Law, as amended by the laws of 1988, the Authority has established comprehensive guidelines detailing its operative policy and instructions concerning the use, awarding, monitoring, and reporting of procurement contracts.
A copy of the Authority's current Guidelines for Procurement Contracts governing solicitations and evaluation of proposals for procurement contracts is attached hereto.
These Guidelines, approved by the Authority's Trustees, were implemented as of January 1, 1990, and have been amended annually as necessary.
A copy of the Guidelines for Procurement Contracts, effective April 30, 2002 (Exhibit "A-2"), is attached to the Report.
These Guidelines are substantively the same as the version approved last year with some revisions as indicated below.
Exhibit "5A -1"
April 30, 2002
In this year's Guidelines, Section 2, Definitions, Part A, Procurement Contracts, is being amended to read as follows: Procurement Contracts shall not include contracts for differences, contracts for energy, capacity, ancillary services, transmission, distribution or related services in support of the provision of service to Authority customers, financial hedge contracts, including, but not limited to, swaps, calls, puts or swap options and credit rating services.
Also in Section 2, Definitions, Part B, Service Contracts, "investment banking" would be deleted and "financial advisory " would be added to the sentence as follows: Personal Services include, but are not limited to: accounting, architectural, engineering, financial advisory , legal, public relations, planning, ma nagement consulting, surveying, training (when provided on Authority property and/or exclusively for Authority employees), and construction management.
The following would be added to Section 3, Solicitation Requirements , Part I:
In addition, this provis ion shall not apply to contracts for differences, contracts for energy, capacity, ancillary services, transmission, distribution or related services in support of the provision of service to Authority customers, financial hedge contracts, including, but not limited to, swaps, calls, puts or swap options and credit rating services, and shall not include memberships in various industry groups, professional societies, and similar cooperative associations, nor any cooperative projects and procurement activities , conducted or sponsored by such organizations, in which the Authority participates; advertising agreements with radio, television, and print media shall also be excluded.
Certain Procurement Contracts may require: (1) purchase on the spot market; (2) purchases which require a completion time less than the time limits for noticing in the Contract Reporter; or (3) purchases that do not lend themselves to the solicitation for proposal process.
In accordance with paragraph 3(h) of Â§ 2879 of the Public Authorities Law, the Authority declares it to be the policy that such purchases, including, but not limited to: oil or gas purchases on the spot market are exempted from the noticing requirements of Article 4- C of the Economic Development Law subject to the approval of the Vice President of Procurement and Real Estate and the head of the initiating unit.
Where appropriate, generic ads may be included from time to time in the Contract Reporter notifying potential bidders of such opportunities and soliciting qualif ication statements from such firms for consideration by the Authority.
The following would be added to Section 6, Award of Contract, Part A: Extensions of 12 months or less of the term of a contract previously approved by the Trustees shall be approved by authorized designee in accordance with existing Expenditure Authorization Procedures ("EAP's").
The Guidelines describe the Authority's process for soliciting proposals and awarding contracts.
Topics detailed in the Guidelines include solicitation requirements, evaluation criteria, contract award process, contract provisions, change orders, Minority/Women Business Enterprises ("M/WBE") requirements, employment of former officers and reporting requirements.
The Guidelines have been designed to be self-explanatory.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS Major procurement efforts in 2001 included purchase of goods, services and construction work, in support of the Authority's operating projects, and headquarters' facilities, support of the Power Now! Projects, Life Extension Modernization ("LEM") Programs at Niagara and St. Lawrence, the Energy Services and Technology ("EST") Programs (e.g., High Efficiency Lighting Program ("HELP"), the Refrigerator Program for the New York City Housing Authority, the Electric Transportation Program, and Energy Services Program ("ESP")).
Procurement is continuing efforts to optimize use of the Authority's credit card system for small dollar procurements, the SAP

April 30, 2002
procurement and materials management system, as well as supporting the requireme nts of our operating and capital projects, and headquarters operations.
(I) Credit Card Procurement System ("CCPS")
With the implementation of SAP, procurement credit card usage levels have declined.
The decline is largely attributed to the placement of previously non-stock items into the SAP inventory system requiring the issuance of a formal purchase order regardless of dollar value.
At the end of 2001, the number of cardholders was 160.
Cardholders are located in headquarters and the operating facilities.
Monthly credit card use averaged 1000 transactions, with a value of $475,000.

April 30, 2002
(II)
Negotiated Savings Program
The procurement staff at the Authority established a goal of achieving $6,200,000 of additional savings through negotiation of improved pricing and other commercial terms with low recommended bidders and the resolution of back charges and claims with our outside Vendors and Contractors.
In 2001, the estimated value of such savings was $6,600,000, ranging from improved pricing terms for the 500 MW Combined Cycle Plant at Poletti, contracts in support of Energy Efficiency Programs, and Niagara Life Extension Project.
(III) Supplier Diversity Program ("SDP")
In 2001, the Power Authority continued to optimize the utilization of M/WBE providing goods and services in support of the Authority's operations.
As noted in Attachment I, the Authority awarded nearly $12,000,000 for goods and services in 2001 to M/WBE firms.
This included direct and indirect procurements of office supplies, computer equipment, chemicals, consulting services, temporary engineering personnel, and design and construction work.
Our M/WBE goal in 2001 was 6% of the total reportable procurement expenditures.
The actual percentage attained for calendar year 2001 was 6.1%.
The Authority includes subcontracting goals to M/WBE firms in non-construction procurements over $25,000 and construction procurements over $100,000.
This has been and will continue to be a major focus for the Energy Efficiency and Electrotechnologies Programs.
We will, however, continue to pursue other direct and indirect procurement opportunities when and wherever possible, including the upcoming 500 MW Combined Cycle Plant.
The Authority has also focused on increasing banking activities, treasury bill investments, Tax Exempt Commercial Paper Program.
In over $550,000,000 ( in principal) of securities opportunities for M/WBE firms to participate in investment as well as including an M/WBE firm as a co- manager in the 2001, M/WBE investment banking firms purchased and sold transactions for the Authority.
Procurement representatives also worked closely with, and were members of, the National Minority Business Council ("NMBC"), the Association of Minority Enterprises of N.Y.
("AMENY"), the New York/New Jersey Minority Purchasing Council, the Westchester and Long Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the African American Chamber of Commerce for Westchester and Rockland Counties.

ANNUAL REPORT - 2001 PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS The Annual Report includes specific details of procurements of $5,000 or greater, awarded since January 1, 1990 and which were active in 2001.
There were 2224 such contracts with an estimated value exceeding $ $2,242,000,000, which also includes fossil fuel and Corporate Finance expenditures.
Total procurement expenditures in 2001 exceeded $774,000,000.
This included over $182,000,000 for the purchase of fossil fuels, over $295,000,000 for the purchase of major equipment and construction in support of the Power Now! Projects , and approximately $33,000,000 for the purchase of design and furnishing of major equipment for the 500 MW Power Plant at Poletti.
Approximately 62% of the contracts active in 2001 were closed out last year.
As noted in Attachment II, approximately 8% of these contracts were for construction work; over 57% were for the purchase of equipment and commodities; over 11% were for consulting contracts (e.g., engineering, design, specialized analysis); with 19% for other services, such as technician work and contracted personnel; the remaining 5% was for non-procurement contracts such as payments for memberships, co-funding agreements with the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI") and Petroleum Overcharge Restitution ("POCR") grants.
It should also be noted that while approximately 49% of the 2001 non-fuel contracts covered by the Report exceeded $25,000, the total value of those contracts were approximately 99% of the total non-fuel expenditures.
Attachment III indicates that based upon the total value of the contracts included in the Annual Report, approximately 94% of the total dollars expended (including fuels and corporate finance) were for contracts, which were competitively bid.
In terms of the numbers of contracts processed (Attachment IV), approxi mately 68% were competitively bid and 32% were sole source awards.
Major reasons for the sole source awards included the purchase of spare parts and services from original equipment manufacturers, and to procure services on an emergency basis and from pro prietary sources.

Exhibit " 5A -2" April 30,2002 GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS 1.
PURPOSE
The purpose of these Guidelines for Procurement Contracts ("Guidelines"), which comply with the applicable provisions of Article 4-C of the Economic De velopment Law and Â§ 2879 of the Public Authorities Law, is to establish the basis for soliciting and evaluating proposals from individuals and/or firms providing goods and/or services as defined below in section 2.
Consistent with these Guidelines individ ual facilities or headquarters departments may establish specific supplementary guidelines based on their own needs.
2.
A. DEFINITIONS "Procurement Contracts" are all contracts for the acquisition of goods and/or services in the actual or estimated amount of f ive thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more.
Such goods and/or services shall consist of all those necessary to support the Authority's Headquarters Facilities, Operating and Capital Construction Projects, including but not limited to: goods, such as office supplies, major electrical equipment; construction and maintenance work; and services as more fully described in section 2.
B below.
Procurement Contracts shall not include contracts for differences, contracts for energy, capacity, ancillary services, tra nsmission, distribution or related services in support of the provision of service to Authority customers, financial hedge contracts, including, but not limited to: swaps, calls puts or swap options, and credit rating services.
In addition, Procurement Co ntracts shall not include memberships in various industry groups, professional societies, and similar cooperative associations, nor any cooperative projects and procurement activities, conducted or sponsored by such organizations, in which the Authority participates; advertising agreements with radio, television, and print media shall also be excluded.
"Services Contracts" are Procurement Contracts for services of a consulting, professional or technical nature provided by outside consultants/contractors (individuals, partnerships or firms not officers or employees of the Authority) for a fee or other compensation.
Services Contracts are comprised of three specific types: Personal Services, Non-Personal Services, and Construction.
Personal Services include, but are not limited to: accounting, architectural, engineering, financial advisory, legal, public relations, planning, management consulting, surveying, training (when provided on Authority property and/or exclusively for Authority employees), and construction management.

Pursuant to the Public Authorities Law Â§ 2879, the Authority shall, where feasible, make use of the stock item specification forms of New York State manufacturers, producers and/or assemblers for any Procurement Contract for the purchase of goods when preparing a request for proposals, purchase order, price inquiry, technical specifications and the like.
The Headquarters Procurement Group will develop a system for collecting such data and disseminating a listing of such New York State manufacturers for consultation by Authority employees preparing a specification or bill of materials for goods.
Goods may be procured pursuant to Procurement Contracts let by any department, agency, officer, political subdivision or instrumentality of the state or federal government or any city or municipality where the Procurement Division at the Headquarters offices, or the Procurement Departments at the facilities, and the initiating unit determine that a reasonable potential exists for the savings of costs or other benefit to the Authority and have approved the specifications and proposed terms and conditions of such contract.
An RFP will include a scope of work which defines the goods required and/or the services to be performed, the required completion of any "milestone" dates, the Authority's M/WBE Program require ments, if applicable, all other applicable Authority requirements, and any special methods or limitations which the Authority wishes to govern the work.
Telephone solicitation, usually for those procurements valued at $25,000 or less, may be used where time constraints do not permit issuance of an RFP, where issuance of an RFP is otherwise impracticable, or for goods which are catalog items or do not require a detailed bill of materials or specification.
For all Procurement Contracts with a value equal to or greater than $15,000 (except for those contracts noted below) the Authority shall, prior to solicitation of proposals, submit the following information to the Commissioner of Economic Development to be included in a weekly Contract Reporter published by that department (unless such publication would serve no useful purpose): (1) the Authority's name and address; (2) the contract identification number; (3) a brief description of the goods and/or services sought, the location where goods are to be delivered and/or services provided and the contract term; (4) the address where bids or proposals are to be submitted; (5) the date when bids or proposals are due; (6) a description of any eligibility or qualification requirement or preference; (7) a statement as to whether the contract requirements may be fulfilled by a subcontracting, joint venture, or co -production arrangement; (8) any other information deemed useful to potential contractors; (9) the name, address, and telephone number of the person to be contacted for additional information; and (10) a statement as to whether the goods or services sought had, in the immediately preceding three year period, been supplied by a foreign business enterprise.

A minimum of fifteen business days shall be allowed between the publication of such notice by the Commissioner of Economic Development and the due date of the bid or proposal.
This provision shall not apply to Procureme nt Contracts awarded on an emergency basis as described below in section 3.
L; Procurement Contracts being re -bid or re -solicited for substantially the same goods or services, within 45 business days after the date bids or proposals were originally due; Procurement Contracts awarded to not -for-profit providers of human services.

Certain Procurement Contracts may require: (1) purchase on the spot market; (2) purchases which require a completion time less than the time limits for noticing in the Contract Reporter; or (3) purchases that do not lend themselves to the solicitation for proposal process.
In accordance with paragraph 3(h) of Â§ 2879 of the Public Authorities Law, the Authority declares it to be the policy that such purchases, including, but not limited to: oil or gas purchases on the spot market, are exemp ted from the noticing requirements of Article 4- C of the Economic Development Law subject to the approval of the Vice President of Procurement and Real Estate and the head of the initiating unit.
Where appropriate, generic ads may be included from time to time in the Contract Reporter notifying potential bidders of such opportunities and soliciting qualification statements from such firms for consideration by the Authority.
J. Proposals for certain Services Contracts may also be solicited by competitive sea rch, as follows: For contracts where the scope of work cannot be well defined or quantified, or where selection requires evaluation of factors such as breadth and depth of experience in a unique or highly specialized field and suitability as an Authority representative, a "competitive search" shall be conducted to determine which consultants are most qualified, for reasonable compensation terms, to perform the work.
Depending upon market conditions, at least five (5) potential sources should be evaluated.
If there are less than five sources, all sources shall be evaluated.
The Procurement Division shall interface with the initiating unit to gather information from potential sources, which should include a description of the qualifications of the consultant or firm, resumes of key personnel, past experience and proposed billing rates.

The compatibility of equipment, accessories, or spare or replacement parts is the paramount consideratio n. Services are required to extend or complement a prior procurement and it is impracticable or uneconomic to have a source other than the original source continue the work.
A sole supplier's item is needed for trial use or testing, or a proprietary item is sought for which there is only one source.
Other circumstances or work requirements exist that cause only one source to be available to supply the required goods or services.
Award to certified M/WBE firms for purchases not exceeding $5,000, pursuant to section 3.

A Procurement Contract may be awarded without following the solicitation requirements that would ordinarily apply (but using such competitive selection procedures as are practicable under the circumstances ) where emergency conditions exi st, such as: 1.
2.
A threat to the health or safety of the p ublic or Authority employees or workers.
The proper functioning of the Authority's offices or construction or operating projects require adherence to a schedule that does not permit the time for ordinary procurement solicitation.
M.
Whenever an initiating unit determines that a Procurement Contract should be awarded on either a sole source or emergency basis, the head of the unit shall provide to the Procurement Division at Headquarters or Procurement D epartments at the Facilities, a written statement explaining the reasons therefore.

April 30, 2002
4.
EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS A. Evaluation of proposals shall be made by a fair and equitable comparison of all aspects of the proposals against the specifics of the RFP and against each other, including an analytic study of each offer considering: the quality of the goods and/or the competence of the bidder, the technical merit of the proposals, and the price for which the goods and/or services are to be supplied.
In the eve nt that the price submitted by the bidder recommended to be awarded a contract exceeds the cost estimated on the contract requisition at the time of bidding, the initiating department shall prepare an explanation of any reasons why the initial cost estimate was incorrect or should be revised.
This will be reviewed by the Procurement Division at Headquarters and/or Procurement staffs at the Facilities and appropriate management levels for approval as stipulated in the Expenditure Authorization Procedures.
Consideration will be given at that time for: 1) rejecting bids, re -soliciting proposals, and/or possibly modifying the scope of work; or 2) revising the cost estimate, and proceeding with the award of contract; or 3) negotiating with the low bidder(s), as determined by the Vice President - Procurement and Real Estate, to reduce the price quoted.
Factors to be considered in reaching the proper course of action will include, but not be limited to, the effects (both schedule and cost) of a delay to the spe cific capital construction project or outage at an operating facility, the magnitude of the contract, available bidders, the ability to attract additional competition if proposals are re -solicited, and the accuracy of the original cost estimate.
The recommended course of action and the reasons therefore will be fully documented in a memorandum for consideration by the appropriate level of management prior to approval.
C. Important items to be considered in evaluating the goods to be supplied and/or competenc e of the bidder are: previous experience (including applicable experience within New York State and evaluations from other clients to whom the bidder has provided goods and/or services); the abilities and experience of the personnel to be assigned to the A uthority's work; and the ability to provide any needed advanced techniques such as simulation and modeling.
The approach proposed in meeting the exact requirements of the scope of work will be given consideration in evaluating the technical merit of proposals, together with a well -organized task structure, the ability to timely supply the goods and/or perform the proposed services, and the ability to meet M/WBE goals, if any.
The need to purchase the goods from and the need to subcontract performance of services to others will be evaluated as to effect on cost, as well as quality, schedule, and overall performance.
For Services Contracts, the technical merits of the proposals and the experience and capabilities of the bidders will be the primary factors i determining the individual or firm to be awarded the n contract, provided that the price for performing such work is reasonable and competitive.
For Procurement Contracts other than Personal Services (as defined in section 2.
B of these Guidelines), award should usually be made to the bidder which is the lowest priced firm submitting a proposal which meets the commercial and technical requirements of the bid documents.
Award to "other than low bidder" can be made only with the approval of the appropriate management level as stipulated in the Authority's Expenditure Authorization Procedures, and should be based upon such a proposal providing a clear advantage to the Authority over that of the lower-priced proposal.
Such factors justifying an "other than low bidder" award may include, but are not necessarily limited to, improved delivery schedules which will reduce outages, longer warranty periods, improved efficiency over life of equipment use, reduced maintenance costs, financial resources of the bidders, or ability to meet or exceed M/WBE goals.

CONTRACT PROVISIONS Standard forms of contracts currently in use are available from the Procurement Division.
They generally include: purchase order format for standard p rocurements of goods or services; furnish and deliver format for major equipment purchases; Letter Agreements and Agreement formats for consulting work; and contract work orders (for construction work of small magnitude), construction contracts (for major construction work), and furnish, deliver, and install contracts (for specialized major procurements where single responsibility is required for procurement and installation).

St. Lawrence/F.
D. Roosevelt and Niagara Power Projects Â­ Relicensing - Capital Expenditure Authorization Requests and Initial Payment of the St. Lawrence Community Enhancement Fund The President and Chief Executive Officer submitted the following report: SUMMARY "The Trustees are requested to authorize an additional $11.0 million in capital expenditures in 2002 for relicensing the St. Lawrence/F.
D. Roosevelt Power Project (`St. Lawrence').
The anticipated tasks related to the St. Lawrence Project involve: (1) performing eel studies and any additional studies required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (`FERC' ) for the application for a new license including a Draft Environmental Impact St atement ( `DEIS ') for the St. Lawrence Project; (2) consultation with agencies, local governments, and other parties; and (3) third party contractor (`TPC') support for the cooperative environmental review process by FERC and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (`DEC' ), including preparation of the DEIS; and (4) certain initial payments related to the settlement agreements with local governments and the St. Lawrence Aquarium and Ecological Center.
To date, the Trustees have approved $35.4 million for this project, of which approximately $30.8 million has been spent.
The current request would increase the total authorized amount for this project to $46.4 million.
"The Trustees are further requested to authorize: 1) the initial payment of $4 million to the St. Lawrence Local Government Task Force for the Community Enhancement Fund (`Fund') provided for in a settlement agreement executed by the Local Government Task Force and the A uthority on February 22, 2002, and 2) the President and Chief Operating Officer, and any of his designees, to sign any documents or enter into any agreements necessary or desirable to effectuate such payment.
"The Trustees are also requested to approve an additional $6.7 million in capital expenditures for relicensing-related activities this year at the Niagara Power Project.
To date, the Trustees have approved $19.8 million for this effort, of which approximately $15.3 million has been spent.
The current request would increase the total authorized amount for this project to $26.5 million.
BACKGROUND "Section 2879 of the Public Authorities Law and the Authority's Guidelines for Procurement Contracts require Trustees' approval for procurement contracts involving services to be rendered for a period in exc ess of one year.
"The Authority's Expenditure Authorization Procedures require Trustees' approval when a personal services contract exceeds a cumulative change order value of $500,000, or when a non-personal services or equipment purchase contract exceeds a cumulative change order limit of $3,000,000.
"The Authority's existing FERC license for the St. Lawrence Project expires in October 2003.
In accordance with FERC regulations, the Authority's application for a new license was filed by October 2001.
"At their meeting of December 18, 2001, the Trustees approved additional expenditures of $15.6 million for the St. Lawrence relicensing effort to cover expenses through 2002.
The focus in 2002 will be: continued consultation and finalization of settlement agreements with various members of the Cooperative Consultation Process (`CCP ') Team; completing any additional studies identified by FERC; performing eel studies; and processing of the application for a new license, including a DEIS.
"At the ir meeting of December 18, 2001, the Trustees also approved additional expenditures of $14.0 million for the Niagara relicensing effort to cover expenses through 2002.
The Authority's federal license for the Niagara Power Project expires in August 2007.
In accordance with FERC regulations, the Authority's application for a new license must be filed by August 2005.
April 30, 2002
DISCUSSION St. Lawrence Project Relicensing "Relicensing of the Project began in 1992 with the creation of a Hydro Relicensing Task Force ( `Task Force') which included representatives from most of the non-nuclear departments within the Authority.
From 1993 to 1995, the Task Force, led by the Licensing Division, identified potential issues to address during relicensing, conducted studies to collect and compile environmental information, and developed an overall plan for relicensing the St. Lawrence Project.
Additional activities included obtaining data on existing environmental conditions, conducting turbine upgrade studies, reviewing issues related to license compliance, and initiating a public outreach program.
"Some of the significant milestones that have been reached since the Authority began the relicensing process in 1996 include: 1) a Memorandum of Understanding between the Authorit y, FERC and DEC to conduct an integrated environmental review of the Authority's applications for both a new FERC license and a DEC Water Quality Certificate; 2) establishment of the CCP with FERC, resource agencies, local governments, the Mohawks of Akwes asne, non -governmental organizations, and the public; 3) identification of issues to be addressed during relicensing through a public scoping process; 4) completion of necessary studies for issues raised during the scoping process; 5) settlement negotiatio ns with a number of CCP Team members; 6) filing of the Application for a New License (` LA '), including Preliminary Draft Environmental Impact Statement (` PDEIS '); and 7) filing of the Application for a Water Quality Certificate with DEC.
In addition, a conceptual settlement agreement has been achieved with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, and Settlement Agreements have been reached with the local governments and the St. Lawrence Aquarium and Ecological Research Institute.
"Funding has been included to continue support for: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) M eeting with the CCP Team and facilitation support; TPC to continue assisting FERC and DEC in settlement negotiations, meeting attendance, study review, and preparation of the DEIS and assi stance with other licensing activities; services of a Contractor who is managing eel studies and any additional study required by FERC, report preparation and responses to comments, coordination of information being provided to the TPC, and preparation of any amendments to the LA; outside counsel to provide support in relicensing-related matters; and initial payments related to settlement agreements including the Community Enhancement Fund.
"Representatives of the Local Government Task Force and the Authority executed a settlement agreement on February 22, 2002.
As part of this agreement, the Authority agreed to establish the Community Enhancement Fund when it accepts the new license and that the principal amount of the Fund would be $36 million, less the initial payments.
The initial payment of $4 million is to be made within 90 days of the execution of the agreement.
If FERC accepts the Authority's proposal to remove the Town of Lisbon from the Project boundary, an additional $500,000 will be paid t o the Town of Lisbon within 90 days of the acceptance of the license by the Authority.
Annual payments of $2 million will be provided from the Fund to the Beneficiaries for the term of the new license.
The annual $2 million payment is guaranteed for each year of the new license, even if the Fund should be depleted prior to the full term of the license.
The Authority also agreed t o a High Water Flow Adjustment that would be triggered when annual net generation exceeds 7 million- megawatt hours.
Based on h istoric water flows, the adjustment will likely produce at least an additional $10.9 million over the next 50 years.
Under the terms of the agreement, the initial payment of $4 million is due to be paid by May 22, 2002.
Niagara Relicensing "Emphasis in 2002 will be on obtaining approval from the FERC for the Authority's Proposed Alternative Licensing Procedures, designed to enhance public participation, and submission of a notice of intent to relicense the project, as required by the Federal Power Act.
Under the Authority's alternative licensing proposal, the public participation effort will formally commence in late 2002 with the release of a First Stage Consultation Report, which
17
April 30, 2002
is currently under development.
In addition, several baseline environmental studies are being conducted.
The Authority's public outreach effort will continue through 2002 focusing on educating stakeholders about the relicensing process.
Funds have been included to support the efforts of the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to improve some recreational facilities in the Niagara area.
FISCAL INFORMATION "Funds are included in the approved 2002 budget.
It is anticipated that these funds will cover expenses through the end of 2002.
Funds through 2007 wi ll be included in future budget submittals.
Payments will be made from a combination of Niagara bond proceeds and the Authority's Capital Fund.
RECOMMENDATION "The Senior Vice President - Public and Governmental Affairs recommends that the Trustees approve capital expenditures of $11.0 million for the St. Lawrence/F.D.
Roosevelt Power Project and $6.7 million for the Niagara Power Project relicensing efforts in 2002.
"It is further recommended that the Trustees approve the payment of $4 million to the St. Lawrence Local Government Task Force for the Community Enhancement Fund.
"The Executive Vice President Â­ Power Generation, the Executive Vice President, Secretary 
Mr. Osinski presented the highlights of staff's recommendations to the Trustees.
Responding to questions from Trustee McCullough, Mr. Barden explained that certain Authority funds are currently being held in escrow.
Mr. Barden also responded that litigation is possible but is not likely to directly involve the Authority.
Trustee Carey requested that a presentation of any outstanding re-licensing issues be provided at the next regular meeting of the Trustees.
Trustee McCullough expressed agreement and added that a report on security matters should also be provided at that time to the Trustees.
The following resolution, as recommended by the President and Chief Executive Officer, was unanimously adopted.
RESOLVED, That additional capital expenditures are hereby approved in accordance with the Authority's Expenditure Authorization Procedures, as recommended in the foregoing report of the President, in the amounts and for the purposes listed below: Expenditure Authorization Capital Current Request Previous Authorizations TOTAL AMOUNT AUTHORIZED St. Lawrence/FDR Relicensing $11.0 million $35.4 million $46.4 mi llion Niagara Relicensing $ 6.7 million $19.8 million $26.5 million

Charles Poletti 500 MW Combined Cycle Project Â­ Authorization for the President and Chief Executive Officer to Accept the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need and Related Conditions and Other Regulatory Approvals and Permits The President and Chief Executive Officer submit ted the following report:
SUMMARY "The Trustees are requested to authorize the President and Chief Executive Officer to accept (i) the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need ( `Certificate' ) and Conditions for the Combined Cycle Project which is anticipated to be issued by the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment ( `Siting Board ' ) pursuant to Article X of the Public Service Law; and (ii) any other regulatory approvals and permits for the Project.
The Authority will likely be required to accept the Certificate before any construction can begin.
BACKGROUND "The Authority filed an Application for a Certificate for the 500 MW Combined Cycle Project at the Authority's Poletti Station on August 18, 2000, and a Supplement to the Application on January 22, 2001.
The Application was determined to be complete on April 30, 2001.
Public hearings on the Application were held on June 5, 2001 and were followed by pre -hearing issues conferences.
Adjudicatory hearings were held on September 10 and October 11, 2001, on emission rates, merchant plant status and the Market Assessment and Portfolio Strategies computer modeling (commonly known as `MAPS '), with briefs on these issues filed shortly thereafter.
Topic agre ements addressing issues related to construction and operation of the Project were signed by the Authority, the New York State Department of Public Service ( `DPS '), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (`DEC' ) and New York State Department of Health (` DOH ') on October 18, 2001.
"A Recommended Decision from the DPS and the DEC administrative law judges recommending that the Project be approved by the Siting Board was issued on December 17, 2001.
"On January 24, 2002, the Siting Board remanded the proceeding to the Examiners to hold additional adjudicatory hearings on a single issue - the relationship of Particulate Matter sized 2.5 micron and public health.
Such adjudicatory hearings were held on April 3- 5, 2002, and briefs on the PM 2.5 issue were submitted to the Board on April 12, 2002.
"The Authority expects to receive a Certificate on or before April 30, 2002, because pursuant to Public Service Law, Article X, the Siting Board must determine whether or not to issue the Certific ate by that date.
DISCUSSION "The Project consists of a 500 MW combined cycle facility, which will primarily burn natural gas, with low sulfur oil as a back-up fuel.
It will be located on an approximately eight-acre site adjacent to the Authority's Ch arles Poletti Power Project in Astoria, Queens.
The purpose of the Combined Cycle Project is to provide economical, reliable, efficient and environmentally safe electricity to government, institutional, and commercial customers in the New York City metropolitan area.
"As noted, it is anticipated that the Siting Board will issue a Certificate with associated Conditions on or before April 30, 2002.
Following approval of the Compliance Package, which was submitted to the DPS on April 17, 2002, and as authorized by such Certificate, the Authority would proceed with construction of the Project.
The proposed resolution would authorize the President and Chief Executive Officer to determine whether acceptance of the Certificate and any of its Conditions would be in the best interest of the Authority, and if so, to accept the Certificate and any of its Conditions.
20
April 30, 2002
OTHER APPROVALS "Additional regulatory approvals include New York State air and water permits from the DEC; a nationwide permit from the U.S. Army Co rps of Engineers for construction of a new outfall in the East River; and a New York State Department of State determination of consistency with the New York State Coastal Zone Management Plan.
In addition, the Authority will seek various building permits from the City of New York.
With the exception of the permit from the Corps of Engineers, it is expected that the other approvals will be received by the end of April.
The Corps Permit is expected in the near future prior to the time work in the water is scheduled to commence.
FISCAL INFORMATION "The acceptance of the Certificate may have fiscal consequences for the Authority.
Such potential consequences will be considered by t he President and Chief Executive Officer in making his determination to accept the Certificate.
Payment for the construction of the Project will be made from the Authority's capital fund.
RECOMMENDATION "The Senior Vice President - Public and Governmental Affairs recommends that the President and Chief Executive Officer be authorized to accept the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need for the Charles Poletti 500 MW Combined Cycle Power Project and any other approvals for the Project.
"The Executive Vice President Â­ Power Generation, the Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice President Â­ Marketing, Economic Development and Supply Planning, the Vice President Â­ Project Management and I concur in the recommendation."
M r. Suloway presented the highlights of staff's recommendations to the Trustees.
Responding to questions from Trustee McCullough, Mr. Blabey explained the timing within which the Siting Board is anticipated to issue its decision.
Responding to questions fro m Trustees Carey and McCullough, Mr. Blabey explained the scope and significance of the requested authorization and he indicated that acceptance of the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need by the Trustees would not place any obligation on the Authority to move forward with the Project although it is likely that the Certificate itself would expire at some point if construction is not undertaken.
The following resolution, as recommended by the President and Chief Executive Officer, was unanimously adopted.
RESOLVED, That in consideration of and as recommended by the President and Chief Executive Officer in the foregoing report, the Trustees hereby authorize the President and CEO to determine whether acceptance of the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need ("Certificate") and any of its Conditions would be in the best interests of the Authority and to accept: (i) the Certificate, together with any Conditions thereto for the 500 MW Combined Cycle Project, if such Certificate is issued by the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment pursuant to Article X of the Public Service Law; and (ii) the additional regulatory approvals and permits related to the Project as discussed herein.

LIPA Summer 2002 Combustion Turbine Project on Long Island The Deputy Secretary and Deputy General Counsel submitted the following report:
SUMMARY "The Trustees are requested to authorize the conveyance or transfer of real property by the New York Power Authority ( `Authority') to the Long Island Power Authority (` LIPA ').
The sites were acquired by the Authority and are to be used by LIPA for the construction, operation and maintenance of electric generating units to be installed by LIPA for its Summer 2002 Combustion Turbine Project (the ` Project' ) and are located in Bethpage and Glenwood Landing in Nassau County and Port Jefferson in Suffolk County (the `Sites ').
Such conveyance or transfer may include permanent or temporary easements necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of the three generation facilities.
DISCUSSION "At their December 18, 2001 meeting, the Trustees approved the Authority's acquisition of the Sites for use by LIPA in constructing single cycle General Electric LM6000 electric generating units.
The generators are to be installed on a schedule that would have them operational by the summer of 2002.
Because of the need to expedite the real estate acquisition of these sites to support the scheduled in -service dates, LIPA, pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between the Authority and LIPA dated as of September 7, 2001, requested the Authority to (1) acquire the property at Bethpage, Glenwood Landing and Port Jefferson, and (2) convey the Sites to LIPA.
These Sit es have now been acquired by the Authority and construction of the Project has commenced.
"In accord with the terms of the MOU and the March 19, 2002 Access and Purchase Agreement between the Authority and LIPA, the Sites should be transferred to LIPA.
To effect the transfer of the Sites, the Authority and LIPA will enter into a self -executing escrow agreement whereby the latest date for the actual transfer of the Sites will be July 31, 2003.
However, LIPA and the Authority will seek to accomplish the tra nsfer before that date.
"The construction, operation and maintenance of the electric generating units and the acquisition of the Sites were the subject of a SEQRA Environmental Assessment performed by LIPA, as lead agency.
In November, 2001 LIPA determined that the action would not result in significant adverse environmental impacts and issued a Negative Declaration.
The Negative Declaration was published in the Environmental Notice Bulletin on November 28, 2001.
FISCAL INFORMATION "As the payments incurred in connection with the acquisitions of these Sites was advanced by LIPA prior to acquiring the Sites, there is no fiscal impact on the Authority.
RECOMMENDATION "For the foregoing reasons, the Vice President- Project Management, the Vice President -Contracts and Real Estate and the Project Manager recommend that the Trustees approve and adopt the attached resolution authorizing the President and Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, to take all steps necessary and convenient to convey the Sites to LIPA.
"The Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, and the Executive Vice President-Power Generation and I concur in the recommendation."
Mr. Clemente presented the highlights of staff's recommendations to the Trustees.
Responding t o questions from Chairman Ciminelli and Trustee McCullough, Mr. Clemente confirmed that LIPA has advanced the funds required for these transactions and thus there will be no actual cost to NYPA.
22
April 30, 2002
The following resolution, as recommended by the Deputy Secretary and Deputy General Counsel, was unanimously adopted.
