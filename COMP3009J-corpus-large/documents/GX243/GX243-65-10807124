The report is now divided series and will be published in 6-month intervals.
Each volume will be four geographic regions: Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and the
The information contained in these volumes is crucial to our efforts, and those of researchers in other countries, to review different ways of approaching social security challenges that will enable us to adapt our social security systems to the evolving needs of individuals, households, and families.
These efforts are particularly important as each nation faces major demographic changes, especially the increasing number of aged, as well as economic and fiscal issues.
Social Security Programs Throughout the World is the product of a cooperative effort between SSA and the International Social Security Association (ISSA).
Founded in 1927, the ISSA is a nonprofit organization bringing together institutions and administrative bodies from countries throughout the world.
The ISSA deals with all forms of compulsory social protection that by legislation or national practice are an integral part of the countries social security systems.
For the first time, the research and writing has been contracted out to the ISSA.
The ISSA has conducted the research largely through its numerous country-based correspondents, as well as its Social Security Worldwide Database and a myriad of other types of data that must be drawn together to update this report.
Members of the ISSA's Information System and Databases Unit analyzed the information and revised the publication to reflect detailed changes to each social security program.
Social Security Programs Throughout the World is based on information available to the ISSA and SSA with regard to legislation in effect in July 2002, or the last date for which information has been received.

Guide to Reading the Country Summaries This edition of Social Security Programs Throughout the World marks a significant break with previous editions.
It now comprises four separate volumes-- Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and the Americas-- that will be published on a rolling basis between September 2002 and March 2004.
The combined findings of this report highlight the principal features of social security programs throughout the world.
This guide serves as an overview of programs in all four regions.
A few political jurisdictions have been excluded because they have no social security system or have issued no information regarding their social security legislation.
In this volume on Asia and the Pacific, the data reported are based on laws and regulations in force at the beginning of July 2002 or on the last date for which information has been received.1 Information for each country on types of social security programs, types of mandatory systems for retirement income, contribution rates, and demographic and other statistics related to social security is shown in Tables 1Â­4 beginning on page 16.
The country summaries show each system's major features.
Separate programs in the public sector and specialized funds for such groups as agricultural workers, collective farmers, or the self-employed have not been described in any detail.
Benefit arrangements of private employers or individuals are not described in any detail, even though such arrangements may be mandatory in some countries or available as alternatives to statutory programs.
The country summaries also do not refer to international social security agreements that may be in force between two or more countries.
Those agreements may modify coverage, contributions, and benefit provisions of national laws summarized in the country write-ups.
Since the summary format requires brevity, technical terms have been developed that are concise as well as comparable and are applied to all programs.
The terminology may therefore differ from national concepts or usage.
survey conducted by the International Social Security Association (ISSA) under the sponsorship of the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA).
This information was supplemented by data collected from the ISSA's Developments and Trends Annual Survey.
Empirical data were also provided by numerous social security officials throughout the world.
(For a listing of countries and jurisdictions, see page 2.)
Important sources of published information include the ISSA Documentation Center; the legislative database of the International Labour Office; and official publications, periodicals, and selected documents received from social security institutions.
Information was also received from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
During the compilation process, international analysts at both SSA and the ISSA examined the material for factual errors, ambiguous statements, and contradictions in material from different sources.
Types of Programs The term social security in this report refers to programs established by statute that insure individuals against interruption or loss of earning power and for certain special expenditures arising from marriage, birth, or death.
This definition also includes allowances to families for the support of children.
Protection of the insured person and dependents usually is extended through cash payments to replace at least a portion of the income lost as the result of old age, disability, or death; sickness and maternity; work injury; unemployment; or through services, primarily hospitalization, medical care, and rehabilitation.
Measures providing cash benefits to replace lost income are usually referred to as income maintenance programs; measures that finance or provide direct services are referred to as benefits in kind.
Three broad approaches to coverage provide cash benefits under income-maintenance programs; namely, employment-related, universal, and means-tested systems.
Under both the employment-related and the universal approaches, the insured, dependents, and survivors can claim benefits as a matter of right.
Under means-tested approaches, benefits are based on a comparison of a person's income or resources against a standard measure.
Some countries also provide other types of coverage.
Sources of Information Most of the information in this report was collated from the Social Security Programs Throughout the World
The names of the countries in this report are those used by the U.S. Department of State.
The term country has been used throughout the volume even though in some instances the term jurisdiction may be more appropriate.

Employment-Related Employment-related systems, commonly referred to as social insurance systems, generally base eligibility for pensions and other periodic payments on length of employment or self-employment or, in the case of family allowances and work injuries, on the existence of the employment relationship itself.
The amount of pensions (long-term payments, primarily) and of other periodic (short-term) payments in the event of unemployment, sickness, maternity, or work injury is usually related to the level of earnings before any of these contingencies caused earnings to cease.
Such programs are financed entirely or largely from contributions (usually a percentage of earnings) made by employers, workers, or both and are in most instances compulsory for defined categories of workers and their employers.
The creation of notional defined contributions (NDC) is a relatively new method of calculating benefits.
NDC schemes are a variant of contributory social insurance that seek to tie benefit entitlements more closely to contributions.
A hypothetical account is created for each insured person that is made up of all contributions during his or her working life and, in some cases, credit for unpaid activity such as caregiving.
A pension is calculated by dividing that amount by the average life expectancy at the time of retirement and indexing it to various economic factors.
When benefits are due, the individual's notional account balance is converted into a periodic pension payment.
Some social insurance systems permit voluntary affiliation of workers, especially the self-employed.
In some instances, the government subsidizes such programs to encourage voluntary participation.
The government is, pro forma, the ultimate guarantor of many benefits.
In many countries, the national government participates in the financing of employmentrelated as well as other social security programs.
The government may contribute through an appropriation from general revenues based on a percentage of total wages paid to insured workers, finance part or all of the cost of a program, or pay a subsidy to make up any deficit of an insurance fund.
In some cases, the government pays the contributions for low-paid workers.
These arrangements are separate from obligations the government may have as an employer under systems that cover government employees.
Social security contributions and other earmarked income are kept in a dedicated fund and are shown as a separate item in government accounts.
(For further details on the government's role in financing social security, see Source of Funds under Old Age, Disability, and Survivors.)
Universal Universal, or demogrant, programs provide flat-rate cash benefits to residents or citizens, without consideration of income, employment, or means.
Typically financed from general revenues, these benefits may apply to all persons with sufficient residency.
Universal programs may

include old-age pensions for persons over a certain age; pensions for disabled workers, widow(er)s, and orphans; and family allowances.
Most social security systems incorporating a universal program also have a second-tier earnings-related program.
Some universal programs, although receiving substantial support from income taxes, are also financed in part by contributions from workers and employers.
Contributions are assigned to an employee's individual account.
The employee must pay administrative fees for the management of the private account and usually purchase a separate policy for disability and survivors insurance.
Provident Funds.
These funds, which exist primarily in
Means-Tested Means-tested programs establish eligibility for benefits by measuring individual or family resources against a calculated standard usually based on subsistence needs.
Benefits are limited to applicants who satisfy a means test.
The size and type of benefits awarded are determined in each case by administrative decision within the framework of the law.
The specific character of means, needs, or income tests, as well as the weight given to family resources, differ considerably from country to country.
Such programs, commonly referred to as social pensions or equalization payments, traditionally are financed primarily from general revenues.
Means-tested systems constitute the sole or principal form of social security in only a few jurisdictions.
In other jurisdictions, contributory programs operate in tandem with income-related benefits.
In such instances, means- or income-tested programs may be administered by social insurance agencies.
Means-tested programs apply to persons who are not in covered employment or whose benefits under employment-related programs, together with other individual or family resources, are inadequate to meet subsistence or special needs.
Although means-tested programs can be administered at the national level, they are usually administered locally.
In this report, when national means-tested programs supplement an employment-related benefit, the existence of a means-tested program is generally noted, but no details concerning it are given.
When a means-tested program represents the only or principal form of social security, however, further details are provided.
developing countries, are essentially compulsory savings programs in which regular contributions withheld from employees' wages are enhanced, and often matched, by employers' contributions.
The contributions are set aside and invested for each employee in a single, publicly managed fund for later repayment to the worker when defined contingencies occur.
Typically, benefits are paid out in the form of a lump sum with accrued interest, although in certain circumstances drawdown provisions enable partial access to savings prior to retirement or other defined contingencies.
On retirement, some provident funds also permit beneficiaries to purchase an annuity or opt for a pension.
Some provident funds provide pensions for survivors.
Employer-Liability Systems.
Under these systems,
workers are usually protected through labor codes that require employers, when liable, to provide specified payments or services directly to their employees.
Specified payments or services can include the payment of lump-sum gratuities to the aged or disabled; the provision of medical care, paid sick leave, or both; the payment of maternity benefits or family allowances; the provision of temporary or long-term cash benefits and medical care in the case of a work injury; or the payment of severance indemnities in the case of dismissal.
Employer-liability systems do not involve any direct pooling of risk, since the liability for payment is placed directly on each employer.
Employers may insure themselves against liability, and in some jurisdictions such insurance is compulsory.
Format of Country Summaries Each country summary discusses five types of programs: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Old age, disability, and survivors; Sickness and maternity; Work injury; Unemployment; and Family allowances.
Other Types of Programs Three other types of programs are mandatory private insurance, publicly operated provident funds, and employer-liability systems.
Mandatory Private Insurance.
This type of coverage may have been introduced to substitute for, or to complement, social insurance systems that are mainly pay-asyou-go (PAYG).
Private insurance is funded either through mandatory employee contributions or a combination of mandatory employee and employer contributions.
Old Age, Disability, and Survivors Benefits under old age, disability, and survivor programs usually cover long-term risks, as distinct from short-term risks such as temporary incapacity resulting from sickness and maternity, work injury or unemployment.
The benefits are normally pensions payable for life or for a considerable number of years.
Such benefits are
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 3
usually provided as part of a single system with common financing and administration as well as interrelated qualifying conditions and benefit formulas.
The laws summarized under Old Age, Disability, and Survivors focus first on benefits providing pensions or lump-sum payments to compensate for loss of income resulting from old age or permanent retirement.
Such benefits are usually payable after attaining a specified statutory age.
Some countries require complete or substantial retirement in order to become eligible for a pension; other countries pay a retirement pension at a certain age regardless of whether workers retire or not.
The second type of long-term risk for which pensions are provided is disability (referred to in some countries as invalidity).
Disability may be generally defined as longterm and more or less total work impairment resulting from a nonoccupational injury or disease.
(Disability caused by a work injury or occupational disease is usually compensated under a separate program; see Work Injury, below.)
The third type of pension is payable to dependents of insured workers or pensioners who die.
(Pensions for survivors of workers injured while working are usually provided under a separate Work Injury program.)
Coverage.
The extent of social security coverage in any given country is determined by a number of diverse factors, including the kind of system, sometimes the age of the system, and the degree of economic development.
A program may provide coverage for the entire country or some portion of the workforce.
In principle, universal (or demogrant) systems cover the entire population for the contingencies of old age, disability, and survivorship.
A person may have to meet certain conditions, such as long-term residence or citizenship.
Many countries exclude aliens from benefits unless there is a reciprocal agreement with the country of which they are nationals.
The extent of employment-related benefits is usually determined by the age of the system.
Historically, social security coverage was provided first to government employees and members of the armed forces, then to workers in industry and commerce, and eventually extended to the vast majority of wage earners and salaried employees through a general system.
As a result, public employees (including military personnel and civil servants), teachers, and employees of public utilities, corporations, or monopolies are still covered by occupation-specific separate systems in many countries.
In many countries, special occupational systems have been set up for certain private-sector employees, such as miners, railway workers, and seamen.
Qualifying conditions and benefits are often more liberal than under the general system.
The risk involved in an occupation,
its strategic importance for economic growth, and the economic and political strength of trade unions may have had a role in shaping the type and size of benefits offered by the particular program.
Groups that might be considered difficult to administer--family workers, domestics, day workers, agricultural workers, and the self-employed--were often initially excluded from coverage.
The trend has been to extend coverage to these groups under separate funds or to bring them gradually under the general system.
In some countries, noncovered workers become eligible for the right to an eventual pension if they make voluntary contributions at a specified level.
Some systems also provide voluntary coverage for women who leave the labor force temporarily to have children or to raise a family, or for self-employed persons not covered by a mandatory program.
Some developed countries with younger programs have constructed a unified national program, thus largely bypassing the need for developing separate industrial or agricultural funds.
Most developing countries have extended coverage gradually.
Their first step toward creating a social security system has commonly been to cover wage and salary workers against loss of income due to old age and, less commonly, disability.
In a number of developing countries, particularly in those that were once British colonies, this initial step has come via the institutional form of provident funds.
Most provident funds provide coverage for wage and salary workers in the government and private sector.
A few funds have exclusions based on the worker 's earnings or the size of the firm.
Funds that exclude employees with earnings above a certain level from compulsory coverage may in some cases give them the option to affiliate or continue to participate voluntarily.
Source of Funds.
The financing of benefits for old-age,
disability, and survivor programs can come from three possible sources: Â· A percentage of covered wages or salaries paid by the worker, Â· A percentage of covered payroll paid by the employer, and Â· A government contribution.
Almost all pension programs under social insurance (as distinct from provident funds or universal and demogrant systems) are financed at least in part by employer and employee contributions.
Many derive their funds from all three sources.
Contributions are determined by applying a percentage to salaries or wages up to a certain maximum.
In many cases the employer pays a larger share.
The government's contribution may be derived from general revenues or, less commonly, from special earmarked or excise taxes (for example, a tax on tobacco,
4 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
gasoline, or alcoholic beverages).
Government contributions may be used in different ways to defray a portion of all expenditures (such as the cost of administration), to make up deficits, or even to finance the total cost of a program.
Subsidies may be provided as a lump sum or an amount to make up the difference between employer/ employee contributions and the total cost of the system.
A number of countries reduce or, in some cases, eliminate contributions for the lowest-paid wage earners, financing their benefits entirely from general revenues or by the employer 's contribution.
The contribution rate apportioned between the sources of financing may be identical or progressive, increasing with the size of the wage or changing according to wage class.
Where universal and earnings-related systems exist side by side, and the universal benefit is not financed entirely by the government, separate rates may exist for each program.
In other instances, flat-rate weekly contributions may finance basic pension programs.
These amounts are uniform for all workers of the same age and sex, regardless of earnings level.
However, the self-employed may have to contribute at a higher rate than wage and salary workers, thereby making up for the employer 's share.
For administrative purposes, a number of countries assess a single overall social security contribution covering several contingencies.
Benefits for sickness, work injury, unemployment, and family allowances as well as pensions may be financed from this single contribution.
General revenue financing is the sole source of income in some universal systems.
The contribution of the resident or citizen may be a percentage of taxable income under a national tax program.
General revenues finance all or part of the means-tested supplementary benefits in many countries.
Contribution rates, as a rule, are applied to wages or salaries only up to a statutory ceiling.
A portion of the wage of highly paid workers will escape taxation but will also not count in determining the benefit.
In a few cases, an earnings ceiling applies for the determination of benefits but not for contribution purposes.
In some countries, contribution rates are applied not to actual earnings but to a fixed amount that is set for all earnings falling within a specified range or wage class.
Qualifying Conditions.
Qualifying to receive an old-age benefit is usually conditional on two requirements: attainment of a specified age and completion of a specified period of contributions or covered employment.
Another common requirement is total or substantial withdrawal from the labor force.
In some instances, eligibility is determined by resident status or citizenship.
Old-age benefits generally become payable between ages 60 and 65.
In some countries, length-of-service
benefits are payable at any age after a certain period of employment, most commonly between 30 and 40 years.
Reflecting public pressure to lower the age limits, a major policy issue in the 1970s and 1980s was the age at which retirement benefits first become payable.
More recently, several countries have increased the age limit for entitlement, due, in part, to budgetary constraints.
Many programs require the same pensionable age for women as for men.
Others permit women to draw a full pension at an earlier age, even though women generally have a longer life expectancy.
Although the norm has been for the differential to be about 5 years, there is now an emerging international trend toward equalizing the statutory retirement age.
Many programs offer optional retirement before the statutory retirement age is reached.
A reduced pension, in some instances, may be claimed up to 5 years before the statutory retirement age.
Some countries pay a full pension before the regular retirement age if the applicant meets one or more of the following conditions: work in an especially arduous, unhealthy, or hazardous occupation (for example, underground mining); involuntary unemployment for a period near retirement age; physical or mental exhaustion (as distinct from disability) near retirement age; or, occasionally, an especially long period of coverage.
Some programs award old-age pensions to workers who are older than the statutory retirement age but who cannot satisfy the regular length-of-coverage requirement.
Other programs provide increments to workers who have continued in employment beyond the normal retirement age.
Universal old-age pension systems usually do not require a minimum period of covered employment or contributions.
However, most prescribe a minimum period of prior residence.
Some old-age pension systems credit periods during which persons, for reasons beyond their control, were not in covered employment.
Credits can be awarded for reasons such as disability, involuntary unemployment, military service, education, child rearing, or training.
Other systems disregard these periods and may proportionately reduce benefits for each year below the required minimum.
Persons with only a few years of coverage may receive a refund of contributions or a settlement in which a proportion of the full benefit or earnings is paid for each year of contribution.
The majority of old-age pensions financed through social insurance systems require total or substantial withdrawal from covered employment.
Under a retirement test, the benefit may be withheld or reduced for those who continue working, depending on the amount of earnings or, less often, the number of hours worked.
Universal systems usually do not require retirement from
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 5
work for receipt of a pension.
Provident funds pay the benefit only when the worker leaves covered employment or emigrates.
Some countries provide a number of exemptions that act to eliminate the retirement condition for specified categories of pensioners.
For instance, the retirement test may be eliminated for workers who reached a specified age above the minimum pensionable age or for pensioners with long working careers in covered employment.
Occupations with manpower shortages may also be exempted from the retirement test.
The principal requirements for receiving a disability benefit are loss of productive capacity after completing a minimum period of work or having met the minimum contribution requirements.
Many programs grant the full disability benefit for a two-thirds loss of working capacity in the worker 's customary occupation, but this requirement may vary from one-third to 100 percent.
The qualifying period for a disability benefit is usually shorter than for an old-age benefit.
Periods of 3 to 5 years of contributions or covered employment are most common.
A few countries provide disability benefits in the form of an unlimited extension of ordinary cash sickness benefits.
Entitlement to disability benefits may have age limitations.
The lower limit in most systems is in the teens, but it may be related to the lowest age for social insurance or employment or to the maximum age for a family allowance benefit.
The upper age limit is frequently the statutory retirement age, when disability benefits may be converted to old-age benefits.
For survivors to be eligible for benefits, most programs require that the deceased worker was a pensioner, completed a minimum period of covered employment, or satisfied the minimum contribution conditions.
The qualifying contribution period is often the same as that for the disability benefit.
The surviving spouse and orphans may also have to meet certain conditions, such as age requirements.
Old-Age Benefits.
The old-age benefit in most countries is a wage-related, periodic payment.
However, some countries pay a universal fixed amount that bears no relationship to any prior earnings; others supplement their universal pension with an earnings-related pension.
Provident fund systems make a lump-sum payment, usually a refund of employer and employee contributions plus accrued interest.
In programs that have mandatory individual accounts, options for retirement include purchasing an annuity, making withdrawals from an account regulated to guarantee income for an expected lifespan (programmed withdrawals), or a combination of the two (deferred annuity).
Benefits that are related to income are almost always based on average earnings.
Some countries compute the average from gross earnings, including various fringe benefits; other countries compute the average from net earnings.
Alternatively, some countries have opted to use wage classes rather than actual earnings.
The wage classes may be based on occupations or, for administrative convenience, on earnings arranged by size using the midpoint in each step to compute the benefit.
Several methods are used to compensate for averages that may be reduced by low earnings early in a worker 's career or by periods without any credited earnings due, for example, to unemployment or military service, and for the effects of price and wage increases due to inflation.
One method is to exclude from consideration a number of periods with the lowest (including zero) earnings.
In many systems the period over which earnings are averaged may be shortened to the last few years of coverage, or the average may be based on years when the worker had his or her highest earnings.
Other systems revalue past earnings by applying an index that usually reflects changes in national average wages or the cost of living.
Some assign hypothetical wages before a certain date.
Alternatively, others have developed mechanisms for automatic adjustment of workers' wage records based on wage or price changes.
A variety of formulas are used in determining the benefit amount.
Instead of a statutory minimum, some systems pay a percentage of average earnings--for instance, 35 percent or 50 percent--that is unchanged by length of coverage once the qualifying period is met.
A more common practice is to provide a basic rate--for example, 30 percent of average earnings--plus an increment of 1 percent or 2 percent of earnings either for each year of coverage or for each year in excess of a minimum number of years.
Several countries have a weighted benefit formula that returns a larger percentage of earnings to lower-paid workers than to higher-paid workers.
Most systems limit the size of the benefit.
Many do so by establishing a ceiling on the earnings taken into account in the computation.
Others establish a maximum cash amount or a maximum percentage of average earnings set, for example, at 80 percent.
Some systems combine these and other, similar methods.
Most systems supplement the benefit for a wife or child.
The wife's supplement may be 50 percent or more of the basic benefit, although in some countries the supplement is payable only for a wife who has reached a specified age, has children in her care, or is disabled.
It may also be payable for a dependent husband.
Minimum benefits are intended to maintain a minimum standard of living in many countries, although that objec-
6 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
tive is not always achieved.
A maximum that reduces the effect large families have on benefits is commonly used to limit total benefits, including those of survivors, in the interest of the financial stability of the program.
In some countries, benefits are automatically adjusted to reflect price or wage changes.
In other countries, the process is semiautomatic--the adequacy of pensions is reviewed periodically by an advisory board or other administrative body that recommends a benefit adjustment to the government, usually requiring legislative approval.
Disability Benefit.
Under most programs, provisions for disability benefits for persons who are permanently disabled as the result of nonoccupational causes are very similar to those for the aged.
The same basic formula usually applies for total disability as for old age--a cash amount usually expressed as a percentage of average earnings.
Increments and dependents' supplements are generally identical under the total disability and old-age programs.
For the totally disabled, a constant-attendance supplement, usually 50 percent of the benefit, may be paid to those who need help on a daily basis.
Partial disability benefits, if payable, are usually reduced, according to a fixed scale.
The system may also provide rehabilitation and training.
Some countries provide higher benefits for workers in arduous or dangerous employment.
Survivor Benefit.
Most systems provide periodic
children's allowances.
Many countries fix a somewhat higher age limit for orphans attending school or undergoing an apprenticeship or for those who are incapacitated.
The age limit is usually removed for disabled orphans as long as their incapacity continues.
Most survivor programs distinguish between half orphans (who have lost one parent) and full orphans (who have lost both parents), with the latter receiving benefits that are 50 percent to 100 percent larger than those for half orphans.
Special payments are also made to orphans under the family allowance programs of some countries.
Benefits are payable under a number of programs to widowers of insured workers or pensioners.
A widower usually must have been financially dependent on his wife and either disabled or old enough to receive an old-age benefit at her death.
A widower 's benefit is usually computed in the same way as a widow's benefit.
Many systems also pay benefits to other surviving close relatives, such as parents and grandparents, but only in the absence of qualifying widows, widowers, or children.
The maximum total benefit to be divided among survivors is usually between 80 percent and 100 percent of the benefit of the deceased.
Administrative Organization.
Responsibility for administration generally rests with semiautonomous institutions or funds.
These agencies are usually subject to general supervision by a ministry or government department but otherwise are largely self-governing, headed by a tripartite board that includes representatives of workers, employers, and the government.
Some boards are bipartite with representatives of workers and employers only or of workers and the government.
Where coverage is organized separately for different occupations, or for wage earners and salaried employees or self-employed workers, each program usually has a separate institution or fund.
In a few cases, the administration of benefits is placed directly in the hands of a government ministry or department.
benefits for survivors of covered persons or pensioners, although some pay only lump-sum benefits.
Survivor benefits are generally a percentage of either the benefit paid to the deceased at death or the benefit to which the insured would have been entitled if he or she had attained pensionable age or become disabled at that time.
Survivor benefits are paid to some categories of widows under nearly all programs.
The amount of a widow's benefit usually ranges from 50 percent to 75 percent of the deceased worker 's benefit or, in some cases, 100 percent.
In some countries, lifetime benefits are payable to every widow whose husband fulfills the necessary qualifying period.
More commonly, the provision of widows' benefits is confined to widows who are caring for young children, are above a specified age, or are disabled.
Lifetime benefits are ordinarily payable to aged and disabled widows.
Those awarded to younger mothers, however, are usually terminated when all children have passed a certain age, unless the widow has reached a specified age or is disabled.
Most widows' benefits also terminate on remarriage, although a final lump-sum grant may be payable under this circumstance.
Special provisions govern the rights of the divorced.
Age limits for orphan's benefits are in many cases the same as for
Sickness and Maternity Sickness benefit programs are generally of two types: cash sickness benefits, which are paid when short-term illnesses prevent work, and health care benefits, which are provided in the form of medical, hospital, and pharmaceutical benefits.
Some countries maintain a separate program for cash maternity benefits, which are paid to working mothers before and after childbirth.
In most countries, however, maternity benefits are administered as part of the cash sickness program.
(Benefits provided as a result of work injury or occupational disease are provided either under work injury or sickness programs.
Details of the benefits are discussed under Work Injury.)
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 7
Cash sickness and maternity benefits as well as health care are usually administered under the same branch of social security.
For this reason, these programs are grouped together in the country summaries.
An important reason for grouping these numerous benefits together is that each deals with the risk of temporary incapacity.
Moreover, in most instances, such benefits are furnished as part of a single system with common financing and administration.
Most countries provide medical care services for sickness and maternity as an integral part of the health insurance system and link those services directly with the provision of cash benefits.
In some instances, however, maternity cash grants are covered under family allowance programs.
Occasionally, medical care services are provided under a public health program, independent of the social insurance system.
Where this dual approach is followed, it has been indicated in the summaries.
Where health care is dispensed directly by the government or its agencies and the principal source of funds is general revenue, the cash benefit program usually continues to be administered on an insurance basis, funded by payroll contributions, and merged in some instances with other aspects of the social insurance system such as old age and disability.
However, countries that deliver health care primarily through private facilities and private funding are also likely to have developed separate programs.
Where the social security program operates its own medical facilities, both types of benefits are usually administered jointly.
Benefits designed to assist in the provision of longterm care, often at home, are generally supported by a special tax.
Benefit levels are normally set to the level of care required.
These benefits may be payable in cash, as care services, or as a combination of the two.
Coverage.
The proportion of the population covered by
may be permitted to affiliate on a voluntary basis.
In several countries, higher-paid employees are specifically excluded from one or both forms of sickness insurance, although some voluntary participation is usually permitted.
Many countries include pensioners as well as other social security beneficiaries under the medical care programs, in some cases without cost to the pensioner.
Elsewhere, pensioners pay a percentage of their pension or a fixed premium for all or part of the medical care coverage.
Special sickness insurance systems may be maintained for certain workers, such as railway employees, seamen, and public employees.
Where medical care coverage is provided through a national health service rather than social insurance, the program is usually open in principle to virtually all residents.
However, restrictions on services to aliens may apply.
Source of Funds.
Many countries have merged the
financing of sickness programs with that of other social insurance benefits and collect only a single contribution from employees and employers.
More commonly, however, a fixed percentage of wages, up to a ceiling, is contributed by employees and employers directly to a separate program that administers both health care and cash benefits for sickness and maternity.
Some countries also provide a government contribution.
Where medical care is available to residents, generally through some type of national health service, the government usually bears at least the major part of the cost from general revenues.
Qualifying Conditions.
Generally, a person becoming ill must be gainfully employed, incapacitated for work, and not receiving regular wages or sick-leave payments from the employer to be eligible for cash sickness benefits.
Most programs require claimants to meet a minimum period of contribution or to have some history of work attachment prior to the onset of illness to qualify.
Some countries, however, have eliminated the qualifying period.
The length of the qualifying period for cash sickness benefits may range from less than 1 month to 6 months or more and is ordinarily somewhat longer for cash maternity benefits.
Usually the period must be fairly recent, such as during the last 6 or 12 months.
In the case of medical benefits, a qualifying period is usually not required.
In instances where such a requirement does exist, it is generally of a short duration.
Most programs providing medical services to dependents of workers, as well as to the workers themselves, do not distinguish in their qualifying conditions between the two types of beneficiaries.
A few programs require a longer period of covered employment before medical services are provided to dependents.
sickness programs varies considerably from country to country, in part because of the degree of economic development.
Coverage for medical care and cash benefits is generally identical in countries where both types of benefits are provided through the same branch of social insurance.
In a number of systems, particularly in developing countries, health care insurance extends only to employees in certain geographic areas.
A common procedure is to start the program in major urban centers, then extend coverage gradually to other areas.
Both cash sickness and health care programs may exclude agricultural workers, who, in some countries, account for a major proportion of the working population.
Where a health insurance system (as distinguished from a national health service program) exists, most workers earning below a certain ceiling participate on a compulsory basis.
Others, such as the self-employed,
8 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
Cash Benefits.
The cash sickness benefit is usually 50 percent to 75 percent of current average earnings, frequently with supplements for dependents.
Most programs, however, fix a maximum benefit amount or do so implicitly through a general earnings ceiling for contributions and benefits.
Benefits may be reduced when beneficiaries are hospitalized at the expense of the social insurance system.
A waiting period of 2 to 7 days is imposed under most cash sickness programs.
As a result, benefits may not be payable if an illness or injury lasts for only a few days.
Similarly, in the case of a prolonged inability to work, benefits may not be payable for the first few days.
Under some programs, however, benefits are retroactively paid for the waiting period when the disability continues beyond a specified time, commonly 2 to 3 weeks.
A waiting period reduces administrative and benefit costs by excluding many claims for short illnesses or injuries during which relatively little income is lost and can also help reduce the potential for the inappropriate use of the system by workers.
The period during which a worker may receive benefits for a single illness or injury, or in a given 12month period, is ordinarily limited to 26 weeks.
In some instances, however, benefits may be drawn for considerably longer and even for an unlimited duration.
A number of countries permit the agency to extend the maximum entitlement period to 39 or 52 weeks in specific cases.
In most countries, when cash sickness benefits are exhausted, the recipient is paid a disability benefit if the incapacity continues.
Cash maternity benefits are usually payable for a specified period, both before and after childbirth.
A woman is almost always required to stop working while receiving maternity benefits, and usually she must use the prenatal and postnatal medical services provided by the system.
In some countries, cash maternity benefits are also payable to working men who stay home to care for a newborn child while the mother returns to work.
Cash payments may also be available for a parent, usually the mother, who is absent from work to care for a sick child under a specified age.
The proportion of earnings payable as a cash maternity benefit differs considerably from country to country but, like cash sickness benefits, is usually between 50 percent and 75 percent of current earnings.
However, in a number of countries, maternity benefits are set at 100 percent of wages.
Benefit payments usually start approximately 6 weeks before the expected date of childbirth and end 6 to 8 weeks afterward.
A nursing allowance--usually 20 percent or 25 percent of the regular maternity benefit and payable for up to 6 months or longer--may be provided in addition to the basic cash maternity benefit.
A grant for the purchase of
a layette--clothes and other essentials for the new-born baby--or the provision of a layette itself is furnished under some programs.
Finally, a lump-sum maternity grant may be paid on the birth of each child.
The wives of insured men may be eligible for this grant.
Similar benefits may be provided under the family allowance program.
Medical Benefits.
Medical services usually include at
least general practitioner care, some hospitalization, and essential drugs.
Services of specialists, surgery, maternity care, some dental care, a wider range of medicines, and certain appliances are commonly added.
Transportation of patients and home-nursing services may be included.
There are three principal methods of meeting the cost of health care: direct payment to providers by the public system or its agents, reimbursement of patients, and direct provision of medical care.
These methods may be used in different combinations and may be varied for different kinds of services.
Under direct payment, the social security or public medical care system pays providers directly for services.
Patients usually have little or no direct financial dealings with the care provider.
Payments for care are commonly made on the basis of contracts with service providers or the professional groups representing them, such as practitioner or hospital associations.
Remuneration may take the form of a specified fee for each service, a capitation payment in return for providing all necessary services to a given group of persons, or a salary.
Under the reimbursement method, the patient makes the initial payment and is reimbursed by social security for at least part of the cost.
A maximum is sometimes placed on the refund, expressed as a percentage of the bill or a flat amount that can vary with the nature of the service as stipulated in a schedule of fees.
The ceiling on medical bills can be placed on the provider when presenting the bill or on the patient when applying for reimbursement.
In the latter case, the patient may be reimbursed for only a small portion of the bill.
Under the direct-provision method, the social security system or the government owns and operates its own medical facilities, largely manned by salaried staff.
Countries using this method may contract for services of public or private providers.
The patient normally pays no fee for most of these services, except insofar as part of the social security contribution may be allotted toward health care funding.
Regardless of the funding method used, all national health care programs provide for at least a small degree of cost-sharing by patients, usually on the assumption that such charges discourage overuse.
Thus, the patient either pays part of the cost to the provider or social
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 9
security agency or receives less than full reimbursement.
Even under the direct-provision method, with its emphasis on basically free medical services to the whole population, patients are generally required to pay a small fixed fee per medical treatment or prescription or per day of hospitalization.
Some health care systems have no limit on how long medical care may be provided.
Other systems fix a maximum, such as 26 weeks, for services provided for any given illness.
Some set limits only on the duration of hospitalization paid for by social security.
Where time limits are imposed, they may be extended.
Maternity Care.
Prenatal, obstetric, and postnatal care
for working women is provided in most countries under the medical services program.
Obstetric care is sometimes limited to the services of a midwife, although a doctor is usually available in case of complications.
Care in a maternity home or hospital, as well as essential drugs, are ordinarily furnished where necessary.
Medical Care for Dependents.
When medical benefits
National law usually prescribes the minimum (and, in some cases, the maximum) cash benefits and medical services the health funds may provide.
In a few countries, individual funds may determine what specific health care benefits and services to provide and arrange to furnish medical care to their members.
This arrangement can involve delivery through contracts with care and service providers in the region.
Less commonly, government departments are responsible for the actual provision of medical services, usually through a national health service program.
The administrative responsibility for delivering medical services in some countries is often separated from the administration of cash benefit programs, which tend to be linked with other types of social security benefits.
Work Injury The oldest type of social security--the work injury program--provides compensation for work-connected injuries and occupational illnesses.
Such programs usually furnish short- and long-term benefits, depending on both the duration of the incapacity and the age of survivors.
Work injury benefits nearly always include cash benefits and medical services.
Most countries attempt to maintain separate work injury programs that are not linked directly with other social security measures.
In some countries, however, work injury benefits are paid under special provisions of the general social security programs.
Both types of programs are dealt with under Work Injury.
Types of Systems.
There are two basic types of work
for insured workers are provided through social insurance, similar services are typically furnished to their spouse and young children (and, in some cases, other adults or young relatives living with and dependent on the insured).
Maternity care is generally provided to the wife of an insured man.
In some countries, however, medical services available to dependents are more limited than those provided to insured workers or heads of families.
Dependents may be subject to a shorter maximum duration for hospital stays, for example, and may have to pay a larger percentage of the cost of certain services such as medicines.
Administrative Organization.
The administrative organization for the sickness and maternity program is similar to that of the old-age, disability, and survivor program in many countries.
Most commonly, such programs are administered by some form of national social security institution.
Under some systems, social security agencies own and operate their own medical facilities, furnishing at least part of the services available under their programs.
In most countries with a national health insurance program, responsibility for detailed administration lies with semiautonomous, nongovernment health funds or associations.
All workers covered by the program must join one of these funds.
Each health fund usually requires government approval and must satisfy certain requirements.
Workers and, in some countries, employers participate in the election of governing bodies.
The funds normally collect contributions within minimum and maximum limits.
Funds may also receive government subsidies related to their expenditures or to the number of affiliated members.
10 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
injury systems: social insurance systems that use a public fund, and various forms of private or semiprivate arrangements required by law.
In most countries, work injury programs operate through a central public fund, which may or may not be part of the general social insurance system.
All employers subject to the program must pay contributions to the public carrier, which in turn pays the benefits.
Countries that rely primarily on private arrangements require employers to insure their employees against the risk of employment injury.
However, in some of these countries, only private insurance is available.
In the remainder, a public fund does exist, but employers are allowed the option of insuring with either a private carrier or the public fund.
The premiums charged by private or mutual insurance companies for work injury protection usually vary according to the experience of work accidents in different undertakings or industries, and the cost of protection may vary widely.
In some countries, however, experience rating has been eliminated, and all employers contribute to the program at one rate.
In other instances, workers' compensation laws simply impose on employers a liability to pay direct compensation to injured workers or their survivors.
Employers covered under such laws may simply pay benefits from their own funds as injuries occur or may voluntarily purchase a private or mutual insurance contract to protect themselves against risk.
Coverage.
Work injury programs commonly cover wage
and salary workers and exclude the self-employed.
The programs of some of the more highly industrialized nations cover practically all employees.
However, many countries either exclude all agricultural employees or cover only those who operate power-driven machinery.
Some programs also exclude employees of small enterprises.
Source of Funds.
Work injury benefits are financed
primarily by employer contributions, reflecting the traditional assumption that employers should be liable when their employees suffer work injuries.
Where certain elements of the work injury program are meshed with one or more of the other branches of the social insurance system, however, financing usually involves contributions from employees, employers, and the government.
Another exception occurs in countries that provide medical treatment for work-connected illnesses under their ordinary public medical care programs.
Work Injury Benefits.
Work injury programs provide
cash benefits and medical benefits.
Cash benefits under work injury programs may be subdivided into three types: benefits for temporary disability, those for permanent total disability, and those for permanent partial disability.
No qualifying period of coverage or employment is ordinarily required for entitlement to work injury benefits.
The concept of work-connected injury has gradually been liberalized in a number of countries to cover injuries occurring while commuting to and from work.
Temporary disability benefits are usually payable from the start of an incapacity caused by a work injury, though some programs require a waiting period of 1 to 3 days.
Benefits normally continue for a limited period, such as 26 to 52 weeks, depending on the duration of incapacity.
If incapacity lasts longer, the temporary disability benefit may be replaced by a permanent disability benefit.
In some systems, temporary benefits may continue for an extended period, particularly if the temporary and permanent benefit amounts are identical.
The temporary benefit is nearly always a fraction of the worker 's average earnings during a period immediately before injury, usually at least one-third to one-half.
A ceiling may be placed on the earnings considered in computing a benefit.
Temporary benefits under work injury programs may be significantly higher than in the
case of ordinary sickness.
Benefits are reduced under some programs when a worker is hospitalized.
The second type of cash work injury benefit is provided in cases of permanent total disability.
Generally, it becomes payable immediately after the temporary disability benefit ceases, based on a medical evaluation that the worker 's incapacity is both permanent and total.
The permanent total disability benefit is usually payable for life, unless the worker 's condition changes.
A minority of programs, however, pay only a single lumpsum grant equal to several years' wages.
The permanent total disability benefit usually amounts to two-thirds to three-fourths of the worker 's average earnings before injury, somewhat higher than for ordinary disability benefits.
In addition, unlike ordinary disability benefits, the rate usually does not vary based on the length of employment before the injury.
Supplements may be added for dependents and for pensioners requiring the constant attendance of another person, in which case benefits may exceed former earnings.
In some countries, the benefits of apprentices or new labor force entrants who become permanently disabled as a result of work-connected injury or disease are based on hypothetical lifetime wages or on the wage of an average worker in the particular industry.
This mechanism overcomes the problem of establishing a lifetime benefit based on a very low starting wage.
The third type of cash work injury benefit is provided when permanent partial disability results in a worker 's loss of partial working or earning capacity.
It is usually equal to a portion of the full benefit corresponding to the percentage loss of capacity.
Alternatively, permanent partial disability benefits may be paid in the form of a lump-sum grant.
Partial disability payments are generally smaller and are usually stipulated in a schedule of payments for particular types of injuries.
Some systems pay the benefit as a lump sum when the extent of disability is below a stated percentage, such as 20 percent.
Medical and hospital care and rehabilitation services are also provided to injured workers.
Nearly always free, they may include a somewhat wider range of services than the general sickness program.
Ordinarily, they are available until the worker recovers or the condition stabilizes.
In some countries, however, free care is limited, the amount being based on the duration of services or their total cost.
Survivor Benefits.
Most work injury programs also provide benefits to survivors.
These benefits are customarily payable to a widow, regardless of her age, until her death or remarriage; to a disabled widower; and to orphans below specified age limits.
If the benefit is not exhausted by the immediate survivors' claims, dependent parents or other relatives may be eligible for
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 11
small benefits.
No minimum period of coverage is required.
Survivor benefits are computed as a percentage of either the worker 's average earnings immediately before death or the benefit payable (or potentially payable) at death.
These percentages are typically larger than those for survivor benefits under the general program and do not normally vary with the length of covered employment.
They are usually about one-third to one-half of the worker 's average earnings for a widow, about half as much for each half orphan, and about two-thirds as much for each full orphan.
A limit is commonly placed on the combined total of survivor benefits.
Not all countries, however, provide work injury benefits to survivors, and some do not differentiate between survivors in this category and survivors entitled to benefits under other social insurance programs.
Some schemes pay only a lump sum equal to the worker 's earnings over a specified number of years.
Most systems also pay a funeral grant equivalent to a fixed sum or a percentage of the worker 's earnings.
Administrative Organization.
The functions involved in
more than a specified amount.
Some have special provisions covering temporary and seasonal employees.
Several countries have special occupational unemployment programs, most typically for workers in the building trades, dockworkers, railway employees, and seafarers.
Voluntary insurance systems are limited to industries in which labor unions have established unemployment funds.
Membership in these funds is usually compulsory for union members in a covered industry and may be open on a voluntary basis to nonunion employees.
Noninsured workers, such as recent school graduates or the selfemployed, for example, may be eligible for a governmentsubsidized assistance benefit when they become unemployed.
Source of Funds.
The methods used to finance unemployment insurance are usually based on the same contributory principles as for other branches of social insurance--contributions amounting to a fixed percentage of covered wages are paid on a scheduled basis.
In many cases, the government also grants a subsidy, particularly for extended benefits.
Unemployment insurance contributions are shared equally between employees and employers in many countries.
Alternatively, the entire contribution may be made by the employer.
However, government subsidies may be quite large, amounting to as much as two-thirds of the program's expenditures.
Means-tested unemployment assistance programs are financed entirely by governments, with no employer or employee contribution.
Qualifying Conditions.
To be entitled to unemployment
administering work injury programs differ widely between countries in which employers are not required to insure or can insure with private carriers and those in which a public agency or fund has sole responsibility for both collecting contributions and paying benefits.
Unemployment Benefits in this category provide compensation for the loss of income resulting from involuntary unemployment.
In some countries, these programs are independent of other social security measures and may be closely linked with employment services.
In other countries, the unemployment programs are included with social security measures covering other short-term risks, although employment services may continue to verify unemployment and assist in a job search.
Unemployment programs, which exist mainly in industrialized countries, are compulsory and fairly broad in scope in many countries.
Some restrict benefits to those who satisfy a means or income test.
In addition to the programs offering scheduled payments, a number of countries provide lump-sum grants, payable by either a government agency or the employer.
In addition, employers in many instances are required to pay lump-sum severance indemnities to discharged workers.
Coverage.
About half of the compulsory unemployment
programs cover the majority of employed persons, regardless of the type of industry.
Coverage under the remaining programs is limited to workers in industry and commerce.
A few exclude salaried employees earning
benefits, a worker must be involuntarily unemployed and have completed a minimum period of contributions or covered employment.
The most common qualifying period is 6 months of coverage within the year before employment ceased.
In a number of industrialized countries, however, students recently out of school who are unable to find jobs may be eligible for unemployment benefits, even without a work record.
This benefit provides a transition from school to work, particularly in periods of recession.
Nearly all unemployment insurance programs, as well as those providing unemployment assistance, require that applicants be capable of, and available for, work.
An unemployed worker, therefore, is usually ineligible for unemployment benefits when incapacitated or otherwise unable to accept a job offer.
Usually, the unemployed worker must register for work at an employment office and report regularly for as long as payments continue.
This close linkage between unemployment benefits and placement services ensures that benefits will be paid only after the person has been informed of any current job opportunities and been found unsuitable.
12 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
An unemployed worker who refuses an offer of a suitable job without good cause usually will have benefits temporarily or permanently suspended.
Most programs stipulate that the job offered must have been suitable for the worker.
The definitions of suitable employment vary considerably.
Generally, the criteria include the rate of pay for the job being offered in relation to previous earnings; distance from the worker 's home; relationship to the worker 's previous occupation, capabilities, and training; and the extent to which the job may involve dangerous or unhealthy work.
In some countries, longterm unemployed workers may also be obliged to undertake employment retraining programs.
Some countries also provide the unemployed with access to educational placements.
If an unemployed worker refuses a place on a retraining program or fails, without good cause, to attend an educational placement, benefits can be temporarily or permanently suspended.
An unemployed worker may satisfy all of the qualifying conditions for a benefit but still be temporarily or permanently disqualified.
Nearly all unemployment systems disqualify a worker who left voluntarily without good cause, was dismissed because of misconduct, or participated in a labor dispute leading to a work stoppage that caused the unemployment.
The period of disqualification varies considerably, from a few weeks to permanent disqualification.
Unemployment Benefits.
Weekly benefits are usually a
Most countries place a limit on the period during which unemployment benefits may be continuously drawn.
Typically, this limit varies from 8 to 36 weeks but may be longer in certain cases.
Duration of benefits may also depend on the length of the preceding period of contribution or coverage under the program.
That criterion may reduce the maximum duration of unemployment benefits for workers with brief work histories.
However, workers with a long history of coverage may, under some programs, have their benefit period extended well beyond the ordinary maximum.
Many unemployed workers who exhaust the right to ordinary benefits continue to receive some assistance, provided their means or incomes are below specified levels.
Recipients are usually required to continue registering and reporting at an employment exchange.
Some countries that have unemployment assistance but no insurance program do not place any limit on the duration of payments.
A number of countries require that insured workers approaching retirement age who have been out of work for a specified period be removed from the unemployment rolls and granted a regular old-age benefit.
Administrative Organization.
Unemployment insurance
percentage of average wages during a recent period.
A system of wage classes rather than a single fixed percentage is used in some countries.
The basic rate of unemployment benefits is usually between 40 percent and 75 percent of average earnings.
However, a ceiling on the wages used for benefit computations or maximum benefit provisions may considerably narrow the range within which the basic percentage of wages applies.
Flat-rate amounts are sometimes payable instead of graduated benefits that vary with past wages and customarily differ only according to the family status or, occasionally, the age of the worker.
Supplements for a spouse and children are usually added to the basic benefit of unemployed workers who are heads of families.
These supplements are either flat-rate amounts or an additional percentage of average earnings.
Most countries have a waiting period of several days before unemployment benefits become payable to reduce the administrative burden of dealing with a very large number of small claims.
Most waiting periods are between 3 and 7 days.
Some programs have a waiting period for each incident of unemployment, and others limit eligibility to once a year.
Longer waiting periods may be prescribed for certain workers, such as the seasonally employed.
systems may be administered by government departments or self-governing institutions that are usually managed by representatives of insured persons, employers, and the government.
Unemployment insurance and placement service programs usually maintain a close administrative relationship that ensures that benefits are paid only to workers who are registered for employment.
At the same time, this liaison increases the effectiveness of the placement services by providing an incentive, through payment of benefits, for unemployed persons to register and report regularly.
Some countries have merged the administration of unemployment insurance and employment service programs, especially at the lower administrative levels where claims are received and benefits are paid by the local employment office.
Other countries require persons to register with a local employment office, but the receipt of claims and payment of benefits are handled by a separate insurance office.
In addition to providing an income for the unemployed, many governments have elaborate measures to prevent or counteract unemployment.
The typical procedure is for government employment services to work with industry to promote occupational and geographic mobility of labor and to minimize unemployment caused by economic or technological developments; they do that by subsidizing the retraining and relocation of workers in industries that are declining or being restructured.
Gov-
SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002 13
ernments may grant tax and other incentives to industry to locate in areas of high unemployment, or they may allocate funds to create jobs in anticipation of periods of seasonal unemployment.
Eligibility.
Eligibility is commonly related to the size of
Family Allowances The general purpose of family allowance programs is to provide additional income for families with young children in order to meet at least part of the added costs of their support.
These programs may either be integrated with other social security measures or kept entirely separate.
In this report, family allowances primarily include regular cash payments to families with children.
In some countries, they also include school grants, birth grants, maternal and child health services, and allowances for adult dependents.
Most industrialized countries have family allowance programs that originated in Europe in the 19th century when some large companies began paying premiums to workers with large families.
The idea spread gradually, and several European countries enacted programs during the 1920s and 1930s.
Most programs in operation today, however, have been in place since 1945.
Types of Systems and Coverage .
Family allowance programs are of two types: universal and employmentrelated.
The first category, in principle, provides allowances to all resident families with a specified number of children.
The second category provides allowances to all wage and salary workers and, in some cases, the self-employed.
A few systems cover some categories of nonemployed persons as well.
Most employment-related programs continue to pay family allowances to insured persons with dependent children in their care when they retire or are temporarily off the job and receiving sickness, unemployment, work injury, disability, or other benefits.
Employment-related family programs also pay allowances to widows of social security beneficiaries.
Source of Funds.
The differences in family allowance
the family and, in some cases, to family income.
Many countries pay allowances beginning with the first child.
In addition, some countries pay an allowance for a nonemployed wife or other adult dependent, even if there are no children.
In some countries, families with only one child are ineligible.
Age requirements vary but are usually tied to the last year of school or the minimum working age, which are often the same and fall somewhere between ages 14 and 18.
Under most programs, the continuation of schooling, apprenticeship, or vocational training qualifies a child for an extension of the age limit.
In the case of disabled children, many countries extend the age limit beyond that for continued education or pay allowances indefinitely.
Benefits.
Whether a program pays a uniform rate for all
children or an increasing or decreasing amount for each additional child may reflect the history or the intent of the program.
The allowance structure may vary, for example, depending on whether the primary intent is to provide assistance or stimulate population growth.
The allowance in most countries is a uniform amount for every child, regardless of the number of children in a family.
The allowance in most of the other countries increases for each additional child; the payment for a fifth child, for example, may be considerably larger than that for the first or second child.
In a few countries, the allowance per child diminishes or ceases with the addition of children beyond a certain number.
In some countries, family allowances (and tax exemptions for dependent family members) have been replaced or supplemented by credits or other forms of a negative income tax.
Administrative Organization.
In countries where family
programs are reflected in the methods used for financing.
In universal systems, the entire cost is usually covered by general revenue.
By contrast, countries linking eligibility with employment meet the cost of allowances entirely or in considerable part from employer contributions, usually at a uniform percentage-of-payroll rate.
If employer contributions do not cover the entire cost, the remainder is usually met from a government subsidy.
Few countries require an employee contribution toward family allowances, although some require self-employed persons to contribute.
allowances are available to all families and financed from general revenues, the program is usually administered by a government department.
Where allowances are payable mainly to families of employed persons and financed primarily from employer contributions, the administration may be by a semiautonomous agency under public supervision.
Equalization funds may handle the program's financial operations.
Each employer pays family allowances to its employees with their wages.
The firm then settles with the local fund only the surplus or deficit of contributions due, after deducting allowances the firm has paid.
A similar procedure of settling only surpluses or deficits is followed by the local funds in relation to the regional equalization funds under whose supervision they operate.
The equalization process makes it possible to fix a uniform contribution rate for all
14 SSPTW: Asia and the Pacific, 2002
employers, regardless of the number of children in their employees' families.
It also eliminates any effect allowances might have in inducing employers to discriminate in hiring workers with children.

Flat-rate universal pension: A pension of uniform amount normally based on residence but independent of earnings.
It is generally financed through government contributions, with no contributions from employers or employees.
Provident funds: Employee and employer contributions are set aside for each employee in publicly managed special funds.
Benefits are generally paid as a lump sum with accrued interest.
