DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FY 2000 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET REQUEST ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY ENERGY CONSERVATION (Tabular dollars in thousands, Narrative in whole dollars) TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PROGRAM MISSION Sector Mission, Situation, Goal(s) and Strategic Approach Mission The mission of the Transportation Sector program is to support the development and use of advanced transportation vehicles and fuels which will reduce energy demand, particularly for petroleum; reduce criteria pollutant emissions; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and enable United States transportation to sustain a strong competitive position in domestic and world markets.
Situation: Increasing Vulnerability Transportation accounts for 67% of the petroleum consumed in the U.S., and the transportation sector is almost totally dependent on petroleum.
The explosive popularity of low fuel economy pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles used for personal transport, coupled with a growing economy, fuel prices that are at an all-time low in real terms, increasing numbers of drivers, and increasing miles traveled by each vehicle continue to push transportation fuel consumption higher.
Other impacts are high levels of air emissions and further growth in greenhouse gas emissions.
Given projections of substantial growth in the number of vehicles, the best approach to alleviating such impacts is the development of vehicles with substantially higher fuel economy, and the widespread use of clean, non-petroleum fuels.
The transportation sector budget primarily supports high-risk research and development, with the goal of making breakthroughs which offer potentially large benefits in energy security, reduced emissions and economic growth.
Current market pricing of fuels and vehicles mitigate against the private sector making such investments on its own.
PROGRAM MISSION - TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (Cont'd) C Growing dependence on petroleum Demand for petroleum has grown steadily during the 1990s.
Worldwide 1997 petroleum demand was 73.2 million barrels per day, up from 67 million barrels per day in 1993.
The growth of economies among the world's developing nations means competition may greatly increase for petroleum on the world market.
U.S. demand will continue to grow, as the number of U.S. light vehicles is projected to increase from 178 million in 1997 to 254 million by 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
EIA projects that U.S. oil consumption will rise from 18.4 million barrels per day (mbd) in 1996 to 24.7 mbd in 2020.
When these demand trends are coupled with projections that world oil production might peak within 20 years and begin to gradually decline, the potential for serious economic dislocation becomes apparent.
Significant contribution of highway vehicles to urban air quality problems In urban areas, a significant portion of air pollution is attributable to transportation (78% of carbon monoxide, 45% of nitrogen oxides, 37% of volatile organic compounds, 26% of particulates).
Vehicles also generate 32% of atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions.
Concentrations of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas, are thought to contribute to global climate change.

Economic impact of the nation's transportation sector The domestic vehicle industry is the nation's largest U.S. Domestic Petroleum Production 4 manufacturing industry; all transportation activity accounts 2 for 7.4% of American jobs, and total transportation outlays account for 16.3% of the gross domestic product.
U.S. car 0 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 companies are among the nation's leading consumers of glass, Year iron, and rubber, and they lead the nation in purchases from small business.
The development of advanced vehicle technologies for automobiles and trucks will improve U.S. leadership in the increasingly competitive world market for the production of competitively-priced, fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles.
PROGRAM MISSION - TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (Cont'd) Strategic Goal and Approach Reflecting the fact that over three-fourths of total transportation sector energy consumption is used by cars and trucks, the transportation sector's program is focused almost exclusively on reducing oil consumption in these vehicles.
In support of DOE's overall strategic goal to promote secure, competitive and environmentally responsible energy systems, the transportation sector program goal is use of advanced petroleum-based transportation fuels, non-petroleum fuels, and more efficient vehicles sufficient to reduce year 2010 projected highway transportation oil consumption by 10% from the 2010 baseline forecast by EIA in its 1999 Annual Energy Outlook.
The program will contribute to development, by 2004, of prototype mid-sized cars and light trucks with up to three times the fuel economy of their conventional counterparts.
These technologies will also reduce vehicle criteria pollutant emissions to at least the more stringent of U.S. EPA or State of California standards, without compromising safety, performance, comfort, and cost.
Recognizing the reality that industry must at some point make a substantially greater financial investment than government, if advanced vehicles and new fuels are to be successfully produced and sold, industry is an indispensable partner in the planning and integration of DOE-funded technology development programs.
Nearly all programs are cost shared by the private sector, and programs involving major expenditures are periodically peer-reviewed by independent scientists and engineers.
Funds are utilized by hundreds of entities--small and large--including industrial, university, national laboratory, and government organizations.
Coordination and establishment of research portfolio priorities are accomplished by technical teams comprised of representatives from industry, government, and national laboratories.
Teams develop technical roadmaps to overcome both technological and cost barriers in their respective technology areas.
A relatively small portion of the budget (7%) is for the purpose of informing potential customers about the status of advanced vehicles and fuels, and for participation in highly-leveraged partnerships to accomplish test programs and innovative approaches to the introduction of new technologies.
The office participates actively in the Special Project State Grants, working closely with State and local governments to develop and deploy advanced vehicle technologies and alternative fuels.
Budget Structure A portfolio of technology requirements results from the planning activities accomplished jointly by industry and government.
To achieve automobiles and trucks with high fuel economy will require industry to successfully integrate the results of multiple technology development programs--including propulsion systems, energy storage, control systems, and advanced emissions reduction technologies.
Development of these "enabling" technologies is included in the Vehicle Technologies R
In order to accomplish the broad national goals indicated above for future transportation vehicles, development of the fuels to be used in those vehicles will also be required.
Fuels-related activities are included in the Fuels Utilization R
These activities encompass work required on both petroleum-based fuels and non-petroleum fuels.
PROGRAM MISSION - TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (Cont'd) Timely availability of new materials and materials manufacturing technologies is critical for the development and engineering of advanced transportation vehicles.
Research and development of propulsion system materials and lightweight vehicle materials are included in the Materials Technologies element of the budget.
The Technology Deployment element of the budget supports activities to accelerate the market acceptance and purchase of highly efficient vehicles, fueled by either petroleum, petroleum-based blends, or non-petroleum fuels; and conventional vehicles which use alternative fuels.
The Management and Planning element of the budget provides funds for salaries, travel, and training of DOE staff responsible for managing the transportation sector program.
Management responsibilities for all research and development activities are aligned with vehicle "platforms."
The Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) reports to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
Within OTT, the Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies provides "platform management" for automobiles and light trucks (Class 1 and 2); the Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies is responsible for developing and implementing programs related to medium trucks (Classes 3 through 6) and heavy trucks (Classes 7 and 8).
The following matrix relates each element of the transportation sector budget to the vehicle platform, or platforms, directly supported by that element.
In many cases where there is not direct support, the R
For example, fuel cell development activities are focused specifically on achieving characteristics required for successful applications in automobiles; but advances made could well result in truck, bus, and stationary applications.

PROGRAM MISSION - TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (Cont'd) Program Benefits The following benefits are projected from sustained multi-year funding of the transportation program.
Metric Primary Energy Displaced (quadrillion Btus) Primary Oil Displaced (million barrels per day) Energy Cost Savings ($ billion) Carbon Reductions (million metric tons) 2000 0.01 0.04 0.19 0.44 2010 1.21 0.85 9.87 24.81 2020 3.04 1.77 22.11 59.78
These benefits correspond to approximately 1.2 million alternative fueled vehicles employed in the year 2000.
In the year 2010, the transportation sector would have nearly 2.6 million compressed natural gas vehicles, 1.7 million electric vehicles, and about 8.3 million advanced high fuel economy vehicles resulting from the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).
By the year 2020, the PNGV vehicle population would be about 32 million vehicles.
Also by 2020, the amount of biomass ethanol used in transportation would be about 12 billion gallons, with most of this in gasoline blends.
About 613,000 advanced diesels would be employed in heavy trucks, accounting for about 12% of the heavy truck stock.
Studies estimate that developing countries will be major markets for technologies supported by this budget.
While U.S. and European vehicle sales will grow modestly, sales in developing countries are expected to increase by over five percent annually.
This provides a large export market opportunity for America's transportation industry, potentially also leading to the creation of jobs in the U.S.
In order to realize the market penetration of alternative fueled vehicles estimated above, an aggressive program has been structured to support the widespread use and distribution of natural gas as a transportation fuel.
The following table lists the funding sources that support the Office of Transportation Technologies' natural gas activities.

Appropriate Federal Role: The primary government research and development role is to support long-range, high-risk activities where breakthroughs offer large potential payoffs to the nation, but are not reflected in current market pricing.
This support includes funding, as well as access to unique R
With fuel prices at historic lows, transportation exemplifies a sector where a lack of market demand, combined with realistic requirements for private sector return on investment, provide industry with little or no incentive to undertake high-risk research on its own to achieve breakthrough improvements in efficiency.
Such breakthrough improvements would clearly contribute to achieving national goals of reducing petroleum dependence and decreasing emissions, while having a positive longrun economic impact.
It is also appropriate for the government to support research on technologies which foreign competitors may be close to

Activity Summary: The Hybrid Systems R
The R
The latter activity relies heavily on developing component and system models, and validating them both analytically and experimentally.
One of the key enabling technologies for hybrid vehicle systems is high power energy storage.
The focus of the high power energy storage activities is development of two high power battery technologiesClithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride.
Both are being developed, first to
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES R
Advanced power electronic activities are focused on lowering the cost, weight, and size, and improving the efficiency, of automotive power electronics through the development of an Automotive Integrated Power Module (AIPM), as well as through the development of permanent magnet, switched reluctance, and induction motor technologies.
Truck and bus vehicle manufacturers, and their component providers, are at an early stage of technology demonstration, building on hybrid propulsion technologies that have resulted in large measure from Federally-supported research programs.
The tests of these demonstration vehicles show a 50% improvement in fuel efficiency but, more importantly, a 95% reduction in particulates and a 30% reduction in oxides of nitrogen emissions using conventional fuels (and even lower with natural gas).
At the current level of effort, demonstration systems will require several more years of development to become cost competitive with conventional systems.
Each additional year exposes the technology to increased competitive business pressures.
The heavy vehicle hybrid program intends to shorten that exposure by supplementing industry=s investment in the early stages of cost reduction and performance optimizing developments.
Hybrid Systems R
Each platform has its own duty cycle, market sector, and performance requirements.
Partners: The Hybrid Systems R
In the propulsion and ancillary subsystem area, partners include Tier 1 suppliers of the automotive and truck manufacturers to support propulsion development; Argonne National Laboratory for screening, benchmarking, developing, and evaluating concepts; the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for accessory load reduction, systems modeling and analysis; and the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), under a cooperative agreement with the PNGV systems analysis technical team.
The high power energy storage development efforts are conducted through a cost-shared cooperative agreement with the U. S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), a partnership composed of Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and, through development contracts with the USABC, Saft America, Inc., PolyStor, and VARTA.
High power electronics development is coordinated among AIPM suppliers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) committee that develops specifications, and USCAR through cost-shared financial assistance agreements with the AIPM candidate suppliers.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, EPRI, the Navy, and other agencies assist in selection and sub-component development.
Cost-sharing for the Hybrid Systems R
In support of DOE=s strategic goal, the Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies R
Technology roadmaps jointly developed with USCAR and USABC provide a list of technical goals and strategies for developing high power batteries, power electronics,
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES R
These roadmaps are coordinated with PNGV technical teams, and include the Department=s strategic goal to promote secure, competitive, and environmentally responsible energy systems.
Laboratory R
The technology roadmap of the Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies reflects the growing interest in the use of hybrid propulsion technology in commercial transportation.
The roadmap is coordinated with programs in the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, and is supported by the truck and bus manufacturing industry as an appropriate strategy for introducing advanced technology into commercial practice.
Goals: In FY 2000, the Hybrid Systems R
Achievement of these goals will be a major step toward removing energy storage and energy management barriers to hybrid systems for 80 mpg vehicles, and will allow integration of these technologies in testbed vehicles for test and validation the next year.
For medium and heavy trucks, an 80% improvement in fuel efficiency, a 95% reduction in particulate emissions, and a 30% reduction in oxides of nitrogen emissions will be demonstrated in a test vehicle in FY 2000.

C For medium and heavy trucks, initiate cooperative agreements with two development teams.
During the first year, demonstrate an 80% improvement in fuel efficiency, 95% reduction in particulate emissions, and 30% reduction in oxides of nitrogen emissions compared to current production.
Test vehicle results will be the basis for a production feasible design development over the following 3-year program.
FY 2001 - FY 2004 Accomplishments C Complete design of a multi-platform propulsion system to be used in urban trucks and buses.
The design will incorporate the inputs from fleet managers involved in initial test vehicle trials.
(FY 2003) C Demonstrate propulsion system, advanced battery, high power electronic and accessory technologies in a rolling test platform capable of meeting PNGV goals.
(FY 2004) Fuel Cell R
Fuel cell technology developed under the program is also directly applicable to light truck and heavy duty vehicle applications (e.g., buses).
Fuel cells are critical to meeting the goal of an 80 mpg vehicle with extremely low emissions, and have been selected by the PNGV as a priority technology.
Particular emphasis is placed on achieving high fuel use efficiency, long life, very low emissions, and low manufacturing costs.
This is done through component development, subsystem development, and technology integration and validation of fuel cell stack systems, fuel-flexible fuel processors, and onboard hydrogen storage.
Partners: Industrial partners perform research and development through cost-shared contracts and cooperative agreements in the areas of integrated fuel cell systems, stack subsystems, air management and fuel cell components.
Current partners are: International Fuel Cells, Plug Power, Epyx, Hydrogen Burner Technology, AlliedSignal, Energy Partners, the Institute of Gas Technology, Electrochem, Spectracorp, Foster-Miller, 3M, A.D. Little, Vairex, and Meruit.
National laboratories have a major role in this program performing fundamental research, technology transfer, independent testing and evaluation, and technical support.

I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES R
These relationships have resulted in Memoranda of Understanding, Non-Disclosure Agreements for Cooperative Research, and informal joint ventures.
Laboratory research and development is planned and managed through Annual Operating Plans.

Although DOE has long funded minor R
The participation of small businesses and universities will help tap the full range of available technical innovation and expertise necessary to overcome the critical technology barriers preventing production of highly fuel efficient, emission compliant vehicles.
CARAT supports development of high priority technologies, from laboratory scale through technology validation.
The program also fosters links between the innovators and the auto
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES R
Competitive solicitations are issued each year on carefully selected technical topics.
Resulting cooperative agreements can extend through three phases, with detailed reviews and go/no-go decisions after each phase.
In FY 1998, DOE launched its Graduate Automotive Technology Education (GATE) initiative to establish university graduate study programs in several critical, multi-disciplinary engineering areas.
The program will provide graduate-level engineer training in the most advanced automotive technologies.
Because these technologies cross normal engineering disciplines, few schools are able to offer a focused curriculum in these areas.
In FY 2000, GATE will provide fellowships for the most talented engineering students to pursue graduate work in the selected technology areas.
Those universities selected to participate in GATE must identify a relationship with the automotive industry and contributions that industry members will make to the program.
Contributions can take the form of shared research facilities or equipment, internships for students, guest lectureships, funds, or identification of research topics for student projects.
These research topics will address critical PNGV technical targets.
Partners: During projects will add developed under involvement and the first two phases of CARAT projects, partners include small businesses, universities, and national laboratories.
Phase 3 appropriate industrial partners that have the technical and financial resources to commercialize the prototype technology Phases 1 and 2.
Under the GATE program, DOE establishes partnerships with universities that have demonstrated strong commitment with industry partners, including both major auto manufacturers and suppliers.
Goals: One of the most significant goals in CARAT is to further progress on overcoming technology barriers which are preventing the manufacture of highly efficient, lower emission vehicles.
By FY 2000, at least 13 components will be designed, tested, and evaluated for potential application in on-road vehicles.
The goals of GATE are twofold: to train a future workforce of automotive engineering professionals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in developing and commercializing critical advanced automotive technologies; and to marshal the resources of the brightest university graduate students to help solve the technology barriers identified by government and industry.
By FY 2000, 20 to 25 graduate students will be receiving fellowships to study and conduct research on the most critical automotive technologies.
FY 1998 Accomplishments C Launched the Cooperative Automotive Research for Advanced Technology (CARAT) program and awarded approximately 26 cooperative agreements in 18 technical areas.

The mission of the Fuels Utilization R
The strategic approach is to identify and develop new fuel options that will allow advanced Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) and other future vehicles to meet increasingly challenging performance and emissions targets.
Emissions reductions in vehicles over the past two decades have been significant, but further gains are required.
The current state of technology suggests that changes in fuel formulation, and the use of fuels other than petroleum, can have a major positive impact on achieving further improvements in emissions reductions.
The Fuels Utilization R
Two major areas are being addressed: Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels and Alternative Fuels.
Applied research in these two areas will lead to the development of advanced fuels for new technology engines with high fuel economy, and the development of vehicles which can costeffectively utilize alternative fuels while meeting all consumer expectations.
Key Milestones 2004 Complete development of a new fuel formulation for advanced direct injected engines that can use the existing fueling infrastructure, and which enables vehicle operation with both high fuel use efficiency and very low emissions.
Complete development of cost-effective systems, for application in Class 3-8 truck platforms, that will enable the practical use of natural gas as a preferred vehicle fuel option.
Appropriate Federal Role: The Government has an important role in realizing new fuel options.
Current fuel price market signals mitigate against private sector investment in alternatives to conventional fuels.
Also, the government can facilitate cooperative work among the fuel

Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels Activity Summary: The Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels activity is a collaborative effort conducted in partnership with energy companies, engine/vehicle manufacturers, and emission controls companies.
It is focused on developing new fuel formulations that will allow extremely fuel efficient engines to be developed that can also be very low polluters.
This work supports an initiative of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which has an objective of assuring that clean fuels are available to achieve emissions goals.
The current compositions of fuels are not suitable for advanced high fuel economy engines, since they have poor physical properties (e.g., cetane number) and contain high levels of sulfur and aromatics.
R
For example, initial testing at Southwest Research Institute has shown that the addition of dimethoxymethane (DMM) in low-sulfur diesel fuel can reduce particulate emissions significantly.
Direct injection engines being developed for high efficiency automotive, light truck, and heavy duty truck applications will not meet proposed 2004 emissions standards without improvements to fuels.
Current impurities (e.g., sulfur) and other constituents cause combustion inefficiencies and aftertreatment catalyst poisoning, which leads to excessive NOx and particulate emissions.
Fuel cell engines being developed for PNGV automotive applications will be more efficient and less costly if gasoline can be optimized to make onboard fuel processors simpler.
In addition to fuels R
Currently, projects are being developed to determine toxicity effects from different fuels used in advanced engines, and to investigate oxygenate and lube oil impacts on particulate emissions.
Partners: Test programs are conducted at DOE's national laboratories and independent laboratories (e.g., the Southwest Research Institute) in partnership with energy companies, exhaust aftertreatment manufacturers, and domestic automobile and truck engine manufacturers.

Data will be shared publicly to determine technology status and develop future plans.
Commitments from catalyst, auto, engine, emission controls, and energy companies are being made to support generation of technology R
Documents which address fuel development and testing, for both direct injection and fuel cell engines, are currently being developed, to complete initial planning described in Section 3.7 of the Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies R
The roadmaps are being developed jointly with auto/truck industrial partners and energy companies.
Goal: In FY 2000, an important program goal is to determine the maximum emissions reduction achievable with an advanced petroleum- based fuel.
This determination will be based on the analysis of tailpipe emissions from vehicles incorporating advanced emission controls strategies.
Year 2000 targets of 0.3 g/mi NOx and 0.025 g/mi particulate have been established for compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engines.
By 2004, in collaboration with the vehicle manufacturing industry, its suppliers, and the fuels industry, the goal is to develop and validate advanced fuels which enable direct-injected and fuel cell engines to meet Tier II emission standards proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

(FY 2004) Alternative Fuels Activity Summary: The Alternative Fuels activity has both near- and long-term elements.
The near-term activity is a collaborative effort in partnership with the natural gas industry, heavy duty engine/vehicle manufacturers, and natural gas storage tank manufacturers.
It is focused on supporting the use of natural gas in a cost-effective manner.
The long-term activity is to evaluate fuels derived from natural gas, such as dimethyl ether (DME), for compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engines.
Natural gas promises to be as cost effective as conventional fuel in some applications.
However, the barriers associated with the use of natural gas include: (1) current natural gas engines operate at lower efficiency levels than conventional fueled engines, (2) unacceptable incremental cost of current onboard storage techniques for natural gas, and inconvenience to the operator during refueling, (3) lack of available fuel; and (4) excessive costs of natural gas fueling facilities.
The program seeks to overcome these barriers by supporting development of high efficiency natural gas engines, reduced-cost onboard storage techniques that are user friendly, and low-cost fueling station designs.
Research and development is focused on cost-effective applications of this fuel option, specifically for Class 3-6 inner city and Class 7-8 inter-city trucks where natural gas is available and the duty cycles of the vehicles do not require long-range travel.
Natural gas derived fuels, such as dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol, will be evaluated in advanced PNGV automotive engines and direct injection engines for light trucks.
Partners: Industrial partners perform research and development on utilization of natural gas through cost-shared programs, contracts, and cooperative agreements.
Particular emphasis is placed on achieving proposed emissions standards and fuel efficiency goals, reducing cost, improving reliability, and maintaining safety.
Current partners include Johns Hopkins University, the Institute of Gas Technology, the Gas Research Institute, the State of California, Southwest Research Institute, Lucas Aerospace, Lincoln Composites, and Power Tech Labs.
National laboratories also have a major role in this program, performing fundamental research, testing and evaluation.
In addition, cost-shared projects exist with the Coordinating Research Council and the California Air Resources Board.
A multi-year plan for natural gas use in transportation vehicles was published as part of the overall DOE Natural Gas Multi-Year Program Plan, dated December 1997.

I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives I. A. Program Strategy
The mission of the Materials Technologies program is to support development of cost-effective materials and materials manufacturing processes which are required in order to achieve successful commercial introduction of fuel efficient, low emission transportation vehicles.
Research, development, testing and analysis are conducted to provide advanced materials with the necessary properties, and the processes needed to produce them, at Lightweight materials and advanced the costs and volumes required by vehicle producers.
propulsion materials will enable vehicle fuel economy and emission goals to be realized in The Materials Technologies program has two closely coordinated elements: propulsion commercially viable automobiles and trucks.
materials technology and lightweight materials technology.
Goals of the program Government-industry partnerships are in place include: (1) development and validation of lightweight materials technologies that will to facilitate validation and implementation of enable reductions in automobile weight of 40 percent (relative to 1994 baseline) and in cost-effective advanced materials heavy truck weight of 30 percent (relative to 1998 baseline) by 2004; and (2) technologies.
development and validation of enabling propulsion materials technologies for integration into advanced propulsion systems.
These goals are aligned with those of the Vehicle Technologies R
Advancement in the materials development areas is critical to success of the overall DOE transportation R
For example, up to 30 percent of the improvement required to triple vehicle fuel economy, and to attain much of the cost, safety, and recyclability targets of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), depends on lightweight materials development, as does achieving a 10 to 18 percent reduction in fuel use by heavy duty trucks.
New materials are also essential to the viability of the advanced propulsion systems under development for both cars and trucks.
In addition to enabling increased vehicle efficiency because of lighter weight, incorporation of advanced lightweight materials into vehicles has synergistic beneficial effects for reducing fuel consumption; for example, in allowing reduced engine sizes for automobiles, or in the area of high strength weight reduction materials for commercial trucks, which would enable increased payloads.
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES (Cont'd) The strategic approach to meeting these goals involves partnering with industry, with a high degree of cost sharing, to identify and remove the technical barriers to the viability of the highest payoff materials technologies.
Most of the R
Many also utilize the expertise of national laboratories and universities, as well as that in industry.
A major principle of the approach is that the program will not address technology R
Continuous coordination with industry is required to: (1) understand industry's R
Key Milestones 2000 Validate lightweight materials technologies to enable a 50 percent weight reduction in automobile body and chassis components, and a 20 percent weight reduction in heavy vehicles.
Validate materials technologies to enable a cost-competitive 40 percent reduction in automobile total weight (including body, chassis, powertrain, and fuel system); and validate lightweight materials technologies to enable a 30 percent reduction in total heavy vehicle weight.
2004
Appropriate Federal Role: The primary government research and development role is to support long-range, high-risk activities where breakthroughs offer large potential payoffs to the nation, but are not reflected in current market pricing.
This support includes funding, as well as access to unique R
With fuel prices at historic lows, transportation exemplifies a sector where a lack of market demand, combined with realistic requirements for private sector return on investment, provide industry with limited incentive to undertake high-risk research on its own to achieve breakthrough improvements in fuel use efficiency.
Such breakthrough improvements would contribute to achieving national goals of reduced petroleum dependence and decreased emissions while having a positive economic impact.
The Materials Technologies program includes maintenance and usage of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's world-class High Temperature Materials Laboratory (HTML), which has unique capabilities to support the transportation materials development effort; the facility also supports other materials efforts, other transportation R

I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives I. A. Program Strategy
Successful introduction and commercialization of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and advanced technology vehicles with significantly improved fuel economy are necessary to achieve reductions in oil consumption and environmental emissions from transportation.
The Department's deployment efforts logically follow and complement successful technology development by industry and government.
The program, in coordination with partners, stakeholders, and customers, will provide the catalyst needed to establish an improved public understanding about, and The Deployment program puts DOE and resulting market demand for, alternative fuel vehicles, advanced technology vehicles, industry developed alternative fuel and and new fuels; and to establish a strong and far-reaching fuel and service advanced vehicle technologies to work for infrastructure.
The program is designed to provide support at critical periods in the energy security and clean air by creating and transition of advanced transportation technologies from the laboratory to the supporting initiatives which get those marketplace, and then reduce government support as market penetration improves.
technologies out of the lab and onto the road.
The mission of the Technology Deployment program is to accelerate the adoption and use of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles to help meet energy and environmental goals.
With fleets paving the way for higher volume, lower cost vehicle production, and the installation of refueling capability, the strategic objective is to make alternative fuel vehicles and advanced technology vehicles the preferred choice of many individual private vehicle purchasers.
Over the next five years, the program will result in significant increases in the number of alternative fuel vehicles, reductions in petroleum consumption compared to baseline projections, and reductions in environmental emissions from transportation.
The program's overall goal is to support the introduction and use of over 4 million AFVs over the next five years, a significant increase over the 500,000 AFVs operating in 1998.
These AFVs will displace, by 2004, at least 200,000 barrels per day of petroleum, reduce carbon emissions by 3 million metric tons per year, and reduce annual energy costs (i.e., oil costs) by approximately $1 billion per year.
The Deployment program supports the use of new transportation technologies that will enable dramatic changes necessary to deal with rising dependence on oil imports and the increasing impact of transportation on air quality.
A transportation system that uses a more diverse fuel supply, and less oil overall, will increase competition and provide greater resiliency in the face of external disruptions.
The Department's Comprehensive National Energy Strategy (April 1998) documents the need for deployment activities to complement research and development
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (Cont'd) efforts: "Promoting the acquisition of newly developed alternative fuel transportation technologies for government and private fleets, through efforts such as the Clean Cities program, encourages more widespread use of alternative fuels.
Federal funding, leveraged by significant private investment, can create an infrastructure of corridors in which alternative fuel vehicles can readily find refueling stations, spurring the use of alternative transportation fuels in key regions."
(page 20).
This approach is also endorsed by the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, in its November 1997 recommendations: "Government investment in R
(page 3-9).
The approach to meeting the program goals is to promote both alternative fuel use and advanced vehicles that have significantly improved fuel economy.
The alternative fuel efforts are designed around the multiple goals of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), which supported and renewed the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988.
Alternative fuels of interest include electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, methanol, natural gas, biodiesel and propane.
Relative to petroleum fuel substitution, the basic EPACT goal is to promote the development and use of domestic replacement fuels to substitute for imported petroleum motor fuels to the maximum extent practicable.
Within the context of the basic program goal, DOE focuses its program on those replacement fuels which will have the greatest impact on: reducing oil dependency, improving the nation's economy, and reducing criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.
The Department promotes the increased use of alternative fuels in vehicles, and also the increased use of non-petroleum fuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel, oxygenates) blended into conventional gasoline and diesel fuels.
Both uses of non-petroleum fuels can help promote the goals of EPACT as "replacement fuels" for petroleum-based fuels.
Appropriate Federal Role: With oil prices at record lows, current market conditions are not conducive to widespread use of, and investment in, alternative fuels and fuel efficient vehicles.
In addition, Federal policies do not provide adequate tools to address many of the technical and market barriers to increased use of these vehicles, even though it would be in the national long-term self interest.
Until market and/or policy conditions change, the Federal deployment programs will lay the foundations for future use by focusing on proven niche markets where alternative fuel vehicles and advanced vehicles can successfully compete.
C For the next five years, alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles will be the primary focus.
With over 40 models of alternative fuel vehicles available, the technical risk is low.
However, Federal efforts, such as the successful Clean Cities program, are needed to support the growth of refueling infrastructure and consumer acceptance of AFVs.
To help build consumer confidence in these technologies and encourage private sector investment in supporting infrastructure, the program will: -- forge partnerships with fleet owners, fuel providers, vehicle manufacturers, and State and local governments; -- provide current, accurate, reliable information on all types of alternative fuels and vehicles; -- perform rigorous, structured programs to test and evaluate cars and trucks that use alternative fuels and advanced technologies;
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (Cont'd) -- implement the requirements of the Energy Policy Act; -- promote consumer acceptance of advanced technology cars and trucks with significantly improved fuel economy; and -- encourage the increased blending of non-petroleum fuels into conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and new formulations of diesel fuel.
C Acquisition of AFVs by the Federal fleet remains an important part of the technology deployment program; the current Federal fleet has over 20,000 AFVs.
The program will continue to encourage the use of AFVs in the Federal fleet to help agencies meet and exceed all Energy Policy Act and Executive Order requirements.
During this same period, advanced technology vehicles capable of significantly improved fuel economy will be entering the final development phases; some will already be available commercially.
The program will support educational efforts, testing and evaluation, and deployment planning for these technologies.
The Clean Cities program will help promote these advanced vehicles.
In addition, the program will work with industry and universities to sponsor advanced vehicle competitions that push the technology envelope and expose numerous people to these technologies.
C
I. B. Program Benefits The Department's efforts to encourage the deployment of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles are linked with and support State and local government initiatives.
The Federal investment, together with these complementary efforts, will result in significant changes in the transportation market over the next five years.
By 2004, alternative fuel vehicles will have achieved significant commercial success, and advanced technology vehicles will be poised to enter the market as increasing awareness of the benefits of fuel diversity and fuel-efficient vehicles spurs demand.
In particular: C C C In selected metropolitan areas, alternative fuel vehicles will be common-place and supported by extensive re-fueling infrastructure.
Clean Cities will grow from 67 to over 100 participants but, more importantly, 15% of the Cities will reach their goals for 100% AFV use in specific market niches (e.g., taxis, shuttles, school buses, etc.).
Alternative fuel vehicles will account for 40-50% of the transit bus orders (30% in 1998); 10-20% of school bus orders (less than 1% in 1998); and 10-20% of the covered light duty fleet orders with spillover into the medium duty market (less than 1% in 1998).
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (Cont'd) C C C Cost-shared infrastructure/corridor development will yield 10 times the number of E85 refueling stations (less than 50 in 1998), 5 times the number of EV recharging stations (500 in 1998), and 5 times the number of natural gas stations available in 1998 (1,400 in 1998).
The blend market for renewable fuels will be 50% larger (1 billion gallons annually in 1998).
Vehicle competitions will have demonstrated 60 and 80 mpg cars, and motivated hundreds of highly trained automotive engineers.
Using the Office of Transportation Technologies' quality metrics modeling methodology, it is estimated that about 1 million AFVs will be in operation nationally by the year 2000.
If 50% of these use alternative fuels routinely, they would displace 20,000 barrels per day of petroleum, reduce carbon emissions by 0.21 million metric tons per year, and reduce annual energy costs (i.e., oil costs) by approximately $150 million per year.
These estimates are summarized below: Metric Primary Energy Displaced (quadrillion Btu) Primary Oil Displaced (million barrels per day) Energy Cost Savings ($ billion) Carbon Reductions (million metric tons) 2000 0 0.02 0.15 0.21 2010 0 0.2 0.85 1.82 2020 0 0.21 0.7 1.94
I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (Cont'd) This significant penetration of alternative fuel vehicles, and the resulting oil displacement and cost savings, would not, however, be adequate to meet the ambitious goals set forth in the Energy Policy Act.
As shown in the graph below, the EPACT Section 502(b) goal of 30 % oil displacement by the year 2010 equates to about 3.5 million barrels per day.
With current funding levels and programs, this goal will not be achieved.
However, OTT will work with industry, State, and local governments to identify additional programs that could be developed by the States and Federal government to further increase the use of alternative fuels.

Performance Measures The Deployment program is divided into four complementary program areas: Clean Cities, Testing and Evaluation (which includes the Federal fleet program), EPACT Replacement Fuels Program, and Advanced Vehicle Competitions.
Each program area and its planned accomplishments are described below.
Clean Cities Activity Summary: Clean Cities is a voluntary Federal program designed to accelerate and expand the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in communities throughout the country, and to provide refueling and maintenance facilities for their operation.
As of January 1999, sixty seven communities have joined the Clean Cities program.
Many of these local programs have links across regional and State boundaries to establish Clean Corridors with refueling infrastructure, to allow easier inter-city travel with alternative fuel vehicles.

I. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives I. A. Program Strategy
Management and Planning supports the human resource requirements as well as the Office-level analysis, assessment, evaluation, and planning functions for the Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT).
The objective of this activity is to provide the integrated program direction needed to plan, manage, and oversee the research, development, and technology deployment activities funded by the transportation sector program.
The analytical part of the mission is accomplished by collecting and analyzing technology and market data, using computer models to project technology potential and market share, and calculating program benefits.
The technology assessment activity estimates the impacts, benefits, and costs of advanced transportation vehicle and fuel technologies.
A system of models has been created that: (1) estimates the market shares of new light duty vehicle sales for alternative fuel and advanced vehicle technologies; and (2) calculates the alternative fuel use, petroleum use reductions, and changes in criteria pollutant and global climate change emissions.
These models are continually improved and updated to consider new technology developments, and to be consistent with projections prepared by the Energy Information Administration.
The models are also used to estimate the impacts of individual technology programs during budget formulation and program planning.
The analysis function produces the annual Transportation Energy Data Book; assembles the best past and current data to use in updating transportation sector plans; and supports preparation and updating of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Department of Energy plans.
