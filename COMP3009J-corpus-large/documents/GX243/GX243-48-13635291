GOAL 2: ASSESS AND MONITOR CORAL REEF HEALTH KEY THREATS ADDRESSED Assessing and monitoring coral reef conditions is important to understanding and reducing many threats to these ecosystems.
The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).

RATIONALE FOR ACTION Successful coral reef ecosystem conservation requires adaptive management that responds quickly to changing environmental conditions.
This, in turn, depends on monitoring programs that track trends in coral reef ecosystem health and reveal patterns in their condition Â­ before irreparable harm occurs.
Monitoring can also play a vital role in guiding and supporting the establishment of complex or potentially controversial management strategies such as no - take ecological reserves, fishing gear restrictions, or habitat restoration, by documenting the impacts of gaps in existing management schemes and illustrating the effectiveness of new measures over time.
Long- term monitoring is also required to determine the effectiveness of various _____________________________________________________________________________ 21 National Coral Reef Action Strategy

Goal 2: Assess, Monitor and Forecast Reef Health ______________________________________________________________________________ management strategies to conserve and enhance our coral reef ecosystems.
A rigorous monitoring and assessment program will contribute to and improve coral reef conservation efforts by: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·
Documenting the status of ecologically and economically important reef species.
Assessing and tracking changes in reef communities in response to environmental stressors or specific human activities and uses.
Evaluating the effectiveness of specific management strategies and identify actions for future adaptive responses.
Evaluating the natural recovery and/or restoration of injured or degraded reefs.
Enabling informed decisions about the location of potentially harmful activities by providing baseline data on community composition and predicted ecosystem response.
Providing baselines for assessing catastrophic damage from natural or anthropogenic events such as storms, diseases, climate change, coral bleaching, vessel groundings, and toxic spills.
Serving as an early warning system for identifying declines in coral reef ecosystem health.
The Task Force National Action Plan calls for a coordinated national program to assess, inventory and monitor the health of U.S. coral reef ecosystems.
This monitoring- based goa l is directly linked to the goal to map all U.S. coral reefs as the digital benthic habitat maps aid in designing and implementing local, regional, and national monitoring programs.
Many of the research- based activities also complement or are directly linked to on going monitoring programs within the states, territories, commonwealths, and the Federal Government.
As government and non- governmental partners continue to integrate coral mapping, research, and monitoring studies into a national monitoring effort, the nation's ability to assess coral reef conditions will continue to increase.
ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING STRATEGY The strategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Monitoring subgroup of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The strategy includes the following three major objectives : Objective 1: Working closely with partners and stakeholders, develop and implement a nationally coordinated, long- term program to inventory, assess and monitor U.S. coral reef ecosystems.
Develop a web- enabled data management and information system for U.S. reef monitoring and mapping data, with user- friendly GIS- based mapping and
Objective 2:

Goal 2: Assess, Monitor and Forecast Reef Health ______________________________________________________________________________ querying capability to present complex information in usable formats to all potential users, while ensuring the security of sensitive place- based biological or cultural resource data.
Objective 3: Develop and produce a biennial report on the State of U.S. Coral Reef Ecosystems.
SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2001) In 1999, 50 of the Nation's coral reef managers and scientists drafted a detailed implementation plan for A National Program to Assess and Monitor Coral Reef Ecosystems (National Program) in FY 1999.
In FY2000, NOAA facilitated a workshop for 60 coral reef managers to evaluate the relative importance of environmental threats impacting local reefs and prioritize management needs (e.g., biotic inventories monitoring, research, mapping, and assessments of the sources and extent of reef degradation).
These managers endorsed the National Program plan.
The following is a partial summary of recent accomplishments to begin implementing the plan and achieving the objective s. Objective 1 Accomplishments : Â·
