The provision of support for both the development of new and innovative facility capabilities, and the maintenance and enhancement of existing systems is an important priority for the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) at the National Science Foundation (NSF).
This document, Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discover y, 20042008,complements the GEO Science Plan, NSF Geosciences Beyond 2000 Understanding and Predicting Earth's Environment and Habitability (NSF 00-27).
The capabilities described herein are intended to enable the aims in the Science Plan to be achieved.
Fundamental research in the geosciences requires a vast range of capabilities and instrumentation.
GEO has engaged the community in a variety of long-range planning processes to evaluate opportunities and needs within the geosciences, and to determine the specific facilities, instrumentation, and capabilities that should be developed in support of the science.
The planning and operation of these facilities relies strongly on close communication between GEO staff and the research community.
Indeed, community-based workshops and meetings form the basis for all the major facility components described in this document.
References to these community activities may be obtained from the specific programs.
The active involvement of the research community in the GEO long-range planning process is also manifest in the active role taken by the Advisor y Committee for Geosciences.
Former and present members have contributed substantially to the Science Plan and to this report, which they have endorsed.
We wish to thank all those who have contributed to the document.

Introduction The vision of the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to benefit the nation by advancing the scientific understanding of the integrated Earth systems through supporting high-quality research, improving geoscience education, and strengthening scientific capacity.
The Directorate strives to support creative people, scientifically challenging ideas, and essential tools to achieve success in meeting this goal.
NSF Geosciences Beyond 2000 Understanding and Predicting Earth's Environment and Habitability provides the comprehensive context for future activities and outlines specific Directorate objectives: " Foster discover y and understanding of the factors that define and influence the Earth's environmental and planetar y processes; Expand understanding and predictability of the complex interactive processes that # determine variability in the past, present and future states of planet Earth, # control the origin and current status of the forms of life on the planet, # affect the interdependencies of society and planetar y processes; " " Provide the resulting scientific information in forms useful to society.
This document specifically addresses the essential facilities that have been identified to support the aims of the Directorate.
It first outlines the current facilities for field and laborator y observations, sample collection, computation and data access, and education.
It then provides a sequenced inventor y of future elements that are planned for implementation as funding becomes available and appropriate proposals are considered and successfully reviewed.
The information has been assembled principally by the Directorate staff, based on frequent interactions with the scientific community and through community-based workshops and planning documents.
It has benefited from frequent consultation with and review by the Advisor y Committee for Geosciences.
Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discovery 1 The Facilities Basic research and discover y in the Geosciences requires a vast range of capabilities and diverse instrumentation, including ships and aircraft, ground-based observatories, laborator y and experimental analysis instruments, computing capabilities, and real-time data and communication systems.
Many projects in the geosciences require extensive facilities and platforms to support the study of complex, interdependent processes that may extend from pole to pole.
Comprehensive models of earth systems require significant investments in observational capability and computational systems demanding close coordination between the observational and modeling communities.
Laborator y capabilities for study and analysis are also essential.
The geoscience community relies on sharing access to samples and data for analysis of environmental processes.
It pioneers new approaches to distribute information and develops new technologies to enhance our understanding.
The Directorate for Geosciences is firmly committed to the support of necessar y infrastructure and facilities to support this important research enterprise.
All facilities supported by the Directorate must: " " Be driven by the basic research programs of NSF; Perform at the cutting edge of discover y, continuously evolving and improving services and capabilities; Have efficient and cost-effective management; Be well publicized with accessibility to the broad community; Share partnerships with operating institutions, private foundations, industr y, other agencies, or other nations, as appropriate; Offer challenging educational opportunities.
" " " " This plan outlines the current integrated view of infrastructure fabric for geosciences, and notes the types of facilities and infrastructure currently supported by the Directorate.
More significantly, it notes the strategic investments in facilities and infrastructure needed to enable the geoscience community to continue its pioneering research agenda.
It focuses on the period 2004 to 2008.

An Integrated View of the Future Several themes are expected to dominate the development of research capabilities over the next five to ten years.
Improved Technology: As technology advances our observing systems will improve.
New technology will allow observing systems far more powerful, capable and adaptable than any of our present systems.
Integration Across Disciplines: Boundaries between disciplines are rapidly eroding as the community addresses the challenges of understanding the earth as an integrated system.
Geoscience facilities must provide capabilities for integrated research across the boundaries of ocean, earth and atmospheric sciences, as well as related disciplines outside the traditional geosciences.
Continuing Exploration: As more sophisticated and long-term observing, data collecting, and analysis systems become available, appropriate priority and scheduling must be given to research facilities and infrastructure investments that expand the boundaries of current understanding.

Data Quality and Access: The need to maintain high standards of quality in the data collection systems and database construction is obvious.
As users of large complex data sets become more widely dispersed it is increasingly important to develop practices and procedures ensuring the quality, accuracy, integrity, and availability of the data.
Observing Networks: As our understanding of the Earth's environment matures, our understanding and the needs of sophisticated data assimilation models depend more and more on networks of autonomous observational sensors, all connected via the Internet and accessible remotely.
Interagency and Inter national Coordination: GEO supports facilities primarily because of their utility to NSF investigators, but in many cases these facilities are community-wide resources that receive support from multiple agencies or other countries.

EarthScope: The EarthScope facility is a multi-purpose array of geophysical and geodetic instruments and observatories that will greatly expand the observational capabilities of the Earth Sciences and permit us to increase our understanding of the structure, evolution and dynamics of the North American continent.
EarthScope consists of: " The Plate Boundar y Observator y (PBO):
The Plate Boundar y Observator y is a continentalscale array of continuously recording GPS and strain meter systems that will enable unprecedented observations of deformation of the Earth's crust over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales.
US Array: The US Array is an array of broadband and short-period seismometers that will provide a coherent 3-dimensional image of the structure of the entire continental U.S. and provide a foundation for thorough and systematic seismological-geophysical study of fault patterns at depth and the nature of the earth's crust and upper mantle.

Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discovery 17 Near-term New Capabilities for Computational and Data Access Systems High Perfor mance Computing Capability: Challenges inherent in the computational components of research in atmospheric, ocean, and earth sciences require a capable computing facility (e.g., 35 Teraflops, sustained).
Much GEO research involves the movement and analysis of large (and often disparate) data sets and so highspeed network access, data management, visualization and machine-learning-based data analysis tools are also required as part of this infrastructure.
To make use of this technology requires the human infrastructure of software engineering, operations and programming support.
These facilities would provide computational, analytical, data management, and collaborative services in support of research efforts in all areas IBM SP cluster at NCAR. of the geosciences.
Climate science computational infrastructure: The forefront of climate research in particular requires significant computational and information science resources.
The high-resolution global climate modeling anticipated over the next 35 years requires access to large-capability computing facilities that can sustain 510 Teraflops on a full climate model for periods of two to three months.
The study of uncertainty in climate modeling similarly requires many runs at somewhat lower resolution and so requires capacity more than capability (e.g. dedicated use of one or more large scalar massively parallel processor (MPP) machines).
The rise in regional climate modeling and studies of the regional impacts of climate variability pose a need for dispersed mid-sized computational infrastructure such as multi-node shared memor y machines of moderate size and clusters such as Beowulf clusters operated by university research groups.
Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics: Numerical modeling of the dynamics of the interior of the earth and planets is often the only method available to assess the physical basis for fundamental observation at the earth's surface including magnetic fields, transient deformations of the crust, mantle, and lithosphere due to glacial cycles and earthquakes, and even global seismic wave propagation.
Scaled-down laborator y experiments can help to guide models and the models can further guide experiments, but most experiments require unrealistic scaling of important parameters.
A distributed facility necessar y to develop and maintain computational infrastructure for geodynamic modeling is envisioned.
The facility would include hardware, technical personnel, senior-level numerical analysts and computational scientists, and a governing structure dedicated to modern software design, code validation, and user-friendly graphical interface development for the larger community of Earth and planetar y scientists.

on these high resolution topographic data will allow for new insights into processes including floods, storm surges, landslides, volcanic eruptions, soil creep, erosion and glacial dynamics, that directly influence human activities.
ALSM can provide topographic data at scales appropriate to the scale at which many of these processes operate.
Distributed National Facilities for Geochronology: The Geoscience community is pressing the limits of its ability to accurately and sufficiently measure the rates and processes that have shaped the development of the Earth.
The next generation of cutting-edge geoscience, such as that initiated by EarthScope, requires higher precision and more detailed geochronology data than can be provided by the present laboratories.
Thus, a national facility of distributed geochronology centers needs to be developed.
Additional research infrastructure may also be needed in the area of high-precision isotopic fingerprinting of biogeochemical processes using stable isotope geochemistr y. New Manned Submersible: Alvin, the national facility operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is now well over 30 years old and has been the most scientifically successful submersible in the world.

20 Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discovery Airbor ne and Ground Based-Mobile Atmospheric Observing Instrumentation and Facilities: Research requires advanced mobile airborne and ground observing instruments and facilities that may be easily deployed during field campaigns (e.g., Doppler radar on wheels).
With the continued advances of emerging technologies (e.g., adaptive optics, phased arrays, communications, and data display technologies) platform lifetimes significantly exceed that of instrumentation and supporting infrastructure.
New Instrumentation for Global Upper Atmospheric Observations: Emerging priorities in upper atmospheric research emphasize the need for global observations of the upper atmosphere using robust and easily deployable ground-based instrumentation.
These include new generation lidars capable of probing the mesosphere and lower thermosphere; small, inexpensive Fabr y-Perot interferometers for neutral wind measurements; strategically arrayed magnetometers to detect ionospheric currents; and compact radar systems that can run continuously and provide height-resolved measurements of atmospheric parameters.

Research Vessel Renewal: The current academic fleet is aging and needs replacement.
The Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee (FOFC) issued a report in December 2001 defining a federal interagency renewal strategy for the national academic research fleet over a period of about 20 years.
Of the ships listed in the FOFC plan, the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) is of highest priority for NSF funding.
NSF is also developing plans to support the concept design and construction of the Regional Class ships described in the FOFC plan beginning with a ship for the Gulf of Mexico followed by ships for the Pacific and Atlantic.
Tentative plans are to build 3 Regional Class ships in 6 years with construction funds available beginning in FY06.

Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA): RPA technology is now Observing System for Meteorology, reaching the maturity where it is feasible to do ver y long Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) duration missions (i.e., 48 hours) at an impressive range of satellite constellation altitudes and locations.
Large payload aircraft such as the DARPA-developed Global Hawk would provide the research community with research opportunities that cannot be accomplished with piloted aircraft.
Alternatively, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems instrumented with multi-element arrays of miniaturized chemical sensors or optical detectors, for example, and equipped with advanced communication and control systems could uniquely probe highly variable remote atmospheric regions.
Their incorporation into science programs will be influenced by the regulator y climate.

Fault conditions including mineralogy, pore fluid pressure, and temperature along with the physics of earthquakes within this different environment will test theories and conditions established in SAFOD.
The results will be essential inputs to models of dynamic crustal and mantle motion and earthquake hazard analysis.
Out-years Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR): The Frequency-Agile Solar Radiotelescope is a multi-frequency imaging array composed of many antennas designed specifically for observing the Sun.
It will produce high-quality images of the Sun with high spatial resolution, high spectral resolution, and high time resolution, across more than two decades in frequency.
In so doing, it will produce a continuous, three-dimensional record of the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere up into the mid-corona.
These qualities represent a quantum leap beyond existing solar radio instruments, yet are well within reach of emerging technologies GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Earth Observing System (GEOS): GEOS is a constellation of 12 small research satellites for global monitoring of atmospheric water vapor, temperature, atmospheric ozone, ocean altimetr y, Earth gravity and space weather parameters.
The fleet of instrumented spacecraft envisioned for GEOS will explore the global atmosphere from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of several hundred kilometers, and provide unique geoscience measurements to study the oceans, troposphere, stratosphere and ionosphere as an integrated, interacting system.

22 Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discovery Community Facility for Global Volcanism Research (CFGVR): CFGVR will bring an array of technologies to bear on long-standing problems in volcanic research and provide for the common needs of volcanic researchers.
" Volcano Measurements Facility (VMF): VMF will develop and provide a pool of geophysical, geodetic and atmospheric instruments, and associated wireless communications and remote sensing for the comprehensive and integrated research on volcanic phenomena.
Volcano Data Analysis System (VDAS): VDAS will make available the vast amounts of existing and anticipated volcano-related data and provide community modeling, computational and analytical tools to the research community.
A special focus of VDAS will be the virtual coordination of access to community experimental, computational, and geochemical facilities.
Volcano Observator y and Monitoring System (VOMS): VOMS will develop a network of observational systems that will allow near-real time monitoring of volcanic activity and hazards.
VOMS will also establish deep volcanic observing systems requiring state-of-the-art drilling technologies and high temperature instrumentation.

In the tens of minutes currently required to scan a system, meteorologists have to assume that the storm remains stationar y for the entire volume scan or they have to artificially remove the average speed from a storm or estimate advection during the volume scan.
Next Generation Airbor ne Radar System: ELDORA has been integrated into a Naval Research Laborator y (NRL) P-3 aircraft.
The NSF Electra aircraft was removed from service in 2001.
Development of a surveillance radar capability displaying real-time radar data in the horizontal is a pressing need.
A conformal phased array antenna would be used for airborne weather surveillance radar to allow high-resolution measurements without a need to undertake substantial expensive airframe modifications.
The conformal radar would have a much finer beam diameter (yielding greater spatial resolution) since the antenna could be made ver y large without affecting aircraft drag and performance.
NRL P-3 being outfitted with ELDORA radar at NCAR. 24 Facilities to Empower Geosciences Discovery The Challenges Ahead The future will undoubtedly see substantial change in the way the geoscience community collects samples, performs field and laborator y experiments, exchanges information and data.
Information will become more widely and effectively disseminated for use by scientists and educators alike.
Disciplinar y barriers will be further eroded, data access will continue to revolutionize the way investigators work together, and increasingly researchers will study dynamic earth processes remotely in near real-time.
GEO must be prepared to manage a rapid evolution in the observational and computational capabilities that will empower the scientific community to achieve the exciting advances in understanding and prediction of important phenomena in the geosciences.
