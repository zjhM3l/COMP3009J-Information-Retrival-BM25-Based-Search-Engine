T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF NORTH CAROLINA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the North Carolina Geological Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
In 1998, the preliminary estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for North Carolina was $785 million, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
This was about a 6% increase from that of 19972 and followed a 7.5% increase from 1996 to 1997.
The State remained 19th in rank among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which North Carolina accounted for about 2% of the U.S. total.
_____________ 1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1998 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of February 1999 and are expected to change.
For some mineral commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.
To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.
A telephone listing for the specialists may be retrieved over the Internet at http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/contacts/ comdir.html; by using MINES FaxBack at (703) 648-4999 from a fax machine with a touch-tone handset (request Document #1000 for a telephone listing of all mineral commodity specialists); or by calling USGS information at (703) 648-4000 for the specialist's name and number.
All Mineral Industry Surveys--mineral commodity, State, and country--also may be retrieved over the Internet at http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals; facsimile copies may be obtained from MINES FaxBack.
2 Values, percentage calculations, and rankings for 1997 may vary from the Minerals Yearbook, Area Reports: Domestic 1997, Volume II, owing to the revision of preliminary 1997 to final 1997 data.
Data for 1998 are preliminary and expected to change, while related rankings may also be subject to change.
In 1998, the increased values of crushed stone and phosphate rock accounted for most of the State's rise in value.
The only significant decreases were those that occurred for lithium minerals, feldspar, and construction sand and gravel (table 1).
(Mineral commodity listings are in descending order of change.)
Lithium mineral production declined because of the closure of FMC Corp., Lithium Division's, spodumene mine and lithium carbonate plant at Cherryville near Bessemer City, NC, early in 1998.
In 1997, increases in the values of crushed stone, construction sand and gravel, phosphate rock, and industrial sand a nd gravel significantly offset a substantial decrease in the value of lithium minerals.
Based on 1998 USGS estimates of the quantities of minerals produced in the 50 States, North Carolina continued as the leading2 State in feldspar, crude mica, and pyr ophyllite production; second in common clays and second of two States that produced lithium minerals and olivine; sixth in industrial sand and gravel; and ninth in crushed stone.
The State was second of four States that produce phosphate rock and eighth in the production of dimension stone.
North Carolina mines exclusively have produced industrial minerals since the early 1970's, particularly since the 1971 closing of the Tungsten Queen Mine, an underground tungsten mine in Vance County.
Metal production in the State, especially that of primary aluminum, resulted from the processing of recycled materials or raw materials received from other domestic and foreign sources.
