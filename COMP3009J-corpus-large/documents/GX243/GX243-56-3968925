INTRODUCTION: CRIMINAL LAW SYMPOSIUM Three articles on diverse aspects of military justice are presented in this issue of the Military Law Review.
This is the fourth criminal law symposium issue that the Review has presented since the sym posium series commenced with volume 80, spring 1978.
Previous issues devoted to criminal law are volume 84, spring 1979; volume 87, winter 1980; and volume 88, spring 1980.
In the opening article, Captain Woodruff discusses section V of the new Military Rules of Evidence.
These Rules, replacing chapter XXVII of the Manual for Courts - Martial, govern the use of all types of testimony, documents, and physical evidence, as evidence in court - martial proceedings.
The Military Rules, which become ef fective on 1 September 1980, are largely based upon the Federal Rules of Evidence, promulgated in 1975 for use by United States district courts and magistrates.
The text and analysis of the Military Rules may be found in Appendix 18, Manual for Courts' Martial, added to the Manual by Change 3.
Section V of the Military Rules of Evidence sets forth rules governing use of privileged communications as evidence.
Ex amples of such communications include confidential discussions between lawyer and client, priest and penitent, and husband and wife.
Others less obvious include the Government's privilege of protecting the identity of clandestine criminal informants, the political vote privilege, and the secrecy of deliberations of courts and juries.
Information which has been given a security classifica tion or is otherwise considered sensitive by the Government is also subject to privilege.
An article concerning section V should be especially helpful to judge advocates practicing in the field.
While most provisions of the Military Rules are similar to if not identical with the Federal Rules, section V represents a major exception.
The drafters of the Federal Rules originally proposed an extensive codification of the law of privileges.
However, this part of their work proved extreme ly controversial for many unrelated reasons.
Congress disapproved the proposed section V and substituted a short provision that simp ly preserves prior law intact.
Section V in the Military Rules is based in part on the rejected section V of the Federal Rules.
During the past several years a con-
1
MILITARY LAW REVIEW
[VOL. 92
siderable body of case law and scholarly commentary has grown up around the portions of the Federal Rules which were approved, and all this law is available for use by military attorneys.
Unfortunate ly, little or no such guidance concerning the section V privileges has evolved, except for a few portions taken more or less intact from the Manual for Courts - Martial.
Captain Woodruff's ground - breaking article is followed by "In consistent Defense in Criminal Cases," by Major James F. Nagle.
Criminal defendants occasionally present two or more defenses which may seem to contradict one another.
The defense may con tend, for example, that the defendant did not commit the crime, but that if he did, he was entrapped by government agents, or commit ted an act of violence in self - defense, or took a piece of property under the reasonable but mistaken belief that it belonged to him.
Such defense contentions are not always as illogical as at first they may seem.
The defendant may present one theory, and the government's evidence may raise another entirely different defense.
It is clearly in the defendant's best interests to use both theories if at all possible.
In other cases, such as denial of guilt and assertion of insanity, the defenses are not truly inconsistent.
Fur ther, some courts have felt that, in the case of a defense such as en trapment, the public policy considerations behind the defense are so strong that it should be permitted even if inconsistent with another defense.
Major Nagle provides an extensive review of the federal, state, and military case law on use of inconsistent defenses.
He sorts out the various jurisdictions according to the extent, if any, that their appellate courts have permitted presentation of such defenses.
He concludes that inconsistent defenses are generally permitted in American jurisprudence, but that there are still some major in consistencies in treatment of such defenses between the various jurisdictions, which should be rectified.
Our concluding article by Lieutenant Colonel Norman G. Cooper is a note on military legal history.
Modern western military criminal law and procedure are descended in part from the Swedish Articles of War of 1621, promulgated by King Gustavus I1 Adolphus (1595-1632).This monarch's reputation is based upon his military genius during the Thirty Years' War, a complex religious and economic conflict which tore northern Europe apart in the ear ly seventeenth century.
Gustavus Adolphus initiated extensive

reforms in the recruitment, training, leadership, and support of soldiers, and not the least important were his efforts at moderniza tion of disciplinary practices.
Lieutenant Colonel Cooper discusses the relationship between the Articles of 1621 and our present Uniform Code of Military Justice.
The Military Law Review is pleased to present these articles on criminal law and procedure and legal history.
All of them are valuable additions to the growing body of military legal literature.

PRIVILEGES UNDER THE MILITARY RULES OF EVIDENCE* by Captain Joseph A. Woodruff**
The Military Rules of Evidence became law in 1980 by executive order of the President.
The new rules are based largely upon the Federal Rules of Evidence, signed into law in 1975, and upon former chapter XXVII of the Manual for Courts - Martial.
Captain Woodruff'sarticle focuses on section V of the Military Rules.
This section states rules concerningprivileged communications, such as statements made to an attorney by a client.
Captain Woodruff reviews section V, rule by rule, and compares its text with that of the previous Manual provisions, and with the text of :;heprivilege rules proposed by the drafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence but rejected by Congress.
He concludes that for the most part the new rules do not represent a drastic change from prior military law, and that in certain respects they improve significantly upon that law.

context of an attorney - client relationship, or between priest and penitent, or husband and wife, and sometimes doctor and patient.
In civilian proceedings, the law of privileged communications is generally part of the common law, varying from state to state.
At the federal level, an ambitious attempt was made to codify the law of privileged communications in section V of the Federal Rules of Evidences2This attempt was rebuffed by Congress when the pro posed rules were enacted in 197E1.~ Section V as it now reads is a
9ee the Notes of the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the text of which is reproduced after Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, 28 U.S.C. app., at 556-58 (1976).
Article V or section V of the Rules consists of Rule 501 above.
As originally pro posed by the United States Supreme Court, that section contained thirteen aroposed rules.
Nine different non - constitutional privileges were defined.
Thesc were: required reports privileged by statute, the lawyer - client privilege, the physicianpatient or psychotherapist.patient privilege, the husband - wife privilege, the clergyman.penitent privilege, a political vote privilege, a trade secrets privilege, a privilege for secrets of state and other official information, and identity of criminal informants.
The Congress disapproved the proposed section V. See discussion in footnote 3, infra.
Extensive information about the proposed but rejected rules may be found in the two editions of the Federal Rules of Evidence Manual by Professors Kenneth R. Redden and Stephen A. Saltzburg of the University of Virginia School of Law.
The 1975 edition sets forth the text of a Library of Congress research report at pages 114-28 prepared by a Mr. Charles Doyle in 1973 for the House Judiciary Committee.
The 1977 edition includes the text of the rejected rules themselves.
The 1977 edition and its 1980 supplement are reviewed by Lieutenant Colonel Herbert J. Green at 89 Mil. L. Rev. 96 (1980) and are briefly noted at 89 Mil. L. Rev. 130 (19801.
The Federal Rules of Evidence were prepared chiefly by an Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence appointed by Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1965.
The Commit. tee's initial draft, completed in 1969, was made available for comment by the bench and bar and was extensively revised before it was approved by the Supreme Court and was submitted to Congress in 1973.
Following congressional approval, Presi dent Ford signed the Federal Rules into law on January 2, 1975, as Pub. L. No. 93595, 88 Stat. 1926, effective 180 days later.
K. Redden 
'According to the Notes of the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, sec tion V as originally written was rejected by Congress because it was too controver sial.
Most of the proposed provisions were vigorously attacked by critics, for many different reasons; no concise summary of objections is possible.
The congressional committees concluded that section V would have to be sacrificed to make possible the passage of the remainder of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Apparently no other section of the proposed rules was changed so drastically by Congress.

Note 6, supra.
Section I11 of the Military Rules is entitled, "Exclusionary Rules and Related Matters Concerning Self.Incrimination, Search and Seizure, and Eyewitness Iden tification."
It consists of fourteen separate numbered rules and is one of the largest sections.
The many topics covered include, but are not limited to: self - incrimination (Mil. R. Evid. 301), confessions and admissions (Mil. R. Evid. 304), rights warnings (Mil. R. Evid. 305), unlawful searches and seizures (Mil. R. Evid. 3111, probable cause (Mil. R. Evid. 314, 3151, and eyewitness identification (Mil. R. Evid. 3211.
(The rules in section 111 as published are not numbered consecutively: nos. 307-310 and 318-320 are reserved for future use.)
%ection V of the Military Rules of Evidence consists of twelve numbered rules.
Like section 111, it is one of the largest sections in the Military Rules.
`"The lawyer - client privilege (Mil. R. Evid. 5021, the privilege for communications to the clergy (Mil. R. Evid. 5031, the husband - wife privilege (Mil. R. Evid. 504), the privilege protecting the identity of informants (Mil. R. Evid. 5071, and the political vote privilege (Mil, R. Evid. 509) are all similar to or analogous with privileges found among the section V rules proposed for the Federal Rules by the Supreme Court but rejected by Congress.
The rule on classified information (Mil. R. Evid. 505) and that on government information other than classified information (Mil. R. Evid. 506) are loosely analogous with the proposed privilege for secrets of state and other official information.
The Military Rules include no provision for required reports privileged by statute, an extremely limited physician - patient privilege, and no privilege for trade secrets.
Concerning the physician.patient privilege, see Mil. R. Evid. 501(d). and also notes 14 through 26 and accompaning text, infra.

RULE 501: GENERAL PROVISIONS Rule 501 states the nature and scope of evidentiary privileges allowed under the new rules.
" Neither its limited incorporation of federal rules1*nor its provision describing the kinds of assertions available to a privilege holder13 are significant departures from prior practice.
"Rule 501 reads as follows: (a) A person may not claim a privilege with respect to any matter except as required by or provided for in: (1) The Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the armed forces; (2) An Act of Congress applicable to trials by courts - martial; (3)These rules or this Manual; or (4) The principles of common law generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts pursuant to rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence insofar as the application of such principles in trials by courts - martial is practicable and not contrary to or inconsistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, these rules, or this Manual.
(b) A claim of privilege includes, but is not limited to the assertion by any person of a privilege to: (1)Refuse to be a witness; (2) Refuse to disclose any matter; (3)Refuse to produce any object or writing; or (4) Prevent another from being a witness or disclosing any matter or pro ducing any object or writing.
(c) The term " person " includes an appropriate representative of the federal government, a State, or political subdivision thereof or any other en tity claiming to be the holder of a privilege.
(dl Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, information not otherwise privileged does not become privileged on the basis that it was ac quired by a medical officer or civilian physician in a professional capacity.

Subdivision (d) is a reiteration of the military's longstanding In nonrecognition of any physician - patient pri~i1ege.l~ United States v. Wright,15the Army Court of Military Review held that so long as the medical officer was engaged in his professional capacity as a physician, and was not acting as an investigator, all statements made to him by the accused were nonprivileged and could be received into evidence.
The physician in Wright was a doc tor on duty at the base hospital whom the accused had sought out voluntarily.
That fact distinguishes Wright from cases involving compulsory psychiatric evaluations or sanity boards.16 The argu ment was made that during such compulsory examinations the physician had an investigative or quasi - judicial function; therefore statements by the accused merited protection, as surely as if he or she were being interrogated by a CID investigator.
This issue was resolved in a series of cases.
In United States v. Shaw," a 1958 decision of the Army Court of Military Review, the court found that if a physician - patient privilege existed, the accused had waived it at trial by failing to object and by introduc ing similar evidence himself.
Having thus disposed of the case, the court did not reach the issue of whether a privilege attached.
In the 1959 case of United States v. Burke,'B the defense alleged that sec'"he former paragraph l5ld2) of the Manual for Courts - Martial stated: (2) Communications to medical officers and civilian physicians.
It is the duty of medical officers to supply medical services to members of the armed forces, to make periodical physical examinations as required by regula. tions, and to examine persons for appointment and enlistment, and medical officers may be specifically directed to observe, examine, or attend members of the armed forces.
This observation, examination, or attendance is official and the information thereby acquired is official.
Although the ethics of the medical profession forbid medical officers and civilian physi cians to disclose without authority information acquired when acting in a professional capacity, no privilege attaches to this information or to statements made to them by patients.

tion 4244 of Title 18, United States Code,lg applied in the military.
This statute prevents admission into evidence on the issue of guilt of statements made by an accused during a sanity or competency examination, The then - Army Board of Review opined that section 4244 was not applicable to trials by courts - martial, but stated that it was not forced to so hold since the government psychiatrist did not testify to any statements made by the accused.
The question was finally put to rest in 1966 in United States v. Wimberley,zO where the Court of Military Appeals held that the privilege established by section 4244 was not applicable to military criminal practice.
The Court reasoned that paragraph 121 of the Manualz1 was the military equivalent of section 4244 in that it established a preliminary proceeding to determine mental capacity.
Therefore, paragraph 151d2) of the Manualzzwas dispositive of the privilege provision.
Rule 501(d) does not disturb these precedents.
Rule 302, however, gives the accused a privilege to prevent any statement made by him during a mental examination, ordered under paragraph 121, from being received into evidence.z3 The privilege created by Rule 302 goes further than the section 4244 privilege.
Section 4244 restricted the admission of such statements on the issue of guilt.
Rule 302 prevents their use both on 1918U.S.C. para. 4244 reads in pertinent part:

If the accused opens the door by offering expert testimony concerning his or her mental condi tion, the military judge may order release of the examination report to the prosecution, with the accused's statements excised.
And should the defense offer a portion of the accused's statements into evidence, the military judge may, in the interest of justice, order the release of all such statements.26 The 1966 holding in Wimberley has not been repealed, however, and section 4244 has not been made applicable to courts - martial.
Rules 302 and 501(d), taken together, replace paragraph 151c(2) of the Manual.
As explained above, Rule 302 is a privilege of broader application than its 8 4244 counterpart.

RULE 502: THE ATTORNEY - CLIENT PRIVILEGE
Of all the confidential relationships for which evidentiary privileges may be granted, those of husband and wife, and of at torney and client are two whose roots penetrate so far into the history of the common law that their protection is almost assumed as a matter of course.
Of course, any evidentiary privilege is an im pediment to the judicial search for truth and must be justified by sound policy.
The attorney - client privilege rests on three stout pillars.
First is the salutory purpose of encouraging frank and open discussion between the lawyer and his client.
The second justifica tion is that the attorney, by his representation of his client, is in ef fect his client's alter ego, and the attorney - client privilege is a vicarious extension of the privilege against self - incrimination.
Finally, the privilege is a reflection of the lawyer's duty to preserve the confidences of his client.27This third consideration has found expression in the American Bar Association's Code of Professional Responsibility.28 The military justice system recognized the necessity of the attorney - client privilege and expressly incorporated it into the

A recent article discussing the lawyer - client privilege in military law is The AttorneyClient Privilege under Military Rule of Evidence 502, by Captain Kenneth Gale, JAGC, U.S. Army, published at 12 The Advocate 335 (1980).Captain Gale con cludes that Rule 502 is an improvement over prior law, combing the best of the old Manual provisions and the best of the proposed Federal Rule.

Manual.29As was the case in civilian courts, the privilege extended to "[c]ommunications between a client or his agent, and his at torney or the agent of the attorney, if made while the relationship of client and attorney was in existence, made in connection with that relationship, and under circumstances not indicating a lack of confidentialit~."~O Thus stated, the rule was subject to two important exceptions.
First, no privilege attached where the communication "clearly contemplated the future commission of a fraud or crime."31Second, when a person outside the privileged relationship gained knowledge of the confidential matter by either accident or design, the right to invoke the privilege was Since the privilege is designed to protect the relationship that ex ists between attorney and client, one of the threshold requirements is that such a relationship must exist.
Whether such a relationship exists is a question of fact.
The military courts have held that the mere designation by a convening authority of appointed counsel does not create an attorney - client relationship in the absence of an acceptance of the appointment by the accused.33Likewise, the ex istence of the relationship has been held not to depend upon the legal qualifications of counsel,34and the privilege may attach even though the counsel is not a lawyer.35Similarly, the existence of the 2tl
Communications between a client or his agent and an attorney or his agent, such as the attorney's clerk, stenographer, or other associate.
are privileged when made while the relationship of client and attorney existed in connec tion with that relationship, unless the communications clearly con. templated the future commission of a fraud or crime, for instance, perjury or subornation of perjury.

privilege does not depend upon the kind of proceeding that occa sioned the establishment of the attorney - client relati~nship.~~ Rule 502 of the Military Rules of Evidence does not substantially alter the traditional attorney - client privilege, and, except for ex pressly extending the privilege to nonlawyer counsel, it is a mirror image of proposed Federal Rule 503.
As written, the rule creates a privilege held by the client protecting against disclosure "confiden tial communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendi tion of professional legal services to the client."37 The rule goes on to create five exceptions to the privilege, one of which, the future crimes exception, had a counterpart in prior practice.

A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communica tions made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client, (1)between the client or the client's representative and the lawyer or the lawyer's representative, (2) between the lawyer and the lawyer's representative, (3) by the client or the client's lawyer to a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest, (4) between representatives of the client or between the client and a representative of the client, or (5) between lawyers representing the client.

maining exceptions, some are codifications of prior waiver rules and others are completely new.3a The second exception, concerning opposing nonclient parties who both claim through a common deceased client, has no parallel in pre - rule case law.
The Advisory Committee Comments on the pro posed Federal Rule imply that this exception is applicable when an attorney is called as a witness in a dispute between two parties who both claim the right to assert the privilege as representatives of the witness attorney's deceased client.39The applicability of such an exception to a military criminal trial is doubtful since the govern ment will never be in a position to assert, by representation, the privilege of a deceased.
This does not mean, however, that relevant testimony cannot be adduced from the attorney of a deceased witness.
For example, assume the following situation: A, the accused, is on trial.

L as part of his duties as an attorney.
If D had waived his personal privilege before he died,40 the attorney would be free to testify because A would have no privilege to a~sert.~' The third exception to the general rule of attorney - client privilege exempts from protection communications relating to an alleged breach of the attorney's duty to his client.42This exemption is closely related to the earlier rule of waiver for a client who charges his attorney with inc~mpetence.~~ Whereas the exception is narrow in scope, applying only to conversations relevant to the issue of breach of duty, the waiver provision removed the privilege from all attorney - client comm~nications.~~ is doubtful that military It courts will substitute the (d)(3) exception for the former waiver rule, because waiver by allegation of incompetence is a longstanding and well - recognized feature of the attorney - client privilege.45 Subsection (d)(4) exempts from the ambit of the rule testimony by an attorney who was an attesting witness to a document which is in issue.
This exemption may be likened to the holding of the Court of Military Appeals in the case of United States v. Marrelli.46 In its opinion the Court distinguished between actions by an attorney which are legal in nature and those which are not, protecting the former but not the latter.47Clearly a lawyer may render purely legal service to a client in the drafting of a document and still perform the nonlawyer act of attestation.
According to Marrelli the only nonprivileged evidence would be that which related to the process of attestation.
According to the M.R.E. there is no privilege as to any issue "concerning an attested do~ument,"~~ presumably in cluding the advice given during the drafting process.
The final exception expressed in Rule 502 deals with communica tions made by opposing litigants to counsel they retained or con`OSince the attorney - client privilege is perpetual in duration, it survives the death of the client, in the absence of waiver.

sulted together.49By its terms the exception applies only when the testimony i s offered "in an action between any of the clients."50 This makes the rule wholly inapplicable to trials by court - martial since such trials are not actions "between" any of the clients.
Representation of both the accused and the government by the and same counsel in the same case is expressly f~rbidden,~' where it occurs a presumption of prejudice to the accused arises, tainting all subsequent proceeding^.^^ Furthermore the communications between co - accused and their counsel are expressly embraced by the general rule of privilege.53 Interestingly enough, the most striking change to the attorney client privilege brought about by the M.R.E. is not found in Rule 502 at all.
Rather it is Rule 51 1 which rids the privilege of the harsh and unfair exception for inadvertent or involuntary disclosure.
Rule 511 makes evidence of privileged matter inadmissible if disclosure was erroneously compelled or made without an op portunity for the holder to assert his privilege.54 This effectively reverses the provision of paragraph 151 b(2) of the Manual allowing eavesdroppers to testify as to communications presumed by the parties to be confidential.

law phen~menon.~~ Nevertheless the same policy judgments justify ing the traditional common law privileges apply to the relationship between the individual penitent and his or her spiritual advisor.
Military law recognized the confidential nature of this relationship and fashioned an evidentiary privilege for communications be tween a person and a "chaplain, priest, or clergyman . . . made.
. . as a formal act of religion or concerning a matter of con~cience."~~ There is very little military case law in this area.
In United States v. Kidd,57the court found no prejudice to the accused by the fact that a chaplain conducted the post - trial interview and rendered an adverse clemency recommendation, in the absence of any evidence indicating an unauthorized disclosure of confidential inf~rmation.~~ Obviously there is no presumption of prejudice as is the case with defense counsel performing the same function.
In United States v. Hender~on,~g prejudice resulted from a chaplain no refusing to testify as to words spoken to him by the accused, in

A person has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication by the person to a clergyman or to a clergyman's assistant, if such communication is made either as a formal act of religion or as a matter of conscience.
(b)Definitions.
As used in this rule: (1)A "clergyman" is a minister, priest, rabbi, chaplain, or other similar functionary of a religious organization, or an individual reasonably believ ed to be so by the person consulting the clergyman.
(2)A communication is "confidential" if made to a clergyman's assistant in the assistant's official capacity and is not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than those to whom disclosure is in furtherance of the purpose of the communication or to those reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication.
(c) Who may claim the privilege.
The privilege may be claimed by the per son, by the guardian or conservator, or by a personal representative if the person is deceased.
The clergyman or clergyman's assistant who received the communication may claim the privilege on behalf of the person.
The authority of the clergyman or clergyman's assistant to do so is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

light of the fact that the chaplain later returned and testified fully.
The court declined to speculate as to what result would have ob tained had the chaplain remained silent.
It should be noted, however, that the holder of the privilege is the penitent, not the cleric.60And in United States v. Moore,61the court indicated its in tent to construe the rule strictly when it declared that a letter writ ten to a nun fell outside the privilege.
Rule 503 of the M.R.E. is a recodification of the Manual's state ment of the privilege,62 plus an adoption of the definition of " clergyman " found in the proposed F.R.E.63The Advisory Com mittee pared this definition down further in its comments: [I]t is not so broad as to include all self - denominated " ministers.
" A fair construction of the language requires that the person to whom the status is sought to be attached be regularly engaged in activities conforming at least in a general way with those of a Catholic priest, Jewish rabbi, or a minister of an established Protestant denomination though not necessarily on a full - time Like the other paragraph 151b(2)privileges, the priest - penitent communication was made subject to the eavesdropper exception.
And like the attorney - client privilege discussed above, and the spousal privilege discussed below, Rule 511 of the M.R.E. cures the problem.

EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES
One final aspect of this otherwise placid rule deserves comment.
Rule 503 does not provide for closed sessions to minimize un necessary disclosure when clerics are required to testify.
Yet in the Henderson65case the judge closed the courtroom to the public when the chaplain returned to the stand.
The Court found no prejudice or impropriety.
However, this case was twenty years prior to the United State Supreme Court's decision concerning public access to criminal trials,66 and Henderson may no longer be a foundation upon which a similar order may rest.
V. RULE 504: THE MARITAL PRIVILEGE Traditionally the marital privilege has been divided into a spousal competency branch67 and a confidential communicat,ions branch.@ Both aspects have long been recognized in military law and both branches have been carried over, with certain modifica tions, to the M.R.E.69 By contrast, the federal rule, as originally 65Note59, supra.

Husband and wife are competent witnesses in favor of each other.
Although husband and wife are also competent witnesses against each other, the general rule is that each is entitled to a privilege prohibiting the use of one spouse as a witness against the other.
" 68Former para 151M2) of the Manual states in relevant part, " Confidential com munications between husband and wife, made while they were husband and wife and not living in separation under a judicial decree, are privileged.
However, a confiden. tial communication between husband and wife is not privileged when the marital relationship was a sham at the time the communication was made.

A person has a privilege to refuse to testify against his or her spouse.
(b)Confidential communication made during marriage.

A person has a privilege during and after the martial relationship to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, any confidential communication made to the spouse of the person while they were husband and wife and not separated as provided by law.

proposed, would have codified the holding in Hawkins v. United States,'O a position that has been subjected to unfavorable criticism and has been rejected by the National Conference on Uniform State Laws.71 The proposed federal rule would have established a com petency privilege running to the criminal accused but would not have created a privilege for confidential marital communications.72 The M.R.E. solution was to create a competency branch privilege consistent with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Trammel v. United States,73 and a confidential communications branch similar to that suggested by the Uniform Rules of Evidence.
(3) Who may claim the privilege.
The privilege may be claimed by the spouse who made the communication or by the other spouse on his or her behalf.
The authority of the latter spouse to do so is presumed in the absence of evidence of a waiver.
The privilege will not prevent disclosure of the communication at the request of the spouse to whom the communication was made if that spouse is an accused regardless of whether the spouse who made the communication objects to its disclosure.

McCormick, supra note 45, at 9: 86.
The Advisory Committee's Notes for proposed Rule 505, F.R.E., state the commit tee's reasons for rejecting the confidential communications branch: The rule recognizes no privilege for confidential communications.
The traditional justifications for privileges not to testify against a spouse and not to be testified against by one's spouse have been the prevention of marital dissension and the repugnancy of requiring a person to condemn or be condemned by his spouse.
8 Wigmore QÂ§ 2228, 2241 (McNaughton Rev. 1961).
These considerations bear no relevancy to marital communications.
Nor can it be assumed that marital conduct will be affected by a privilege for confidential communications of whose existence the parties in all likelihood are unaware.
The other communication privileges, by way of con trast, have as one party a professional person who can be expected to in form the other of the existence of the privilege.
Moreover.
the relationships from which those privileges arise are essentially and almost exclusively verbal in nature, quite unlike marriage.

EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES
A. THE SPOUSAL COMPETENCY BRANCH The former competency rule, as found in chapter XXVII of the Manual, was that spouses were competent witnesses in each other's behalf, and were also competent adverse witnesses, but that each spouse had the privilege of prohibiting such adverse testimony.74 In other words both the witness spouse and the party spouse were considered to be equal holders of the privilege.75As was the case at common law,76this branch of the privilege was limited in duration by the existence of an actual state of marriage.77 the termination of which extinguished the privilege.
The privilege was further limited by what is best known as the "injury e~ception,"~8 which precluded the party spouse from asserting the privilege with respect to those injuries to the witness spouse which were deleterious to the marital relation~hip.~~ However, in United States v. Moore, the Court of Military Appeals declined to apply the injury exception to the privilege of the witness spouse as well.80 changes military law in this area.
Under present law, see present Manual paragraph 148e, each spouse has a privilege to prevent the use of the other spouse as an adverse witness.
Under the new rule, the witness spouse is the holder of the privilege and may choose to testify or not to testify, as the witness spouse sees fit.
But see Rule 504(c)(exceptions to the privilege).
Implicit in the rule is the presumption that when a spouse chooses to testify against the other spouse the marriage no longer needs the protection of the privilege.
Rule 504(a) must be distinguished from Rule 504(b),Con fidential communication made during marriage, which deals with com munications rather than the ability to testify generally at trial.
Although the witness spouse ordinarily has a privilege to refuse to testify against the accused spouse, under certain circumstances no privilege may exist, and the spouse may be compelled to testify.
SeeRule 504(c).

fense charged; the fact that the evidence tended to establish a separate uncharged offense against the spouse was not enough.83 Under the new rule, both spouses are competent to testify but can prohibit each other's adverse testimony, as before.
The new rule limits the duration of the privilege to a period of actual matrirn~ny,~~ denies the privilege when, at the time testimony and is given, the marital relationship is a sham.85 It is the injury exception that has been the most revised.
Under the M.R.E., the injury exception applies only "[iln proceedings in which one spouse is charged with a crime against the person or pro perty of the other spouse or a child of either, or with a crime against the person or property of a third person committed in the course of committing a crime against the other spouse."86The focus of the in jury seems to have shifted from an injury to the marital relation ship to personal or property injury to the witness spouse.
If this is indeed the case, then it is questionable whether such injuries to the marital relationship as adultery87will survive the adoption of the new rule.
An argument could be made, however, based upon the underlying policy of the rule, to construe the kinds of personal in-

juries contemplated to include the mental anguish resulting from such offenses.88 The new formulation of the injury exception also appears to change the doctrine that the injury must be the result of the charg ed offense.
The last phrase of the exception denies the privilege where the accused is charged with a crime against the person or property of another that arose out of the commission of " a crime'' against the spouse.
The rule does not require that the misconduct directed toward the spouse be part of the charges.
Therefore if the evidence offered to prove the offense includes evidence of an injury to the spouse, then no privilege exists to shield that spouse's testimony.
Perhaps the most profound change in this branch of the privilege is the change in which spouse holds the privilege.
The proposed F.R.E. 505 would have the party spouse as the holder, and the Manual gave the privilege to both spouses, but the United States Supreme Court, in the case of Trammel v. United limited the privilege to the witness spouse only.
The M.R.E. codifies the Trammel position.
Rule 504(a)simply states, "A person has a right to refuse to testify against his or her spouse.
" In the majority opi nion in Trammel, Mr. Chief Justice Burger wrote, " This modifica tion - vesting the privilege in the witness spouse - furthers the im portant public interest in marital harmony without unduly burden ing legitimate law enforcement needs."g0 Rule 504, M.R.E., contains no waiver provision, and the general waiver provision of Rule 510 applies only to confidential com munications.
It is unclear how the waiver mechanism for the spousal competency privilege operates.
Under the old chapter XXVII of the Manual, the scope of cross - examination was limited .

generally to the matters covered by direct e~amination.~' Likewise a spouse who testified on behalf of the other was subject to cross examination, provided the cross - examination was limited to the issues testified to on direct, and to the question of ~redibility.~~ Rule 611(b) of the M.R.E. limits the scope of cross to the subject matters of direct examination, but allows`the military judge to per mit "inquiry into additional matters as if on direct."93In relation to the former practice, the new rule would seem to make waiver of the competency privilege occur when the witness spouse voluntarily testifies either as a favorable or adverse witness.
In sum, the spousal competency branch adopted in the M.R.E. is the privilege of a witness spouse to refuse to give testimony adverse to the accused spouse, during the existence of a bona fide marriage and limited by an injury exception that focuses upon per sonal or property injury rather than upon injury to the marital rela tionship.
B. THE
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
The military version of this branch of the marital privilege, both before and after adoption of the M.R.E., is essentially the same privilege for interspousal confidences found' at common law.
Unlike the competency branch, which when properly invoked bars all adverse testimony, this branch shields only confidential disclosures or communications made while the parties were mar-

ried, " the nature of which would betray conjugal confidence and A " communication " may be an utterance or a writing, but does not include conduct unless the conduct is intended as a substitute for an utterance.95 Such confidential communications, under the Manual and the M.R.E., are privileged from disclosure for a duration unlimited by the continuance of a marital relation s hip.96 The only exceptions or limitations placed upon the privilege by former chapter XXVII of the Manual were that: (1) an accused spouse could compel disclosures by the witness spouse not withstanding the fact that the witness was the communicator and hence the theoretical holder of the privilege, and (2) a person out side the protected relationship could be compelled to testify concer ning any presumably confidential communication he or she overheard, whether by accident or design.97 Rule 504 expressly Wnited States v.

""The privilege does not terminate uDon a breach in the marital relation but lives on in prepetuity,-as does the attorney-ciient privilege, " Fontanella, supra note 92, at 182.
Mil. R. Evid. 504(b)(l) states in part: " A person has a privilege during and after the martial relationship to refuse to disclose.
. . any confidential communication.
" 97Para.151b(2)of the Manual, supra note 5, explained the two exceptions or limita tions upon the privilege of confidential spousal communications as follows: The privilege pertaining to confidential communications between hus band and wife will not prevent allowing or requiring such a communication to be disclosed at the request of the spouse to whom the communication was made if that spouse is an accused, and this is so even when the spouse who made the communication objects to its disclosure.
The privilege pertaining to privileged communication between husband and wife, client and attorney, or penitent and clergyman, which is based on a recognition of the public advantage that accrues from encouraging free communication in these circumstances, will not prevent allowing or requir ing a person outside the privileged relationship who either by accident or design gained knowledge of the communication to testify concerning it, nor will it prevent the reception in evidence of a writing containing the com. munication which was obtained by such a person either by accident or design.
But see 152.
However, this exception to the general rule does not ap ply if the person outside the privileged relationship who gained knowledge of the privileged communication or who obtained the writing containing it did so, as to a communication between husband and wife, with the con. nivance of the spouse to whom the communication was made, or.
as to a communication between client and attorney or penitent and clergyman, with the connivance of the attorney or clergyman or agent thereof or in any other manner not reasonably to be anticipated by the client or penitent.

adopts the first of these two limitations98 and by so doing effective ly makes the accused spouse the holder of the privilege regardless of the accused's role in the communication.99 However, the working of Rule 504(b)(l),taken together with Rule 511, apparently rejects the second limitation allowed by chapter XXVII.
According to the general provision of the rule, a person may not only refuse to disclose, but may also "prevent another from disclosing"'00 any confidential communication made to his or her spouse.
Rule 511 states that, even if a holder of the privilege has disclosed the privileged matter to another, if such disclosure was "compelled erroneously or was made without an opportunity.
. . to claim the privilege,"'01 such disclosure does not constitute a waiver of the privilege.
When considered in tandem, these two provisions clearly permit an accused to seal the lips of a stranger to the mar riage who has overheard or obtained knowledge of the subject mat ter of a communication intended to be confidential.
Another change in the new rule is the creation of an injury excep tion for the confidential communications branch where none ex isted previously.
In the old chapter XXVII, the injury exception was included only in the paragraph dealing with the competency of witnesses,lo2and the courts treated this as creating no injury excep tion for the admissibility of confidential communications.103Rule 504(c), however, extends to the confidential communications branch the same injury exception which applies to the spousal com petency ~rivilege.1~~

One unusual aspect of the marital privilege, under the old as well as the new practice, not found in either the F.R.E. or Uniform Rules of Evidence, deserves brief mention at this point.
That feature is the proviso that the mere fact that the parties are not living together when the confidential communication is made does not change the privileged nature of the communication.'05 This provi sion is obviously a recognition of the fact that military service often requires periods of long separation of spouses, and that it is therefore neither fair nor logical to condition the marital privilege upon cohabitation.
The topic of waiver for confidential communications and the ap plication of Rule 510 is discussed hereafter in depth in Part IX.
VI. RULES 505 AND 506: CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION The United States Supreme Court, in the Reynolds case,Io6held that an evidentiary privilege exists whereby the government may withhold or prevent the disclosure of military and state secrets.
Like the privilege of concealment of the identity of police in formant~,'~~ a privilege in the hands of the party bringing a such criminal prosecution is fraught with potential for abuse and must be carefully controlled.
Most of the text of Rules 505 and 506 of the M.R.E. are devoted to the procedures to be employed in determin ing whether a claim of privilege is to be denied and, when a claim is denied, to the procedures applicable for controlling unnecessary disclosure of nonrelevant information.
Accordingly, this section focuses both on the procedural aspects of the rules and the substan tive nature of the privilege.

EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES
A. THE NATURE OF THE PRIVILEGE The 1969 Revised Edition of the Manual provided, "Official com munications and documents containing military and state secrets . . . are privileged from disclosure in a court - martial proceeding where in the opinion of the head of the executive . . . agency con cerned such disclosure would be detrimental to the national interest."lo8This rather broad privilege was strictly controlled by the requirement that nondisclosure of relevant classified material by the government required the government to abandon the prosecution.lo9The government could, however, elect to exclude the public from the trial and appoint members to the court, including counsel, who had sufficient security clearances.11o There was authority for the proposition that, whenever classified information related to the case, even if the document involved was only a classified in vestigative report, the convening authority had to appoint defense counsel who possessed the requisite security qualifications.'"
In United States v. Reyes,ll* the Air Force Court of Military Review held that the defense must be allowed to introduce classified evidence once it has established the relevance and ad missibility of the evidence.ll3 The government could elect either to permit the introduction of the proffered evidence, or to cease pro secution of the charge to which it related.'14 The Court of Military Appeals summed up the government's problem in the case of United States v. Gagnon,'l5 when it held that the military judge was without power to order that highly classified information be made available to defense counsel.
As the court observed, "A judge who has made a determination that this hard choice is unavoidable can then recess the trial while the decision is weighed by the convening authority, , , ."'le

Classified information is privileged from disclosure if disclosure would be detrimental to the national security.
The government pays a price for the enjoyment of this privilege, however.
The first paragraph of the official analysis following the text of Mil. R. Evid. 505 explains succinctly: Rule 505 is based upon H.R. 4745,96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979).which was proposed by the Executive Branch as a response to what is known as the " graymail " problem in which the defendant in a criminal case seeks disclosure of sensitive national security information, the release of which may force the government to discontinue the prosecution.
The Rule is also based upon the Supreme Court's discussion of executive privilege in United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953) and United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 687 (1974).
The Rule attempts to balance the interests of an accused who desires classified information for his or her defense and the interests of the government in protecting that information.

Nixon.132 The Court characterized the privilege as applying only to "communications between high Government officials and those who advise them,"'33 but added that "when the privilege depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations a confrontation with other values a~ises."'3~ Clearly the greatest problem facing the military judge is that of striking the balance between the due process guarantee of the fifth amendment and confrontation and com pulsory process rights of the sixth amendment on the one hand, and the alleged detriment to public interest on the other hand.
Certainly the first step is to determine what kind of public interest is involv ed.
In United States v. Progressive I ~ c . , where the issue facing the '~~ court was whether to enjoin the publication of nuclear weapons design information, a United States district court found as a matter of fact that publication by the defendant of certain restricted data136 would result in "direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to the United States."13' The balance in that case was between harming the public interest and preserving first amendment guarantees.
The guarantees of the fifth and sixth amendments are certainly no less jealously guarded.
As the Supreme Court stated in Nixon, "[Tlhe generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal Therefore, in order to sustain a claim of "public interest" privilege, the court must find palpable and irreparable damage to the public safety or to the proper conduct of an essential govern mental function.139 These rather difficult problems may possibly be vitiated by an in terpretation of the rule which limits its scope narrowly.

(Emphasis added.)
Two inferences may be drawn from this language.
First, the judge could determine that material that is not classified meets the criteria established for classification and is therefore the proper subject of a claim of privilege.
And second, the military judge could determine that the material is improperly classified; that the criteria established by executive order, statute, or regulation, have not been met.
As to the first inference, Rule 505(a),note 118, supra, and Rule 505(bl(l),note 120, supra, com. bine to negate it.
Rule 505(a) creates a privilege only for "classified information," which is defined by 505(b)(l)as material "that has been determined . . . to require protection against unauthorized disclosure."
Clearly this means that material must beclassified to be subject to the privilege, The second inference remains.
The judge could, upon inspection, determine that the material is not properly classified and that the privilege does not apply.
This ap parently substitutes a judicial determination for an administrative one.
Not withstanding the problems associated with this blurring of the separation of the judicial and executive functions the wording of the rule clearly empowers the military judge to effectively declassify material he determines not to warrant classification.
This same language is used in Rule 505(i)(3) and will be dealt with again.

EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES
terest of a fair trial, the government may still protect itself from unreasonable compromise by closing the doors of the court to the public.
Before the military judge convenes an "in camera proceeding" under Rule 505(i),the government must demonstrate to the military judge that its claim of privilege is properly taken.lgl This requires, as does subdivision (g) concerning Jencks Act motions, that the military judge determine whether the information involved is pro perly classified.'g* This not only calls for a substitution of the judge's assessment of the national security value of the informa tion for the classifying authorities' assessment, it also requires the judge to make a determination for which his training may not have equipped him.
Also raised, but not resolved, is the question of whether the military judge may determine that the nation's securi ty is not implicated and may sua sponte order declassification.
Notwithstanding what the rule does not resolve, it clearly does give the military judge the authority to make the following deter minations: He may determine the information to be irrelevant to an element of the offense or to a legally cognizable defense, and ex clude the evidence.
He may determine the evidence to be relevant but inadmissible.
He may conclude that the evidence is relevant, admissible, and properly classified (therefore privileged).
Or he may determine that the evidence is relevant and admissible but not properly classified (therefore not privileged).lg3 is with these last It two options that we are concerned.
If the relevant and admissable evidence is privileged, the military judge may permit the government to elect an alternative to full disclos~re'9~ unless the interest of fairness requires otherwise.lg5If the relevant and admissible evidence is not privileg ed, then no alternatives to full disclosure are available.

The previous chapter XXVII of the Manual allowed the head of an executive agency or military department to substitute a summary in lieu of the original if a determination was made that disclosure of the original would result in "detriment to the public interest."*02The authority to determine whether a summarized exhibit will be admit ted under the M.R.E. now rests instead with the military judge.

The Rule is similar in scope to the best evidence rule found in para. 143a(19)of the present Manual except that specific reference is made in the rule to recordings and photographs.
Unlike the present Manual, the Rule does not contain the misleading reference to "best evidence" and is plainly applicable only to writings, recordings, or photographs.

If the head of an executive or military department or independent governmental agency determines that it would be detrimental to the public interest to disclose the text or informational source of a certain official record kept under the authority of the depart. ment or agency, a properly authenticated (143b(2)(f)) certificate or statement signed by him, or by his deputy or assistant, setting forth a summary of the record is as admissible in evidence as the record itself, provided that the certificate or statement contains a statement to the effect that the abovementioned determination was made.

sessions nor does it permit the record of trial to be classified.204 In sum, the new classified information privilege confers upon the military judge greater authority and flexibility than he or she en joyed under the former practice.
Along with this expanded authori ty comes the threat of blurring the separation between the judicial and executive functions by substituting the judgment of one for the other.
The procedures established in the M.R.E. are an excellent at tempt to balance the competing interests of the government and ac cused.
Yet the military judge should be mindful of the public's right to open access to criminal trials and he should consider that right before ordering that the proceedings be closed.
Rule 506 does not really establish a public interest privilege for the government.
Rather it provides the judge and the accused with procedures to be followed when sensitive, nonclassified informa tion is sought to be discovered.
It also provides guidelines to deter mine when the government will be forced to produce such evidence or abate the prosecution.

Closed sessions are authorized by Rule 505(j)(5), note 199, supra.
Classification of trial records is covered by Rule 505(jH6),as follows: (6)Record of trial.
The record of trial with respect to any classified matter will be prepared under paragraph 82dof this Manual.
Para 82dof the Manual, supranote 5, reads as follows: d. Security classification.
When the record contains information which is required to be classified by the security regulations of the armed force con. cerned, the trial counsel will take appropriate action in accordance with per. tinent regulations to assign a proper security classification to the record.
However, convening authorities, staff judge advocates, and legal officers will be on the alert to downgrade or declassify a record of trial which does not contain data requiring security protection.
If the papers accompanying the record of trial include classified matter which is not material to the in quiry, this matter should be withdrawn from the papers to be bound with the record if the withdrawal will permit downgrading or declassification of the record.
If the accompanying papers include classified matter which is material to the inquiry, action should be taken to have this matter declassified or downgraded when that action is possible and will permit downgrading or declassification of the record.

enforcement authorities.205As originally expressed this privilege extended not only to the identity of the informer but to all com munications between the informer and the police.206When the Manual was first published it adopted this view and granted to in formants' communications a status equal to that of the delibera tions of courts and juries, and of diplomatic corre~pondence.~O~ But as the policy underlying the rule, to protect the informant from future dire consequences,208came into clearer focus, the courts began to shrink the scope of the privilege so that eventually only the informant's identitywas protected.209 In Roviaro v. United the Supreme Court denied the privilege of withholding an informant's identity at trial when the informer was a material participant in the crime2" or was a witness whose testimony was necessary for a fair determination of the case.212Declining to enunciate a fixed rule, the Court adopted a balancing test in which the need for secrecy is weighed against the defendant's right to prepare his defense, by considering the crime 205Vogel Gruaz, 110 US.311 (1884). v. zosId.

- (1) State secrets and police secrets.
- Communications made by informants to public officers engaged in the discovery of crime are privileged.
The deliberations of courts and of grand or petit juries are privileged, but the results of their deliberations are not privileged.
Diplomatic correspondence is privileged and, in general, so are all oral and written official communications the disclosure of which would, in the opinion of the head of the executive or military department or independent governmental agency concerned, be detrimental to the public interest.
The privilege that extends to communications made by informants to public officers engaged in the discovery of crime may be waived by ap propriate governmental authorities.
This privilege does not warrant the exclusion from evidence of statements of informants which are inconsistent with, or might otherwise be used to impeach, their testimony as witnesses.

The remainder of that provision, which concerns primarily in formants, is as follows:
The deliberations of courts and of grand or petit juries are privileged, but the results of their deliberations are not privileged.
The identity of persons supplying information to public officials engaged in the discovery of crime is privileged against disclosure, and the communications of these in formants imparting the information are also privileged to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of the informant's identity.
The privilege pertianing to the identity and communications of in. formants may be waived by appropriate governmental authorities.
This privilege is no longer applicable once the identity of the informant has been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent his communication.
Also, the privilege is not applicable with repect to an informant the disclosure of whose identity is necessary to the accused's defense on the issue of guilt or innocence.
Whether such a necessity exists will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the offense charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informant's testimony, and other relevant factors.
When the prosecution used an infor mant as a prosecution witness, the privilege pertaining to communications made by informants is waived by the Government with respect to statements or reports of the informant which relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, and therefore the privilege cannot be applied in opposition to an attempt by the defense to discover or disclose such a statement or report of the informant.
See 153 b (Impeachment of witnesses).
The principles expressed above, however, cannot be applied in opposition to a proper invocation of the privilege pertaining to diplomatic cor.

cases discussed above, but also as followed by military courts.218 Subsequent discussion of this topic will focus upon the provisions of Rule 507 of the M.R.E., including a discussion of the general rule and its exceptions, waiver, and the procedures established.
A. THE GENERAL RULE 1.
The Nature of the Privilege.
The privilege expressed in Rule 507 is essentially a recapitula that tion of the holding in R~viaro,~'~ the government has a privilege to withhold disclosure of an informant's identity.220 The respondence or to communications the disclosure of which would, in the opi nion of the head of the executive or military department or independent governmental agency concerned, be detrimental to the public interest.
In this connection, it should not be considered that the mere fact of disclosure of the communications or identity of informants is, of itself and regardless of the nature of the disclosure, detrimental to the public interest.
However, it should be recognized that invocation of such privilege might, depending upon the circumstances of the case, make it impossible to pro ceed with the trial where to do so would prejudice the substantial rights of the accused.
See 33f.
2'8Theprivilege may be limited only to protect the identity of the informant: United States v. French, 10 C.M.A. 171,27 C.M.R. 245 (1959).The privilege does not extend to situations wherein the informant was an active participant, or when the infor mant's testimony is necessary for a fair trial: United States v. Ness, 13 C.M.A. 18, 32 C.M.R. 18 (1962), United States v. Skywark, 37 C.M.R. 944 (A.C.M.R. 1967).
Disclosure is not required where the informant is a mere conduit for information: United States v. Miller, 43 C.M.R. 671 (A.C.M.R.),pet. denied, 43 C.M.R. 413 (1971).
'19353 U.S. 53 (1957).
ZZoThe privilege is set forth in Rule 507(a),Mil. R. Evid., as follows:
(a) Rule of privilege.
The United States or a state or subdivision thereof has a privilege to refuse to disclose the identity of an informant.
An "infor mant" is a person who has furnished information resulting in an investiga tion of a possible violation of law to a person whose official duties include the discovery, investigation, or prosecution of crime.
Unless otherwise privileged under these rules, the communications of an informant are not privileged except to the extent necessary to prevent the disclosure of the in formant's identity.
The rule is explained as follows in the official analysis: (a) Rule of privilege.
Rule 507(a) sets forth the basic rule of privilege for in formants and contains the substance of present Manual paragraph 151M1).
The new Rule, however, provides greater detail as to the application of the privilege than does the present Manual.
55
MILITARY LAW REVIEW
[VOL. 92
rule with respect to communications is stated in the negative: "The communications of an informant are not privileged except to the ex tent necessary to prevent disclosure of the informant's identity.22' This does not reflect any substantive change in the rule as it has evolved.
One curious aspect of the original statement of the privilege was the definition of the word "informant."
The rule as originally published stated, "An `informant' is a person who has furnished in formation resulting in an investigation of a possible violation of law to a person whose official duties include the discovery, in vestigation, or prosecution of crime."222 Both the proposed F.R.E. and the Uniform Rules of Evidence define an informant as one who "furnished information relating to or assisting in an investigati or^."^^^ A question of interpretation was clearly raised.
On the one hand it could be argued that this choice of words bodes nothing new.
None of the leading decisions concerning the privilege have focused on whether an investigation was in progress at the time the information was provided.
Furthermore, even if a person supplies information to law enforcement officials which is part of a broader inquiry, such information will result in a separate investigation of the facts contained therein.
Therefore the M.R.E. merely uses different words to express the same concept.
It could be argued, however, that this definition merely distinguishes an informant or conduit of information from an ac tive participant in the crime, shielding the former but not the latter.
This argument would seem to have two weaknesses.
First, such a definitional distinction seems to be unnecessary in the face of R ~ v i a r d ~ ~M ~ C r a y .Secondly, such a definitional resolution and ~~~.
The privilege is that of the United States or political subdivision thereof and applies only to information relevant to the identity of an informant.
An "informant" is simply an individual who has supplied "information resulting in an investigation of a possible violation of law" to a proper per son and thus includes good citizen reports to command or police as well as the traditional "confidential informants" who may be consistent sources of information.

eliminates the need for an exception dealing with informants whose testimony concerns an issue of guilt or innocence.226 The counter argument is that the intent of the drafters is clear on the face of the rule.
Since this is a privilege held by the state, the rule should be strictly construed against the state.
Therefore the only "informant" is a person who provides information where there is no on - going investigation, since only then can the disclosure "result in an investigation."
All other police sources of information are "witnesses" and do not have the need for confiden tiality.
An alternative definition was available in the Uniform Rules and proposed Federal Rules; yet it was rejected in favor of the version at hand.
The consequences of such a definition were potentially disastrous.
The problem was brought to the drafter's attention and corrective action has been taken.227 2.
Exceptions
An exception to the government's privilege is made when the in formant's identity "is necessary to the accused's defense on the 226This exception is set forth at Mil. R. Evid. 507(c)(2), follows: as (2) Testimony on the issue ofguilt or innocence.
If a claim of privilege has been made under this rule, the military judge shall, upon motion by the ac cused, determine whether disclosure of the identity of the informant is necessary to the accused's defense on the issue of guilt or innocence.
Whether such a necessity exists will depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the offense charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informant's testimony, and other relevant factors.
If it appears from the evidence in the case or from other showing by a party that an informant may be able to give testimony necessary to the accused's defense on the issue of guilt or in nocence, the military judge may make any order required by the interests of justice.
2270n July 3, 1980, the author discussed this problem with Major Fredric I. Lederer, JAGC, then of the Criminal Law Division, Office of The Judge Advocate General, Department of the Army, at the Pentagon.
Major Lederer, now an instructor at the Marshall - Wythe School of Law, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va., was at that time a member of the committee that prepared the new military rules.
Major Lederer stated that the intention of the drafters was to mirror the proposed Federal Rule as to the functional definition of "informant."
He advised the author that the argument raised was valid and unanticipated, and would have to be ad-

issue of guilt or innocence."22* This would include not only factual defenses, as implied by the rule, but affirmative defenses as welLZ29 and other situations where a full and fair resolution of the case would be made possible by In determining whether the necessity exists the military judge is required to apply the balancing test prescribed in R~viaro.~~' all balancing tests this Like one relies upon uncertain standards, but the more recent cases in dicate that something more than mere speculation by the defense is required to trigger this exception to the privilege.232 Therefore the burden of proving the necessity of disclosure is on the defense, and a claim of necessity must be supported by some credible evidence.
Another exception is created for situations wherein the testimony of the informant is required to determine whether sufficient pro bable cause existed for the search that resulted in the evidence offered by the government.233 This exception is tied procedurally to dressed by the committee.
During a subsequent conversation between the same par ties on July 7, 1980, Major Lederer informed the author that, as a result of the 3 July discussion, the committee had included a proposed change to Rule 507(a)in the draft of the then unpublished executive order amending and correcting Exec.

The accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the person, place or property searched; the accused had a legitimate interest in the property or evidence seized when challenging a seizure; or the accused would otherwise have grounds to object to the search or seizure under the Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the armed forces.
(3) Legality of obtaining evidence.
If a claim of privilege has been made under this rule with respect to a motion under rule 311, the military judge shall, upon motion of the accused, determine whether disclosure of the iden. tity of the informant is required by the Consititution of the United States as applied to members of the armed forces.
In making this determination, the military judge may make any order required by the interests of justice.
The official analysis of this rule explains as follows: (3) Legality of obtaining evidence.
Rule 507(c)(3) is new.
The Rule recognizes that circumstances may exist in which the Constitution may re quire disclosure of the identity of an informant in the context of determin ing the legality of obtaining evidence under Rule 311; see, e.g., Franks v. Delaware, 438 US.154,+ -, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 2684 (1978); McCray v. Illinois, 386 US.300 (1967) (both cases indicate that disclosure may be required in certain unspecified circumstances but do not in fact require such disclosure).
In view of the highly unsettled nature of the issue, the Rule does not specify whether or when such disclosure is mandated and leaves the determination to the military judge in light of prevailing case law utilized in the trial of criminal cases in the Federal district courts.
234This requirement is set forth at Mil. R. Evid. 311(e)(l), follows: as (e)Burden of proof.
(1)In general.
When an appropriate motion or objection has been made by the defense under subdivision (d),the prosecution has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that evidence was not obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure.
235That to say, the evidence is assumed to have been unlawfully obtained and is is treated accordingly.
This results from the application of Rule 311(a),Mil. R. Evid.: (a) General rule.
Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure made by a person acting in a governmental capacity is inadmissible against the accused if:
(1)Objection.
The accused makes a timely motion to suppress or an objec tion to the evidence under this rule; and

seems to be upon the defense to demonstrate that is necessary.
In light of the Supreme Court's decision in ythe defense must offer some evidence to show that the ,~~~ was an "active participant in or witness to the crime in order to vitiate the privilege.
The burden imposed on the defense to overcome the policy supporting nondisclosure in such cases has been characterized as heavy.238
B. WAIVER Since the government is the holder of the privilege,239 certain ac tions by the government can abrogate the privilege.*`O Although the M.R.E. classify these actions as exceptions to the privilege, they are more properly viewed as types of waiver.
The acts that con stitute waiver are (a) the disclosure of the identity of the informant to "those who would have cause to resent" the inf~rmant,~~' (b) and calling the informant as a prosecution These same waivers are found both in paragraph 151b of the Manual and in the proposed Federal rules.
The disclosure contemplated by the first branch of the waiver rule is a revelation of the informant's identity to the persons from 236386 300 (1967).

As the Advisory Committee observed in the Federal rules, "disclosure.. . to another law enforcing agency is not calculated to undercut the objects of the privilege."z43 Therefore the fact that the police have shared their in formation with other law enforcement authorities is not a waiver.
It is interesting to note that disclosure to a hostile person by the informant is binding on the government as a waiver, notwithstan ding that it is the government, not the informant, that is the holder of the privilege.
The underlying reasoning is perfectly sound.
Once an informer has revealed his identity, no policy justification exists for prolonged governmental silence.
The witness branch of the waiver rule is grounded upon the deter mination that the defense interest in full and fair disclosure is serv ed by the ability to cross - examine all government witnesses.
In Harris v. United States,244 Ninth Circuit stated that the defense the interest in inquiring into the credibility of adverse witnesses outweighed the government's desire to conceal the fact that its witness was a paid informant.
Since the fact of a person serving as an informant bears upon his credibility as a witness, the govern ment waives its privilege by calling him.

ing whether revelation is necessary, the military judge may hold an out - of - court hearing under Article 39(a).246 When insufficient or in conclusive evidence is produced in the 39(a) session, disclosure of the informant's identity may be the only means of determining whether the government claim of privilege is well taken.
This presents a procedural difficulty for the military judge.
Arti cle 39(a) requires the presence of the accused and of counsel from both sides.247 Disclosing the informant's identity to the judge in the presence of the accused is hardly a satisfactory way of preserving the government's privilege.
Therefore some kind of in camera pro ceeding may be required.
This is not the same kind of in camera hearing provided for in Rules 505 and 506, however.
As previously discussed, those rules define an in camera hearing as a 39(a)session but at which the accused and his that is closed to the counsel are still present.
There is substantial federal case authority for the judge to hold an inquiry in chambers wherein he or she compels disclosure of the informant's indentity out of the hearing of the This pro cedure would have been required in federal district courts had the proposed Federal Rule 510 been enacted.250 Given the mandate of Article 36 of the Uniform to conform military practice to accepted federal practice, this in camera procedure could probably be successfully urged upon a military court.

Upon an inquiry into the validity of the findings or sentence, a member may not testify as to any mat ter or statement occurring during the course of the deliberations of the members of the court - martial or to the effect of anything upon the member's or any other member's mind or emotions as influencing the member to as. sent to or dissent from the findings or sentence or concerning the member's mental process in connection therewith, except that a member may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention of the members of the court - martial, whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member, or whether there was unlawful command influence.

IX. RULE 510: WAIVER BY VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE Various kinds of waiver have been discussed in the sections deal ing with the particular privileges,262 a discussion of the general but rule of waiver by voluntary disclosure has been deferred until now.
Traditionally, waiver is said to occur when one intentionally relin quishes a known right.263 But when one voluntarily discloses a con fidential communication, lack of knowledge that the communica tion was privileged is irrelevant.264 Waiver by voluntary disclosure, and its counterpart, failure to object to disclosure by another, are well recongnized in military case law265 and are mentioned in the Rule 510 does not significantly alter these provisions.
It is instructive to note, however, that disclosure of "any significant part of the matter or communication" is a waiver of the whole, if the privilege is a sec tion V privilege.267 Yet partial voluntary disclosure of statements 262Examplesinclude waiver of the attorney - client privilege by allegation of in competence; waiver of the government's informant identity privilege by action of the informant; and waiver of the spousal competency privilege by divorce.

266Manualfor Courts - Martial, supra note 5, para. 151 b(2).
This former Manual paragraph has been discussed in part at note 97, supra.
The waiver rules are stated negatively, as follows: The general rule is that the disclosure of a privileged communication between husband and wife, client and attorney, or penitent and clergyman should not be required or permitted unless the person who is entitled to the benefit of the privilege consents to the disclosure of the communication or has otherwise waived the privilege, as when he has consented to a disclosure of the communication at a previous trial or hearing.
Unless he voluntarily testifies concerning the communications, an accus ed who testifies in his own behalf, or a person who testifies under a grant or promise of immunity, does not, merely by reason of so testifying, waive any privilege pertaining to communications between husband and wife, client and attotney, or penitent and clergyman to which he may be entitled.
267This provided in Rule 510(a),which reads as follows: is (a) A person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure of a confidential matter or communication waives the privilege if the person

privileged by Rule 302 does not automatically constitute a waiver as to all such statements.z68 The primary exception to this kind of waiver is that, if the disclosing communication is itself subject to a privilege, than no waiver has A second exception, contained in subsec tion (b), provides that "an accused who testifies in his or her own behalf or a person who testifies under a grant or promise of im munity" does not, merely by testifying, waive any privilege per taining to confidential matter or communications.270These provi sions parallel the old waiver rules in the Manual, except that the Manual's provision applied only to the attorney - client, clergypenitent, and husband - wife privilege^.^^' Rule 510(b) applies to all section V privileges, many of which did not fall within the ambit of paragraph 151 b(2).272
X. RULE 511: INVOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS Subdivision (a) of Rule 511 effectively abrogates the rather harsh result of inadvertent or involuntary disclosure of otherwise privileged communications mandated by paragraph 151b(2) of the Manual.
How these sections operate with regard to the attorney client, husband - wife, and priest - penitent privileges has been or the person's predecessor while holder of the privilege voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the matter or communication under such circumstances that it would be inappropriate to allow the claim of privilege.

discussed in the sections addressing the individual rules.
The net effect of Rule 511(a)is to preserve the privileged nature of confiden tial communications that have been compromised by compulsion or under circumstances that do not allow for assertion of the privilege.
The rule thus prevents involuntary waiver.
This subsection is virtually a verbatim adaptation of proposed Rule 512, F.R.E.
As the Advisory Committee observed, the kind of compulsion contemplated by the drafters as necessary to trigger the rule does not require the holder of the privilege to exhaust all legal recourse.
To require such a standard would, in the words of the committee, "[elxact of the holder greater fortitude in the face of authority than ordinary individuals are likely to p o ~ s e s s .

Evid. 512 (not enacted), Advisory Committee Notes.
The text of Mil. R. R. Evid. 511(a)is as follows: (a) Evidence of a statement or other disclosure of privileged matter is not admissible against the holder of the privilege if disclosure was compelled erroneously or was made without an opportunity for the holder of the privilege to claim the privilege.
The official analysis explains thus: Rule 511(a)is similar to proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 512.
Placed in the context of the definition of "confidential" utilized in the privilege rules, see, e.g., Rule 502(b)(4),the Rule is substantially different from present military law inasmuch as present law permits utilization of privileged in formation which has been gained by a third party through accident or design.
See present Manual paragraph 151 Ml).
Such disclosures are generally safeguarded against via the definition of "confidential" used in the new Rules.
Generally, the Rules are more protective of privileged in formation than is the present Manual.

Wire or radio operators, military and civilian, may be ordered or subpoenaed to testify before courts - martial as to wire or radio communications, and telegrams and radiograms may be brought before courts - martial by the usual process.
But see 151b(l) and the next to the last paragraph of 152.
*T5Theformer Manual provision, near the end of para. 152, reads thus: Evidence is inadmissable against the accused if it was obtained under such circumstances and in such a place that its use against him would be prohibited by section 2515, title 18, United States Code, pertaining to the prohibition of the use as evidence of certain intercepted wire or oral com munications, or by section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934 (82 Stat. 223; 47 U.S.C. Q 605), as amended, pertaining to the unauthorized divulgence or publication of wire or radio communications.
The Statute at 18 U.S.C. 5 2515 (1976) was enacted in 1968, as part of title 111of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90 - 351, 82 Stat. 211, codified at 18 U.S.C. 2510 - 2520 (1976).Entitled "Prohibition of use as evidence of intercepted wire or oral communications," it states: Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.
The current counterpart of the former Manual provision at para. 152 is Mil. R. Evid. 317.
A detailed analysis of its application is beyond the scope of this inquiry.

[VOL. 92
1934.276 Therefore, nonprivileged, confidential communications obtained by illegal wiretapping were inadmissible.
However, this still left as admissible supposedly confidential communications obtain ed in the course of otherwise legal electronic surveillance.277 The new rule eliminates this gap by preserving the privileged nature of wire or oral communications by the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, or any Military Department for purposes of enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
(cl Regulations.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, members of the armed forces or their agents may not intercept wire or oral communications for law enforcement purposes except as follows: (1)in the United States, under subdivision (b);and (2)outside the United States, under regulations issued by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned.
The official analysis of Rule 317 is as follows: (a)General rule.
The area of interception of wire and oral communications is unusually complex and fluid.
At present, the area is governed by the Fourth Amendment, applicable federal statute, DOD directive, and regula tions prescribed by the Service Secretaries.
In view of this situation, it is preferable to refrain from codification and to vest authority for the area primarily in the Department of Defense or Secretary concerned.
Rule 31 7(c) thus prohibits interception of wire and oral communications for law en forcement purposes by members of the armed forces except as authorized by 18 U.S.C. 0 2516, Rule 317(b), and, when applicable, by regulations issued by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned.
Rule 317(aJ, however, specifically requires exclusion of evidence resulting from non compliance with Rule 317(cJonly when exclusion is required by the Con stitution or by an applicable statute.
Insofar as a violation of a regulation is concerned, compare UnitedStates v. Dillard.

Rule 317(b) is intended to clarify the scope of 18 U.S.C. 0 2516 by expressly recognizing the Attorney General's authority to authorize applications to a federal court by the Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, or the military departments for authority to intercept wire or oral com munications.

confidential communications notwithstanding the person's use of telephonic or wireless means of c~mmunication.~~~ XI. RULE 512: COMMENT UPON OR INFERENCES FROM CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE
A strong argument can be made that to allow an adverse party to comment upon, or to allow a jury to draw an adverse inference from the assertion of an evidentiary privilege is to diminish the value of that privilege to the holder.
The drafters of both the F.R.E. and be faced with determining the legality of electronic surveillance.
They recommend consultation of Federal decisions interpreting 18 U.S.C. $5 2516 -2518 (1976).
For Department of the Army policy and procedures for the lawful gathering of electronic evidence, see Army Reg. No. 190.53, Interception of Wire and Oral Com munications for Law Enforcement Purposes (1 Nov. 1978).
Z78The text of Mil. R. Evid. 511(b)is as follows: (b)The telephonic transmission of information otherwise privileged under these rules does not affect its privileged character.
Use of electronic means of communication other than the telephone for transmission of information otherwise privileged under these rules does not affect the privileged character of such information if use of such means of communication is necessary and in furtherance of the communication.
The official analysis explains thus: Rule 511(b) is new and deals with electronic transmission of information.
It recognizes that the nature of the armed forces today often requires such information transmission.
Like present Manual paragraph 151Ml),the new Rule does not make a nonprivileged communication privileged; rather, it simply safeguards already privileged information under certain cir cumstances.
The first portion of subdivision (b) expressly provides that otherwise privileged information transmitted by telephone remains privileged.
This is in recognition of the role played by the telephone in modern life and par ticularly in the armed forces where geographical separations are common.
The Committee was of the opinion that legal business cannot be transacted in the 20th century without customary use of the telephone.
Consequently, privileged communications transmitted by telephone are protected even though those telephone conversations are known to be monitored for whatever purpose.
Unlike telephonic communications, Rule 511(b) protects other forms of electronic communication only when such means "is necessary and in fur therance of the communication."
It is irrelevant under the Rule as to whether the communication in question was in fact necessary.
The only relevant question is whether, once the individual decided to communicate, the means of communication was necessary and in furtherance of the com munication.
Transmission of information by radio is a means of com munication that must be tested under this standard.

The M.R.E. also prohibit any comment upon the claim of a privilege by witnesses other than the accused, but allow adverse in ferences to be drawn when "determined by the military judge to be required by the interests of justice."2'36 This represents a con siderable narrowing of the previous rule, and probably eliminates any constitutional objections from the face of the rule.
Military judges, however, must be wary of allowing adverse inferences to be drawn from the assertion of a privilege by any defense witness who could arguably be said to be vicariously raising a privilege held by the accused.
Under cases such as Courtney v. United Stateszs9 and United States v. Pariente,z90one can argue that to draw such an adverse inference would be tantamount to infringing upon the ac cused's fifth amendment protections.
The remaining subdivisions of Rule 512 are direct adaptations of proposed Rule 513(b) 
No inference may be drawn therefrom.
The official analysis states in part: (a) Comment or inference not permitted.
Rule 512(a) is derived from pro. posed Federal Rule 513.
The Rule is new to military law but is generally in accord with the Analysis of Contents of the present Manual; United States Department of the Army, Pamphlet No. 27-2, Analysis of Contents, Manual for Courts - Martial, 1969, Revised Edition, 27-33,27-38(1970).
Rule 512(a)(l)prohibits any inference or comment upon the exercise of a privilege by the accused and is taken generally from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 513(a).
288This provided in Rule 512(a)(2), follows: is as (2) The claim of a privilege by a person other than the accused whether in the present proceeding or upon a prior occasion normally is not a proper subject of comment by the military judge or counsel for any party.
An adverse inference may not be drawn therefrom except when determined by the military judge to be required by the interests of justice.
The official analysis continues: Rule 512(a1(2)creates a qualified prohibition with respect to any inference or comment upon the exercise of a privilege by a person not the accused.
The Rule recognizes that in certain circumstances the interests of justice may require such an inference and comment.
Such a situation could result, for example, when the government's exercise of a privilege has been sus tained, and an inference adverse to the government is necessary to preserve the fairness of the proceeding.

Subdivi sion (b) requires that proceedings be conducted "so as to facilitate the making of claims of privilege without the knowledge of the members."291In San Fratella v. United States,292 Fifth Circuit the found reversible error in the fact that the prosecutor called the defendant's wife to the stand and caused her to claim her fifth amendment privilege after she had informed the court without the jury present of her intention to do so.
Although the privileges ad dressed in section five of the M.R.E. do not rise to constitutinal level, such cases as San Fratella can serve as the authority for Here arguing that they must nevertheless be jealously guarded.293 again the military judge should carefully weigh any decision to per mit a witness to claim a privilege in the hearing of the jury rather than in an out - of - court hearing.

CONCLUSION The Military Rules of Evidence have been a subject of prime im portance to military criminal practitioners for quite some time and will no doubt continue to be so.
They represent the single most far reaching revision of court - martial practice since the Code was enacted over three decades ago.
With the automatic amendment provision of the Rule 1102, they promise to be a vibrant and evolu tionary feature of substantive military law.
The privileges section is no exception.
For the first time a limited physician - patient privilege is created which applies to statements made by an accused during a mental evaluation.
The attorney - client, priest - penitent, and husband - wife privileges for confidential communications are no longer subject to an exception for eavesdroppers.
In keeping with recent constitu tional litigation, the spousal competency privilege has been placed in the hands of the witness spouse, and, in keeping with good sense, the injury exception has been extended to confidential interspousal communications.
The military judge has been given greater authority and an ex panded role to play in determining the applicability of the goverriment's privilege to safeguard state secrets.
Additional alternatives have been created so that the government no longer faces the pro spect of automatic dismissal if it stands on its privilege.
Rule 506 emerges as a rule which, if improperly invoked as a device for con cealing governmental information from the accused, faces the government with the prospect of constitutional defect in the pro ceedings.
However, if it is properly employed as a discovery pro cedure, the government and defense may both find it highly useful.
The M.R.E. codifies a privilege for the identity of police in formants that is in keeping with accepted federal practice.

of the rule was marred, however, by an unfortunate defect in the definition of "informant," a defect which survived several stages of review prior to the adoption of the rule.
Due to the research of the author of this article, however, the problem has been brought to the drafter's attention and corrective action, by way of an amending Executive Order, has been taken.
Also eliminated from military practice is the harsh provision which held all electronic communications to be nonconfidential.
This is a recognition not only of the societal impact of technological advances, but also of the extent of an individual's right to privacy.
Practice under the Military Rules of Evidence will be more demanding and will require the best that counsel can give.
At the same time, the new Rules will reward creativity and afford counsel the opportunity to utilize fully their profes sional abilities.

INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
IN CONSISTENT DEFENSES IN CRIMINAL CASES* by Major James F. Nagle**
Occasionally a criminal defendant will respond to charges with two or more theories which may seem to contradict each other.
He or she may say, in effect, "I did not shoot the victim, but if I did so, it was in self -defense."
Civilian courts have taken many different positions on the extent to which this type of pleading is permissi ble, and military courts have permitted it in some cases but not others.
Major Nagle has extensively reviewed the case law on the sub ject.
He examines the decisions of state and military courts, but concentrates on the United States courts of appeals, where most of the authoritative positions on inconsistent defenses have been developed.
Major Nagle notes that in some cases the defenses used are not truly inconsistent, in the sense that factual proof of one does not necessarily imply disproof of the other.
Insanity and self defense provide one example.
In other cases, such as a claim of en*The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of The Judge Advocate General's School, the Department of the Army, or any other governmental agency.

trapment coupled with denial of guilt, there may be policy reasons for permitting such defenses even if they are inconsistent on the facts.
Major Nagle concludes that use of inconsistent defenses is generally permitted in American jurisprudence.
He feels, however, that so many variations in treatment of inconsistent defenses exist between jurisdictions as to result in significant unfairness to some defendants.
The United States Supreme Court has not acted to resolve some of the glaring inconsistencies of treatment among the various federal circuits, nor has the Court of Military Appeals done all that it could to clarify the state of military law on the subject.
Major Nagle argues that it is time for corrective judicial action.
I. INTRODUCTION One wants to say to the defense, "Shorn of technicality, what do you really want? Which way would you have it. . .
Either position is legitimate, but choose.
It ill behooves you to try to have it both ways."'
These words, written by a Maryland appellate judge, demonstrate the natural frustrations that courts often experience when confronted with the logical absurdity known as inconsistent defenses.
Such defenses arise when the accused, in effect, argues, for example, "I didn't shoot him, but if I did, it was in selfdefense."2 Such a tactic is clearly not a preferred strategem.
Inconsistent defenses have been described as: likely to mislead the 'Bartram v. State, 37 Md. App. 115, 364 A.2d 1119 (1976), aff'd, 280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 114 (1977).

"Inconsistent defenses" in this article means those defenses which, when asserted by a single defendant, are inconsistent with one another, such as denial and self defense.
It does not refer to those situations which arise in joint trials when the co defendants each allege a different defense which is inconsistent with that alleged by the other, nor those situations in which one lawyer represents two clients who assert inconsistent defenses.

fraught with great risk,4 multifarious and confu~ing,~ "hunting always with a shotgun, never with a rifle,"6 a device sure to destroy the defendant's credibility,' and a tactic no competent attorney would utilize.8 Despite such criticisms, inconsistent defenses have specifically been permitted to some extent in seven federal circuit^,^ 26 states,'O and the military,'l and seem to be a generally accepted principle in American jurisprudence.12 The reasons given for such acceptance have varied; most promi nent are: 1.
It is improper to force a defendant to admit certain essential facts (usually the commission of the "criminal" act) in order to avail himself of a defense such as self - defense or entra~ment.'~ While such an analogy certainly has analytic merit, one distinguishing factor is that in Simmons the Supreme Court was dealing with forced choices between two clear constitutional rights.
However, affirmative defenses such as entrapment are not perceived as constitutionally based.

The defendant should be accorded every reasonable protection in defending himself against pro~ecution.'~ 3.
Inconsistent defenses often aid in the search for the truth by presenting different facts and theories to the fact finder and thereby enabling the fact finder to attach credibility to whatever facts and theory it believes.'5
A fourth justification might well be that it is, under certain cir cumstances, an indispensable tool for the defense counsel.
Con sider the following example: The client tells his counsel that he did not kill the victim and, in fact, was 100 miles away at the time.
The prosecution, however, has four eyewitnesses who positively iden tify the client as the assailant.
They testify further that the victim was advancing with a knife on the client.
If the counsel must rely solely on the client's version, then he is relying on an alibi defense that will be obliterated by the prosecution evidence.
Conversely, he is presented with a classic example of self - defense which, if he is allowed to present it, could save the client's life.
If inconsistent defenses are permitted, he may argue both denial and self - defense to the fact finder.16 While many jurisdictions have accepted the theory of inconsis tent defenses, that acceptance has varied greatly.

16Another justification advanced for inconsistent defenses in entrapment cases is that it is unsound public policy to let police misconduct go unnoticed because the defendant who must either admit the "crime" and claim entrapment or deny the crime, chooses the latter.

dant has a constitutional right to present evidence which raises in consistent defenses.18 Furthermore, decisions diverge greatly on, first, what inconsistent defenses will be accepted.
Self - defense and denial are generally accepted,lg but entrapment and denial are not.20Second, decisions vary on how the defenses may be raised.
Can the defendant himself testify to both, or must the state's own evidence raise one of the defenses?2'

DEFINITION This divergence of views is readily apparent when one seeks to find a common definition for "inconsistent defenses."
Rarely will a court attempt to give any specific meaning to the phrase.
Usually the courts will merely say the defenses are inconsistent and then permit them or not.
This lack of specificity has caused a division of the tactic into three separate meanings - alternative defenses, truly inconsistent defenses, and antithetical defenses.
Apparently the courts feel that the word "inconsistent" is clear enough to require no further clarification.
In civil cases it is said that "the test of inconsistency of defenses is whether proof of one necessarily disproves the other."22 This rule seems to have been adopted in criminal cases so that "mutually exclusive defenses" is often used as a substitute for "incon~istent.defenses."*~ Confusion has resulted, however, because there is a subjective dividing line between what is permissibly and impermissbly in consistent.
Some courtsz4 have stated that inconsistent defenses are allowed as long as they are not too inconsistent or as long as proof of one does not necessarily disprove the otheraZ5 This seems

to be a contradiction in terms and illustrates the extent of the con fusion on the subject.
Other courts have utilized analysis of the facts involved to determine that defenses, which on the surface ap pear to be inconsistent, are not so.26 To provide a framework for analysis, the subject of inconsistent defenses can conveniently be divided into three levels.
The first level consists of the inconsistent defenses which are merely alternative because they can coexist at the same time and proof of one does not disprove the other.
For example, alibi and in sanity might at first glance appear to be inconsistent but upon analysis they clearly are not.
A person can be 100 miles away from the scene of the crime and still be insane.27 It is difficult to draw an exact logical line of demarcation between the second and third levels because of the conflicting decisions that have been issued in this area.
An arbitrary distinction, however, can be drawn on the basis of the traditional way courts have viewed certain defenses.
The second level comprises those cases which appear factually inconsistent but which have historically been viewed by the courts as not so repugnant as to be impermissible.
Two prime examples of this have been accident and self-defense,28 and denial and self The third level which the courts tably repugnant.
this prohibition of antithetical defenses consists of those defenses have viewed as so inconsistent as to be insuppor While some courts have, quite logically, applied to cases involving alibi,30it has most commonly

Some courts have rejected it t0tally,~3 while others have parsed the relevant facts to show that the defenses are not necessarily inconsistent under the circumstance~.~~ 111.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT The modern doctrine has been the result of a long development stemming from the early days of the Republic.
The early cases dealt with pleas in bar or pleas in abatement and it was only at the turn of the century that affirmative defenses began to be discussed.
The first such embryonic step took place in Commonwealth v. Myers,35 an 1812 Virginia case.
Myers was charged with murder and pled double jeopardy (autrefois acquit) and not guilty.
The court: stated that, although a person indicted for a capital offense may not enter two pleas in abatement which are deemed by law repugnant, pleas in bar which are only somewhat repugnant may be accepted if two conditions are met.
First, the court must be satisfied of their truthfulness, and second, they must not directly contradict each other.
In this case, the court considered that the conditions were satisfied and permitted these two pleas to be ad vanced. ple v. Doody, 343 Ill. 194, 175 N.E. 436 (1931); Brown v. Commonwealth, 308 Ky. 486,214 S.W.2d 1018 (1948).

The defense argument, accepted by the court and unrebutted by the prosecution, was that in England it was the absolute right of a prisoner to enter as many pleas as were necessary and proper for his defense.
The defense counsel specifically challenged any lawyer "to produce a single dictum of the worst of the English courts, in the worst of times, to prevent a prisoner from pleading doubly in bar of prose~ution."~~ Virginia broadened that rule a year later3' to permit two pleas in abatement.
Alabama, in 1837, followed Virginia's lead and an nounced in State v. Green woocP that a defendant could not be com pelled to select one of several pleas submitted by him.
The development was slowed somewhat by State v. Potter.39In Potter, the defendant pled not guilty and also former conviction.
The North Carolina court ruled that "former conviction" is manifestly inconsistent with a plea of not guilty.
Therefore, the defendant must rely upon only one of the pleas or the court would treat the latter plea as a waiver of the former.
(Pottermay not have been too great an aberration since the court in Myers had used a former conviction and a not guilty plea as an example of an ex tremely repugnant set of pleas.)
The first federal case to deal with the subject was United States v. Richardson4*in 1886.
In Richardson, the court stated that, in this country, two or more pleas in abatement, not repugnant to one another, had been allowed to be pled together.
A major leap forward occurred in the 1888 case of State v. Stevens.41In that case, the Supreme Court of Missouri permitted the defendant to assert both accident and self - defense, because "any number of defenses may be made, whether consistent or not."42 More importantly, the court, in dicta, stated that, under a plea of not guilty, all defenses, such as self - defense, insanity, 361d.at 211-212.

misadventure, or alibi, are available to the defendant regardless of their consistency with one another.43 Although no citation of authority was given for this broad unequivocal statement, it represents a significant breakthrough in the evolution of the law concerning inconsistent defenses.
Indiana, in 1895, permitted a defendant to plead the inconsistent defenses of denial and self - defense.
In Reed v. State,44 the accused had testified that the victim had advanced on him to attack him but that a third party had thrown the rock that killed the victim.
The trial judge felt self - defense had been raised, considering all the evidence, and instructed on self - defense over the objection of the defendant.
The appellate court agreed that, if the defense had been raised, it should be the subject of instruction.
A similar result was achieved in Kentucky, three years later, although the Reed case was not cited.45 In State v. Jackett, in 1909, Kansas permitted denial and self defense.
The court based its rationale on the practice followed in civil cases,46especially the fact that one sued for defamation could assert that he did not utter the defamatory comments and that, even if he did, they were true.
The court noted that, under a plea of not guilty, the defendant can utilize all ordinary defenses.
Georgia, in 1902, refused to permit accident and self - defense to be asserted simultaneously.47 Despite this temporary reluctance to adopt the rule announced in State v. Stevens, discussed above, those defenses were permitted the next year, 1903, in the New York case of People v. Gaimari48 (again with no citation of authority).

Numerous other caseP covering a variety of defenses followed in rapid succession.
By 1912, in People v. C ~ n t ea, California court ~~ could state, without citation, that the rule permitting inconsistent defenses was "well settled" both in criminal and civil law.
The types of inconsistent defenses commonly changed dramatically since World War 11.
Before inconsistent defenses were raised in connection violence and usually consisted of accident and denial and self - defense.
Since World War 11, with narcotics prosecutions, the most prevalent set defenses has been entrapment and denial.

ALTERNATIVE DEFENSES Some cases said to involve inconsistent defenses actually present only alternative defenses.
In these cases, the defendant usually has pled insanity or intoxication.

INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
defenses of insanity or intoxication do not involve an implicit con fession that the defendant committed the act.
These defenses focus solely on the defendant's mental responsibility at the time of the crime without necessarily admitting certain acts while in that state.
Consequently, those defenses are not mutally exclusive when coupled with a denial of the crime.
If the Government could prove that the defendant was sane, that would not necessarily prove that he committed certain acts.
Conversely, proof of the commission of certain acts does not necessarily disprove the defendant's conten tion of insanity.
Therefore, as the District of Columbia Circuit has said, there is no logical inconsistency.
The defendant is merely claiming he was not mentally responsible, while still requiring the Government to meet its burden of proof.56 Despite the seeming persuasiveness of the District of Columbia Circuit's logic, some courts have viewed alibi as inconsistent with intoxication, yet allowed their assertion since inconsistent defenses were permitted in those j~risdictions.~' Alternatively, at least one other court5* has reached the same conclusion as the District of Columbia Circuit, holding that alibi and insanity are not truly inconsistent, since proof of one does not disprove the other.
Although the Michigan Court of Appeals has permitted denial to be asserted with the defense of intoxication, it views such defenses as incon~istent.~~ other courts have adopted the rule that Most Mo. 705, 203 S.W.2d 425 (1947);People v. Dumas, 51 Misc.2d 929, 274 N.Y.S.2d 764 (1966).

The appellant in People v. Ford, 39 I11.2d 318, 235 N.E.2d 576 (1968), attempted to utilize this rationale to her advantage.
She argued that she was denied her right not to be a witness against herself because, by raising the defense of insanity, she was admitting commission of the offense.
The court was not persuaded by such logic.
It held that there was no reason a defendant could not deny commission of the crime and still claim insanity.
The court compared this to the situation in which a defen dant denies making incriminating statements and also challenges their voluntariness.

MILITARY LAW REVIEW
[VOL. 92
there is no inconsistency between a denial and insanity or intoxicat io n ,60 A more difficult question arises, however, when the defendant wishes to claim insanity and self - defense.
Although the two defenses have been labeled "inconsistent,"61 most courts which have faced the question have held they are not inconsistent,62since proof of one does not necessarily disprove the other.
The latter position seems correct.
While self - defense requires by definition an intentional act of reasonable insanity would not necessarily deprive an individual of his ability to perceive an attack upon himself and to act accordingly; nor would it deprive him of his com mon law right of self - defense in such circumstance^.^^ Two examples of cases presenting alternative defenses not in volving insanity or intoxication are Stalling v. Statg5 and People v. Lee.66Stalling was charged with failing to stop and render aid to an individual his vehicle had struck.
His main defense was alibi.
He attempted to utilize a "fallback" theory, to the effect that, even if he did do it, the state had not shown that he knew his vehicle had struck anyone because the accident occurred on a cloudy night.

The ALI.Model Penal Code test would not appear to increase the likelihood of inconsistency because it speaks in terms of appreciating the criminality of one's conduct, or of con forming one's conduct to the law.
The M'Naghten test, however, because one of its tenets is that the defendant did not know what he was doing, seems to involve a greater likelihood of inconsistency when asserted with self - defense.

INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
Such knowledge was an essential element of the charge under the applicable statute.
The trial judge refused to submit this fallback theory to the jury because it was inconsistent.
The Texas appellate court reversed, saying that, although the defendant had relied on alibi, this did not deprive him of using any other "defense theory" sanctioned by the evidence.
In Lee, the defendant was charged with intending to kill by ming ling carbolic acid with beer.
Lee denied placing the acid in the beer but also attempted to produce evidence showing that the amount of acid in the beer was not sufficient to produce death.
The trial judge did not permit such evidence because it was inconsistent with Lee's denial.
The appellate court reversed, saying that a plea of not guilty renders competent any evidence that tends to prove or disprove any issue involved even if one defense is inconsistent with another.
While both decisions seem correct, their reasoning has certain flaws.
Certainly by claiming alibi or denying the commission of the crime, the accused is not thereby relieving the state of its burden to prove all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.
Furthermore, there is no logical inconsistency between asserting alibi or denial (or insanity or into~ication~~),still claiming that and the state has not successfully carried its burden of proof, because those defenses do not necessarily involve an admission that the "criminal" act occurred.
1
A thornier problem develops, however, if the defense asserted is self - defense, accident, or entrapment.
Such defenses are based on the assumption that an act occurred which, absent the defense, would be criminal.
Therefore, an inconsistency may occur if the ac cused asserts such a defense and simultaneously contests that the act occurred or that he committed it.68 Such defenses are then truly inconsistent and will be discussed infra.
A final example of alternative defenses is found in murder pro secutions when the defendant asserts the affirmative defense of 67Seenote supra and accompanying text.
60, 68Aninconsistency would not arise if the accused contested only one of the elements of the offense, and if that element were not implicitly assumed in his affirmative defense.
For example, the defendant in a murder case who claimed he shot the victim in self - defense may still contest the allegation that his shot was the cause of death.

Cr. 1969).

self - defense and simultaneously claims that his actions constitute the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.
Beginning as early as 1909, the courts ruled that such defenses were not necessarily inconsistent because the fear which might prompt an individual to act in self - defense might also pro duce the heat of passion necessary for voluntary man~laughter.~~ It was for the jury to decide which was more applicable.
V. CONTRADICTORY DEFENSES
"Contradictory defenses" are those defenses which are truly in consistent, i.e., mutually exclusive, but which traditionally have been permitted.
The most common examples of these are accident/self-defense and denial/self-defense.
Accident and self - defense are usually inconsistent.
Self - defense requires a voluntary, intentional act in response to some type of at tack.
For example, the defendant shoots the victim intentionally because the victim is trying to stab him.
The defense of accident (or misadventure), however, requires the doing of a lawful act, free from negligence, which has unintended results.'O For example, the defendant is lawfully hunting in a woods.
Despite using due care, he trips and, as he falls, his weapon fires and strikes his com panion.
Accident does not require an impending attack nor does it require the operative act to be intentional.
In the hunting situation above, the "act" of shooting was not intentional."

The Manual provision describes accident or misadventure as an excuse, and states, "A death, injury, or other event which oc curs as the result of an accident or misadventure in doing a lawful act in a lawful manner is excusable."
"Some courts have referred to accident as an involuntary act by definition.
See, e.g., State v. Peal, 463 S.W. 2d 840 (Mo. 1971).This appears to be incorrect.
The act might be voluntary but the results were unforeseen and unwanted.
as illustrated by the
90
19811
INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
The defense of accident or misadventure is complicated somewhat by the fact that courts often do not specify whether they are discussing the affirmative defense of accident which renders a homicide excusable, or are using "accident" in its ordinary sense, which does not.
Consider the following example: Defendant enters a crowded room and, to show off his dexterity, begins to twirl a loaded pistol.
The pistol fires during this exhibition and kills an onlooker.
Certainly in this case the defense of accident or misadventure is not applicable, because the defendant was not do ing a lawful act in a non - negligent way.
Therefore the homicide would not be excusable.
The killing, however, was nonetheless "ac cidental" in the sense that there was no intent to kill or even to in jure. consequently, the defendant's claim of "accidental" shooting would tend to negate any element of intent and would serve as a defense to premeditated murder or voluntary manslaughter.
It will not, however, serve as a defense to any other degree of homicide which did not require specific intent.
People v. GaimarP and People v. D e R o ~ are ~ examples of a a ~ two situation in which the two defenses are not necessarily inconsis tent.
Gaimari and DeRosa might be called "two - shot" cases.
Both were murder prosecutions in which the defendant fired two shots into the victim in the course of a struggle.
In each case, the defen dant asserted that the first shot was fired accidentally but the se cond shot was fired in self - defense, In such cases, the defenses are clearly not inconsistent because they are based on two different (although closely related) events.
Proof that one shot was fired ac cidentally does not necessarily disprove the notion that the second Both courts, shot was fired in self - defense and vice ~ersa.7~ however, referred to the defenses as inc~nsistent.~~ following example: A defendant on a lawful hunting trip fires at a deer.

If the second shot was the fatal one, then self - defense and voluntary manslaughter were in issue.
The trial judge, to be safe, instructed on all three issues to provide the jury with sufficient guideposts for their deliberations.
75Neither court specified whether they were referring to the affirmative defense of accident (misadventure) or meant that the shooting was accidential in its normal sense.
91
MILITARY LAW REVIEW
[VOL. 92
A case that provides an excellent vehicle to illustrate that the two defenses are not inconsistent is the military case of United States v. Perry.76 In Perry, the accused was tried for unpremediated murder.
He testified that he punched the decedent in self - defense.
The victim fell and later died from head injuries.
The United States Court of Military Appeals held that the act of throwing one punch in response to a threatened attack was an act of permissible self defense.
Such a permissible act of self - defense would constitute a lawful act done in a lawful manner.
Therefore, the defense of acci dent or misadventure was available and the homicide would be ex cusable if the court believed the accused's testimony.77 Obviously the defenses in Perry are not contradictory.
Quite the contrary, they complement each other and are vital to full defense to the charge.
Such cases illustrate that despite the definitional difference, many inconsistent defenses, upon analysis of the facts, are not mutually exclusive but rather alternative defenses.
In the absence of such severable factual bases, however, accident and self - defense are inconsistent and courts have traditionally viewed them as such.
Despite this perception, the defenses have been permitted,78as have the similar sets of the defense of accident 7616C.M.A.221,36C.M.R.377(1966).
"But see State v. Carter, 26 N.C.
App. 84, 214 S.E.2d 611 (1975).This was a murder prosecution in which the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.
His defense was self - defense.
in that he shot the victim while the victim was trying to stab him.
He claimed, however, that he had not intended to shoot the victim in the chest but only in the leg.
The appellate court said accident (misadventure) was not raised.
However, the defense probably was raised under the Perry theory that the act of firing at the knife - wielding victim was a permissible act of self - defense.
Therefore the unintend ed fatal results would be excusable under a theory of accident or misadventure.
Even assuming that accident or misadventure was not applicable because the act of shooting was not reasonable under the circumstances, it would appear that the defendant's testimony raised the partial defense of lack of intent to kill.

The rule had its start before the turn of the century83 and continues unabated to the present.84 T-he ratio decidendi of the decisions has been that, even if the defendant denies the act, if self - defense is raised by the other evidence, it should be the subject of instruction because the jury S.W.2d 257 (en banc) (Mo. 1973); State v.

need not believe the defendant.85In other words, "[ilt would be perfectly proper for him to say: (a) I did not fire the shot, but (b) whatever I did, I did in my own self-defense."86 Similarly incongruous are the defenses of denial or alibi and voluntary manslaughter.
It is certainly contradictory for a defen dant to argue "I didn't stab him but, if I did, it was intentional and in the heat of passion."
Yet the same principle that has permitted denial and self - defense has permitted the simultaneous assertion of these two defenses also.8' The obvious problem with the assertion of such defenses is that it frequently wreaks havoc with the defendant's credibility, at the least, and insults the intelligence of the jury (and thereby raises its ire) at worst.
Such an effect was noted in Johnson v. United States.88Johnson was charged with rape and contended that he did not have inter course with the girl.
Because of evidence in the government's case, the defense counsel argued that the victim consented, "but I don't concede one second that the act of intercourse took place."8g An en banc District of Columbia Circuit permitted such inconsistent defenses to be argued, noting that it was a tactical decision to be made at trial.
The court added, however, that it would not be sur prising if such a position reflected unfavorably on the defendant's ~redibility.~O 85Davisv.

INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
VI. ANTITHETICAL DEFENSES The "inconsistent" defenses which have faced the greatest dif ficulty in gaining judicial acceptance have been entrapment and any type of denial such as alibi, general denial, lack of knowledge, and lack of intent.
Why the judiciary would be so unwilling to ac cept the simultaneous assertion of denial and entra~ment,~' per yet mit denial and self - defense is Certainly it cannot be explained totally by the principle of stare decisis.
The first cases which refused to permit the simultaneous assertion of entrapment and denial were People v. Murng3in the in the federal courts.
state courts, and Nutter v. United Both courts simply stated that the defenses were inconsistent and refused to permit them, without giving any citation of authority.
During the same era, however, and equally available as citation of authority had successor courts been willing, were Scriber v. United Statesg5and two Missouri cases, State v. DeckeP and State v. all of which indicated that the combination of denial and entrapment should be available.
Scriber was a bribery case in which the defendant had admitted the act of taking the money but denied any criminal intent and thereby denied the crime.
He also claimed that he had been entrap ped.
The trial judge refused to submit entrapment to the jury because it was inconsistent.
The Sixth Circuit stated, in dicta, "it would seem that a defendant should have the benefit of the defense, even though such inconsistency exists . . .
[A] jury might conclude that the defendant's claim of good intent was untrue and that he really intended to keep the money but might also conclude he was entrapped and therefore not Two years later the United States District Court for Nebraska in United States v.

It is a relatively re cent inventionla' which permits an individual to escape what would otherwise be "his just desserts" by showing that the police were overzealous in their methods.
Consequently, the defense was view ed essentially as a possibly undeserved legal windfall for the defen dant.
He would be set free not because he himself was clearly inno cent, but because, for public policy reasons, this mischievous type of police conduct could not be permitted to go unabated.lo2 However, to allow the defendant to cry entrapment and also to con test the commission of the crime was to permit him to have "two bites at the apple."
Although the prohibition against these defenses has clearly been the prevailing view of 40 years,'03 the rule has been soundly criticiz ed in law reviews1@' and appears now to be steadily declining.
The loo Washington is typical of the early cases involving denial and entrapment in that it involves the illicit sale of liquor.

It is not the position of the Supreme Court that the purpose of allowing the entrap ment defense is to deter police misconduct, although several justices have espoused the position in concurring or dissenting opinions.
The police misconduct rationale is sometimes called the "objective" test for entrapment, and is contrasted with the "subjective" test, which focuses on the motivation of the defendant or accused to commit a crime independently of police inducement.

INCONSISTENT DEFENSES
present status of the jurisdictional landscape on the simultaneous assertion of entrapment and denial of the crime is divided into three separate and distinct layers.
The first is a group of cases which permit these defenses to be asserted without re~ervati0n.l~ Second, some cases refuse to permit them to be asserted under any circumstances.lo6 Third, other cases permit the assertion of such defenses under certain circumstances depending mainly on the degree of denial."J7 Before examining the state of the law in various jurisdictions, however, we will benefit from analyzing the subject overall to discover some of the fundamental differences that exist.
Some courts have refused to allow denial and entrapment because, in order to assert entrapment, one must admit commission of the crime.loB Other courts have ruled that entrapment will not be available to one who denies commission of the offense.lo9The dif ference, if intentional, would be substantial.
If the defendant may not deny the commission of the offense, then he can still retain his right to remain silent and simply not testify.
If the defendant must "admit" the commission of the offense then he must take the stand (or enter into stipulation) and judicially confess.
Although prima facie motion for defendant in either case the Government must have established a case at the conclusion of its own evidence to overcome a a finding of not guilty, it is obvious that compelling a to confess judicially eliminates any difficulty the

Government might have had in meeting the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Such a prerequisite to an assertion of entrapment certainly puts the defendant in a quandary.
Should he forego the entrapment defense and hope that the Government has not convinced the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, or should he assert entrapment and take the stand and confess, thereby effec tively relieving the Government of its burden of proof? Requiring an individual to judicially confess has two substantial flaws.
First, to require an individual to confess in order to avail himself of a defense seems a clear violation of an individual's fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination.'1o Second, such a re quirement would seem to frustrate the entire purpose of the entrap ment defense, which is to deter unlawful and overzealous officials from preying upon innocent citizens.
This requirement would in sulate the police from judicial scrutiny, because the defendant, rather than judicially confess, would forsake the entrapment defense."'
Some courts112have applied that rule literally and required the defendant to take the stand and confess before he could assert en trapment.
Despite this, it appears that the two expressions, "ad mit" and "must not deny," were meant to be used interchangeably.
This construction is based on several considerations.
First, it is obvious why such a misunderstanding could arise.
In the vast majority of entrapment cases that reach an appellate court, the evidence which raises entrapment was the defendant's own testimony.
Consequently, faced with this fait accompli, the courts have stated in effect that, once the defendant takes the stand and discusses the offense, he must admit complicity since he gave up his right to remain silent.
Once he is on the stand and subject to cross - examination, the difference between "must admit" and "may not deny" becomes non - existent.

Second, various jurisdictions have used both terms in stating the req~irement,"~ indicating they viewed the terms as inter changeable.
Third, in Gorin v. United States114 and United States v. Groe~sel,"~ defendants did not take the stand, yet the courts the permitted them to assert denial and entrapment if other evidence raised entrapment.
In Gorin, the court specifically stated that it would have been inconsistent for the accused to take the stand and deny commission of the offense and then assert entrapment.
However, it was not fatally inconsistent for him to claim entrap ment but also to keep silent in. the hope that the jury would find that the Government had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
The law would permit that much inconsistency.
Such a holding seems eminently correct, in light of the majority opinion in Sorrells v. United States which held that entrapment could be raised under a plea of not guilty,l16 Fourth, other courts have specifically noted in dicta that a defen dant claiming entrapment may not take the stand and deny com mission of the crime.l17 Such decisions imply agreement with Gorin and Groessel that if the defendant merely remains silent he may contest the state's case and still assert entrapment.
Fifth, certain jurisdictions have adopted the converse of the pro position that in order to assert entrapment, one must admit or not deny the commission of the crime.
They have ruled that by asserPaduano, 549 F.2d 145, 151 (9th Cir. 1977),for a discussion of this "manifest error" which "impaired a defendant's constitutionally secured rights."
