Telephone Fraud: What You Need to Know Before You Answer the Phone The telephone is an increasingly important marketing tool for legitimate businesses, and telemarketing is an important, growing industry in Utah.
But the telephone in the wrong hands is also becoming a very effective tool to defraud innocent consumers with schemes ranging from stock investments to abusive "900" numbers.
Americans lose an estimated $10 billion each year to telemarketing fraud.
Con artists and swindlers use the telephone more and more as their "weapon" to hold up their victims.
Consumers should learn to hang up when it sounds too good to be true.
Many people don't--they may become unwilling victims to telephone fraud.
Top Phone Scams
The Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing (AAFT), a national coalition of more than 60 consumer groups, trade associations, and state and federal agencies recently released a list of trends in telefraud for the '90s.
While some of the following products and services can be legitimate and sold by reputable telemarketers, the AAFT believes they will also be among the most popular promotions by con artists in the coming years.
The phone scams identified by AAFT as having the greatest potential to do damage to the pocketbooks of consumers during the 1990s are: * Abusive 900 Numbers * Bogus Health Care Promotions * Bank-Financed Precious Metals * Accelerated Mortgage Scalpers * Single-Use Credit Cards * Timeshares Resales * Phony Foreign Banking Schemes
What Can Be Done
During the 1990 Utah Legislative Session, two new telemarketing bills were enacted to protect consumers from unscrupulous telemarketers and telemarketing scams and, at the same time, protect legitimate telemarketing businesses.
These new laws--the Telephone Fraud Act and the Regulation of Automated Dialing Telephone Solicitation Act--allow for entry and growth by legitimate firms while requiring compliance from all who operate in Utah.
The two laws give the Division of Consumer Protection new tools to help consumers protect themselves from unscrupulous telemarketers.
The new laws: * Limit automated or computer voice solicitations to the hours between 9:00 am and 8:00 pm. * Require automated solicitations to disconnect within 30 seconds after completion of the call.
* Allow consumers the opportunity to register with the Division of Consumer Protection if they do not wish to receive automated telephone solicitations.
* Allow the state to fine violators.
* Require registration of some solicitors.
Charities are required by law to be registered with the Division of Consumer Protection.
If a charity contacts you by telephone, ask if they are registered and what percentage of your dollars goes to the cause.
If you have questions or wish to verify if a charity is registered, contact the Division of Consumer Protection at (801) 530-6601.
