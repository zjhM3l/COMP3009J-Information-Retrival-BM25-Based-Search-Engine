If the East is not now in an active plate margin, why do we have earthquakes here and why do we have them in the center of the continent? One possible explanation is that ancient faults or rifts are stressed.
If this is true, what is the cause of the stress? In many areas of the East where earthquakes have occurred historically, specific faults causing the quakes have not been mapped or even identified.
Another problem we encounter when evaluating earthquake risk is that we only have earthquake records for the last couple of hundred years.
Establishing geologic patterns over human time scales is difficult at best.

Central United States earthquakes often occur within, rather than along plate boundaries.
Earthquakes occurring along boundaries of plates (for example, San Francisco, 1906) are well understood in terms of plate tectonics, but those occurring within plates are not similarly understood.
The intraplate epicenters in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, and New Madrid, Missouri produced major shocks that were not unique for large earthquakes in the Eastern and Central United States.

No earthquake in recorded history has caused deaths or injuries in Arizona.
In the past century or more, 14 tremors of intensity V to VII (Modified Mercalli scale) have centered within its borders, of which 12 were reported after Arizona entered the Union in February 1912.
Colorado is considered a region of minor earthquake activity.
Most shocks in the history of this State have centered west of the Rocky Mountain Front Range.
Nevada ranks among the most seismically active States.
Most of New Mexico's historical seismicity has been concentrated in the Rio Grande Valley between Socorro and Albuquerque.
Montana is one of the most seismically active States in the Union.
Since 1925, the State has experienced five shocks that reached intensity VIII or greater.
A belt of seismicity known as the Intermountain Seismic Belt extends through western Montana, from the Flathead Lake region in the northwest corner of the state to the Yellowstone National Park region where the borders of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming meet.
The Intermountain Seismic Belt continues southward through Yellowstone Park, along the Idaho-Wyoming border, through Utah, and into southern Nevada.
In western Montana, the Intermountain Seismic Belt is up to 60 miles (100 km) wide.
A branch of the Intermountain Seismic Belt extends west from the northwest corner of Yellowstone Park, through southwestern Montana, into central Idaho.
This so called Centennial Tectonic Belt includes at least eight major active faults and has been the site of the two largest historic earthquakes in the northern Rocky MountainsÃ‘the August 17, 1959 Hebgen Lake, Montana, earthquake (M 7.3), and the October 28, 1983 Borah Peak, Idaho, earthquake (M 7.2).
California
California, Nevada
Recent earthquakes: http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/latest.htm
California and Alaska have the most earthquakes in the United States, with California having the most damaging earthquakes.
Many of the earthquakes in California occur along the San Andreas Fault System, which crosses California from the Salton Sea in the south to Cape Mendocino in the north, and is the boundary between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate.
The historic record of earthquakes in California begins in 1769.
Pacific Northwest
Oregon, Washington
Recent earthquakes: http://spike.geophys.washington.edu/recenteqs
Approximately 1,000 earthquakes are recorded each year in Washington and Oregon with one to two dozen of these causing enough ground shaking to be felt by residents.
Most are in the Puget Sound region, and few cause any damage.
However, based on the history of past damaging earthquakes and our understanding of the geologic history of the Pacific Northwest, damaging earthquakes (magnitude 6 or greater) will recur in the Pacific Northwest, although there is currently no reliable way to predict whether this is more likely to be today or years from now.

Earthquakes in Hawaii are closely linked to volcanism.
They are an important part of the island-building processes that have shaped the Island of Hawaii and the other Hawaiian Islands.
Thousands of earthquakes occur every year beneath the Island of Hawaii.
Eruptions and magma movement within the presently active volcanoes (Kilauea, Mauna Loa and Lo`ihi) are usually accompanied by numerous small earthquakes.
They originate in regions of magma storage or along the paths that magma follows as it rises and moves prior to eruption.
These are loosely termed volcanic earthquakes.
Many other earthquakes, including the largest ones, occur in areas of structural weakness at the base of Hawaii's volcanoes or deep within the Earth's crust beneath the island.
These are referred to as tectonic earthquakes.
In the past 150 years, several strong tectonic earthquakes (magnitude 6 to 8) caused extensive damage to roads, buildings, and homes, triggered local tsunami, and resulted in loss of life.
Alaska
Alaska
Recent earthquakes: http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/Seis/recenteqs/index.html
The northwestward motion of the Pacific Plate at about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) per year causes the crust of southern Alaska to be compressed and warped, with some areas along the coast being depressed and other areas inland being uplifted.
After periods of tens to hundreds of years, this compression is relieved by the sudden southeastward motion of portions of coastal Alaska as they move back over the subducting Pacific Plate.
Puerto Rico and U.S. Territories
Guam
Recent earthquakes: http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/guam/guam.html
Guam, the largest and southernmost island of the Mariana Islands, rises steeply from the ocean floor, a short distance to the north of the world's greatest known oceanic depth.
Felt earthquakes are frequently reported.
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
Recent earthquakes: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsUS/Maps/PR10/13.23.-71.-61.html
The Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands region is located at the northeastern corner of the Caribbean Plate where motions are complex.
The westward-moving North American Plate is being driven under the Antilles Arc where volcanism is active.
On the north side of the plate corner, the North American Plate slides past the Caribbean, but irregularities in the plate boundaries cause stresses that result in a complicated underthrusting of plate fragments.
The interaction of plates causes the volcanism of the Antilles Arc on the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Plate and creates major stresses all along the northern boundary, which causes frequent earthquakes.
Two groups of earthquake foci (locations of initial ruptures within the Earth) extend diagonally under the islands, one from the north and one from the south.
