Security Tips for Air Travelers
When you are preparing for your trip, remember to pack smart pack safe.
You cannot bring items listed below on your person or in carry-on luggage.
Knives of any length, composition, or description.
All cutting and puncturing instruments.
This includes pocketknives, carpet knives and box or ice picks, straight razors, metal scissors, and metal nail files.
Corkscrews.
Athletic equipment that could be used as a weapon, such as baseball/softball bats, golf clubs, pool cues, ski poles, and hockey sticks.

Pressure containers spray cans, butane fuel, scuba tanks, propane tanks, CO2 cartridges and self- inflating rafts.
Weapons firearms, ammunition, gunpowder, mace, tear gas, or pepper spray.
Other hazardous materials: dry ice, gasoline-powered tools, wet-cell batteries, camping equipment with fuel, radioactive materials (except limited quantities), poisons, and infectious substances.
Beware many common items used every day in the home or workplace may seem harmless; however, when transported by air, they can be very dangerous.
In flight, variations in temperature and pressure can cause items to leak, generate toxic fumes or start a fire.
Personal care items containing hazardous materials (e.g., flammable perfume, aerosols) more than 70 ounces may be carried on board.
Contents of each container may not exceed 16 fluid ounces.
Matches and lighters may only be carried on your person.
However, strike-anywhere matches, lighters with flammable liquid reservoirs, and lighter fluid are forbidden.
Firearms and ammunition may not be carried by a passenger on an aircraft.
However, unloaded firearms may be transported in checked baggage if declared to the agent at check in and packed in a suitable container.
Handguns must be in a locked container.
Boxed small arms ammunition for personal use may be transported in checked luggage.
Amounts may vary depending on the airline.
Dry ice (4 pounds or less) for packing perishables, may be carried on board an aircraft provided the package is vented.
Electric wheelchairs must be transported in accordance with airline requirements.
The battery may need to be disconnected, removed, and the terminals insulated to prevent short circuits.
Leave gifts unwrapped.
Airline security personnel will open gifts if the x-ray scan cannot determine the contents.
If in doubt, dont pack it.
Return to top
Hazardous Items Except for toiletries and medicines weighing no more than 75 ounces, it is illegal and extremely dangerous to carry on board or check in luggage with any of the following hazardous materials: aerosols, corrosives, flammables, explosives, radioactive, compressed gasses, infectious substances and poisonous materials.
If you travel with any of these materials, check with the airlines air freight department to see if special arrangements can be made.
A violation of these restrictions can result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation or a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and/or up to 5 years in jail.

Baggage and Packing Many problems associated with checking your baggage can be solved before you leave for the airport.
It is recommended that the following items be packed into a carry-on bag:
Small valuables (cash, credit cards, jewelry, cameras, personal computers) Critical items (medicine, keys, passport, business papers) Irreplaceable items (manuscripts, heirlooms) Fragile Items (eyeglasses, liquids, glass containers)
These items should be carried personally or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit under your seat on the plane.
The only way to be absolutely sure that your valuables are not lost or damaged is to keep them with you.
Even if your baggage is not lost, it could be delayed for as much as a few days.
Do not pack perishables or food items because they may spoil if there is a delay.
It is also suggested that you pack items that you will need during the first 24 hours in a carry-on bag, such as toiletries and a change of underwear.
Watch your bags and personal belongings at all times.
Do not accept packages from strangers.
If you see unattended bags or packages anywhere in the airport terminal or parking area, immediately report them to a security officer or other authority.
Report any suspicious activities or individuals in the airport or parking lot to airport security.
Dont joke about having a bomb or firearm.
Dont discuss terrorism, weapons, explosives, threats while going through the security checkpoint.
The mere mention of words such as gun, etc., can compel security personnel to detain and question you.
They are trained to consider comments as real threats.
Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.
Return to top
Allow Extra Time Arrive early.
Heightened airport security measures increase the time needed to check in.
Arriving at the airport two hours before your flights scheduled departure is advisable, however, passengers may want to consult with their airline for more specific arrival times.
Build in even more time at the airport if traveling with young children, infants, or persons with disabilities.
Consider taking public transportation to the airport, if possible.
Parking and curbside access will be controlled and limited.
Curbside check-in is available only at specific locations.
Contact your airline to see if it is available for your flight.
Do not leave your car unattended in front of the terminal.
Security measures dictate that unattended cars will be towed.
Return to top
Checking In
Checked baggage is subject to weight, size and numerical limits.
On most domestic and international flights, there is a limit of two checked bags per passenger.
You may be subject to extra charges if you bring more, or if you exceed the airlines weight and size restrictions for baggage.
Be sure to clearly label each of your bags with your name, address and phone number.
Without proper labeling, it is difficult to locate lost baggage.
When you check in, also be sure to remove all straps, hooks, and other objects on your luggage that may get caught in the baggage handling machinery.
Adult passengers must bring a government-issued photo ID.
The FAA requires that air carriers request government-issued identification, such as a drivers license or draft card, if the passenger appears old enough to have an ID.
If a government-issued photo ID is not available, bring two pieces of ID, one of which must be from a governmental authority.
E-ticket travelers should check with their airline to make sure they have proper documentation.
Automated kiosks are available for airlines that have appropriate security measures in place.
Travelers interested in this option should check with their airlines.
Be prepared to answer questions about your bags.
When asked who packed your bags and if you might have left them unattended at anytime, think carefully and answer the questions honestly.
Criminals may use unsuspecting passengers to carry bombs or other dangerous items onto aircraft.
Be cooperative as screeners ask to hand-search your bags.
Security personnel will search the x-ray scan cannot determine its contents.
Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.
Return to top
Screener Checkpoints Only ticketed passengers are allowed beyond the screener checkpoints, unless a passenger requires parental oversight or must be accompanied by a medical assistant.
Travelers are limited to one carry-on bag and one personal item (e.g., purse or briefcase) Electronic items, such as laptop computers and cell phones, may be subject to additional screening.
Be prepared to remove your laptop from its travel case so it can be X-rayed separately.

Air Fares
Because of the competitive nature of the air travel market, consumers often have an opportunity to choose from a wide variety of air fares.
The differences in air fares can be substantial.
While careful comparison shopping among the various airlines does take time, it can lead to significant savings.
For fare information, consumers can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or an airline serving their intended destination.
Consumers should also contact each airline to ask about the fares they charge and whether any special promotional fares are being offered.
It is also helpful to pay attention to newspaper, television and radio ads for airline advertisements and discounts.
Consumers with access to the Internet should also visit airline web sites and check for special discount rates.
When purchasing tickets over the Internet, encryption and security precautions should be used.
Tips for Choosing Among Air Fares
Be flexible with your travel plans in order to get the lowest fare available.
Significant savings are sometimes available by flying on certain days, at different times, or even by taking a different flight on the same day.
Consumers should be careful in purchasing discount rated fares because many are non-refundable.
If plans change, you may not get your money back.
Make your travel plans as far ahead of schedule as possible.
Many discount rates are limited to a certain number of seats per plane.
Once a ticket is purchased, consumers should call the airline a few times before departure and compare their fare to any other special offers.
New offers are available every day and many airlines, upon inquiry, will refund the difference between a reserved price and a new special offer.
Simply holding a reservation number without a ticket does not guarantee a fare.
While many airlines will not increase the fare after a ticket is issued and paid for, others may reserve the right to collect more money for the same ticket at a later time.
Consumers should inquire about an airlines pricing policy before purchasing a ticket.
Airlines offering interstate and/or foreign flights are required to include a conspicuous written notice, either on the ticket or on another separate written document, that the full text of any contract terms incorporated by reference on the ticket may be inspected at the carriers airport or local ticket office.[1] These terms may include:
Limitations upon carrier liability; Claim restrictions, including the applicable periods within which passengers must pursue claims; Rights of the carrier to change the terms of the contract, change schedules, and substitute carriers; and Rules concerning reservations, check-in times, and refusals to carry.
An airline must, upon request, provide the full text of its contract to consumers free of charge.
Where an airline is shown to have failed to do so, it may not deny a claim made by a passenger concerning a term purportedly incorporated by reference.
Questions and complaints regarding this rule should be directed to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
See Appendix.

Reservations and Tickets
When making a reservation, consumers should be sure the agent records their information accurately.
Review all of the essential information - your name, the flight numbers and travel dates - with the agent before hanging up.
When purchasing tickets more than one week in advance of traveling, you should give the airline your home and work telephone numbers so they can let you know of any changes in the flight schedule.
If you plan to fly during a busy travel period, call for reservations well ahead of time.
Holiday flights often sell out months before the actual date of travel.
Travelers should avoid using stand-by or open return tickets during these periods as well.
When travel is extremely time sensitive, the larger airlines can provide you with an on-time performance code for flights you are considering.
This enables a traveler to choose among the most punctual flights being offered.
When a reservations agent asks you to buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a deadline that must be adhered to.
If you fail to meet this deadline, the airline is entitled to cancel the reservation without notice.
When purchasing tickets, it is best to do this in person instead of relying upon the mail or picking them up on the day of travel.
By doing so, you will avoid both the possibility of losing tickets in the mail and having to wait in line before boarding.
It is suggested that travelers reconfirm their reservations before they start their trip because flight schedules are subject to change.
For international flights, most airlines require that passengers reconfirm their reservations at least 72 hours in advance.
Failure to do so entitles the airline to cancel the reservation.
Whenever possible, consumers should purchase their airline tickets through the use of a credit card.
Payment by credit card provides certain protections under federal credit laws.[2] When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application.
If you paid by credit card for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a refund that you are due, report this in writing to your credit card company.
If this is done within 60 days from the time that the credit card company mailed your first monthly statement reflecting the charge in question, the card company should credit your account even if the airline does not.
This option is particularly useful where the airline you purchased a ticket from happens to go out of business before the date of your flight.
Airline tickets are comparable to negotiable documents, which means that they are quite difficult to replace once lost or stolen.
Every safeguard should be undertaken so that this does not occur.
You should write down the ticket numbers as soon as you receive them, in case they are misplaced or stolen.
This may enable the airline to quickly replace a lost ticket.
If the airline is unable to replace the ticket right away, the passenger will have to purchase a replacement ticket and process a refund application for the lost ticket.
This can take up to six months.
Return to top
E-Tickets
Electronic airline tickets, commonly known as E-Tickets, are a relatively new means of purchasing airline tickets.
Many airlines now offer E-Tickets as an alternative to standard paper tickets.
The consumer is given a record locator number and written receipt, and must show his or her credit card and appropriate photo ID at the airport gate.
By reducing ticketing costs, speeding up the accounting and billing process, and reducing the handling costs involved with paper tickets, E-Tickets promise tremendous savings for consumers and the airline industry.
Electronic ticketing is not, however, completely paperless.
Most passengers still want or need a hard copy Passenger Receipt, and most airlines still have a need to issue a paper Boarding Pass Also, various government regulations and the Warsaw Convention on liability still require that various paper notices be provided to passengers.
When purchasing an E-Ticket over the telephone, note the name of the ticketing agent, as well as the date and time you purchased the electronic ticket.
Then ask the agent to fax or mail you an itinerary indicating that you have purchased an electronic ticket, and a copy of all associated terms and conditions of use.
Return to top
Delayed and Canceled Flights
When making travel plans, passengers should always consider the possibility of a flight delay or cancellation.
Making reservations on a second or back-up flight should not be done without first finding out whether you have to pay a cancellation fee or a higher fare for altering your reservations.
If a flight is available on another airline, you can ask the delayed airline to endorse your ticket to the second airline, thereby avoiding a fare increase.
Although there is no rule requiring airlines to do this, they often do so in the interest of good public relations.
If a scheduled flight is canceled, the airline will rebook passengers on the next available flight to the intended destination at no additional charge.
If the rebooking process for another flight involves a significant delay, a passenger may opt to have his or her ticket endorsed and find space on another airline.
Each airline has its own policy on compensating passengers who are stranded as a result of a delayed flight.
If you are delayed, ask the airline staff if they will pay for meals or a phone call.
In situations where the delay is short or where the airline is charging a very low fare for the flight, it is not likely that the airline will offer any help.
Amenities are also likely to be refused where the delay is caused by bad weather or other factors beyond the airlines control.
However, in situations where the airline has caused a significant delay, passengers may often request and have supplied to them a phone call, cab fare, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.
Travelers should keep track of out of pocket expenses and receipts where amenities are denied.
An airlines consumer affairs office may be willing to provide a reimbursement at a later time.
Airlines generally refuse to pay passengers for financial losses resulting from a delayed flight.
If there is significant importance relating to the timeliness of your flight, plan ahead.
Return to top
Overbooking Overbooking is a common practice used by airlines to make up for a certain number of "no-shows" on each flight.
When this results in a seating shortage, passengers are sometimes left behind, or bumped.
It is important to note that denied boarding compensation should be given in the form of a check to the passenger on the day and place the bumping occurred.
If the alternative transportation provided by the airline departs before this can be done, the payment must be sent to the passenger within 24 hours.
Return to top Voluntary Bumping When a flight is overbooked, the airline is required to seek out passengers who are not in a hurry and are willing to volunteer their seats in return for compensation.
Passengers volunteering to be bumped can keep their original ticket as well.
There are no regulations governing how much a passenger should be compensated for being voluntarily bumped and policies vary among airlines.
Therefore, passengers who volunteer should negotiate with the airline to receive as much compensation as possible.
Before volunteering, you should also ask a few important questions, including:
When is the next flight on which the airline can confirm a seat? Will the airline provide amenities while waiting for the next flight? If a free ticket is offered as compensation, are there restrictions?
The selection of volunteers is left to the airline and in many cases, they will select those volunteers who are willing to sell back their reservations for the lowest price.
Return to top
Involuntary Bumping
Federal regulations require airlines offering flights with a passenger capacity of 60 or more persons to establish boarding priorities for situations where an insufficient number of volunteers offer to take another flight.
In addition, airlines are required to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written statement describing their rights, including the terms, conditions and limitations on compensation.
Included in this statement must be the airlines boarding priority rules and criteria.
With certain exceptions, travelers who are turned away from a flight are entitled to denied boarding compensation, which amounts to being paid for the inconvenience of having to take another flight.
The amount of denied boarding compensation paid to an involuntarily bumped passenger depends on the price paid for their ticket and the length of the delay.
The following rules govern denied boarding compensation:
If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination within one hour after your original arrival time, there is no entitlement to compensation.
If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time, the airline must pay you an amount equal to the price of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $200.
On international flights, the delay in arrival time can be between one and four hours.
If the airline fails to provide substitute transportation or if the substitute transportation provided is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination more than two hours later (four hours later internationally) than your original arrival time, the denied boarding compensation doubles.
Hence, the airline will be compelled to pay you twice the amount of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $400.
If you have been involuntarily bumped, you can still keep your original ticket and use it on another flight.
If you choose to make your own arrangements, a request can be made for an involuntary refund to recoup the price of the ticket for the flight you were bumped from.
It is important to note that denied boarding compensation should be given in the form of a check to the passenger on the day and place the bumping occurred.
If the alternative transportation provided by the airline departs before this can be done, the payment must be sent to the passenger within 24 hours.
In cases where an airline has to substitute a smaller plane for the originally scheduled plane, the airline is not required to compensate passengers who are bumped as a result.Denied boarding compensation may also be withheld in certain cases where it is shown that a passenger has not complied with conditions imposed by the airline.
These may include:
To be eligible for compensation, passengers must have a confirmed reservation.
Where an airline cannot find your reservation, the presence of an OK status on a ticket will suffice, provided however, that the ticket holder has not missed a required reconfirmation deadline.
All deadlines for purchasing tickets must be met Most tickets need to be picked up and paid for no later than 30 minutes before a flight departs.
Discount priced tickets must be purchased within a certain number of days after a reservation is made.
All deadlines set by the airline for checking in must be met.
Most airlines set an amount of time within which passengers must present themselves to the airline before a scheduled departure.
For most domestic flights, passengers are required to check in at least ten minutes before the time of departure.
Do not count on this being the case every time, in that check in deadlines can be up to an hour or longer.
Check-in deadlines for international flights can be as much as three hours before a flights scheduled departure time.
If you miss the ticketing or check-in deadline for your flight, it is possible to lose both your reservation and the right to compensation if the flight is oversold.
These rules do not apply in the following situations: Flights on planes with a capacity of 60 or fewer passengers.
Specially chartered flights, international flights inbound to the United States.
Flights between foreign cities.
These types of flights may have similar rules that can be obtained from the carrier.
The complete rules for the payment of compensation and boarding priorities for each airline are available at all ticket counters and boarding locations.
Also, a notice concerning the overbooking of flights must be clearly posted at each ticket station.
Return to top
Liability/Foreign Travel Airlines who offer international flights and have adopted the liability limitations set forth under the Warsaw Convention must furnish passengers with a written statement declaring that the provisions set forth under the treaty may apply to the passengers entire trip.
The liability limitation caps passenger recovery for death or personal injury at approximately $10,000.
Higher caps must be specifically set forth by the airline.
Passengers seeking additional coverage should speak to the airline directly or to an insurance agent for more information.
Return to top
Damage and Loss
Airlines can limit their liability for delay, loss and damage to baggage.[4] They must conspicuously display a sign stating the extent to which liability is limited.
Typically, airlines limit their liability to $1,250 per passenger on domestic flights and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage on international flights.
If your bag arrives open, unlocked, or visibly damaged, immediately check to see if any of the contents are missing or damaged.
If so, report the damage to the airline right away and insist on filling out a claim form.
If your luggage arrives smashed or torn, the airline will pay for the repairs in most cases.
If the luggage cannot be fixed, the airline will attempt to negotiate a settlement with you.
Airlines often decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or because of inadequate packing precautions.
However, airlines generally do not disclaim liability for fragile merchandise packed in its original factory sealed carton, a cardboard mailing tube, or other container designated for shipping and packed with protective padding material.
If your luggage or an item you are checking is worth more than the monetary cap imposed by the airline, it is suggested that you inquire about purchasing excess valuation insurance from the airline.
This will guarantee replacement if damage does occur.
If your baggage is lost altogether, you will have to fill out another form to secure repayment for your loss.
There are often deadlines associated with filing a lost baggage claim, so it is important to adhere to all of the instructions on the form.
Airlines do not automatically reimburse passengers for the claims they file.
They will use the information you provide to estimate your actual losses, account for depreciation and make an offer of settlement.
Often, an airline will require you to provide receipts for the items you claimed lost.
Generally, it takes between six weeks and three months for an airline to pay a claim for lost luggage.
When they tender a settlement, they may offer either cash or a higher amount in free flight credits.
If you experience difficulty in obtaining a remedy, contact the U.S. Department of Transportation, C-75, Washington, D.C. 20590, 1-202-366-2220.

Smoking
Smoking is prohibited on all domestic scheduled-service flights except for flights over six hours to or from Alaska or Hawaii .
This ban applies to domestic segments of international flights, on both U.S. and foreign airlines.
The ban does not apply to nonstop international flights, even during the time they are in U.S. airspace.
The prohibition applies in the passenger cabin and lavatories, but not in the cockpit.
Smoking is also banned on other scheduled-service flights by U.S. airlines that are operated with planes seating fewer than 30 passengers.
(i.e. commuter flights to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean) Cigar and pipe smoking is banned on all U.S.-carrier flights - scheduled and charter, domestic and international.
Smoking is permitted by some foreign airlines, but most of those permitting smoking do provide for non-smoking sections.

Travel Agents
Consumers choosing to make their travel arrangements through a New York based travel agent or consultant are afforded several statutory protections from fraud and misrepresentation.
A travel consultant is defined within New Yorks Truth in Travel Act [5] as any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association, other than a common carrier or employee of a common carrier, who as principal or agent, sells or offers for sale any travel tickets or orders for transportation, or negotiates for or holds himself out by solicitation, advertisement or otherwise as one who sells, provides, furnishes, contracts or arranges for such travel tickets or orders for transportation.

Travel Services
Providers of travel related services are required to obtain a consumers consent before contacting a credit card issuer to reserve or set aside any amount of credit to ensure payment for services.[6]
Once the actual charges a consumer will incur have been determined, travel service providers are required to promptly request release of any amount reserved which exceeds the charges by more than $25.00.
Complaints involving this provision should be directed to the local office of the Attorney General.

Travel Agreements
Upon agreeing to purchase a membership in a travel club or to enter into any travel services contract or other agreement to accept transportation, lodging, an interest or investment in a time share plan, travel investment, or other travel related service, the travel promoter must provide the consumer with a written disclosure of all limitations on and terms of the agreement within five business days of the agreement.[7]
Once a consumer has received a full written disclosure, he or she may cancel the agreement within three business days of receipt.
There is no prescribed form of cancellation, in that the consumer need only indicate an intention to not be bound by the agreement.
The consumer may cancel the agreement during the time period before receipt of the disclosure as well.
The travel promoter must refund all payments made by the consumer within ten days after notice of cancellation is given and remains liable for all payments made until a refund is given.
Return to top
Charter Flights
"Public Charters" can be purchased from a tour operator, a travel agent, or sometimes directly from the airline.
If your flight has been arranged by a club or other organization for its members it may be what is called an "affinity" charter flight.
These charters generally do not carry the consumer protection provisions of Public Charters.
It is important to be certain of what kind of charter flight you are purchasing.
A Public Charter may include only the flights, or it may be sold as a complete package, including hotels, guided tours, and ground transportation.
Either way, your rights are spelled out in a contract you have with the tour operator.
The operator or your travel agent should give you a contract to sign at the time you purchase your trip.
This contract should be carefully reviewed before you pay any money.
Return to top
Required Disclosures The Department of Transportation requires tour operators to disclose certain information in your contract about the restrictions that they impose and the rights that you have under their rules.
Return to top
Cancellations
You usually pay a penalty if you cancel.
On some charters, if a substitute can go in your place you only lose a $25 fee.
You can buy trip cancellation insurance.
These policies usually provide a refund in case you must cancel due to illness or death in the family.
Your travel agent or tour operator can tell you how to buy the insurance and what health conditions it does or doesn't cover.
Cancellation insurance often won't pay you if you must cancel because of a preexisting condition.
The tour operator or airline can cancel a Public Charter for any reason up until 10 days before departure.
Your flight might be canceled if it doesn't sell well or for some other reason.
This is a risk you take in return for a low fare.
(During the last 10 days before departure, a Public Charter can be canceled only if it is physically impossible to operate it.)
Return to top
Schedule Changes All charter flights and ground arrangements are subject to changes.
Signing a contract does not guarantee that prices won't go up or that itineraries won't change.
But, if there is a "major change" in your flight or tour, you have the right to cancel and get a penalty-free refund.
Major changes include:
A change in departure or return city (not including a simple change in the order in which cities are visited).
A change in departure or return date, unless the date change results from a flight delay.
(However, a flight delay of more than 48 hours is a major change.)
A substitution of a hotel that was not named as an alternate hotel in your contract.
An increase in price, if the total of all increases billed to you is more than 10% of what you originally paid.
(No increases are allowed during the last 10 days before departure.)

Refunds
If your tour operator notifies you of a major change before departure, you get a full refund if you decide to cancel.
If you choose not to cancel, the operator is not required to make partial refunds.
However, if you don't find out about a change until after your trip has begun, you can reject the changed flight or hotel, make and pay for your own alternative plans, and insist on a refund for the changed component when you get home.
No "open returns" are allowed on round-trip public charters.
Be sure you have a specific return date, city, and flight, in order to avoid being stranded.

Operational Requirements (Bonding and Escrow) The tour operator has to take specific steps to protect your money.
The tour operator must have a surety agreement, such as a bond, and must usually have an escrow account at a bank that holds your money until your flight operates.
If your money is going into a charter escrow account, the bank will be named in your contract, and the check that is sent to the charter operator should be made payable to that bank.
(If you are using a travel agent, it's OK for you to make your check out to that agent; he will make his check payable to the escrow account.)
Identify the departure date and destination on the face of the check.
If a tour operator goes out of business you should contact the surety company or bank identified in your contract for a refund.

Consumer Responsibilities You alone are responsible for knowing if you need a visa and passport for your trip.
You can be certain of the visa and passport rules of the countries you plan to visit by calling or writing their embassies in Washington, D.C. or their consulates in some major U.S. cities.

Loss or Damage to Luggage If your luggage gets lost during your tour, there may be a dispute over who is liable.
The charter airlines process claims for bags that were lost or damaged while in their possession.
If it is not clear where the problem occurred (e.g. between the airport and a hotel), the operator and the airline may both decline liability.
To cover yourself, find out if your renter's or homeowner's insurance policy covers losses that happen when you're away from home.
You might also ask your travel agent if there's a one-shot baggage insurance policy available to cover baggage problems while you are on your charter trip.

Flight Delays
Your charter may be delayed.
Last-minute schedule changes and departure delays of several hours are not uncommon on charters.
A flight can be delayed up to 48 hours before the charter operator must offer you the option to cancel with a full refund.
Charters and scheduled flights operate independently of each other.
If there's a delay on the scheduled flight connecting you to the city where your charter departs, causing you to miss your charter, you lose your flight and money.
Charter reservations are only good for one flight.
If you miss it for any reason, you're probably out of luck.
Check with the tour operator to see if he or she has another charter flying to your destination.
If your charter is late returning and causes you to miss a scheduled connecting flight back to your home, you have to pay your own expenses while you wait for the next connection.
If you have a discount fare on a scheduled connecting flight you could lose it if the returning charter is delayed.
Then you, not the airlines or tour operator, have to pay more for a regular non-discount fare.

Baggage and Seating
Your baggage can't be checked through from a scheduled flight to a charter, and vice-versa.
You have to claim your baggage and re-check it yourself.
When planning a charter, allow plenty of time to check in at the airport from which your charter leaves, or from which you have a connecting flight.
On international trips, remember that you may encounter delays in Customs.
You might find seating space for your charter plane to be more crowded than you're used to.
The low charter rate depends in part on spreading costs over a large number of people with virtually all of the seats being filled.
If a charter flight hasn't sold out shortly before departure, the operator can sell seats at bargain basement prices to latecomers.
Some who have paid the regular price well in advance may object, but should realize that the operator's alternative may be to cancel the flight altogether for economic reasons.
Charter rates are relatively low, but might not be the cheapest fare to your destination.
Ask your travel agent to compare fares on scheduled and charter flights for you.
