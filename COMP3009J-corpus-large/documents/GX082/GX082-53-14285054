6-25-03 -- Members of European Parliament Encourage U.S. to Pass a Full Human Cloning Ban
______________________________________________________________________ ________________________
WASHINGTON, DC - Joining with U.S. Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Dr. Peter Liese, bioethics expert and Member of the European Parliament, at a Capitol Hill news conference, Rep. Dave Weldon, M.D. urged the Senate to recognize the potential international ramifications stemming from their continued delay in passing a human cloning ban.
A growing number of countries have already banned human cloning, and there is increasing consensus at the United Nations that human cloning for any purpose should not proceed.
In February, Rep. Weldon's bill, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 (H.R. 2505) passed by a large bipartisan margin (241 -155) in the House of Representatives.
The same bill also passed overwhelmingly in July 2001.
The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 would prohibit anyone from performing human cloning, whether for research or reproductive purposes.
The bill does not ban embryo stem cell research, or other types of cloning that do not involve "somatic cell nuclear transfer", the cloning procedure used in to create Dolly the cloned sheep.
However, despite the fact that some scientists continue to work to clone humans, the Senate has failed to pass legislation sponsored by Senators Brownback and Landrieu that would stop human cloning.
"Human cloning is baby manufacture.
Any attempt at human cloning, for whatever purpose, is a gross form of human experimentation that the American people oppose," said Weldon.
"Human cloning hasn't cured any diseases even in animals, it poses serious risks to the cloned child to be, it will commercialize women's eggs and wombs, and it violates human dignity.
Indeed, those who perform experimental research cloning will actually make reproductive cloning easier, and increase the likelihood that even more scientists will produce cloned human babies,"
concluded Weldon.
