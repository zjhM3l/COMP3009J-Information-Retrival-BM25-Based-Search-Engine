TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ SEARCH FOR LOW SATURATED FATTY ACIDS IN WILD SUNFLOWERS Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary: Consumers are becoming more aware of the consumption of fats in their diets.
The present trend is to decrease consumption of saturated fats thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Vegetable oils are a principal source of fats in the diet.
Canola oil has the (6%) lowest saturated fats (palmitic and stearic acids) of the major oils on the market.
This compares with safflower oil with 9% and sunflower oil with 11%.
Genetically altering (lowering) the saturated fatty acids of sunflower oil would make it more comparable in quality to canola oil.
Several methods are available to alter the saturated fatty acids in sunflower.
One is genetically from the wild relatives of the cultivated sunflower, mutation of cultivated sunflower or using biotechnology to bioengineer the desired levels of fatty acids.
The present study uses the wild relatives for potential sources with low (
Two perennial species were found with less than 7% saturated fats.
These were gown in a common environment (greenhouse) to check the influence of the original environments on the fatty acid composition of the oil.
Saturated fatty acid levels were similar to those obtained from the original habitats when grown in the greenhouse.
This would indicate that the fatty acids are under genetic control and the potential to select for low levels of saturated fatty acids in crosses of these perennial species with cultivated sunflower exists.
Further work using interspecific hybridization will be necessary to transfer the genes from the wild species to cultivated sunflower.
