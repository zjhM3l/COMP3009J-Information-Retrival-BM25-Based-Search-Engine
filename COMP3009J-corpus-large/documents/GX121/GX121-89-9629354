Title: Lesson 2 - Passing on Traits (SC010202)
Abstract Children examine the individual traits of species of dogs.
They distinguish between traits common to all members of a species and traits that vary in individuals.
Finally, children associate the traits of offspring with their parents.
Subject Area: Science
Grade Level and Course Title: First Grade/Introduction to Scientific Description and Organization
Unit of Study: Parents and Offspring
Benchmarks Give evidence that characteristics are passed from parents to young (III.3.E.1).
Ask appropriate questions about offspring to determine their parents (I.1.E.1).
Key Concepts parent trait young/offspring

Sequence of Activities Advance Preparation: If you have very little background in genetics, you may wish to read through one of the resources listed above in advance.
(McCutcheon is recommended to help if children ask questions such as "Why do people have...")
Ask children to bring in pictures of their pet dogs or dogs on their street.
If you are bringing a dog to school, check that it acts well around crowds of children.
Dogs vary greatly in this respect.
Puppies and young dogs are not recommended.
Do not bring several dogs that do not live in the same household at the same time.
Check that the dog is licensed and appropriately vaccinated.
Inform parents and school administration.
Take new pencil erasers and make small arc-like cuts top and bottom so that the erasers resemble little fish.
Safety Precautions: Dogs should be well behaved and recently immunized.
The sounds of a crowded classroom will scare many otherwise well-behaved pets.
Make sure you have no children with dog allergies.
1.
Remind children of their assignment from Lesson 1.
List things that they have in common with their parents on the board in a generic fashion.
For example, if a child says, "blue eyes," write "eye color" on the board.
Put things that all humans have (such as two eyes, hair, ten fingers or toes) in one column and things that vary with individuals (height, weight, musical talent) in another, but do not discuss your reasons at first.
2.
Ask children: "Are some of these things found in almost all people?" [List characteristics of all humans.]
Ask: "What things are different in different people?" [List individual traits.]
3.
Read aloud or ask children to read "All Dogs Allowed" on the Student Pages.
Discuss the various traits of dogs and ask children to generate ideas about what the traits would be good for.
For example: + Wide feet for swimming (i.e., cocker spaniel) + Highly developed nose and "loose" upper lip for tracking (i.e., retriever) + Soft mouth (i.e., cocker spaniel) for bringing back birds without damaging them + Long, thin body (i.e., dachshund) for crawling into holes + Heavy fur for outside life in the cold (i.e., husky) + Long legs and modified hips (i.e., greyhound) for running Expand your discussion to include behavioral characteristics.
For example: + Dogs sniff and urinate as they walk in a city.
(Marking territory) + Dogs circle before they lay down to sleep.
(Matting down grass) + Dogs roll over and show their stomachs to people they trust.
(Submission) + Dogs bare their teeth to new dogs that come near their masters.
(Protection) 4.
Arrange for a short visit from a well-behaved dog that is used to children.
Ask children to generate a list of the traits of that dog.
5.
Ask children where dogs get their traits.
[From their parents.]
Ask "Is every dog exactly like its parents?" [Be prepared for stories of some relative's litter of puppies.
Some dogs get traits from grandparents or other relatives.
Do not use terms like "recessive".]
6.
Show children the dogs on the Student Pages.
Provide these instructions: "These dogs are looking for their puppies.
Make a list of the traits you think each dog's puppy might have."
[Traits should be logical, and should be individual traits, not species traits.]
7.
If facilities permit, introduce children to the web page on dog breeds and allow each child to find one dog picture that they like best.
If computer access is not available, a bulletin board of dog pictures can be used.
8.
Using the aquarium, give children time to check the fish tank.
Each child should make a pictogram of how many fish are in the tank, using the end of the cut pencil eraser as a "stamp" in a stamp pad.
The graph will look like this:
Fish
Sept. 1
Have children observe the fish in the tank over time, and as the fish reproduce, have each child record the number of fish on their graph.
9.
End the lesson with a literature tie-in, a read-aloud about dogs such as the Angela Royston book listed above or a video.
Assessment Given a picture of a cat or other domestic animal, the children should be able to generate a description of the traits of an offspring.
Application Beyond School A visit to a farm will help children understand that maintaining consistent breeds is important in agriculture.
Connections Health and Physical Education
Discuss the precautions to use around strange dogs, and the appropriate vaccination and licensing laws in the community.
