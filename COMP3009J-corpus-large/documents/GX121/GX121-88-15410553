Holiday Clossures for Park's Visitor Center
The Visitor Center at Chaco Culture National Historical Park will be closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years days, in observance of Federal holidays.
Although the Visitor Center will be closed, the cultural sites, campground, and park trails will remain open, and rangers will be on duty.
This is a wonderfully uncrowded time for visitors to enjoy the cultural sites and setting of Chaco.
The campground remains open and the trails are open, as usual, from sunrise until sunset.
Superintendent Dubois says "We encourage families to bring their children to Chaco to learn about this magnificent cultural treasure and to celebrate the native cultures of the Southwest."
The park is approximately 70 miles south of Farmington, off US 550 and County Road 7900, on County Road 7950
