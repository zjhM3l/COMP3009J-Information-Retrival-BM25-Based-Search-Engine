Overview
Gullah/Geechee people are a distinct group of African Americans who are descendants of enslaved Africans from the Rice Coast of West Africa.
Because of their geographic isolation and strong sense of community, the Gullah/Geechee were able to develop a distinct creole language and preserve more of their African cultural tradition than any other black community in the United States.
Although many rural Gullah communities still exist, they are increasingly being threatened by encroaching development, lack of jobs, and diminishing population.
The isolation of Atlantic sea island communities stretching from southern North Carolina to northern Florida was crucial to the survival of the Gullah/Geechee culture.
Within their rural communities, Gullah/Geechee people were able to maintain language, arts, crafts, religious beliefs, rituals, and foods that are distinctly connected to their West African roots.
More recently, real estate development, changing job markets, and population shifts have forced many to leave their traditional family lands.
Along with such change and decreasing isolation comes the threat of losing a unique culture that has survived since colonial times.
Purpose
The purpose of this Special Resource Study (SRS) is to identify and evaluate the role of the National Park Service (NPS) in preserving and interpreting Gullah/Geechee culture.
The primary goals of the Low County Gullah/Geechee Culture SRS are: 1. to analyze the multi-faceted components of this living, breathing culture using the established criteria for the study of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System and; 2. to outline a set management options for consideration by Congress
Unlike most special resource studies that are linked to a site or a series of sites, the NPS has been examining Gullah/Geechee Culture along the entire South Carolina and Georgia coasts, and into the northeast Florida and southeast North Carolina coasts.
The study area generally extends 30 miles inland.
Study Authorization and Funding
Congressman James E. Clyburn (D-SC6) was instrumental in including the study of Low Country Gullah/Geechee Culture as part of the FY2000 appropriations bill.
Public Law 106-113, which provided FY2000 appropriations for the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies, authorized the Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study (SRS).
The act instructs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies of the geographical areas and historic and cultural themes listed in section 326 (b) (3) using the criteria for the study of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System in accordance with Section 8 of Public Law 91-383, as amended by Section 303 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act (Public Law 105-391; 112 Stat. 3501).
Title III, Sections 301-303 of Public Law 105-391 (November 13, 1998) established the process by which areas are considered for addition to the National Park System.
The Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, is responsible for conducting studies for each area for potential inclusion.
The study will be presented to Congress in Winter 2004.
Congress will then determine what action should occur.
A Three-phased Approach to the Project
Phase One - Community Input: Phase one of the study focused on a set of community meetings to solicit public input on the scope and breadth of the study.
The study relies on research and testimony from the Gullah and Geechee people.
One important outcome from the community meetings resulted in adding the term "Geechee" to the study.
This term is used primarily in Georgia while "Gullah" is used in South Carolina.
Phase one has been completed.
Phase Two - Research and Data Collection: Phase two aimed to determine whether resources associated with Gullah/Geechee Culture have potential national significance consistent with the criteria for National Historic Landmarks (36 CFR Part 65), and, if so, seek confirmation by the Southeast Regional Director.
The NPS has also solicited the assistance of the academic community to conduct an ethnographic overview of Gullah/Geechee culture.
This effort is supplemented by an examination of major demographic and economic trends over the last 50 years in target areas traditionally inhabited by members of the Gullah/Geechee community.
Additionally, the team investigated land use trends in those areas to determine changes in land ownership.

The NPS then prepared a set of conceptual management alternatives outlining its role and the role of others.
The NPS completed the development of management alternatives during Fall, 2002, and presented the alternatives to project stakeholders and the public through a series of meetings and community forums conducted throughout the study area that were completed in early November, 2002.
The culmination of Phase III is completion of the final study, which will be transmitted to Congress.
A draft of the study is currently available for public review and can be viewed or downloaded from the resources page below.
