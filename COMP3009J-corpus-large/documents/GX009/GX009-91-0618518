THE CADET HONOR CODE
Personal integrity is one of the most important attributes for any member of our society to display.
Civil Air Patrol Cadets are held to high standards of honor and integrity, as indicated by the Cadet Honor Code: "We Will Not Lie, Steal Or Cheat, Nor Tolerate Among Us Anyone Who Does." [cadet-ELT.jpg]
WHAT TO EXPECT
Do you want to fly, learn survival, search and rescue skills, and camp out on weekends? These are some of the activities offered by the Civil Air Patrol Cadet program.
Did you know that when a plane is missing, trained Cadets from the Civil Air Patrol could do a large part of the search and rescue work? They marshal search planes, operate the radios, talk to and direct pilots and ground teams, and go into the field as ground teams using electronic tracking equipment.
Civil Air Patrol Cadets perform color guards for Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, and other patriotic and community functions.
They also have drill teams which compete with other teams across the country in areas of drill and ceremonies, aerospace and leadership knowledge, and physical fitness.
The Civil Air Patrol has a program for Cadets that offers fun and excitement as you learn and work together as a team.
Cadets attend summer camps on Air Force Bases throughout the State and Country.

WHAT IS CIVIL AIR PATROL?
Civil Air Patrol was founded on December 1st, 1941, by a group of civilian pilots to assist with coastal patrol and search and rescue activities during World War II.
In 1948, Civil Air Patrol was designated as the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force, and continues to work in close partnership with the Air Force in the accomplishment of many of its missions.
[cadet-cpr.jpg] THE CAP MISSION EMERGENCY SERVICES -
Working in close cooperation with the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), Civil Air Patrol performs 90% of all inland search and rescue activities throughout the nation.
The majority of our missions involve the locating and silencing of Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT's) located in aircraft, and Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBS's), located on boats.
AEROSPACE EDUCATION -
The Aerospace Education Program teaches Cadets, Senior Members, and the general public about the importance of this nation's aerospace environment.
It also provides our Cadets and Senior Members an opportunity to learn about all aspects of flight, weather, navigation, aviation history, and many other flight-related subjects.
CADET PROGRAMS -
The Cadet Program develops and motivates you to become one of tomorrow's leaders and a responsible citizen.
The program teaches leadership skills, helps develop physical fitness, self-confidence, moral character, and the importance of teamwork.
Cadets can become promoted in grade by the completion of achievements centered around their leadership skills and knowledge.
Civil Air Patrol relies on all of its Cadets progressing through the ranks in order to take on leadership roles within the Squadron Cadet Command Structure.
