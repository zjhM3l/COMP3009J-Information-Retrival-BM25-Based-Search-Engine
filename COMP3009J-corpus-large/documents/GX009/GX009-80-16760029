[dropseed.jpeg] From Beneath the Ashes Prairie Mural __________________________________________________________________ Ed Home - Sampler Index - Teacher Workshop Curriculum Guide - Journal - Prairie Mural - Read Aloud Novel Bibliography - Children's Books - State Goals - Credits __________________________________________________________________ Three ongoing activities, a student journal, a prairie mural and read-aloud novel, provide a sense of continuity or a "common thread" among the topics.
Scale models of flora and fauna can be made by the students in order to create a simulated prairie in the classroom, hallway or learning center.
Several extension ideas are provided with this activity to cover different subject areas and "grouping" options in the class.
One of the major goals of this unit is to visually and auditorially recreate an actual prairie environment, utilizing all subject areas.
The mural is designed as an ongoing project.
As lessons for grasses, forbs, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects and mammals are presented, examples are added to the mural.
A rationale for the Prairie Mural includes several ideas: * It provides a concrete method to visualize the sizes, colors and shapes of prairie plants and animals.
* It can be a means to integrate subject areas.
* It will help students classify organisms by common characteristics.
The transparencies in this packet can be used in the standard manner with a projector and screen to familiarize students with some of the plants and animals.
However, an integrated approach can make use of the transparencies in another manner.
Measure the given size of the plant or animal on a large piece of paper taped to the wall.
Place the overhead projector on the floor and move until the projected image is the correct size.
Have the students trace the image on the paper, decorate it and cut it out.
Then, it can become part of your prairie mural.
The transparencies for Day 2 include spring and summer plants.
Choose the season for the mural.
Remember that the spring grass is short.
It has not sent up its tall summer seed stalk although last year's yellow, dry grass plants may still be standing with the short wildflowers under them.
(Transparencies for amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are included in Days 4 
Ideally, the students can construct a full-size, three-dimensional mural of prairie plants and animals in the classroom.
The size of the mural can be just a few feet wide to show a few plants, perhaps some butterflies, and a bird, or the mural can be as large as space allows.
It can be done as a shared activity with other teachers and be in a common area, such as a hallway or learning center.
For a three-dimensional effect, trace a few additional leaves on separate paper, cut out and glue to the traced plant so that they partially project into the room.
Flower petals can also be cut out of colored paper but not glued down flat.
Have the students glue the petals only at their base, then curve the petals.
Butterflies can be folded to project into the room or "fly" over the mural suspended by string or thread.
Do not have the plants evenly spaced as they are on the transparency.
That was done only for clarity.
Overlap plants.
Have several of each kind.
For variety, turn the transparency over on the projector to switch left and right sides.
When your classroom prairie is complete, have the students experience it from different perspectives.
With the tape of prairie sounds playing, have students sit on the floor as if they were insects, under their desks as if they were snakes, on their desks as if they were butterflies, on a ladder as if they were hawks, and so on.
Have them write about their experiences.
Materials needed for the mural construction include: Glue Scissors Measuring stick * Coloring sheets of reptiles and amphibian, birds and insects Mural paper Markers Overhead projector Tape * Audiotape of prairie sounds * Transparencies of grasses, forbs, birds and mammals
Starred (*) materials are included in this packet.
Extension activities related to the mural include: 1.
Making the mural so that it represents several seasons.
2.
Assigning individual students or small groups to be the "experts" on "their" animal.
Have them write or give an oral report on it.
Included in the background section is some information on many of the plants and animals.
3.
Posting prairie poetry written at the prairie around the plants in the mural.
4.
Labeling plant and animal adaptations.
5.
Making food chains (energy from the sun going to a plant--plant eaten by an insect--insect eaten by a bird, for example) by connecting links of the chain with colorful yarn.
In a like manner, a food web can be constructed.
6.
Inviting another classroom or grade level to visit your class to see the finished mural and hear oral reports.
Videotape speech presentations.
