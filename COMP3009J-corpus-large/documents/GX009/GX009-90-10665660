Summary of: (Marriage/Divorce/Remarriage/Cohabitation) Cohabitation
Coverage: Universe responding to questions/data collection: (i.e. 15plus/all adults/all people/women 15-44/etc.)
U.S. population 15 and over
Context of question: (i.e. direct response/proxy/direct question/roster/history/ administrative records)
A self-administered questionnaire is sent to all households in the U.S., unmarried partner status is collected as a relationship to the householder, and is part of that "100%" item.
Usually a single person in the household would respond for all household members.
Frequency of collection: Every 10 years on April 1st
Earliest data available: 1990 Census of Population and Housing
Most recent data available:
One hundred percent items on Census 2000.
Strengths of the (Marriage/Divorce/Cohabitation) data collected from this source: (i.e. context with other questions, frequency, detail, coverage, etc.)
This data source provides measures of the prevalence of cohabitation for the nation, down to very small levels of geography.
This is the only Census Bureau data source that has sufficient size to show same-sex cohabiting couples in addition to opposite sex cohabiting couples.
Gaps: (areas missed due to coverage, context, frequency, etc.)
Only unmarried partners of the householder are identified.
This is a relatively small problem as very few couples are cohabiting in another person's household.
Trend data at this point is limited to two data points from Decennial Census data, and comparison of same-sex unmarried partner households between 1990 and 2000 is not possible because of technical changes in this items processing for same-sex couples.
Improvements - areas to look to:
None currently.
Considerations:
Consider the importance or legislative need to know any historical experience of cohabitation.
A simple "ever" question is possible but maybe of little use programmatically.
Current status seems the most important thing in the context of the Census.
Given the Census has been the benchmark for measuring the level of cohabitation and assessing regional and geographical differences, and that few non-householder partnerships are going to be gained by a more comprehensive cross-sectional question.
No changes are currently in progress for the measurement of cohabitation by the Decennial Census.
In addition to the practical and testing costs to include a new question on the Decennial Census form, all content must be approved by Congress and meet some programmatic or legislative need.
That is, adding any specific cohabitation question(s) beyond the category currently in place in the relationship item would have to be mandated/authorized by Congress.

Summary of: (Marriage/Divorce/Remarriage/Cohabitation) Divorce
Coverage: Universe responding to questions/data collection: (i.e. 15plus/all adults/all people/women 15-44/etc.)
U.S. population 15 and over
Context of question: (i.e. direct response/proxy/direct question/roster/history/administrative records)
A self-administered questionnaire is sent to all households in the U.S., marital status data is now collected only on the "long form", prior to Census 2000 marital status was a "100%" item.
Usually a single person in the household would respond for all household members.
In 2000, in the 100% data, divorced status can not be identified because the marriage status item was not included.
In the sample data "long form", a direct marital status question is asked for all people
Now Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, and Never Married
Frequency of collection: Every 10 years on April 1st
Earliest data available: 1880 Census of Population and Housing
Most recent data available:
No divorce data are currently available from Census 2000.
The most recent Decennial Census divorce data come from the 1990 Census.
Divorce data for 2000 will become available as the long form data are released.
Strengths of the (Marriage/Divorce/Cohabitation) data collected from this source: (i.e. context with other questions, frequency, detail, coverage, etc.)
Ability to measure long term trends in the divorced population, and most importantly the ability to measure at very small levels of geography.
Gaps: (areas missed due to coverage, context, frequency, etc.)
Data are collected only every 10 years, data for all household members are recorded by (usually) a single household respondent, not an interviewer, so missing data are more frequent.
Marital history information for ever-married people is not collected.
Limited additional variables.
In Census 2000, marital status only was collected on the "long form."
Improvements - areas to look to: * Return marital status to the 100% form.
* Possibility to add marital history item similar to that in the 1980 Decennial Census depending on congressional support and legislative need.
This question could be modified to included divorce as a response possibility to part 'c.'

If this person has ever been married --
a.
Has this person been married more than once?
O Once O More than once Ã¢ Ã¢ b. Month and year of marriage? Month and year of first marriage? __________________________ ____________________________ (Month) (Year) (Month) (Year)
"If the exact date of marriage is not known, give your best estimate."
c.
If married more than once -- Did the first marriage end because of the death of the husband (or wife)?
O Yes O No
Considerations:
In addition to the practical and testing costs of including a new question on the Decennial Census form, all content must be approved by Congress and meet some programmatic or legislative need.
That is, adding a marital history question or returning marital status would have to be mandated/authorized by Congress.

Summary of: (Marriage/Divorce/Remarriage/Cohabitation) Remarriage
Coverage: Universe responding to questions/data collection: (i.e. 15plus/all adults/all people/women 15-44/etc.)
U.S. population 15 and over
Context of question: (i.e. direct response/proxy/direct question/roster/history/administrative records)
A self-administered questionnaire is sent to all households in the U.S., marital status data is now collected only on the "long form", prior to Census 2000 marital status was a "100%" item.
Usually a single person in the household would respond for all household members.
In 2000, in the 100% data, the relationship item can only be used to identify couples who were married and living with their spouse and where one is the householder.
In the sample data "long form", a direct marital status question is asked for all people.
However, remarriage is not a concept that is captured by either the relationship item or the marital status item.
Additional questions collecting marital history data and/or remarriage data would be necessary to measure this concept.
Now Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, and Never Married
Frequency of collection: Every 10 years on April 1st
Earliest data available: 1880 Census of Population and Housing

1980 Census of Population and Housing.
No remarriage data will be available from Census 2000.

This data source does not measure remarriage as it is designed.

Marital history information for ever-married people is not collected, therefore data on remarriage is not available.
