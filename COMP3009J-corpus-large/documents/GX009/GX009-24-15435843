The President The White House Washington, D.C. 20500
June 6, 1997
Dear Mr. President:
One year ago, you declared the investigation and prevention of church arsons to be a national priority and called upon all Americans to come together in a spirit of respect and reconciliation.
Your three-pronged strategy to prosecute the arsonists, rebuild burned houses of worship and prevent additional fires has produced tremendous results.
Since June 1996, the National Church Arson Task Force (NCATF) has coordinated the efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement.
To get a more complete picture of the arson problem, the Task Force determined it would investigate arsons going back to January 1995.
Working with Congress, which provided additional resources and enacted the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, governors of many states, private groups and individuals, we have achieved considerable success.
Today we are pleased to present our First Year Report of the NCATF.
To date: * The NCATF has launched 429 investigations into arsons, bombings or attempted bombings at houses of worship since January 1, 1995.
* Federal, state and local law enforcement have arrested 199 suspects since January 1995, in connection with 150 of the 429 investigations.
* The 35% rate of arrest in NCATF arson cases is more than double the 16% rate of arrest for arsons in general.
* Federal, state and local prosecutors have successfully convicted 110 defendants in connection with fires at 77 houses of worship since January 1995.
Under your direction, your Administration initiated and implemented a comprehesive response to these arsons.
The primary mission of the Departments of Justice and the Treasury has been to investigate and prosecute the arsons.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has mounted an extensive prevention initiative, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development has joined in partnership with the National Council of Churches, the National Congress of Black Churches and others to rebuild burned churches across the nation.
Also, the Justice Department's Community Relations Service has dispatched conflict resolution experts to help ease community tensions.
We wish to commend Assistant Secretary James E. Johnson and Acting Assistant Attorney General Isabelle Katz Pinzler, co-chairs of the Task Force, and former Assistant Attorney General Deval L. Patrick, a founding co-chair of the Task Force.
The Task Force's success could not have been achieved without the dedicated work of the special agents of ATF and the FBI, prosecutors around the country, state and local law enforcement officials and others who have contributed to our efforts.
The attached report provides greater details on the progress of the Task Force's efforts.
We would be pleased to brief you in more detail.
Respectfully,
Robert E. Rubin Janet Reno

FIRST YEAR REPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT
[img.gif]
OVERVIEW
In early 1996, federal officials detected a sharp rise in the number of reported attacks on our nation's houses of worship, especially African American churches in the South.
This trend troubled communities, challenged law enforcement agencies, and stirred the nation's conscience.
In June 1996, President Clinton formed the National Church Arson Task Force ("NCATF" or "Task Force"), made the investigation of these fires a top priority of federal law enforcement, and called on all Americans to come together in a spirit of respect and reconciliation.
The President directed his Administration to implement a strategy to (1) identify and prosecute the arsonists; (2) help communities rebuild the burned houses of worship; and (3) offer assistance in preventing more fires.
Working with state and local law enforcement and private groups, federal officials achieved great success on these fronts.
Significantly, many Americans came together as a result of these arsons, often independent of the federal effort, to lend assistance in many ways.
PROSECUTIONS * 429 Investigations Launched -- The NCATF has opened 429 investigations into arsons, bombings or attempted bombings that have occurred at houses of worship between January 1, 1995, and May 27, 1997.
* 199 Arrested -- Federal, state and local authorities have arrested 199 suspects since January 1995, in connection with 150 of the 429 investigations.
* 35% Solved -- The 35% rate of arrest in NCATF cases is more than double the 16% rate of arrest for arsons in general.
* 110 Convicted -- Federal and state prosecutors have successfully convicted 110 individuals in connection with fires at 77 houses of worship.
REBUILDING * The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is working closely with the National Council of Churches, the Congress of National Black Churches, Habitat for Humanity and other organizations in the rebuilding effort.
* As a result of this cooperation, 25 houses of worship have been rebuilt and 65 are undergoing construction.
* HUD is administering a $10 million Federal Loan Guarantee Fund -- established by Congress as part of the 1996 Church Arson Prevention Act -- to assist with the rebuilding effort.
PREVENTION * Arson prevention efforts continue across the nation.
The U.S. Department of Justice awarded $3 million in grants to counties in 13 states to intensify their enforcement and surveillance efforts around vulnerable houses of worship, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded approximately $1.5 million in arson prevention and training grants.
* FEMA established a Clearinghouse for arson prevention resources that has received over 15,000 telephone inquiries from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
* FEMA has distributed more than 500,000 arson prevention packets, including the NCATF Church Threat Assessment Guide.
* FEMA efforts also include a four-city pilot project in Nashville, TN, Charlotte, NC, Macon, GA, and Utica, NY, to develop grass-roots arson prevention programs.
Led by James E. Johnson, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement and Isabelle Katz Pinzler, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, who replaced Deval L. Patrick, former Assistant Attorney General, the NCATF formalized the coordination of investigations already underway.
The NCATF brought together the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Justice Department prosecutors, United States Attorneys, victim/witness coordinators, the Community Relations Service (CRS) and the U.S. Marshals Service, in partnership with state and local officers and prosecutors.
The efforts of the NCATF have been aided significantly by support from Congress, which provided additional statutory authority and resources for these investigations.
I. PROSECUTING DEFENDANTS
A. Coordinating the Investigations
In 1996, following a series of fires around the time of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, federal authorities began to focus on the sharp increase in reports of attacks on churches, particularly African American churches in the South.
These church fires led officials to take steps to improve the coordination within federal law enforcement and between federal, state and local law enforcement.
In June 1996, President Clinton established the National Church Arson Task Force to better coordinate the efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement.
Shortly thereafter, Attorney General Janet Reno directed U.S. Attorneys to establish local task forces focusing on arsons at houses of worship or to join an existing local task force.
These local task forces include state and local law enforcement and fire prevention officials, special agents of the ATF and FBI, mediators from the Community Relations Service, and victim/witness coordinators.
[img1.gif] In addition to the local task forces, the NCATF established an operations team in Washington staffed by special agents of the ATF and the FBI, as well as seasoned prosecutors from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country.
Working with local task forces, the operations team continues to investigate incidents, identify potential connections and prosecute cases.
Since the formation of the Task Force, hundreds of ATF and FBI investigators have been deployed to work with more than 80 federal prosecutors and state and local authorities.
It is one of the largest series of arson investigations in history and is currently the largest ongoing civil rights investigation.
B. Conducting the Investigations
For years, many arsons at houses of worship were handled by local authorities, and not reported to any federal agency.
As a result, local law enforcement often did not benefit from the resources of the federal government in pursuing these incidents.
Following the formation of the Task Force, local law enforcement and fire authorities began regularly reporting these incidents to federal authorities.
As a result, they now are receiving additional assistance in these investigations.
From its inception, the NCATF developed a protocol for investigating and prosecuting suspected arsons.
The protocol sets forth procedures for facilitating the exchange of information among Task Force agencies, developing an investigative plan for each incident, and ensuring that investigators pursue all lines of inquiry, including whether the crime was motivated by race or religion, and whether any one incident is connected to any other.
To gain a more complete picture of the arson problem, the Task Force determined it would investigate arsons going back to January 1995.
Once an investigation is opened, the NCATF compiles statistical information about the case in a unified database.
In addition, the databases and computer systems of the ATF and FBI are used to track and analyze evidence and to generate investigative leads.
In pursuing these investigations, the FBI calls upon its experience in conducting civil rights investigations, and the ATF relies on its experience in conducting arson and explosives investigations.
The NCATF also engaged in training among its constituent agencies.
ATF experts trained FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors regarding arson investigations.
Civil Rights Division prosecutors and FBI experts trained ATF agents regarding civil rights investigations and prosecutions.
[img2.gif] As the past year has proven, arson cases are among the most difficult criminal cases to solve.
Forensic evidence is often destroyed in the fire, and there are often no eye witnesses to the incidents because some of the burned churches are located in isolated, rural areas.
For these reasons, the arsons can often take years to solve.
Moreover, as with many criminal acts, it is difficult to discern the motive for setting fire to a house of worship.
C. Strengthening Laws and Adding Resources
Over the past year, Congress has provided tremendous support to the efforts of the Task Force, by strengthening federal laws and providing additional resources.
When the Task Force was formalized, federal prosecutors relied on several statutes to prosecute arson cases.
Among others, they had authority under the Anti-Arson Act of 1982 to prosecute those who used fire to destroy property involved in interstate commerce (18 U.S.C. 844(i)).
Under criminal civil rights statutes, they also had the authority to prosecute those who conspired to deprive persons of their civil rights or who desecrated religious property or a house of worship (18 U.S.C. 241 and 247).
On July 3, 1996, President Clinton signed the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which granted federal prosecutors greater power in pursuing burnings and desecrations at houses of worship.
Sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Congressman Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and Congressman John Conyers, Jr.
(D-MI), the statute was passed unanimously by both Houses of Congress.
[img3.gif]
The new law, which amended 18 U.S.C. 247, enables federal prosecutors to file charges in racially motivated arsons without having to demonstrate that the incident involved the use of interstate facilities and without showing that the resulting damage totaled $10,000 or more.
Also, prosecutors can now seek sentences of up to 20 years imprisonment for arson.
In addition, in August 1996, Congress provided more than $12 million to support ATF's role in the Task Force, until the end of that fiscal year.
The next month, Congress appropriated an additional $12 million for ATF's role in the following fiscal year.
Additional funds for Task Force activities by the Justice Department and the FBI also were appropriated or reprogrammed.
D. Making Progress
1.
Investigations
The NCATF has opened investigations into 429 arsons, bombings or attempted bombings that have occurred at houses of worship between January 1, 1995, and May 27, 1997.
This number does not include vandalism and other desecration at houses of worship, which continue to be investigated and prosecuted by the FBI, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorneys offices; nor does it include fires that the investigators have determined to be accidental.
Of these 429 incidents, 162 have involved African American churches -- more than three quarters of which are located in the southern United States.
[See Appendix 1, Chart "A"; See Appendix 1, Charts "B"-"E" for a list of African American church fire investigations in the South.]
While arsons at houses of worship appeared to reach a peak in June 1996, federal authorities continue to receive reports of such arsons.
For instance, the NCATF launched 17 investigations in March 1997, 21 investigations in April 1997, and 12 investigations in May 1997.
[See Appendix 1, Charts "F"-"G" identifying the numbers of investigations launched each month since the Task Force began.]
The NCATF continues to launch a new investigation for every new suspicious fire.
As of May 27, 1997, there were 279 investigations in which arrests had not yet been made.
The Task Force remains committed to expending the necessary time, resources and effort to solving these crimes and prosecuting those who are responsible.
[img4.gif] To expand the sources of information available to investigators, the NCATF established a toll-free tip line for citizens to report information on arsons at houses of worship.
1-888-ATF-FIRE
To date, the NCATF has received more than 1500 calls through its tip line service.
The ATF and FBI also are offering rewards for information in a number of arson cases.
Private organizations, including Nationsbank and an insurance industry association, are also offering rewards.
2.
Arrests
The partnership among various enforcement agencies has produced a significant number of state and federal arrests.
Since January 1995, federal, state and local authorities have arrested 199 suspects in connection with 150 of the 429 investigations that the Task Force has launched.
This 35% rate of arrest is more than double the general arrest rate for arsons, which is approximately 16%, according to Justice Department statistics.
[See Appendix 1, Chart "H"]
Of the 199 persons arrested, 160 are white, 34 are African American, and 5 are Hispanic.
Eighty three people arrested were juveniles.
Of the 81 suspects arrested for arsons at African American churches, 55 are white, 25 are African American and 1 is Hispanic.
Of the 123 suspects arrested for arsons at non-African American houses of worship, 110 are white, 9 are African American, and 4 are Hispanic.
Five of the white suspects were arrested for arsons at both African American and non-African American churches.
[See Appendix 1, Charts "I"-"K."] More than three quarters of all arrests were made after the formation of the Task Force.
[See Appendix 1, Charts "L"-"N" identifying the number of arrests made each month since 1995.]
3.
Convictions
Since January 1, 1995, 110 defendants have been convicted in federal and state prosecutions in connection with fires at 77 houses of worship.
[See Appendix 2, for a list of incidents in which a conviction has been obtained.]
These successes include the first convictions under provisions of the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996.
Of the 25 defendants who have been convicted of federal charges, 14 have been convicted of criminal civil rights charges.
[img5.gif] Federal charges are also pending in a number of other cases, and grand jury investigations are ongoing as well.
The Task Force has found that only a few of the fires are linked by common defendants.
Conspiracy charges have been filed in a limited number of cases.
These conspiracies, though, have tended to be confined to the small geographic areas where the arsons have occurred.
Investigators continue to pursue the question of whether broader conspiracies were responsible for some of the fires, but to date the evidence has not established the existence of a national conspiracy.
In still other cases, state prosecutions have been initiated in consultation with federal prosecutors or investigators.
The NCATF actively monitors these prosecutions to ensure that any federal interest is vindicated and to ensure that accurate information is compiled regarding law enforcement's response to attacks on houses of worship.
II.
HELPING TO REBUILD
A. Coordinating the Rebuilding Effort
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has forged a coalition with the National Council of Churches, the Congress of National Black Churches, Habitat for Humanity, local financial institutions and other organizations to coordinate the rebuilding effort.
Together they have assessed the overall arson damage and worked to target resources to affected houses of worship as quickly as possible.
Resources available through this rebuilding coalition include grants, low interest loans, materials and in-kind donations, pro-bono legal services, architectural design services, assistance with insurance, and volunteers.
[img6.gif]
[img7.gif] The resources came from a wide array of participants who responded to the arsons.
Volunteer and religious organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity, Christmas in April, Mennonite Disaster Services, United Methodist's Volunteers in Mission, and the Washington Quaker Workcamps, among others, organized construction volunteers; the American Institute of Architects provided volunteer architectural design services; the AFL-CIO and other unions organized union construction workers; the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law organized private law firms to provide pro-bono legal services; and the Enterprise Foundation worked with a coalition of foundations to contribute financial resources to the rebuilding effort.
As a result of this cooperation, 25 houses of worship have been rebuilt and 65 more are currently being constructed.
[img8.gif]
B. Strengthening Resources to Help Rebuild
Working with President Clinton, Congress enacted legislation that authorized a HUD loan guarantee program that can be used for rebuilding houses of worship.
The Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 made HUD responsible for administering a $10 million Federal Loan Guarantee Fund to assist with the rebuilding of houses of worship and buildings of other non-profit organizations that have been damaged or destroyed by arson.
Through its work with local financial institutions, HUD is working actively with approximately 20% of the houses of worship identified as candidates for loan assistance.
In addition, the rebuilding coalition is awarding "rebuilding resource packages" to 79 churches in 18 states in the form of grants from the National Council of Churches, federally guaranteed loans, volunteer labor and in-kind materials.
Of these 79 churches, 13 are eligible for a HUD loan, 20 have received or are eligible for a National Council of Churches grant, and 46 are eligible for a resource package including a grant and loan.
C. Reaching out to the Communities
[img9.gif]
The private-public partnership is continuing to identify other areas where help can be provided.
The partnership conducts on-site visits and group workshops, at which technical advice and guidance is offered.
HUD has organized regional workshops to bring together ministers from the burned churches with organizations and financial institutions, volunteers, and other grant-making agencies.
III.
PREVENTING ARSONS
A. Coordinating Prevention Efforts
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is coordinating the federal government's efforts to enhance local and state programs to prevent fires at houses of worship and to promote arson awareness generally.
The National Arson Prevention Initiative, announced by President Clinton in June 1996, has focused on coordinating public and private sector resources to support community-based grass roots efforts to prevent arsons.
FEMA Director James Lee Witt met with and enlisted the support of national fire and law enforcement organizations, and religious and volunteer groups in arson prevention activities.
[img10.gif] In June 1996, FEMA established a Clearinghouse for arson prevention resources.
The toll-free number for the Clearinghouse is:
1-888-603-3100
To date, the Clearinghouse has received over 15,000 telephone inquiries from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and has provided more than 500,000 packets of arson prevention materials.
Included in those materials is the Church Threat Assessment Guide, prepared by the NCATF, that informs congregations about steps they can take to make their houses of worship safer, as well as steps to take after an incident has occurred.
In addition, following a meeting with Vice President Al Gore in June 1996, the insurance industry announced its plan to participate in the arson prevention initiative.
Insurance representatives pledged to help find insurance for houses of worship destroyed by arson.
The industry also established a toll-free insurance hotline and offered free site surveys to reduce the risk of arson for any interested house of worship.
B. Strengthening Prevention Resources
1.
Grants
In an effort to help communities prevent future arsons, the federal government provided additional resources.
For instance, with Congress' authorization, the Justice Department awarded $3 million in grants to counties from 13 states to intensify their enforcement and surveillance efforts around vulnerable houses of worship.
The states were: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
In FY 1996, FEMA disbursed $774,000 in arson training grants to enhance state and local arson investigations and prevention capabilities.
These grants have been used to deliver National Fire Academy courses by the state fire training organizations and also to support the training of state and regional arson task forces.
In FY 1997, FEMA has disbursed an additional $635,000 to the states for arson awareness and prevention efforts.
2.
Prevention Education
The NCATF updated and distributed a Church Threat Assessment Guide containing valuable information on the steps that may be taken to try to prevent fires at houses of worship and the steps to follow after an incident has occurred.
Using this guide, special agents of ATF and FBI continue to conduct prevention outreach efforts in communities across the nation.
Local and state fire and law enforcement leaders and members of the insurance industry have also successfully utilized the guide to conduct threat assessments of religious structures.
The NCATF is working closely with FEMA, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National Sheriffs' Association and Southern governors to develop a series of interdisciplinary training conferences and workshops on arson prevention that will be conducted in 13 targeted Southern states in 1997.
An additional 4 regional conferences outside the Southern region are also planned.
Recognizing that arson is a local problem that must be addressed at the grassroots level, FEMA has developed a pilot community action program for arson prevention in four communities: Nashville, TN, Charlotte, NC, Macon, GA, and Utica, NY.
A coalition of fire prevention personnel, law enforcement personnel and community, school and business leaders has been recruited to develop local arson prevention programs.
These include: workshops on juvenile firesetters, arson risk assessment surveys, arson hot-lines, improved building and fire code enforcement and neighborhood watch programs.
These demonstration programs will become the basis for a national grassroots arson prevention effort.
IV.
RECONCILIATION
A. Reaching Out to the Affected Communities
Without the confidence and cooperation of the congregations whose houses of worship burned, many of these investigations, which were difficult at the outset, would have been destined to fail.
Faced with criticism of law enforcement from some congregations, the NCATF took steps early on to ensure solid, working relationships between law enforcement and the affected communities.
Less than a week after being formalized, the NCATF met with FBI and ATF Special Agents in Charge and U.S. Attorneys from the Southeast region to discuss the perceptions within the affected communities and to emphasize the critical importance of pursuing the investigations with vigilance, determination and dispatch, as well as with sensitivity to the needs of the victims.
Following these meetings, the agents and prosecutors, together with representatives from the [img11.gif] CRS, worked to improve lines of communications with the affected communities and make their commitment to these investigations clear.
President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney General Reno have helped reach out to the affected communities, by bringing the church arsons to the nation's attention, speaking out forcefully on the commitment of the federal government to solve these arsons and meeting with ministers from the burned churches.
In June 1996, President Clinton traveled to the site of a burned African American church in Greeleyville, SC, to help dedicate a new church.
Later that month, he organized an interfaith breakfast where he called on leaders of all faiths to open discussions to resolve our nation's racial and religious divisions.
In August, the President and Vice President and their families traveled to Fruitland, TN, to help rebuild a church that had been destroyed earlier.
The President also convened a meeting of governors from affected states, who have worked hard to marshal resources in their states to help investigate arsons, prevent future arsons, and rebuild burned houses of worship.
He also acknowledged the work of many groups which responded to these incidents, including the National Council of Churches, the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the NAACP.
In addition to meeting with representatives from these groups and the Congressional Black Caucus, Assistant Secretary Johnson, then-Assistant Attorney General Patrick, and current Acting Assistant Attorney General Pinzler, have visited churches in the South to reinforce the Task Force's commitment to these investigations and view the devastation these arsons have wrought.
[img12.gif]
B. Dispatching Conflict Resolution Experts
The Community Relations Service (CRS) also has been an important partner in Task Force outreach efforts.
Conflict resolution experts from CRS have worked in many communities across the country to identify and resolve racial conflicts and reduce racial tensions, to foster healthy relationships between law enforcement and minority communities and to facilitate communications among all parties.
[img13.gif]
The NCATF also developed, with the help of CRS, a "Best Practices" guide for conducting community outreach activities.
CRS plays an integral part in the Administration's response in local towns and cities, working with over 150 local communities in reducing racial polarization, bridging communication between law enforcement and minority communities, facilitating a biracial rebuilding effort, and training law enforcement on cultural diversity and race relations.
Throughout the South, CRS convened a series of dialogues on race relations in an effort to reduce the likelihood of further church burnings.
C. Watching the Nation Respond
[img14.gif] In addition to the efforts of Congress, federal agencies and the states, many private companies and organizations, as well as an untold number of Americans, pitched in to respond to the arsons.
Private companies offered funds and materials to help rebuild the burned churches.
Transportation companies offered reduced fares for volunteers who traveled south to lend a hand.
And thousands of Americans donated time and money to support these efforts.
Habitat for Humanity estimates that more than 15,000 individuals volunteered to help in the rebuilding process.
[img15.gif]
Seventy-three VISTA and AmeriCorps volunteers traveled to 18 rural communities in which church arsons have occurred and to over 70 other communities in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
In these communities, volunteers conducted community and church threat assessments, organized arson watch groups and town hall meetings on arson prevention, and engaged in community relations projects.
[img16.gif]
In the end, Americans of all walks of life refused to let these acts of destruction tear apart our communities or our nation.
[img17.gif]
V. DRAWING PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS
Although the investigations of most of the fires continue, the charges filed and the convictions obtained to date enable the Task Force to offer some preliminary conclusions.
These conclusions are not based on cases that have not been completed or where evidence is not sufficient to support additional charges.
As a result, the Task Force cannot answer all of the questions raised by the fires.
* Damage
Hundreds of houses of worship burned, congregations were temporarily displaced, and many people were left wondering how this could happen in the 1990's.
These arsons destroyed rural wooden churches, ruined 100-year old Bibles, and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.
But those communities which suffered a burned house of worship came to realize that thousands of Americans really care.
The arsonists may have sought to divide our communities by burning our houses of worship, but in the end they only helped bring them closer together.
* Multiple Motives
The arsons at African American churches raised significant fears about an increase in racially motivated crimes.
As a result of our efforts to date, we have determined that the arsons -- at both African American and other houses of worship -- were motivated by a wide array of factors, including not only blatant racism or religious hatred, but also financial profit, burglary, and personal revenge.
The Task Force continues to investigate many cases.
When sufficient evidence of racial motive is developed, we will continue to seek and obtain criminal civil rights convictions, as we have against 14 of the 25 defendants convicted of federal charges in Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
* National Conspiracy
While the Task Force continues to explore the question whether there are connections between the fires across the nation, the cases closed to date and the charges that have been filed do not support the theory that these fires were the product of a nationwide conspiracy.
For instance, the Task Force has found that only a few of the fires are linked by common defendants.
Conspiracy charges have been filed in a limited number of cases.
These conspiracies, though, have tended to be confined to the small geographic areas where the arsons have occurred.
* Hate Group Involvement
While there have been a handful of cases in which members and former members of hate groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, have been convicted for arsons at houses of worship, most of the defendants were not found to be members of hate groups.
Prosecutors need not show, however, that a defendant belongs to a particular hate group in order to gain a conviction.
* Investigations Continue
The Task Force continues to investigate and prosecute those responsible for burning our nation's houses of worship.
It is, therefore, too soon for the task force to speak conclusively about the motivation behind many of the fires at churches and other houses of worship.
While it was the number of fires at African American churches that brought these crimes to national attention, the NCATF will continue to investigate and prosecute attacks on all houses of worship, regardless of their denomination or racial composition.
CONCLUSION
We have seen how law enforcement working together can produce tremendous successes.
We have seen how government agencies and private groups can work together to help rebuild a house of worship.
And we have seen how all Americans from all walks of life can come together as one.
We are committed to building on the progress that we have seen to date and to eliminating the divisions in our society.
The federal effort continues to prosecute the arsonists, rebuild the burned houses of worship, and prevent more fires.
There is more work to be done.
We are committed to seeing the task completed.
Acknowledgment
The co-chairs of the Task Force would like to thank all of the investigators, prosecutors, state and local officials and others who have worked tirelessly and so well over the course of the last year as these investigations have proceeded.
We would also like to thank our partners in these efforts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Community Relations Service.

Pine Prairie First Baptist Church (Pine Prairie) (Western District) - On March 1, 1996, and February 23, 1997, these Caucasian churches were burned.The fire at the Saint Peters Catholic Church was started after lit matches were dropped into the money box where patrons paid for candles.
Fire investigator found remnants of burned paper and carpet in the library of the Pine Prairie First Baptist Church.
