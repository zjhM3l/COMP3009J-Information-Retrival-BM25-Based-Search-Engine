Perfect Numbers - A Case Study
Perfect numbers are those numbers that equal the sum of all their divisors including 1 and excluding the number itself.
Most numbers do not fit this description.
At the heart of every perfect number is a Mersenne prime.
All of the other divisors are either powers of 2 or powers of 2 times the Mersenne prime.
Let's examine the number 496 - one of the known perfect numbers.
In order to demonstrate that 496 is a perfect number, we must show that
496 = (the sum of all its divisors including 1 and excluding 496)
We might just start by dividing and working out the divisors the long way.
Or, we might begin by noting that, in the notation that includes a Mersenne prime,
496 = 24 (2^5 - 1) = 2^4 x 31.
From this expression, we may easily obtain the divisors of 496, namely:
1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 31, (2Ã—31), (2^2Ã—31), (2^3Ã—31), and (2^4Ã—31).
The sum of all the divisors excluding 496 is then
1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 31Ã— (1 + 2 + 2^2+ 2^3)
In order to break this mess down a bit, let us examine the partial sum
u = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4
If we multiply by 2 (i.e., 2u = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5) then subtract, we find
u = 2u - u = 2^5 - 1 = 31
Thus, the sum of the divisors becomes
= 31 + 31(2^4 - 1) = 2^4Ã—31 = 496
as we were to show.
To show that any perfect number may be broken down in this way, we let
n[P] = 2^c(2^c+1 - 1)
be a perfect number with (2c+1 -1) being the embedded Mersenne prime.
Then the divisors of n[P] are
1, 2, 2^2, ... , 2^c, 2^c+1 - 1, 2(2^c+1 - 1), ..., 2^c(2^c+1 - 1)
The sum of all the divisors excluding np is then
1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^c + (2^c+1 - 1) (1 + 2 + ... + 2^c-1)
Again, we examine the partial sum:
u = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^c.
We multiply by 2 (i.e., 2u = 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^c + 2^c+1) then subtract:
u = 2u - u = 2^c+1 - 1
The sum of the divisors becomes:
= (2^c+1 - 1) + (2^c+1 - 1)(2^c - 1) = 2^c(2^c+1 - 1)
as we were to show.
