COUNTRY COMMERCIAL GUIDE (CCG) ICELAND 2002 Prepared by: Economic/Commercial Section U.S. Embassy ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland CHAPTER I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Iceland is a stable democracy with a dynamic, developed consumer economy based on fishing, tourism, aluminum smelting and information technology.
Icelanders are generally well educated, with sophisticated tastes and a liking for American consumer goods.
This, along with a per capita GDP of $26,972 (2001) means that the Icelandic lifestyle is similar in many ways to that in the U.S. Iceland is an island nation in the North Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and Norway.
It is about the size of the State of Virginia and has a population of 286,000.
The first settlers arrived from Norway in 874.
Iceland achieved full independence from Denmark in 1944, having been ruled from Copenhagen for almost 600 years.
Iceland is a member of EFTA and the EEA.
It is also a member of NATO but has no armed forces of its own.
The U.S. provides for the defense of Iceland in exchange for base rights under a bilateral agreement.
Due largely to financial deregulation and a strong performance by its fishing industry, Iceland experienced sustained economic growth in the 1990s.
The economy fell into recession in late 2001, but the government took monetary and fiscal measures that resulted in a fairly soft landing.
Inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2002, with slightly negative GDP growth, and a return to positive growth in 2003.
The government is seeking to diversify Iceland's economic base by attracting industries such as metals smelting and "server farms" that can take advantage of its inexpensive energy generated from the country's abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power resources.
Foreign investment is restricted in the energy and fishing industries, but the government is privatizing banks and the national telephone company.
Iceland's economy is highly export-driven.
Marine products account for the majority of goods exports.
Other important exports include aluminum, ferro-silicon alloys, machinery and electronic equipment for the fishing industry, pharmaceuticals, and woolen goods.
Exports account for about one-fourth of GDP and imports for one-third.
Most of Iceland's exports go to the EU and EFTA countries, the United States, and Japan.
The U.S. is Iceland's largest bilateral investment partner and largest partner in services trade.
Potential growth areas for exports to Iceland include electric generating equipment, processed foodstuffs, wine and beer, computer equipment and software, other consumer goods, franchise businesses, and high-tech fishing equipment.
The main barriers to U.S. exports are Iceland's increasing adoption of European product standards and regulations, and tariffs on certain categories of foodstuffs and consumer products.
Most agricultural products are subject to high tariffs and import of some, such as uncooked meat, is prohibited for phyto-sanitary reasons.
Almost all Icelanders speak English, and there is no language barrier for Americans doing business in Iceland.
Iceland is one of the most advanced countries in the world in the use of information and communications technology.
Icelandic banks and other financial institutions are fully connected to world markets, and there are no foreign exchange controls or restrictions on movement of capital.
Additional information on Iceland and the full services of the American Embassy in Reykjavik can be found on the Internet at www.usa.is.
CHAPTER 2: ECONOMIC TRENDS AND OUTLOOK The Icelandic economy appears to be on a path to recovery after falling into recession in the latter part of 2001.
This downturn put an end to several years of steady growth resulting from financial deregulation, privatization of government enterprises, and stable prices for the country's critical fish exports Although GDP and expenditures are forecast to decrease in 2002, and unemployment to increase, the Government expects the economy to grow minimally in 2003 and return to "normal" growth of 3.0-3.5% in 2004.
The value of the krÃ³na has stabilized after plunging to an all-time low against the Government's currency index in December 2001, and strong growth in exports helped shrink the current account deficit from 10.1% of GDP in 2000 to only 4.4% in 2001.
Despite a predicted surplus, the national budget finished in deficit in 2001.
A surplus is again predicted for 2002.
The Government announced significant cuts in business taxes and lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy, as well as cutbacks in public spending.
These steps notwithstanding, inflation forecasts for the current year are still above the Government's target, and there remain other risks to recovery, such as the possibility of renewed wage demands and high levels of business and consumer debt.
The Central Bank of Iceland attributed the slowdown to the need to correct imbalances and inflationary pressures that had built up in the economy from 1999-2001, mainly due to a rapid expansion of consumption and credit and depreciation of the krÃ³na.
After stabilizing near the end of 2001, as the economy slowed and Iceland's trade balance improved, the krÃ³na appreciated roughly 6% against the GOI currency index.
The krÃ³na has risen about 7.5% against the dollar since hitting its low point in late November 2001.
This modest recovery appears to have stemmed a 20-month slide in the krÃ³na's value.
This new stability is also attributable to increased capital inflows resulting from the differential between Icelandic and other European interest rates.
Despite dire predictions from proponents of Icelandic EU membership, the krÃ³na has held its own since the full introduction of the Euro.
Iceland's current account deficit dropped rapidly, from 10.1% of GDP in 2000 to 4.4% by the end of 2001.
For the first two months of 2002, Iceland's trade balance was actually in surplus to the tune of $80 million, and the Government forecasts the deficit to drop to as low as 2.0% of GDP by the end of 2002.
Export growth of 7.5% in 2001, led by the fishing and pharmaceutical sectors, was partly responsible, but a decrease in imports, particularly of automobiles and capital goods, also contributed as the krÃ³na declined in value in the latter part of 2001.
Total imports declined 8% in 2001 compared to the previous year.
The recent stability of the krÃ³na has helped the Government's efforts to bring inflationary pressures under control.
The Central Bank revised its 12-month inflation estimate for 2002 downward to 3.0% from its earlier 4.0% projection.
This contrasts with the 9.4% inflation spike the country experienced in 2001.
The Icelandic Consumer Price Index (CPI) on February 1 2002 was 0.3% lower than in January, its first decline in the last 18 months.
However, the CPI still stood 8.9% higher than it was in February 2001, and not all the inflation forecasts are quite as rosy as the Bank's.
The National Economic Institute predicts a 5.2% inflation rate for 2002, and unanticipated events such as petroleum price increases or reopening of national wage agreements could push the rate back up.
Since March 2001 the Government's exchange rate policy has been based on an inflation target of 2.5%, within a target range of 4.0%, through 2003.
Whether the GOI will succeed in meeting this goal is not clear.
The twelve-month inflation rate has been above the target since June 2001, and remained at 8.7% in March 2002, despite the February fall in the CPI.
Based on its expectation that inflation would moderate in the coming year, and in response to short-term rate reductions announced by Iceland's three commercial banks, the Central Bank has lowered current account interest rates from 6.7% to 5.4% since the beginning of 2002.
The commercial banks have responded accordingly with rate cuts of their own.
Despite the cuts, Icelandic interest rates remain high relative to rates in its European trading partners.
In addition to monetary measures, the Government has taken fiscal steps to encourage recovery, cutting both business and individual taxes for 2002.
The corporate income tax rate dropped from 30% to 18%, and the 1.2% corporate property tax was cut in half.
Businesses were relieved from inflation indexed accounting rules and allowed to do their accounting in foreign currencies.
A 1.5% stamp tax on corporate and individual loans was also cut.
The GOI also lowered personal income and property tax rates.
The Government is relying on expanded business activity to make up the revenue loss, as happened after corporate taxes were cut from 50% to 30% in 1989.
On the expenditure side, the 2001 national budget originally called for a 4.5% surplus, but the final result was a deficit of $15 million (about 0.2% of GDP).
The black ink turned to red because of overspending (which contributed to inflation), declining revenues due to the slowing economy, and because the budget was based in part on the expectation of substantial revenues from privatization of two banks and the national telephone company.
The privatizations were postponed, and the government never realized the income.
The 2002 budget calls for a surplus of 2.5% of GDP, based on decreased public investment spending and $50 million less in interest payments due to decreased debt.
However, the budget again relies in part on anticipated revenues from privatization, and does not do much to reduce current spending.
Debt remains a concern for Iceland's economic recovery.
The Government expects its own debt ratio to decline to 14% of GDP by the end of 2002.
However, local governments carry substantial debt and consumer and corporate debt remain at high levels as a hangover from the expansion that ended in 2001.
Banks reported a 'substantial' increase in non-performing loans in 2001.
Mortgage and other consumer loan rates are indexed, and a serious outbreak of inflation could increase the number of bad loans even further.
The 2001 slowdown played itself out in the labor market in the form of an unemployment rate that more than doubled within 6 months, from 1.0% in September 2001 to 2.6% in February 2002.
Before the slump set in, there was basically no unemployment and the tight labor market contributed to inflationary pressure by pushing up wages.
In absolute terms the increase in unemployment was not large, but had a psychological impact on Icelanders who had grown accustomed to full employment in the years of expansion that preceded the downturn.
The rise in unemployment also may have been a factor in a decision by Iceland's principal labor unions not to reopen national wage contracts this year.
Principal growth sectors: Metals smelting and other energy-intensive industrial activities, tourism, biomedical research, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy technology, and services to the fishing industry are the areas most likely to experience growth in the near-term.
Energy intensive industries can take advantage of Iceland's abundant and inexpensive hydroelectric and geothermal power.
Tourism increased in 2001 despite the impact of terrorism on the industry worldwide, and is forecast to increase again in 2002.
Biomedical and genetic research firms are taking advantage of Iceland's small, homogeneous population and extensive health and genealogical records to investigate the genetic causes of disease and develop gene-based therapies.
The pharmaceutical industry is opening new export markets, mainly in Europe, for a variety of products.
Iceland is a world leader in geothermal energy production and fishing, and the government is actively helping these industries export their expertise and specialized equipment.
Information and communications technology was a major growth area during the 1990s, but has been affected by the recent slump in these industries.
There is still a core of innovative, successful IT firms that will be well positioned for renewed growth when this sector begins to recover.
The government's role in the economy: Both the national government and local authorities play a large role in the Icelandic economy, particularly in banking, energy, fishing, agriculture and telecommunications.
This is gradually changing as the economy evolves from a statist, cooperative model to a more open, market-oriented framework.
The government began deregulating the financial sector in the mid-1990s, but still owns majority shares in two commercial banks.
Electricity generation and distribution, and production of energy for heating are in the government domain, with a combination of national and local government ownership.
The national government has announced a medium-term intention to open this sector to private investment.
Although the fishing industry is in private hands, the government sets fishing quotas and restricts entry and foreign investment.
Agriculture is heavily subsidized, through support payments and high tariffs.
An attempt in 2001 to privatize the national telephone company failed due to poor market conditions, but the government plans to try again in 2003.
The mobile telephone market is already fully open to competition.
Both national and local governments actively support business development, through grants, loans, or equity investments in new businesses.
Regional economic integration: Iceland is a member of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), but not a member of the European Union (EU).
Nonetheless, Iceland maintains close economic ties to the EU through membership in the European Economic Area (EEA).
As a result, EU directives binding on EEA members increasingly influence Icelandic laws and regulations.
Under the terms of the EEA, Iceland is obliged to offer national treatment to EEA members in many areas, including free movement of labor and public procurement, but not in agricultural trade or fishing.
EU product directives are being increasingly enacted into Icelandic law, although implementation of the new laws has been uneven.
Trade patterns: The EU is Icelands largest trading partner overall, accounting for 68% of total exports and 57% of total imports in 2000.
On a per country basis, Britain and Germany claim the largest share of trade.
The U.S. accounted for about 11% of Iceland's total trade in 2000.
However, the U.S. is Iceland's largest bilateral trading partner for services, with over 40% of such trade in 2000.
The U.S. also recently became Iceland's largest bilateral investment partner.
The principal U.S. exports to Iceland are transport equipment and other manufactured articles, while the import is mainly fish.
Infrastructure: Icelandic infrastructure is very good, especially in the Reykjavik area, which is the center of most business activity and home to almost 2/3 of the country's population.
Services in rural areas are also good, although many roads are unpaved and mobile telephone service is unavailable in many areas outside of towns and villages.
Iceland's mountainous terrain and severe winter climate can make transportation difficult in parts of the country during winter.
There are no railroads.
Regular air service connects principal towns with Reykjavik.
Domestic freight is carried by coastal shipping or by truck.
Icelandic shipping companies offer integrated service from the U.S. and Europe.
There are deep-water harbors around the island, and ports in the southwest of the country are ice-free year-round.
Drifting ice from Greenland can affect shipping in the north in late winter and spring.
Communications networks are excellent.
A state-of-the-art fiber-optic cable circles the country, and Iceland is a world leader in mobile telephone use and technology.
Internet access is universally available.
Iceland is part owner of the CANTAT III trans-Atlantic cable, and is preparing a project to lay a 1.2terabyte cable link to Scotland.
Labor: Iceland's labor force numbers about 160,000, with high levels of education and skills.
Computer literacy is very high, and in general Icelanders are comfortable with technology.
A typical minimum wage for a white-collar worker is $40,400 (2001) and $14,200 (2001) for a blue-collar worker, based on a 37-hour workweek.
The workforce is heavily unionized, although salaries are negotiated on an individual "market wage" basis under many union contracts.
Strikes have been infrequent in recent years, as unions and management have cooperated with government efforts to contain inflation.
In response to recent strikes by seamen and air traffic controllers, the government pushed legislation through parliament to force the strikers back to work while the parties negotiated a settlement.
U.S. Embassy ReykjavÃ­k: The Embassy's Economic/Commercial Section represents U.S. business interests for the Departments of State, Commerce, Agriculture, and other branches of the federal government.
Section staff can assist American and Icelandic businesses with information or contacts, and carry out Department of Commerce export assistance programs such as Gold Key and ADS.
For further information, see the Economic/Commercial homepage on the Embassy ReykjavÃ­k website (www.usa.is).
CHAPTER 3: POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Iceland and the U.S. enjoy a strong, friendly relationship as NATO allies and trading partners.
The major political issue affecting the business climate is whether Iceland should join the European Union (EU).
Iceland is a stable democracy, with a well-educated population and an ancient culture that remains very much a part of Icelanders' daily lives, giving Icelandic society a high degree of social cohesion.
Iceland gained full independence from Denmark in 1944 and is a constitutional republic.
The parliament (Althingi), founded in the year 930, holds legislative power.
Its 63 members are elected every four years through a system of proportional representation.
The Government is led by a Prime Minister selected on the basis of the party composition of Parliament and formally named by the President.
The present government is a coalition between the center-right Independence Party (26 seats in the Althing) and the center-left Progressive Party (12 seats), which has a strong following in rural areas.
Prime Minister DaviÃ° Oddsson has held office since 1991.
The opposition parties are the Left Alliance (17 seats), the Left Green Party (6 seats), and the small right-of-center Liberal Party (2 seats).
The next national elections are scheduled for spring 2003.
The office of the President is largely ceremonial with limited powers.
The current President, Ã“lafur Ragnar GrÃ­msson, was elected in 1996, and was unopposed for re-election to a second term in 2000.
Iceland has an independent judiciary composed of District Courts and a Supreme Court.
CHAPTER IV.
MARKETING U.S. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES There are many U.S. products on the Icelandic market, and Icelanders are very familiar with leading U.S. brand names.
Numerous U.S. franchise businesses operate, particularly in the fast food/restaurant sector.
Popular U.S. television programs are broadcast in Iceland, and first-run U.S. films play in Icelandic cinemas (in English with Icelandic subtitles).
Many Icelanders have worked, studied, or traveled in the U.S., and have a first-hand acquaintance with American tastes and life-styles.
Although Icelandic culture is unique, the consumption habits of Icelanders resemble those of Americans in many ways.
The strident public opposition to genetically-modified foodstuffs common in many European countries has not spread to Iceland so far.
Importing and distribution of consumer and industrial goods in Iceland is generally handled by Icelandic wholesalers, or by Icelandic companies acting as agents.
Because of Icelands small size, there is no significant expatriate business community.
Most U.S. firms are represented in Iceland by Icelandic agents or by regional sales offices elsewhere in Scandinavia.
There is an American/Icelandic Chamber of Commerce, but it has a small budget and works mainly with Icelandic exporters of fish and seafood.
Some Icelandic importers and retailers have buyers in the U.S. who search out new products and best prices and buy directly on behalf of their principals.
Even small retailers here often contact manufacturers and distributors in the U.S. directly.
For U.S. business representatives visiting Iceland, a direct approach to importers and wholesalers is usually the best way to introduce a new consumer product to the Icelandic market.
The Embassy Economic/Commercial Section can provide lists of importers and sellers of particular products.
The Embassy recommends seeking the advice of local consultants or attorneys to assist in establishing any permanent business presence or relationship in Iceland.
Several large international consulting firms operate in ReykjavÃ­k, and they, along with local firms and business attorneys can conduct market studies, prepare documents, perform due diligence, and give advice on laws and regulations.
Icelandic trade associations can also be useful sources of information (see Chapter 11 for contact information).
The Embassy Economic/Commercial section can assist in making contact with these firms and organizations.
Retail prices in Iceland can be high, reflecting the cost of shipping to an isolated location, the need to import most industrial inputs, tariffs and regulatory costs for certain items, and a stiff 24.5% Value Added Tax (VAT) on most products.
There are no large retailers/discounters in the country and only two shopping malls.
There is typically only one importer or agent for a particular brand or product.
Most communities outside the ReykjavÃ­k area are extremely small, and not worth considering as separate marketing areas.
Advertising: All major types of advertising media are available in Iceland.
There are two commercial television channels (Channel 2 and Syn) and numerous private radio stations in addition to the Government-owned State Radio/TV, which also accepts advertising.
A 30 second ad during TV prime time costs approximately $1250.
Prime time on the radio can be purchased for about $7.50/10 seconds.
CNN, NBC Europe, Sky News and other international channels are available via a widely-subscribed cable system.
For a list of advertising agencies contact: SÃ�A (Icelandic Advertising Association) HÃ¡teigsvegi 3 IS-105 ReykjavÃ­k Tel: (354) 562-9588 Fax: (354) 562-9585 Newspaper readership in Iceland is very high.
There are two principal daily newspapers, Morgunbladid (mornings except Monday) and DV (weekday afternoons).
Morgunbladid is the newspaper of record and has a circulation of about 54,687.
DV has a more tabloid style, with a circulation up to 46,000.
These papers are read throughout the country.
The business journal, Vidskiptabladid, comes out weekly.
It is aimed at upscale readers in the commercial, financial, and government sectors.
Its content and format is generally similar to the Financial Times of London.
A new paper, Frettabladid, is distributed free to most homes and businesses in Reykjavik, and on this basis claims to have the highest readership of all.

Inquiries may also be directed to: The Icelandic Bar Association (LÃ¶gmannafÃ©lag Ã�slands) Ã�lftamÃ½ri 9 IS-108 ReykjavÃ­k Tel: 354-568-5620 Fax: 354-568-7057 Web site: www.Imfi.is e-mail: Imfi@Imfi.is Government procurement: Iceland is a member of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).
On the national level, most procurement is the responsibility of the State Trading Center (Rikiskaup), an agency of the Icelandic Government.
As an EEA member, Iceland is obligated to follow EU procurement practices, which require that any public procurement in excess of ISK 11 million ($143,500) must be tendered for competitive bidding through EU procedures.
Accordingly, Icelandic tenders are initially posted on the EU web site (www2.echo.lu/echo/databases/ted/en/tedhome.html).
This is the best source of information since it is in English.
Additional material can be obtained from the State Trading Center, however it is not always available in English.
Tenders are sometimes published in MorgunblaÃ°iÃ°, the countrys largest newspaper.
The chief difficulty with the public tender process is that the bid deadline is often very short, which gives prospective U.S. bidders little time to respond, particularly if tender documents need to be translated from Icelandic.
Procurement for the U.S./NATO military base at KeflavÃ­k is subject to special procedures, including pre-qualification of bidders, although the U.S. and Icelandic governments have agreed to open more of the base contracting to competitive bidding.
Further information can be obtained from the State Trading Center (see Chapter 11 for contact information).
CHAPTER 5: LEADING SECTORS FOR U.S. EXPORTS AND INVESTMENT Electric generation/transmission equipment: At least two large hydroelectric plants are likely to be constructed within the next 2-3 years.
U.S. suppliers should be competitive for the turbines and other equipment needed for these facilities.
Packaged and processed food: Despite the difficulties of coping with European regulations, demand for American foodstuffs should remain strong.
While some products are losing ground because they can no longer be competitively priced due to the cost of complying with the new regulations, importers continue to search for new U.S. brands to introduce.
Icelandic consumers say they can tell the difference between a U.S.-made product such as ketchup or breakfast cereal and European-made versions of the same product, and they almost always prefer the U.S. version.
U.S. producers can help by being willing to work with Icelandic importers on packaging and labeling issues.
Computer equipment and software: Iceland is probably one of the most computer-savvy countries in the world, and demand for new off-the-shelf software should reflect this.
The growing number of biomedical research companies in the country offers a potential new market for high-capacity, high-speed data storage and processing equipment.
Consumer goods/entertainment: American consumer products are popular in Iceland.
There are numerous examples of U.S. products that have a higher market penetration per capita in Iceland than anywhere else in Europe.
The percentage of dual-income households in Iceland is high, and there is great demand for labor saving devices and the latest gadgets.
This market should continue to be attractive on both a category and niche basis.
Likewise, the market for U.S. entertainment products should remain bright, and exposure to American entertainment products should have a synergistic effect on sales of other U.S. goods and services.
Franchising: U.S. fast food franchises have long been popular in Iceland, where a high percentage of household income is spent on convenience foods.
In one case, a new American pizza franchise set a corporate world sales record in its first week of operation.
Icelandic familiarity with American brands, and the success of fast food and restaurant franchises suggests that opportunities exist for franchises in other areas.
An office supply franchise that opened in 2001 was the first significant non-food U.S. franchise.
Its success introduced a new level of competition that lowered the price of office supplies across the market.
Icelandic franchise holders recently formed a trade association to promote the growth of franchising in the country.
Wine and beer: Icelanders drinking preferences have changed from hard liquor to wine and beer in recent years, and economic prosperity has brought an increased interest in fine wines.
American wines have claimed a significant piece of this growing market, and their popularity continues to increase.
The Icelandic importer of one upscale American brand said he distributes as much wine in Iceland as does his counterpart in Oslo, even though Norway has almost 20 times as many people.
The old-fashioned regulations of Icelands government alcohol monopoly retard competition and complicate the introduction of new labels, but these rules are slowly being liberalized, which should create more opportunities for these products.
High-tech fishing equipment: Iceland is a world leader in modern fishing methods and processing equipment, but Icelandic fishermen want the best available equipment no matter where it is manufactured.
There should be a market for specialized and advanced U.S. equipment, especially where U.S. producers can use advantages gained from economies of scale to offer competitive prices.
Investment prospects: Icelands inexpensive energy sources make it an attractive location for energy-intensive industrial activities.
The national government and local economic development authorities have been willing to negotiate low-cost contracts for the supply of electricity as an incentive to investors to locate these types of activities in Iceland.
These deals offered power at rates as low as $.05/kwh, substantially less than market rates in the U.S.
Recent U.S. investments and investment proposals for energy-intensive activities include aluminum smelters, steel pipe fabricating, data storage facilities/server farms, and petrochemical processing.
The government expects to complete privatization of two commercial banks and the national telephone company over the next 2-3 years, with privatization of the national electric utility contemplated in the medium-term future.
The government has also begun discussing opening the fishing industry to limited foreign investment.
Biomedical and genetic research companies offer somewhat riskier investment opportunities, and a young stock market lists a variety of Iceland's largest and most successful firms.
CHAPTER 6: TRADE REGULATIONS, CUSTOMS AND STANDARDS Iceland uses the harmonized system (HS) for commodity classification and the ISO 9000 standards for quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC).
Since joining the European Economic Area in 1994, Iceland has been forced to adopt European product standards and regulations in many areas.
Implementation of these new standards, and the accompanying requirement for use of the CE mark, has created problems for importers of some U.S.-manufactured goods.
It is still possible to import U.S.-standard products of many kinds into Iceland, and Icelandic regulators are willing to be flexible where possible, but the Embassy anticipates that these kinds of regulatory barriers will continue to increase as Icelandic regulations become more 'European'.
Information about the CE mark is available from U.S. Department of Commerce Export Assistance Centers in the U.S. Agricultural commodities: Iceland is highly protectionist concerning agricultural products.
Tariffs on certain varieties of vegetables are significantly higher during the growing season to protect domestic greenhouse producers.
Meat and dairy products, and potatos are also protected by substantial duties.
Imported meat must be hormone-free.
Import of uncooked meat is generally banned.
There are currently no restrictions on import of genetically modified substances, but this could change if Iceland is required to adopt EU regulations.
Animal feed can carry tariffs up to55%, and there are limits on ingredients and additives.
Iceland maintains strict phyto-sanitary regulations, since many animal diseases common elsewhere are not present in the country.
Iceland is free of hoof-and-mouth disease and BSE. Customs: U.S. exporters may request an advance ruling on customs classification from the Directorate of Customs (Tollur) (see Chapter 11 for address).
The application should describe the product in full detail.
Samples, catalogs, photographs, or other descriptive literature should be submitted whenever possible.
The manufacturer, the exporter, or the representative in Iceland should sign the application.
While the customs authorities will not in all cases give a binding decision, the preliminary ruling will usually be considered binding if the goods are found to correspond to the sample or the description.
Importers can access the Icelandic Customs Tariff Manual in English on the Customs website (www.tollur.is).
Electrical/electronic equipment: Electrical equipment sold and used by the public (consumer electronics and household electrical appliances) must carry the CE mark.
Electric current in Iceland is 50 cycle, 220-volt AC. Questions can be forwarded to The State Agency for Electrical and Metrology Accreditation (Loggildingarstofa) (see Chapter 11 for address).
Food products: Icelandic regulations on ingredients, additives and labeling generally follow EU directives.
Product labels may be in English.
Importers of U.S. foodstuffs have complained to the Government about the implementation of EU-based labeling regulations, and the Embassy is engaged in discussions with Icelandic regulators in an effort to obtain a more flexible interpretation of the rules.
For now, many U.S. labeled products still appear on store shelves, although some products require additional labeling by importers, which increases the shelf price of the products.
Iceland maintains tariffs on certain categories of food products from the U.S. that are not applied to similar products from the EU.
The Embassy has requested relief from these discriminatory tariffs; discussions with the Government are ongoing.
International Trading Companies: There are no free-trade zones in Iceland, however Icelandic law allows the operation of 'International Trading Companies' (ITC).
The Government offers ITCs 5% income tax and an exemption from net worth tax and stamp duty.
An ITC can operate as a trading or a holding company and can own shares, patents, copyrights, ships and aircraft, and act as an intermediary in service and trade activities.
A Certification Committee mandated by the Minister of Industry and Commerce grants operating licenses.
Further information can be obtained at www.itc.is and the government web site: http://government.is/interpro/ivr/ivreng.nsf/pages/neg-itc Toxic substances: Suppliers of chemical substances and products must provide a composition declaration.
The Icelandic importer, in cooperation with the foreign manufacturer, is responsible for labeling the product.
Labeling requirements generally follow EU regulations.
Questions regarding importing, packaging and labeling of toxic substances or chemicals may be directed to the Environmental and Food Agency of Iceland (see Chapter 11 for address).
Trademarks/patents: Icelandic intellectual property laws are TRIPS-compliant.
All applications for trademark/patent/intellectual property protection in the Icelandic market must be registered with the Icelandic Patent Office (Einkaleyfastofan) (see Chapter 11 for address).
Product Samples: Samples may be imported into Iceland duty-free if they are of little or no commercial value, or have been made unfit for use.
Otherwise samples will be subject to duty.
Samples carried by a commercial traveler, as well as pattern books or cards, must be declared upon arrival in the country.
Samples may be imported temporarily by using the ATA carnet, a simplified customs document by which commercial samples or professional equipment may be sent or taken into Iceland and any of the other 43 foreign countries participating in the arrangement.
Information on the ATA Carnet can be obtained from: U.S. Council for Intl.
Business 1212 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036 Tel: (212) 354-4480 Fax: (212) 575-0327 Website: www.atacarnet.com Tariffs: Other than agricultural commodities and food products, Iceland maintains tariffs on some categories of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, and furniture.
Most industrial goods are not subject to tariffs.
Automobiles are subject to taxes based on engine size and type.
There are no special taxes applicable to trade in services.
CHAPTER 7: INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT The Icelandic government encourages foreign investment, particularly in energy-intensive industries that can take advantage of the country's abundant renewable energy resources.
The government would also like to attract outside investment in connection with privatization of the financial and telecommunications sectors.
Icelandic laws regulating and protecting foreign investments are consistent with OECD and European Union (EU) standards.
The major law governing foreign investment is the 1996 Act on Investment by Non-residents in Business Enterprises, which grants national treatment to non-residents of the European Economic Area (including U.S. citizens), with exceptions that limit investments in fishing, energy production and airlines.
Waivers are not available to these restrictions, although the government is considering opening the energy sector and some aspects of the fishing industry to foreign investment in the medium term.
Icelandic law also restricts the ability of non-EEA citizens to own land, but this may be waived by the Ministry of Justice.
Icelandic courts uphold the sanctity of contracts as a matter of course.
There is no automatic screening of investors, although bidders in privatization sales may have to go through a pre-qualification process.
The government usually sets aside a portion of shares in privatization sales for small investors, which tends to favor Icelandic citizens over foreigners.
Potential U.S. bidders in privatization auctions need to follow the process closely, since the procedures are often ad hoc and deadlines can be short.
The U.S. does not have a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Iceland, however the two governments recently held discussions on the possibility of negotiating such an agreement.
A bilateral tax treaty is in force; talks were held in 2001 on updating some of its provisions.
Conversion and transfer policies: Iceland imposes no foreign exchange controls.
Icelandic law provides for full convertibility and transferability of dividends, profits, interest on loans, debentures, mortgages, lease payments and invested capital.
Payment from Iceland to a foreign entity can normally be made without formalities or delay through commercial banks.
Expropriation and compensation: As far as the embassy is aware, the Icelandic government has never expropriated a foreign investment.
No major investment disputes have occurred in recent memory.
Dispute settlement: Iceland has ratified the major international conventions governing arbitration and the settlement of investment disputes.
Iceland accepts binding arbitration of investment disputes.
Performance Requirements: None.
Right to private ownership and establishment: Other than fishing, energy, and airlines, foreign entities are free to establish and own any type of business enterprise and engage in all forms of legal remunerative activity.
Icelandic law treats private and public enterprises with equality when it comes to market access and other business operations.
Foreign investors are permitted to participate in privatization of government-owned businesses, subject to restrictions imposed by the government.
Protection of property rights: Iceland adheres to key international agreements on property rights (e.g., Paris Union Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property).
Trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and industrial designs are all protected under Icelandic law.
As with many other issues, Iceland is following the European lead in protection of property right and will probably adhere to the European Patent Convention since 1973 soon.
Transparency of the regulatory system: Icelandic laws regulating business practices are consistent with those of most OECD member states, and are increasingly based on European Union directives as a result of Iceland's EEA membership.
Much of Iceland's financial regulatory system was put in place only in the 1990s, thus it is not yet clear where the boundaries of regulatory authority lie in some areas.
Transparency is occasionally a concern in public procurement, and in privatization sales where the process is established by the government on an ad hoc basis.
Capital market and portfolio investing: Iceland has a modern financial sector that provides a full range of services.
There are no significant impediments to the market-determined flow of financial resources.
The private sector has access to a wide variety of credit instruments, and there are numerous venture capital funds.
The Iceland Stock Exchange can facilitate portfolio investment and securities transactions.
Political stability: Iceland is a politically stable democracy, and politically motivated violence is not a threat to foreign holdings.
Isolated cases of corruption occur but are not an obstacle to foreign investment.
A 2001 survey by Transparency International ranked Iceland as the fourth least corrupt country (the U.S. was 16th) out of 91 surveyed.
Free trade agreements: Iceland has free trade agreements with Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Turkey.
These agreements contain provisions for repatriation of capital, dispute settlement, and standards for expropriation and nationalization by the host country.
OPIC and other investment insurance programs: Iceland is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
OPIC is not involved in projects in Iceland.
Labor: The Icelandic workforce is highly skilled but low unemployment has led to shortages of labor.
Increasing immigration has helped fill low-wage service and industrial jobs.
The labor force totaled about 160,000 at the end of 2001, with an unemployment rate of 2.4 percent.
The government has imposed mandatory mediation when strikes have threatened key sectors in the economy such as the fishing industry.
Foreign trade zones: International trading companies (ITCs) may be established in Iceland to conduct business outside Iceland.
An ITC pays a 5% corporate tax and is suitable for any company engaged in trade between two countries not involving Iceland.
Foreign investment statistics: The following tables reflect data available as of June 2002.
Figures on investment position refer to book-value.
These figures are limited to companies in which a single foreign investor holds 10 percent or more of the equity capital and do not include foreign ownership interests via third party investment.
Investment flow statistics are based on market value.

Major U.S. investors in Iceland include: Columbia Ventures (aluminum and telecommunications), Western Wireless (telecommunications), DeCode Genetics (biotech), Kodak, McCann/Ericson and others.
Many U.S. companies are represented through Icelandic agents.
Information in this chapter was primarily obtained from the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Trade, Labor, and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Icelandic Bureau of Statistics and the Central Bank of Iceland.
CHAPTER 8: TRADE AND PROJECT FINANCING Trade in Iceland is financed by the country's commercial banks.
Financing and credit guarantees are generally available; there are no foreign exchange controls or restrictions on movement of capital.
Iceland is eligible for xxxxx (OPIC, EXIM)???.
Under its recent International Trading Company law, the Icelandic Government offers 5% income tax and an exemption from net worth tax and stamp duty.
An ITC can operate as a trading or a holding company and can own shares, patents, copyrights, ships and aircraft, and act as an intermediary in service and trade activities.
Further information can be obtained at www.itc.is.
No U.S. banks maintain offices in Iceland, however Icelandic banks all have correspondent relationships with counterparts in the U.S. See Chapter 11 for contact information for Icelandic banks.
CHAPTER 9: BUSINESS TRAVEL U.S. citizens do not need a visa to travel to Iceland for normal business or tourist purposes.
Icelandair (www.icelandair.com) is the only scheduled airline with service to Iceland from the U.S., flying from Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Minneapolis.
Travel information is available from the Department of State web site (http://travel.state.gov).
There are no restrictions on entry or exit of personal computers or laptops, software, or encrypted data.
Commercial samples and exhibit items may be subject to customs duty.
See Chapter 6, above.
Travelers can take the airport bus from Keflavik Airport (the Fly Bus) and advise the driver of a hotel destination.
One-way bus tickets cost about $11.
Private taxis are also available at the airport, but are significantly more expensive (about $75, no tipping).
Reykjavik has an excellent public transportation system, with buses running to all areas of the city.
Local cabs are readily available at taxi stands throughout the downtown area or by telephone.
Prices depend on the length of journey and the time of day.
A five-minute ride at mid-day should cost about $10.
Rental cars are available at the airport and in town, but are very expensive compared to U.S. prices.
The Icelandic currency is the krona (plural = kronur) (IKR).
The exchange rate on 31 July 2002 was about IKR 85/$1.00.
Cash machines are available, but as in the U.S., not all ATM cards are accepted.
Credit/debit card usage is very common in Iceland, but most businesses (including hotels and restaurants) only accept MasterCard or Visa.
Tipping is not the custom in Iceland, and tips are neither required nor expected.
Any service charges will be included in the bill.
There is no language barrier for U.S. visitors to Iceland.
Icelandic business executives and government officials are uniformly fluent in English and almost all Icelanders speak English to some degree.
Reykjavik offers a variety of hotel and guesthouse accommodations, many excellent restaurants, cafes, and wide range of cultural attractions.
Note that hotel rooms can be difficult to find during the summer tourist season, and that it can be difficult to get a table at the more popular restaurants without an advance booking.
See http://www.tourist.reykjavik.is - www.icetourist.is - www.icelandnaturally.com and www.icelandair.com for more information.
Iceland remains a relatively safe country for visitors.
Reykjavik is safer than major cities in the U.S., although there is occasional street crime, particularly late at night in the city center.
Visitors utilizing common sense and good judgment can expect to enjoy their time in Iceland without incident.
Emergency services including fire, police and ambulance are available by dialing 112.
Emergency service operators speak English.
Icelandic work schedules are similar to those in the U.S., although many offices close early in the summer.
Business activity slows down considerably from mid-June through mid-August as Icelanders take their summer holidays.
Other slow times of year are the Christmas season and the weeks before and after Easter in the spring.
Social and business etiquette in Iceland is similar to that in other western European countries.
Since Iceland is a small community, access to key people is easier and often informal, although it is advisable to schedule appointments in advance.
Business meetings are not formal but good preparation is important.
Since even the largest Icelandic corporations are relatively small, you may find the decision-makers in your meeting.
Business cards are exchanged upon introduction.
Extended pleasantries are not necessary, and getting straight down to business is appreciated.
Simultaneous translation and interpretation services are available, but are usually not required unless very detailed or technical work is involved.
Most Icelanders doing business in a particular field will understand the relevant English technical documentation, but this may have to be translated if included in a contract.
Icelanders like to combine business with pleasure, so establishing a friendly and personal relationship is a good way to do business.
Business dinners are the preferred form of entertainment.
It is considered appropriate to talk business over a meal, unless spouses are present.
Icelanders enjoy dressing up and being social.
There are no strict rules or formal dining customs that need to be observed, although eating European-style is always considered good form.
While Americans dress up for work and dress down after work the opposite is often the case in Iceland, although men in government, banking or business circles generally wear suits.
An informal social event such as a business dinner still calls for a jacket and tie.
Iceland has cool summers, and mild winters.
Even in summer, clothing should include a sweater or jacket, a raincoat, and a good pair of walking shoes.
Understanding Icelandic names is important for business and social occasions.
Only a small proportion of the population has family surnames, usually derived from foreign names.
Most people have a patronymic, formed from their fathers first name with the ending "son" or "dÃ³ttir" (e.g. Hannes OttÃ³sson (Hannes, OttÃ³'s son) or Borghildur MagnÃºsdÃ³ttir (Borghildur, MagnÃºs's daughter).
A woman does not take her husbands name on marriage.
First names are the names by which people are known, and are thus generally used.
(One exception would be a government Minister who would be "Mr. Minister" or "Madam Minister.")
Icelandic telephone directories list people in alphabetical order by their first name.
Icelanders do not use "Mr." and "Ms." among themselves, although they may do so when among foreigners.
Icelanders will not feel you are being overly familiar if you call them by their first names.
