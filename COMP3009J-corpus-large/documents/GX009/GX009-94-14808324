Period at the Staffordshire University, Stafford, England
The courses taken at this institution, in the Masters Program in Industrial Engineering, were in the areas of communication protocols, simulation of manufacturing systems (using the software SIMAN), digital control, numerical control, robotics, etc.
My research project consisted of building the control system for a Flexible Manufacturing Cell which contained numerically controlled machines, as well as robotic arms used to grab parts from an electrical conveyor.
The control system was programmed in C and loaded on a IBM PC which communicated with all the cell's components as well as a couple of Programmed Logic Controllers.
Research was sponsored by the European Union exchange program ERASMUS.
