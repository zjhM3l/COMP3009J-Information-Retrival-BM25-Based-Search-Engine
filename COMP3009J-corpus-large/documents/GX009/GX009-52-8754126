Portraits of the Presidents and First Ladies,1789-Present
While attending a recent Lincoln celebration I asked myself if Lincoln would have been as serviceable to the people of this country had he been a college man, and I was obliged to say to myself that he would not.
The process to which the college man is subjected does not render him serviceable to the country as a whole.
It is for this reason that I have dedicated every power in me to a democratic regeneration.
The American college must become saturated in the same sympathies as the common people.
The colleges of this country must be reconstructed from the top to the bottom.
The American people will tolerate nothing that savors of exclusiveness.
Woodrow Wilson, president of Princeton University; "Address to Alumni," April 16, 1910
On June 9, 1902, Woodrow Wilson was unanimously elected president of Princeton University.
In this position, Wilson exhibited both the idealistic integrity and the occasional lack of political acumen that marked his tenure as 28th president of the United States.
After graduating from Princeton in 1879, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia for one year.
After completing and publishing his dissertation, Congressional Government, in 1886, he received his Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University.
Wilson remains the only American president to have earned a doctoral degree.

Taking the Long View, 1851-1991
Wilson served on the faculties of Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan University before joining the Princeton faculty as professor of jurisprudence and political economy in 1890.
A popular teacher and respected scholar, Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton's sesquicentennial celebration (1896) entitled "Princeton in the Nation's Service."
In this famous speech, he outlined his vision of the university in a democratic nation, calling on institutions of higher learning "to illuminate duty by every lesson that can be drawn out of the past."
In his inaugural address as Princeton's president, Wilson developed these themes, attempting to strike a balance that would please both populists and aristocrats in the audience.

Taking the Long View,1851-1991
As president, Wilson began a fund-raising campaign to bolster the university corporation.
The curriculum guidelines he developed during his tenure as president of Princeton proved among the most important innovations in the field of higher education.
He instituted the now common system of core requirements followed by two years of concentration in a selected area.
When he attempted to curtail the influence of the elitist "social clubs," however, Wilson met with resistance from trustees and potential donors.
He believed the system was smothering the intellectual and moral life of the undergraduates.
Opposition from wealthy and powerful alumni further convinced Wilson of the undesirability of exclusiveness and moved him towards a more populist position in his politics.

Through his published commentary on contemporary political matters, Wilson developed a national reputation and, with increasing seriousness, considered a public service career.
In 1910, he received an unsolicited nomination for the governorship of New Jersey, which he eagerly accepted.
As governor, he developed a platform of progressive liberalism in matters of domestic political economy.
In 1912, the Democratic Party nominated him as their presidential candidate.
During Wilson's presidency (1913-1921), first the civil war in Mexico and then World War I, drew his attention away from domestic issues.
His health suffered during his campaign to promote the Fourteen Points--an outline for peace that proposed an international League of Nations.
While this international organization of nations never matched Wilson's vision, his leadership permanently changed the face of international diplomacy.
In December 1920, he was awarded the 1919 Nobel Prize for Peace.
His years of public service are honored through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.
The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. is a living memorial to this scholarly president.

Jacques Cartier Sails Upriver
Grand Hermine.
Grand Hermine, with Cameos of Jacques Cartier 
Prints and Photographs Division
French navigator Jacques Cartier sailed into the St. Lawrence River for the first time on June 9, 1534.
Commissioned by King Francis I of France to explore the northern lands in search of gold, spices, and a northern passage to Asia, Cartier's voyages underlay France's claims to Canada.
Born in 1491 in the coastal village of Saint-Malo, France, Jacques Cartier was an experienced pilot familiar with the routes Breton fishermen followed to the New World.
In command of the King's 1534 expedition, Cartier set sail from France on April 20, 1534 with two ships and 61 men.
After overhauling his ships and taking on a cargo of the meat of the now-extinct great auk at the Isle of Birds, Cartier ventured north through the Belle Isle Straits and across the Bay of St. Lawrence to Prince Edward Island.
Here, the Europeans made initial contacts with the Native Americans of that region, members of the Iroquois nation.
With Native American guides he may have kidnapped, Cartier headed northwest to Anticosti Island.
After several days sailing in that area, the captain believed he had discovered a new seaway to Asia's riches.
However, Cartier returned to France without confirming that fact.
In 1536, Cartier returned to the site of his discovery with additional ships and men and made his way upriver to an Indian village at present-day Quebec.
In September, after a brief foray to the area around what is now Montreal, Cartier's expedition arrived at the La Chine Rapids.
When his Indian guides informed him of three additional stretches of rapids beyond La Chine, Cartier abandoned the push forward.
He returned to his base camp.
Wintering there, Cartier was unprepared for the severe weather.
After losing many men to malnutrition, he abducted several Iroquois chiefs and fled to France.

Touring Turn-of-the-Century America, 1880-1920
Cartier made his third and final voyage to the new world on a 1541 expedition led by Jean-FranÃ§ois de La Rocque de Roberval.
Roberval's mandate was to establish a colony with convict settlers.
Commanding his own ship, Cartier arrived in the Quebec region first.
Poor relations with Native American tribes jeopardized attempts at settlement and, again, Cartier returned to France without venturing beyond the rapids, this time flouting Roberval's orders to return to Quebec.
He never ventured to Canada again, but Cartier's detailed observations recorded in notes and maps aided subsequent French explorers and settlers who ventured to "New France."
The French abandoned efforts to find riches and a waterway to Asia via Canada until 1603.
That year Samuel de Champlain landed at Tadoussac on the Saguenay River.
On July 3, 1608, Champlain established the first European settlement in Canada, at Quebec.

The map, Early Image of the Americas, was produced in Rome in 1507.
The American continent is visible on the left, but its coastline is only vaguely recognizable.
In Mapping the New Discoveries (1562), by Spanish cartographer Diego GutiÃ©rrez, the shape of the newly discovered continent appears in greater and more accurate detail.
