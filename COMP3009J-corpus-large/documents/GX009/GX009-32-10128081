Invasive species can successfully invade any terrestrial or aquatic ecosystem, and may enter through a wide variety of introduction mechanisms.
Human activities, both intentional and non-intentional, are the chief cause of invasive species introductions.

B * The Beach and Your Coastal Watershed * Biological Criteria for Coral Reefs This paper provides the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with advice on the feasibility of establishing biological criteria for assessing coral reef ecosystems.
C * Caulerpa * Coastal America * Coastal Habitats The continued health and biodiversity of marine and estuarine systems depends on the maintenance of high-quality habitat.
The same areas that often attract human development also provide essential food, cover, migratory corridors, breeding/nursery areas for a broad array of coastal and marine organisms.
Habitat loss and degradation are key issues facing coasts and estuaries around the country.

And established the Coral Reef Task force.
The Executive Order directs all federal agencies to protect coral reef ecosystems to the extent feasible, and instructs particular agencies to develop coordinated, science-based plans to restore damaged reefs as well as mitigate current and future impacts on reefs, both in the United States and around the globe.

N * National Coastal Condition Report Monitoring Assessment of Coastal Waters This report describes the overall condition of the U.S. coastal waters as fair to poor, varying from region to region.
The Report, primarily evaluates estuaries areas where rivers meet the ocean in the continental United States.
Indicators of coastal conditions were derived from data on water quality, sediment quality, biota, habitat, and ecosystem integrity, as they relate to ecological and human health.
