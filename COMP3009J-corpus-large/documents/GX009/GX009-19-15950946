There are currently seven qualified political parties in California.
In addition to the Democratic and Republican parties, which have participated in state primary elections since 1910, six other parties have qualified since 1967.
In 1968, both the American Independent Party and the Peace and Freedom Party qualified by the voter registration method.
The Libertarian Party achieved the requisite number of registrants in 1980; the Green Party reached the required number in 1992; and the two most recent parties to achieve recognized political status in California were the Natural Law and the Reform parties, garnering the requisite number of registered voters in 1996.
At the time of this booklet's publication the Peace and Freedom Party had failed to meet the threshold needed to maintain its status as a qualified political party in California, based on the November 3, 1998 election results.
October 24, 1999, is the deadline for any party seeking to qualify or requalify to participate in the March 7, 2000 primary.
Since the statewide party nomination process began in 1910, eighteen parties have qualified to participate in primary elections, including:
* Democratic 1910-present * Republican 1910-present * Independence League 1910 * Prohibition 1910-1962 * Socialist 1910-1938 Progressive ("Bull Moose") 1912-1918 Liberty 1932-1934 Commonwealth 1934-1938 Communist 1934-March 1944 Progressive 1934-1938 Townsend 1938-1942 Independent Progressive 1948-1954 American Independent 1968-present Peace and Freedom 1968-1998 Libertarian 1980-present Green 1992 - present Natural Law 1996 - present Reform 1996 - present
Prior to 1910, many parties either conducted conventions or held primary elections to select their candidates for the statewide general election.
* The five parties whose names are preceded by an asterisk were active before 1910.
