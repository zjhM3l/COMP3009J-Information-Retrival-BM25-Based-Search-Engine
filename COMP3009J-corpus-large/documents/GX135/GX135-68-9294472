Congressman Jim Kolbe 5^TH DISTRICT ARIZONA PRESS RELEASE __________________________________________________________________ December 19, 2000 Heres a Switch: Medals Pinned on a Trophy Mogul (Tucson) -- Morton K. Tuller, 79, a Tucsonan and veteran of World War II, was awarded nine combat medals, some 55 years overdue, at ceremonies presided over by Rep. Jim Kolbe on Tuesday, Dec. 19.
Tuller was awarded a total of nine silver and bronze stars for service in the Asiatic Pacific; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign; and the Philippine Liberation movement.
The ceremony was held at Tuller Trophy Factory, 525 N. 6th Ave.
A native of Brooklyn, New York, Tuller served as a cryptographer and performed message deciphering and decoding duties.
He enlisted in the Army in August of 1942, entered active service in February of the following year and was discharged in January of 1946.
Despite enlisting in the Army, Tuller spent much of his time in the service aboard Navy ships.
Tuller grew up in Chicago.
When he was in high school, Tuller auditioned for a part in The Dead End Kids, and wound up in a touring company that criss-crossed the United States.
He is well-known throughout Southern Arizona for volunteer efforts on behalf of Tucson Medical Center and Saguaro National Park.
Tuller moved to Tucson in 1947 and, after a stint in the jewelry business in Tucson and Los Angeles, opened Tuller Trophy in 1955 on East Broadway near Scott Avenue, across from the Westerner Hotel.
(A picture taken in 1953 of Tuller and his wife, Sylvia, now deceased, appears on the mural on the Broadway underpass in downtown Tucson.)
The shop moved to N. 6th Avenue location in 1966.
A second location at 5631 E. 22nd Street opened in 1974.
Tuller continues to play an active role in the business, though day-to-day management is in the hands of his son, Howard.
Tuller said he had no particular interest in seeking medals he deserved until he joined a bagpipe band and was informed that he should wear war medals on his outfit.
Two years ago, he started querying the government record center in St. Louis, Mo.
When those requests went unanswered, he mentioned the matter to Rep. Kolbe at a Friends of Saguaro National Park gathering.
