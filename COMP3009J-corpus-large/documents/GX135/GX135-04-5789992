An apparatus for allowing voltage accurate mode-conversion of a model railroad decoder connected to a motor and to layout tracks, comprising:
a) said motor with two motor leads,
b) a mode switch arrangement with make-break electrical connections that selectively and individually connect each one of two track leads to just one of said two motor leads of said motor,
c) said model railroad decoder, further comprising:
(i) an input-rectifying bridge connected to said two track pickup leads and which rectifies track voltages,
(ii) a decoder controller logic means that executes control and detection algorithms based on voltage sample measurements and that can detect the motor connection configuration,
(iii) an H-bridge control circuit controlled by said decoder controller logic means, with two output leads individually connected to said two motor leads,
(iv) a track voltage sample connection to provide track voltage samples to said decoder controller logic means,
(v) a motor voltage sample link to provide motor voltage samples to said decoder controller logic means,
whereby said model railroad decoder detects the connection configuration of said mode switch arrangement and will not allow operation of said H-bridge control circuit if any of said two motor leads is connected directly to any of said two track leads, thus permitting safe and accurate voltage mode-conversion on conventional energy track power, and compatible operation coupled to other conventional locomotives.
