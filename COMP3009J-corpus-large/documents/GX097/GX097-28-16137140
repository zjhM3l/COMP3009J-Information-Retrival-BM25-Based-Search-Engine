TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ WILD SUNFLOWERS AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF DISEASE RESISTANCE FOR CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Diseases are a major limiting factor of sunflower production world-wide.
Cultivated sunflower is susceptible to many diseases caused mainly by fungi, and to a lesser extent by bacteria and viruses.
The susceptibility of cultivated sunflower may be due to the co-evolution of sunflower and the diseases.
While this may have been a disadvantage, it could also be an advantage.
Since they co-evoluted together, certain populations and species had to evolve resistance to survive.
These are the populations of the wild species which we are seeking.
The frequency of disease resistance genes from the wild species varies from frequent for rust, Verticillium wilt, and downy mildew to very limited for Sclerotinia wilt.
The diversity of wild species with disease resistance is also impressive because we can choose from five-to-ten different wild species as our resource for genes.
Several successful transfer of genes from the wild species into cultivated sunflower have been accomplished for rust downy mildew, Verticillium wilt, stem canker, powdery mildew, and charcoal rot.
Many other genes have been identified, but await our ability to transfer the genes from the wild to the cultivated sunflower.
With the advent of biotechnology we should be able to more efficiently move specific resistance genes stored in the wild species into cultivated sunflower.
This will make the wild species an even more valuable genetic resource.
