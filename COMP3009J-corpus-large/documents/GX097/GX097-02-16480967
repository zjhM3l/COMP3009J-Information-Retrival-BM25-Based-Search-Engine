TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ PROGRESS REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON THE EVALUATION OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES FOR THE PERIOD 1994 Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Wild sunflowers, which are the ancestors of the modern cultivated sunflower, are native to the U.S.
The ancestors of the sunflower number some 50 species.
This is a very diverse group with 36 perennial and 14 annual species.
Use of the wild species for the improvement of cultivated sunflower has been very successful in the past.
Due to the large number of species, a team approach to find valuable characteristics is needed.
International organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have been active in the characterization of wild sunflowers.
Participants of this group all share a common goal; that is to increase the genetic diversity of cultivated sunflower using wild species to make it a better global crop.
The group has made significant progress in expanding our knowledge of wild species, but the job is a long way from completion.
It is through international cooperative efforts that we will be able to more rapidly improve the cultivated sunflower crop.
