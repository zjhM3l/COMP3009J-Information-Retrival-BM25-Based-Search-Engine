Testimony of Dr. David W. Simpson
representing the
Seismological Society of America
and the
Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology
before the
Basic Science Research Subcommittee
Committee on Science
House of Representatives
United States Congress
Washington DC
April 24, 1997
Thank you Chairman Schiff for the opportunity to appear
before the Subcommittee's Hearing on the reauthorization of the
National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.
I am here as a
25-year member of the Seismological Society of America and as
President of the IRIS Consortium.
These organizations and their
members have a rich history of working together to promote
advances in seismology and earthquake engineering, and it is with
great pleasure that I am representing them today.
"LESSONS LEARNED" OR "WARNINGS GIVEN"?
In these Hearings on the reauthorization of NEHRP, there
are likely to be frequent references to "the lessons learned" from the
Loma Prieta, Northridge and Kobe earthquakes.
It may be more
appropriate to consider the experience of these recent earthquakes as
"warnings given" rather than "lessons learned" - a reminder that no
modern US city has yet experienced a major earthquake.
We must
resist developing a sense of false security or complacency from the
relatively low loss of life and property that occurred during the
recent moderate-sized earthquakes in California.
Loma Prieta and Northridge were not large earthquakes.
In
addition, both of these shocks occurred in relatively benign locations
outside the highly developed urban centers of San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
The loss of life and property, and the disruption to
our nation, were significant, but as scientists, we recognize them as
merely harbingers of what can follow a truly major earthquake in
either of these cities.
The impact of these relatively moderate events
should serve as a reminder to government agencies and the public of
the compelling need for at-risk urban areas to prepare for and
respond to earthquakes.
One frightening scenario for San Francisco is that
earthquakes the size of Loma Prieta or larger will occur with
increasing frequency in the Bay area in future decades, but these
earthquakes will merely be precursors to the next great earthquake
on the northern San Andreas.
While each of these moderate-sized
earthquakes is likely to be more destructive than Loma Prieta, all of
them will pale in comparison with the impact of the inevitable,
major, through-going rupture of the northern segment of the San
Andreas.
Imagine ten or more Loma Prieta or Northridge shocks
placed end to end.
Damage and loss similar to that observed in
Northridge will occur along and adjacent to the entire area.
Instead
of damage occurring in isolated portions of the city - allowing the
emergency response resources of the relatively unaffected parts of
the city to converge on the damaged areas - the widespread damage
will result in all of these resources being overwhelmed with local
problems.
Lest this description sound too alarmist or sensational, let me
point out that this sequence of events - increasing frequency of
moderate events in the Bay area prior to a large earthquake - is
exactly what happened in San Francisco during the 1880s leading up
to the great 1906 earthquake.
While we tend to focus on California,
the record of the last century gives warning that major cities in the
eastern US - St. Louis, Memphis, Charleston, Boston and New
York among others - have also experienced major earthquakes; and
recent research in the Pacific northwest warns that the entire coastal
region of Washington and northern Oregon has also been the site of
great earthquakes.
NEHRP AND PROGRESS IN HAZARDS MITIGATION
Variability in the causes of earthquakes, the motions they
produce, the response of engineered structures to these motions, and
the reactions of society to both earthquakes and the threat of
earthquakes, makes the assessment of earthquake hazards and the
mitigation of earthquake risk a challenging endeavor.
Strategies to
reduce earthquake risk, however, demand that these elements be
combined into a closely integrated program.
The National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program has forged sometimes
unnatural alliances between scientists, engineers, civic planning
officials and those responsible for disaster planning and response.
NEHRP provides the basis and direction for mitigation efforts
throughout government and in the private and civic sectors.
As an
interagency program, NEHERP is exemplary for the coordination it
has encouraged along both organizational and disciplinary lines.
Although I am here today to speak about the seismological
aspects of NEHRP, I would like to point out, first, some significant
"social" changes that NEHRP has encouraged within the field of
earthquake studies and hazard mitigation.
Twenty years ago,
especially outside California, seismological research was largely an
academic pursuit aimed at understanding the structure and history of
the Earth.
The seismic waves generated by earthquakes were used
to infer the deep structure of the Earth's interior.
Earthquakes
signaled the deformation and evolution of the Earth; and advances in
seismology played an important role in the discovery of plate
tectonics.
Only limited attention was paid by the academic
community to the societal impact of earthquakes.
At the same time,
engineering practice showed little interest in the basic principles of
seismology.
The details and complexity of ground motions
produced by earthquakes were seldom taken into account.
Little
effort was made to transmit the fundamental knowledge required to
develop effective means to minimize earthquake damage, even
though the public has always had a fascination with earthquakes.
NEHRP has changed the isolation which existed 20 years
ago.
Seismological research is now focused on earthquakes as
sources of strong ground motion, and much has been learned about
their rates of occurrence and the motions they produce.
Seismologists and engineers now have a clearer understanding of
how they must work in tandem to understand the interactions
between ground shaking and building response.
The research
community is working closely with federal disaster agencies, the
private sector and the media to provide rapid information on
earthquake occurrence.
The level of public awareness of earthquake
hazards and mitigation strategies has dramatically increased.
Following the Kobe earthquake, Japan realized that its
earthquake mitigation program - already superior in many ways to
the US program - was in serious need of improvement.
Japan has
embarked on a major program to upgrade its earthquake monitoring
network and strengthen its research programs in earthquake studies.
To reach its potential to reduce earthquake losses in the US,
NEHRP is in critical need of similar attention.
NEHRP FUNDING - CALL FOR A NEW METRIC
In the spirit of "lessons learned" and "warnings given", I
would submit that the time is right for a fundamental reassessment
of our investment in NEHRP.
I would encourage your committee to
carefully review the level of support proposed for NEHRP over the
next few years, and consider the lasting return that would result
from a significant acceleration of investment in this program.
After
inflation, NEHRP funding has remained essentially stagnant for the
past 20 years, at a level appropriate for a feasibility study on the
development of mitigation strategies.
While NEHRP has remained
stalled, the cost of earthquakes has not.
In 1970, the San Fernando
earthquake caused $500 million in property damage.
The similarly
sized Northridge earthquake in 1994, within 20 km of San
Fernando, caused over $20 billion in damage - an increase by a
factor of 40.
If we heed the "warnings given" by these recent
earthquakes, as Japan has, we should be investing in hazard
mitigation research and implementation at several times the rate that
we are today.
While there have been numerous reviews of the organization
and structure of NEHRP, to my knowledge there has been no in-
depth look at the funding levels required to meet the national need in
hazard reduction.
The current investment in NEHRP of less than
$100 million per year is only a small fraction of the loss suffered in
a moderate event like Northridge.
Sums well in excess of the
NEHRP budget are being spent to retrofit structures for which there
is virtually no quantitative data with which to evaluate their
performance in strong ground shaking.
I encourage you to reflect on a new metric for establishing
the appropriate level of support for NEHRP.
Whether that metric is
proportional (a small percentage of the total investment at risk in
earthquake areas) or absolute (based on the cost savings that
mitigation efforts can achieve) or comparative (based on the federal
investment in other disaster mitigation programs), I am confident
that the conclusion will be that the current level of effort needs to be
significantly increased .
I list below a few examples of areas where increased federal
support for NEHRP would have a measurable impact over the next
decade.
The attached letter from the Seismological Society of
America outlines additional directions for future studies.
Similar
examples could be provided from the engineering, mitigation and
planning sectors of NEHRP.
Earthquake Data
The earthquake recording equipment in use when
NEHRP began was capable of sensing only a limited part of the
amplitude and frequency range of interest to seismologists and
engineers.
Collecting data from remote stations and reporting to a
central authority for location of earthquakes was a difficult and
lengthy process.
No central repository existed for the collection and
archiving of data.
Today, with advances in electronics, computers
and communication technology, there no longer exist technical
limitations to gathering and distributing the ground motion data that
seismologists use to monitor earthquakes.
Modern seismic sensors
can detect and record the full amplitude and frequency range of
motions produced by earthquakes.
Communication technology,
including the Internet, makes possible the immediate collection and
distribution of data from even the most remote sites.
Computer
processing of these data allows rapid computation of earthquake
locations and broadcast of this information within minutes to
interested parties.
Satellite based geodetic technology has emerged (the Global Positioning System, or GPS) which makes it possible to detect with high precision the slow movement of the Earth's crust that can be used to monitor deformation in earthquake prone areas
.
NEHRP seismologists and engineers have reached
a state where data essential for their research are simply
not available.
The technologies to correct this situation
exist, yet funding constraints severely limit the
incorporation of these technologies into the US infrastructure
for earthquake monitoring and research.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A major upgrade is required in US facilities for
earthquake monitoring and the analysis, distribution and
archiving of data.
At national, regional and urban scales, this upgrade should emphasize the collection of broadband and strong motion seismic data and geodetic (GPS) data within a coordinated, standardized system for data collection, analysis and distribution.
The system
should extend from ground motion, to telemetry, to processing,
archiving and distribution.
The revitalized system should serve the
needs of the seismological and engineering research communities,
and local and national reporting agencies.
Implementation of this recommendation would have immediate and dramatic impact throughout all areas of NEHRP - seismology, engineering, mitigation and response.
It should be stressed that this upgrade does not entail an
extensive research and development program - we know what
needs to be done and we can do it now.
The technology exists, and
models for modern instrument networks already are already in place.
The Global Seismographic Network (GSN), a cooperative program
between the IRIS university consortium and the US Geological
Survey, has established instrumentation standards, modes of
communication and data collection and distribution facilities for
global earthquake monitoring.
The US National Seismographic
Network and recent initiatives in regional networks in Southern
California and the San Francisco area all incorporate the most
modern digital technologies, many of them based on developments
initiated for the GSN.
A Council of the National Seismic System
has been formed to coordinate efforts between national, regional and
global networks.
A significant influx of funding, however, is
required to bring these essential improvements into operation.
Cross-disciplinary interactions
One of the most important contributions NEHRP makes is
the stimulation of interdisciplinary research in the quest for
improved methods of hazard mitigation.
The area with which I am
most familiar is the intersection of seismology and engineering.
Doors have been opened and NEHRP has helped point to obvious
areas where enhanced interactions are required.
Funding
limitations, however, again have limited the opportunities for
effective interactions.
Unable to maintain even basic programs
within their own disciplines, engineers and seismologists find it
difficult to cultivate new initiatives.
There is a compelling need for
engineers and seismologists to interact more closely in the
development of estimates of strong ground motion to use in studies
of structural response.
The weak ground motions recorded from
small earthquakes can be extrapolated to provide preliminary bounds
on expected shaking from larger events.
It was made clear in
Northridge, however, that the detailed motions in moderate and
large events cannot be simply scaled from smaller events.
Engineers and seismologists need to cooperate in
the development of enhanced observational systems and
theoretical studies to more precisely determine the shape
and amplitude of waveforms produced in the zones of high
acceleration near strong earthquakes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Interdisciplinary research needs to be encouraged
through all components of NEHRP.
Special emphasis,
through the NSF and theUSGS, should expand
interactions between specialists in geoscience and
engineering.
Basic and Applied Research
NEHRP provides a structure for the cultivation and
advancement of the knowledge base necessary for hazard mitigation
- from basic research, through applied research to application.
Recent reviews of the management and structure of NEHRP have
encouraged more emphasis on the development of strategies for
implementation.
While I support the development of a coordinated
implementation strategy, I would caution that this should not be
done at the expense of maintaining a strong and vital research base.
The very fact that implementation has emerged as a major issue is
tribute to the success of NEHRP in advancing the knowledge base -
those implementation strategies being used today were developed in
the research base of yesterday.
Within NEHRP, the National Science Foundation and the
US Geological Survey are responsible for sustaining fundamental
and applied Earth science research.
The attached letter from the
Seismological Society of America lists some of the contributions that
seismological research has made to NEHRP.
Much of this research
has been carried out in universities, often in cooperation with the
USGS through their external grants program.
In addition to
advancing our fundamental knowledge of seismology, wave
propagation and the earthquake source, university programs have
contributed greatly to the mapping of the seismic regions of the
nation, through their involvement in the operation of regional
seismic networks.
The recent decrease in the USGS external
research program has weakened an already threatened program in
seismological research, and I strongly encourage that you restore
this program immediately to at least its previous funding level.
As a source of new ideas and the training for future
professionals, both in research and applied fields, the
health of university research programs is critical to the future
health of NEHRP.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ There should be an independent assessment of the
appropriate level of effort for the NSF and USGS
programs in basic and applied research related to
earthquake hazards, seismology and engineering.
Serious consideration should be given to substantial
increase in funding over the next five years.
International Partnerships
Earthquakes are a global phenomena and many nations have
earthquake hazards equal to or greater than those in our nation.
There is a strong tradition in seismology of international cooperation
and data exchange.
Many advances in the understanding of
earthquakes have come from studies, by US and foreign
researchers, of earthquakes in other seismically active regions.
The
fundamental processes which drive earthquakes are not stopped by
political boundaries, and much that is learned from earthquakes in
other environments can be translated for application in the US.
Because great earthquakes are a rare occurrence, it is especially
important to take advantage of observations of these events and their
effects, wherever they occur.
The response to the Kobe earthquake by the Japanese government involves the installation of thousands of new seismic stations, strong motion instruments, ocean bottom observatories, communication systems and GPS deformation sensors.
There have been clear indications that the Japanese are interested in cooperating with US scientists and engineers in post-Kobe studies and in analysis of the rich new data that will be emerging from the new monitoring networks.
At current funding levels, we are unable to
fully exploit this opportunity.
With NEHRP struggling to maintain the basic
operations of its national program, little flexibility exists to
take advantage of opportunities for international
cooperation.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Special funds should be provided within all areas of
NEHRP for support of international programs in
earthquake hazards research and for studying significant
earthquakes and their effects on an global basis.
CONCLUSION
The results of the past 20 years has shown the wisdom of
the concept of a National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.
NEHRP brings to the individual and to government an enhanced
awareness of earthquake hazards and points to actions, private and
civic, that will reduce the impact of earthquakes.
NEHRP has
forged partnerships, both administrative and intellectual, and
encouraged cooperative efforts between seismology, engineering
and mitigation specialists.
With the success of the program,
however, has come a heightened understanding of the enormous
challenge that remains.
Earthquakes cannot be prevented.
We cannot completely
eliminate losses during earthquakes.
We cannot promise that
earthquakes can be predicted.
We can, however, assure you that the
continuation of a healthy and expanded National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program will vastly improve our understanding
of earthquakes, their mode of occurrence and the motions they
produce.
Translated into engineering design and practice, this
knowledge will enhance the seismic resistance of buildings and
structures and significantly reduce losses in earthquakes.
Incorporated in disaster planning, this knowledge will aid in
preparing the response to inevitable earthquakes as they occur.
Transmitted to the public, this knowledge will increase awareness of
earthquake hazards and the means that individuals can take to
prepare for earthquakes and protect their own lives and property.
Mr. Chairman, as a scientist, I am constantly reminded that
earthquakes, many of them large, are a daily occurrence somewhere
in the world.
Our discussion today is somewhat abstract, only
because a major earthquake has not occurred recently within the
borders of our nation.
The recurrence of major US earthquakes
occurs at a time interval much longer than the federal budget cycle.
As a result, it is tempting to sacrifice long-term investment in
research and planning to achieve more immediate short-term goals.
We must be reminded, however, that we are not preparing for some
hypothetical threat to our national security, but rather to an inevitable
occurrence.
A major earthquake will occur within the United States,
and if we are not prepared, the financial and human consequences of
this single event will be more comparable to the ravages of war than
to the impact of other natural disasters that have seen prominence in
recent months.
While investment in NEHRP may seem like a
luxury during times of severe budget constraint, one only has to
view the flooding in North Dakota, and then speculate on what the
federal liability through disaster assistance will be when a major
earthquake occurs near a large metropolitan area.
NEHRP has laid the necessary foundation for both an
interagency and interdisciplinary approach to earthquake hazard
mitigation.
At the core of NEHRP lies a concerned and dedicated
group of scientists, engineers and civil servants who are proud of
our accomplishments, but critically aware of the inadequacies of the
current program.
We know that more needs to be done - and we are
convinced we know what to do.
It is time for us to get on with the
task.
I urge you to allow us to do so.
