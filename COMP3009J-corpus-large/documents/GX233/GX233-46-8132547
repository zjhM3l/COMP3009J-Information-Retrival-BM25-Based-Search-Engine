In the event of the death of a former or current state official or employee, the flags will be displayed at half-staff in accordance with instructions when so ordered by the Governor.
The flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential or Gubernatorial instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law.
Unless otherwise directed by the Presidential or Gubernatorial order the flag will be flown at half-staff thirty days from the death of the President or a former President; ten days from the day of death of the Vice President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until internment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a State, territory, possession; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.

It should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all weather flag is displayed.
