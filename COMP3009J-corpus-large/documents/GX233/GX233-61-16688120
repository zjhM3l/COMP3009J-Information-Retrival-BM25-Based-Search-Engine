If you own your own home, you may be able to use it as a source of income without taking out an ordinary second mortgage or home equity loan.
You may qualify for a "reverse mortgage loan".
A reverse mortgage loan is a loan by which older people, whose principal asset is often a home which might have to be sold in order to provide money for other living expenses, may borrow on the value (equity) in that home.
The loan proceeds are paid by the lender to the home owner in equal installments (usually monthly), or as needed under a line of credit, or in one or more lump sum payments or in any combination of these features.
This is the opposite of obtaining and then paying off a conventional mortgage.
That is why it is called a "reverse mortgage".
Moreover, the home owner does not have to repay the reverse mortgage loan until the loan "terminates" or ends.
But, be very CAREFUL! Not only are these loans complicated, but they can also be inappropriate in certain situations, especially if you do not have the ability to live independently or you wish to leave your home to your children after your death.
For this reason, the law provides the opportunity for counseling to borrowers before they take a reverse mortgage loan, and the Banking Department strongly recommends that borrowers obtain such counseling.
The New York State Banking Law and the Real Property Law authorize reverse mortgage loans and set forth the terms and conditions under which such loans may be offered.
These terms and conditions are summarized here.
But please remember, this information does not describe every feature or every reverse mortgage loan product available to you.
For example, two other Reverse Mortgage Loan products are the HUD/HECM reverse mortgage loan program and the Home Keeper Mortgage program offered by the Federal National Mortgage Association.

General Provisions
There are several general provisions of a reverse mortgage loan with which you should be familiar:
(a) You, or both you and any person with whom you own the property jointly such as your spouse, are considered to be the borrower(s) or the mortgagor(s) on the reverse mortgage loan.
(b) For certain reverse mortgage loans, you, or both you and any person with whom you own the property jointly such as your spouse, must be at least 60 years of age.
For certain other reverse mortgage loans, you, or both you and any person with whom you own the property jointly such as your spouse, must be at least 70 years of age and have a low income.
(c) The loan is secured by a first mortgage on your home provided that it is a one-to-four family residence or a condominium.
It may not be secured by a lien on a cooperative apartment.
(d) The loan may be for a fixed number of years which is known as a "term" loan, or may be for an undetermined length of time which is known as a "tenure" loan.
A tenure loan matures solely upon the happening of certain "termination events" including, but not limited to, your death or your ceasing to live in your home.
These termination events are described more fully later.
(e) The loan proceeds are paid to you in equal installments (usually monthly), or as needed under a line of credit, or in one or more lump sum payments or in any combination of these features.
In some cases, some or all of the loan proceeds may be used to purchase an annuity which is a type of financial investment that may pay you an income in the future for a period of years which period is usually measured by your life.
The purchase of an annuity may enable you to have lifetime income irrespective of the term of the loan or where you later reside.
(f) You or your estate must repay the loan, but the only asset which may be used by the lender to satisfy the loan is the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan.
(g) There is no financial penalty if you choose to prepay the loan.
__________________________________________________________________
Lenders' Responsibilities
Lenders must comply with the laws and regulations governing reverse mortgage loans.
Here are just a few of the lender's obligations of which you should be aware.
(a) The lender must deliver to you, the applicant, at the time of application a statement prepared by the local or county office for the aging on the advisability and availability to the borrower of independent counseling and information services, if such a statement is available.
(b) The lender must disclose to you as the applicant a description of the relevant features of the reverse mortgage being offered.
This should include but is not limited to: 1.
The interest rate to be charged and whether the rate is fixed, variable or both; that interest accrues from the time monies are advanced to or on behalf of you; and that interest is compounded; 2.
All fees, costs and payments to be paid by you; 3.
Where applicable, a description of any refinancing features; 4.
The particular events which can terminate the reverse mortgage loan such as death or moving from the residence; and 5.
Where applicable, a description of any shared appreciation or equity participation features.
(c) The lender must provide a toll-free telephone number and the name of a person to whom applicants and mortgagors may address questions, comments or complaints.
If there is no toll-free telephone number, then the lender must accept collect calls.
(d) Prior to the closing of a reverse mortgage loan, the only charge a lender may collect from an applicant(s) is an application fee.
This fee must be called an application fee and may not be figured as a percentage of the principal amount of the loan or amount financed.
The amount of the fee should be reasonably related to the services to be performed.
(e) The maximum ratio of the loan to the anticipated future value of the property, as projected at the time of loan closing, (i.e., the loan-to-value ratio) should not exceed 80% of the anticipated value of the property at loan maturity.
(f) In the event a lender fails to make or remit to you any payment required under the loan agreement within fifteen (15) days of the due date, the lender must forfeit twice the interest that would have been earned on the outstanding loan principal for the entire period during which payments were suspended, ceased or made late.
(g) The lender must inform you that written complaints can be submitted to the New York State Banking Department, Mortgage Banking Division, 1 State Street, New York, New York 10004-1417.
Telephone number: 1-800-334-3360 (New York State only).
__________________________________________________________________
Mortgagor's Responsibilities
Under the regulations, there are also certain things required of you as the mortgagor(s).
IF YOU DO NOT ADHERE TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, THE LENDER MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR PROPERTY AND TAKE IT FROM YOU.
It is, therefore, extremely important to have a complete understanding of all aspects of a reverse mortgage loan.
These are a few of the requirements of which you should be aware:
(a) You are required to maintain the structural integrity (soundness) of the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan in the same condition as the property is in at the time of closing, or after repairs have been made for which funds have been disbursed or set aside at closing.
(b) If there is no escrow account established by the lender, you are required to pay the real estate taxes and insurance premiums on the property directly.
(c) You must execute all documents reasonably requested by the lender and pay all permissible fees and costs associated with the increase in payments or the extension of the loan term, provided that such fees and costs have been previously disclosed in writing to you.
(d) You and the lender may agree to establish a "reserve account".
This account may be drawn upon by you or the lender to maintain the structural integrity of the real property, to pay real estate taxes or the premium on any required insurance, or for any personal expenses which you may incur.
A lender may only charge interest on advances of funds actually made from the reserve account and not on the entire balance in the reserve account.
(e) You have the right to choose a property insurer, but your choice must be acceptable to the lender.
The lender may not unreasonably withhold its consent.
However, if you fail to choose a property insurer in a timely manner or if the insurer is not acceptable to the lender, then the lender may insure the property with a carrier of its choice.
__________________________________________________________________
Termination
Remember to keep in mind that the lender will hold a mortgage on your home.
At the end of the term or upon the occurrence of any one of the termination events described below, the lender may "foreclose" on that mortgage.
That is to say, when a termination event happens, the lender is either repaid from some other asset of yours or the lender sells the home, takes what is due to it and returns any excess to you or your estate.
If you were planning to leave your home to your children after your death, most likely you will not be able to do so if you get a reverse mortgage loan.
However, remember that the loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty if you have the funds to do so.
Under the law, the lender is required to inform you of the events which would terminate the loan and give you an explicit warning, if you have taken out a term loan, that you may be compelled to move out of your home at the expiration of the term loan.
In addition to the expiration of a term loan, reverse mortgage loans may be terminated by the lender, but only in the event of any of the following:
(1) the sale, conveyance, transfer or assignment, whether voluntary or involuntary, of any part of the real property securing the loan or of your rights in the real property;
(2) your death, or if there is more than one mortgagor, then the death of the last living mortgagor;
(3) you and your joint owner, if any, cease to use the real property as your principal place of residence, i.e, as your living and sleeping quarters, for 90 consecutive days in any 365 day period without notifying the lender and making arrangements satisfactory to the lender for the maintenance of the real property.
For example, you could spend up to 90 consecutive days taking a vacation in Florida during the winter months;
(4) you and your joint owner, if any, cease to use the real property as your principal place of residence, i.e., as your living and sleeping quarters, in excess of 180 days in any 365 day period.
The 180 days do not have to be consecutive and are intended to cover shorter vacations or stays at rehabilitation centers or nursing homes.
Remember, once you are away from the home for 90 consecutive days, you must notify the lender and seek to make arrangements satisfactory to the lender, or the lender can foreclose on the reverse mortgage loan;
(5) you fail to pay real estate taxes or maintain all insurance required pursuant to the agreement.
However, before terminating the loan for this reason, the lender must give you an opportunity to pay the past-due real estate taxes or insurance premiums;
(6) various legal actions such as you or another person filing a petition for your bankruptcy;
(7) you fail to maintain the structural integrity of the real property.
Prior to making or charging you for a repair which is deemed necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the real property, the lender must notify you of the problem and, unless a threat of imminent danger to life or property exists, the lender must give you 90 days to make the repairs.
If an imminent danger to life or property exists, the lender, with as little as 48 hours notice, may proceed to remedy the problem.
__________________________________________________________________
FEES, COSTS AND PAYMENTS AT ORIGINATION
Although we have mentioned an application fee, there are many other fees, costs and payments that the lender may charge you.
The following list contains the ONLY fees, costs and payments which a lender may charge in connection with the origination of reverse mortgage loans, other than principal, interest, shared appreciation and equity participation:
* an application fee;
* a loan origination fee;
* the cost of document preparation;
* the cost of appraising or surveying the property;
* the cost of a title examination, an abstract of title or title insurance;
* the cost of a tax search for tax liens existing at the time of closing if such search is not included in the title examination;
* the payment to discharge any existing liens on the real property securing the loan;
* the cost of recording the reverse mortgage loan;
* the cost of actual attorney's fees charged to the lender in connection with the closing of the loan;
* the cost of a credit report;
* the cost of a flood zone search;
* the cost of an inspection to be paid in connection with the origination of the loan but not subsequent to the loan closing;
* the payment to purchase an annuity;
* the payment for any repairs contracted for, at or before the loan closing, irrespective of whether such repairs are completed at time of closing and/or whether the funds are held in escrow;
* a one-time payment for a tax reporting service;
* the cost of purchasing mortgage insurance;
* the payment of real estate taxes and property insurance;
* the cost of mortgage brokerage services (not to exceed three points based on the value of the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan at the time of loan closing).
Lenders are not authorized to impose any fee which is not contained in this list.
This is unlike a traditional mortgage loan in which the nature and amount of fees is not limited, provided that they are disclosed.
__________________________________________________________________
FEES, COSTS AND PAYMENTS WHILE THE LOAN IS OUTSTANDING
You must also be aware that during the life of the reverse mortgage loan there are additional fees, costs and payments that the lender has the right to charge you or require you to pay directly or add to your loan balance.
The following list contains the ONLY fees, costs and payments which a lender may charge during the loan:
* the cost of purchasing additional mortgage insurance;
* the costs to maintain the structural integrity of the real property securing the loan;
* the costs of any appraisal for the refinancing or extension of the loan;
* the payment of real estate taxes and property insurance;
* a monthly servicing fee of not more than $30.00.
At the termination of the loan, there may be additional fees, costs or payments.
The lender may charge a termination or maturity fee.
This fee would be the actual cost of arranging for the sale or foreclosure of the real property securing the loan.
It may include the actual broker's fees, advertising costs, moving and/or storage costs and legal and other fees representing actual fees or costs incurred by the lender.
It may not be a flat percentage fee.
All of the above fees may be financed as part of the loan except for the application fee.
__________________________________________________________________
SHARED APPRECIATION AND EQUITY PARTICIPATION
Another consideration to take into account is the possible future appreciation on your home.
The lender and the borrower may agree at the outset to "shared appreciation" or "equity participation".
Under shared appreciation, the lender receives an agreed-to percentage of the appreciated value of the loan when the loan is terminated in addition to the repayment of the principal, accrued interest and any financed fees.
Under equity participation, the lender receives an agreed-to percentage of the amount the residence is worth at the end of the loan irrespective of whether that amount is more than or less than the amount borrowed plus accrued interest and any financed fees.
Under shared appreciation, if the residence increases in value while the reverse mortgage is outstanding, the lender will receive an agreed-to percentage of the amount of the increase in the value of the residence.
For example, assume that the home is worth $200,000 when the loan is first made and the lender and borrower agree that the lender will receive 50% of any appreciation in the value of the home that occurs while the loan is outstanding.
At the end of the loan, assume that the home is worth $300,000.
The appreciation in value is $100,000.
The agreement gives to the lender $50,000 or in other words, the agreed-to 50%.
This is in addition to any other money which may be owed to the lender.
Under equity participation, the lender and the borrower agree to a maximum percentage of the home value which a lender may collect at the end of the loan.
The lender collects this percentage of the home value irrespective of whether that percentage gives to the lender an amount which is more than or less than the amount borrowed plus accrued interest and any financed fees.
For example, assume that the property is worth $200,000 at the end of the loan.
The amount loaned plus accrued interest and fees is $125,000.
The agreed-to percentage is 75%.
The lender would be entitled to receive $150,000.
Or, as another example, assume that the property is worth $100,000 at the end of the loan.
The amount loaned plus accrued interest and fees is $125,000.
The agreed to percentage is 75% and therefore, the lender is only entitled to receive $75,000.
Sometimes, the agreement may state that as a minimum, the lender is entitled to receive the amount loaned without any interest or fees.
__________________________________________________________________
Interest
The interest on a reverse mortgage loan is compounded.
This means that you are paying interest on both the principal and the interest which has already accrued each month.
Compounded interest has a major effect on the amount of your loan balance since it causes the amount outstanding to grow at an increasing rate.
As an example, Table A shows the impact of compounded interest on a $500.00 monthly payment at an interest rate of 12% per annum (or 1% per month) for the first year.
TABLE A
CAPTION: Impact of Compounded Interest on a $500.00 monthly payment at an interest rate of 12% per annum for the first year
Month Advance Outstanding Principal Balance Interest (1% per month) Loan Balance at End of Month 1 $500 $500.00 $5.00 $505.00 2 500 1,005.00 10.05 1,015.05 3 500 1,515.05 15.15 1,530.20 4 500 2,030.20 20.30 2,050.50 5 500 2,550.50 25.50 2,576.00 6 500 3,076.00 30.76 3,106.76 7 500 3,606.76 36.07 3,642.83 8 500 4,142.83 41.43 4,184.26 9 500 4,684.26 46.84 4,731.10 10 500 5,231.10 52.31 5,283.41 11 500 5,783.41 57.83 5,841.24 12 500 6,341.24 63.41 6,404.65 TOTAL $6,000 $404.65
TOTAL YEARLY INTEREST ACCRUED IN FIRST YEAR: $404.66
Table B is an example of what it would cost you to receive $500.00 per month and illustrates the increase in loan balances on a reverse mortgage loan over a ten-year period with an interest rate of 12% per annum (or 1% per month) compound interest.
TABLE B
CAPTION: Increase in Loan Balances on a Reverse Mortgage Loan
Year Total of Monthly Loan Advances Interest at 12% Per Annum (1% Per Month) Loan Balance (Amount Owed) at End of Year Increase in Loan Balance for Year 1 $ 6,000 $ 405 $ 6,405 $ 6,405 2 12,000 1,622 13,622 7,217 3 18,000 3,754 21,754 8,132 4 24,000 6,917 30,917 9,163 5 30,000 11,243 41,243 10,326 6 36,000 16,879 52,879 11,636 7 42,000 23,989 65,989 13,110 8 48,000 32,763 80,763 14,774 9 54,000 43,411 97,411 16,648 10 60,000 56,170 116,170 18,759
As you can see from the above table, in ten years your home would have to be worth at least $116,170 in order to repay just the principal and accrued interest of the loan.
The interest rate used in Tables A and B is merely an example of a reverse mortgage loan with a fixed rate of interest of 12% per annum.
The actual interest rate on your loan may be higher or lower or may be a variable rate of interest.
Perhaps you do not need to borrow this much to supplement your income each month.
As another example, if you only borrow $200.00 per month at 12% per annum, the accrued interest at the end of the first year would be $162, and at the end of the 10-year period would be $22,468.
Your total loan balance for interest and principal at the end of 10 years would be $46,468.
Be sure to know exactly how much you will need to supplement your income in advance in order that you are not accruing large amounts of interest on money that you may really not need.
__________________________________________________________________
Conclusion
Reverse mortgages can be of substantial benefit to those senior citizens who are reasonably healthy, desire to remain in their homes and are "house-rich" but "cash-poor".
Nonetheless, as stated earlier, it is extremely important to have a complete understanding of a reverse mortgage loan.
Therefore, it is advisable to have either an attorney, an accountant, a housing and urban development certified counselor, or other counseling service review the reverse mortgage loan product with you before you make any decisions.
If you have any complaints you wish to make, you may contact the New York State Banking Department at the address and phone numbers listed in the Consumer Complaints Section.
