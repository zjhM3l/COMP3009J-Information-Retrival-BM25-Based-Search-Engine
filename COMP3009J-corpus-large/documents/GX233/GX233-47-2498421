Introduction
The Friends For Folks Program was started at the Lexington Correctional Complex in 1990 under the leadership of Dr. Stephen Kaiser, warden; Susan Gilbert, Unit Manager; Pauletta Lewis, Warden's Assistant; Debbie Burchfield, Psychological Assistant; and Sgt. Steven Bradley, Program Coordinator.
The concept for the project was derived from a program located in Gigg Harbor, Washington.
Funding for the program derives entirely from donations given by organizations and individuals in the private sector.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections provides the training facilities and coordinates staff schedules to operate the program.
However, no funding is provided by the Department of Corrections or the Oklahoma Legislature for the operation of this program.
Almost all of the animals are received from a non-kill private sanctuary in Norman, Oklahoma called Second Chance.
Second Chance donates the spaying and neutering, and insures the health of all the animals received at Friends For Folks.
The Animals at Friends For Folks are victims of abuse, abandonment, or found as strays.
Second Chance operating with Friends For Folks is making a concerted effort to give these animals that second chance for a happy and fulfilling life.
These animals, upon completion of training, are placed with senior citizens for the purpose of companionship.
Upon successful completion of training, some animals are placed in Nursing Homes as social therapy animals.
Mission of the Friends For Folks Program
The mission of the Friends For Folks Program is to provide the Senior Citizens of the State of Oklahoma with a well trained and behaved companion.
By providing the senior with this companion, we believe they can increase the senior's desire to live, cope with loneliness, and the need to show affection.
With the placement of these "friends", we are attempting to help control the pet population by using stray, abandoned, and abused animals.
These dogs are spayed or neutered and all health needs are met before placement.
By using the long-term offenders within the Department of Corrections, we hope to use the "friend" to change his outlook on life and the way he does his time.
We also feel that the human-animal bond will help the offender develop a more caring attitude and overall better self-image.
Who Benefits From The Program?
The animal benefits in that he has a second chance to live out his life in a useful and productive manner in a non-abusive environment.
The elderly and handicapped benefit by being provided with a companion to share or assist in their day to day lives.
The agencies that the program works with all agree that their clients benefit a great deal by having one of the trained companion dogs.
The agencies agree that a pet can increase the desire to live by helping the senior citizens to cope with loneliness, and the need to show affection.
In some cases, the pet helps fill a void left by the death of a loved one.
The new friend provides a companion to be petted, pampered, and to give a person company.
Lastly, the program is a tool to manage "long-term" offenders.
The offender is allowed a chance to put something positive back into the community by performing a public service.
It is hoped, that through the "friend" (dog) the offender will change his outlook on life and the way he does his time.
The program helps to create the opportunity for a human-animal bond to develop and grow as each offender develops a more caring attitude, and overall better self-image.
It is also a goal that the offender develop a more positive and caring attitude toward others.
Special Project Animals
Friends For Folks currently has two animals involved in the program that is a special project.
Scottie 
They have been trained mainly to work with the mentally and physically challenged children.
Scottie 
They are also used as a social tie with the long-term offenders on the unit.
The offenders can take them out on the leash and walk or play with them.
They are also allowed to remain in the cell of an offender overnight with permission.
In order for the offender to be able to do this there is a screening process that the offender must pass.
The program has trained and placed three (3) hearing impaired animals and numerous social therapy animals.
Some of the social therapy animals were placed in a mental handicapped facility, while the other social therapy animals were placed in nursing homes.
Friends For Folks hopes to expand the special project dog training in the future.
It is felt that this is a program that can provide a great service to the community, and that it is beneficial not only the handicapped and elderly within the State of Oklahoma, but also to the inmate population involved in the training.
Program Overview
Over the eight years we have been in operation, we have been able to place over three hundred animals covering the State of Oklahoma, as well as placements in Texas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wyoming.
Our goal is to continue with placements and attempt to aid the senior "Citizens of our state.
Friends For Folks has been a great asset to the community, facility, the long-term offenders program, and our "friends" the dogs.
If you have any questions or would like more information on the program please let us know.
We will happy to assist you in anyway we can.
