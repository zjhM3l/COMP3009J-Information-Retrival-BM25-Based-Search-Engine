New Identity Crime Laws Help Consumers and Law Enforcement
By Greg Abbott Attorney General of Texas
Thousands of honest, hard-working people fall prey to identity theft each year.
In 2002 alone, 14,000 Texans told the Federal Trade Commission they were victims of identity crime.
Identity theft is a felony crime in Texas where one person uses another individual's personal or financial information for fraudulent purposes.
The fallout can be devastating, as victims spend large amounts of time and money trying to clear their names.
In response to the growing identity crime epidemic, the 78th Texas Legislature passed four new laws to assist victims and law enforcement agencies.
House Bill 254 changed venue requirements to allow prosecution of identity theft in the county where the victim resides.
It is common for an ID thief to live in a different city, state or even country than the victim.
This has caused jurisdictional problems for law enforcement agencies.
The new law clarifies this issue.
Under S.B. 473, victims who file a valid police report may place a security freeze with the appropriate credit agency.
If a police report is not immediately available, victims can place a security alert in their credit files.
Alerts are only valid for 45 days, but there is no limit on how many times a victim can place an alert with a credit bureau.
S.B. 473 also requires Texas police officers to undergo mandatory training on identity theft.
Our agency recently joined the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Postal Service to train law enforcement in the investigation of identity crimes.
Besides causing financial and credit problems, identity crime often has criminal implications for the victim.
Many ID thieves will give false information when they are apprehended for other offenses.
This means that a criminal record may be created under the victim's name.
Senate Bill 566 was written to address this problem.
Under S.B. 566, an arresting law enforcement agency that was misled by a suspect must notify the ID theft victim regarding the misuse of their identity.
S.B. 566 allows the victim to file a declaration with the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The victim is entitled to expunction of the false criminal record.
Finally, House Bill 2138 makes it illegal to scan the magnetic strip of a credit or ATM card without the consent of the authorized owner of the card.
Violations of H.B. 2138 are a Class B misdemeanor.
Identity theft scam artists are using high tech scanning devices to steal money from hard working Texans.
It can happen fast.
A criminal can take your card, scan the magnetic strip and replace it in your restaurant table or shopping mall counter before you know it's gone.
We urge consumers to be very cautious about giving out their personal financial information.
There seems to be no end to the tricks that ID criminals use to get information.
Our office has received several complaints of scam e-mails ranging from lottery hoaxes and advanced fee fraud to fraudulent e-mails requesting personal information from what appears to be a legitimate business.
No matter what a caller or e-mailer says, do not give out your social security number, driver's license number or other personal information over the phone or by email.
Unfortunately identity crime is here to stay.
However, these new laws are an excellent step toward curtailing identity crime and allowing consumers and law enforcement agencies to fight this menace together.

Beware of Hidden Costs of Work-at-home Scams
By Greg Abbott Attorney General of Texas
Earn thousands of dollars a month, work in your own home, processing medical bills! Chances are you have encountered a work-at-home advertisement with a claim similar to this one.
These types of advertisements abound the on Internet, television, and newspapers.
Unfortunately these offers rarely deliver on their promises.
Consumers lose thousands of dollars on work-at-home scams every year.
Most ads fail to mention that you must work many hours without pay.
In addition, you usually have to spend your own money for supplies such as newspaper ads, envelopes, paper, and stamps.
You may also be asked to pay for instructions and tutorial software.
One of the classic work-at-home advertisements is for medical billing.
These ads usually offer prepackaged businesses, known as billing centers.
The sales pitch may state that there is a crisis in the health care industry due to the costly process of filing paper claims.
The solution is electronic claim processing.
You may also be told that many doctors are turning to electronic billing in order to save money and will (contract out) such billing.
Promoters may say that you can make a substantial amount of money processing these claims for doctors.
The promoter may even supply you with a list of clients "eager" to make the jump from paper to electronic processing.
No experience is needed.
What you might NOT be told is that you have to market these services to the medical community.
The promise of "eager" clients is usually a hollow one.
The seller rarely has reliable contacts within the medical community.
Another infamous work-at-home scam is envelope stuffing.
This type of deceptive advertisement promises you information on how to make money stuffing envelopes at home.
After you pay the promoter a "small fee," you will receive a letter telling you to place the same envelope stuffing ad in newspapers and magazines and on the Internet.
You'll only make money if people respond to your ad.
Some promoters are so brazen as to suggest soliciting family members.
Assembly work is also a very popular work-at-home scheme.
In this case, you may be told that you can make thousands of dollars assembling items for a company that has promised to buy them from you.
You must first buy certain types of equipment to produce the goods for the company.
The equipment typically costs hundreds of dollars.
However, after you perform the work, the business in question will usually refuse to pay you, citing lack of quality.
These solicitations can cost consumers anywhere from $2,000 to $8,000.
The ads may vary in how they get your attention, but they are consistent in their quest to relieve you of your money.
I urge you to be very cautious when considering a work-at-home opportunity.
As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Child Support Collections Top $1.5 Billion
By Greg Abbott Attorney General of Texas
The money benefitted approximately 637,000 children, and topped the previous year's collections of $1.409 billion by $158 million.
During the state fiscal year (SFY) that ended August 31, the Child Support Division of my office collected more than $1.567 billion.
But, this isn't just a bunch of numbers my office is touting.
The payments make a real difference for the families who receive them.
And most important to me, this money represents hope to children who rely on child support for a fair start in life.
The children we serve need child support to put clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads, literally.
This year employees of the Child Support Division made the dream of a home come true for a single mother of two girls, who collected thousands of dollars in unpaid child support.
The Division's efforts included filing a lien in the county where the delinquent father owned property, resulting in a lump sum payment of $27,500 when the property was sold.
The woman, who with her 10- and 13-year-old daughters, had lived in a rented duplex for 11 years, used the money to buy a home in Arlington, which they moved into this year.
The Attorney General's office uses every available tool to see that parents meet their legal obligation to pay child support.
More than 60 percent of the $1.567 billion collected in 2003 was made possible by withholding income from a parent's paycheck..
Almost $115 million resulted from intercepting delinquent parents' IRS refund checks.
Other measures to collect child support include seizure of assets held in financial institutions and suspension of driver, professional and recreational licenses.
If you need help to collect child support, my office accepts applications from mothers, fathers, and other individuals who are taking care of a child.
To request an application for services, call our toll-free telephone number at (800) 252-8014, or visit the Web site at www.oag.state.tx.us.
My office strives to be accessible to all of our clients, who often need up-to-date information about their child support case.
Moms and dads can obtain round-the-clock help from the agency's toll-free automated voice response system (800-252-8014), which handled 18 million calls during the past fiscal year.
With one phone call, both parents who receive child support and parents who pay child support can obtain a record of recent child support payments, dates and locations of pending court hearings, dates of service on current legal actions, availability of genetic test results, and amount due for current and past-due child support.
Child Support Interactive, which can be accessed from the main Attorney General Web site at www.oag.state.tx.us, is used by the public to obtain general information about the child support program and apply for services.
Those with child support cases can obtain specific case information from a secure section of the site.
Child Support Interactive received more than 7 million visits in SFY 2003, a 95 percent increase over visits to the Web site during the previous fiscal year.
I appreciate the hard work of the child support employees that made our record-breaking year possible.
However, there are still many children going without a parent's financial support.
My office will not be satisfied until all children receive the support they are due.

CHILD SUPPORT EVADER: WILLIAM SHEPHERD, JR.
[shepherd.jpg] Owes: $30,062 Last Address: Garrison, TX Occupation: Truck Driver Born: 01/09/61 Height: 5' 11" Weight: 195 Color of Eyes: Green Color of Hair: Brown Race: Caucasian
Attorney General Greg Abbott needs your help to find Child Support Evader William Shepherd Jr., one of the Most Wanted Child Support Evaders in Texas.
Shepherd owes $30,062 for one daughter from Nacogdoches, Texas.
He was added to the Attorney General's Child Support Evader Top Ten list in March 2002, and has gone underground to elude officials and willfully avoid arrest.
When the parents divorced in 1981, Shepherd was ordered to make child support payments of $75 per month.
The Attorney General's Office obtained a $9,400 judgment against Shepherd in 1994, for failing to pay regularly.
Upon the Attorney General's recommendation, Shepherd also was found in contempt of court, and his monthly payments were increased to $350, based on his income at the time.
Shepherd continued to ignore the court's order to pay child support.
When he failed to appear at an August 1996 court hearing to address his noncompliance, a warrant was issued for his arrest.
Shepherd is avoiding law enforcement officers who seek to arrest him on the outstanding charges.
Due to missed payments and interest that accrues on unpaid child support, Shepherd now owes more than $30,000 in unpaid child support.
Shepherd is also wanted by the Nacogdoches County Probation Office for probation violations related to a felony indecency-with-a-child conviction.
Evader Shepherd may be hiding in Southeast Texas or in another state.
He is most likely working for cash to avoid garnishment of wages to pay child support.
If you have information about Shepherd's location, please contact the Attorney General's Office at 1-866-EVADERS (382-3377).
Child Support Evaders on the Top Ten list are being singled out because they have the ability to take responsibility for their children, but refuse to do so.
Incarceration is the only option for parents who flagrantly ignore a court's order to pay child support.
The Attorney General's Office helps parents who lack the ability to pay child support by referring them to job training and employment services.
