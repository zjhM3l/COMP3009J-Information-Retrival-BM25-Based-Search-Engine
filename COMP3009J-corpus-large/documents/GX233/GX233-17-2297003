What is the legal drinking age in Wisconsin? Twenty-one years of age.
This is also the age at which a person can be on licensed premises.
There are some exceptions, which we will discuss below.
2.
Can children be in a bar with their parents? Yes.
Persons under age 21 may be on licensed premises, and can be sold and allowed to drink alcohol beverages, if they are with their parents, legal guardians, or spouses, as long as those persons are of legal age; but this is at the discretion of the lecensee.
3.
Are there other times that underage persons can be on licensed premises? Yes, there are several.
Please see Publication 302, Wisconsin Alcohol Beverage Laws for Retailers Including Laws Relating to Underage Persons, for more information.
4.
Can "teen nights" or "alcohol free nights" be held at taverns? There are several ways to legally allow underage persons on licensed premises.
+ A municipality (town, village, city) may pass an ordinance allowing underage persons to be in a room on a Class B premises where no alcohol is sold, furnished, served, or consumed by anyone when the underage persons are present.
Each time this happens, the local police agency must authorize it in writing.
+ Underage persons may be present on Class B premises when no alcohol beverages are consumed, sold, or given away.
In other words, the place is closed for the sale or consumption of alcohol beverages.
The beer, wine, and liquor must be in locked storage, unless the licensee, agent, or person with an operator's license is present.
The licensee must notify the local police agency in advance of when this will occur.
No written police authorization is required.
+ Underage persons may be in a dance hall attached to Class B licensed premises if the dance hall is separate from the rooms where alcohol beverages are served, if there is a separate entrance to the dance hall, and if no alcohol beverages are furnished or consumed by any person in the dance hall.
5.
Are there any places an unaccompanied underage person can possess alcohol beverages? Yes, an underage person can possess alcohol beverages if that person is employed by a brewer, beer and/or liquor wholesaler, producer of alcohol fuel, retail licensed premises, or campus; is at least 18; and is under the immediate supervision of a person over 21.
The alcohol possession must be during the course of the employment.
6.
As a licensee, how do I ensure that the person across the bar, at the counter, or at the table is old enough to be there and to drink? Check the person's identification (ID).
If anyone appears to be under 21, you must demand proof of age.
Wisconsin residents must show either a valid Wisconsin driver's license with a photo or a valid Wisconsin identification card.
7.
A lot of fake IDs are out there.
How do I protect myself against being fooled? Become familiar with current valid driver's licenses and IDs.
Compare the questioned ID with a standard, like your own ID.
Be suspicious if it looks like the card was altered or tampered with, if it is discolored, or if any of the letters, logos, or photos are poorly applied or partially missing.
See Publication 302, Wisconsin Alcohol Beverage and Tobacco Laws for Retailers , for ID checking guidelines.
8.
Is it a serious violation to make a fake ID? Yes.
It is a crime punishable by fines and jail time.
If you are caught making and selling a fake ID, it is a felony in Wisconsin, punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and 3 years in prison.
The Department of Revenue has a vigorous program to detect and deter ID counterfeiting.
If you know someone who makes and sells fake IDs, please contact the Alcohol 
9.
You said that underage persons can work at licensed premises.
Does this mean any age? No.
They must be over age 14.
In addition, they must not be serving, selling, dispensing, or giving away alcohol beverages unless they are at least 18 years of age.
If over age 18 and they do not have their own operator's license, they must be immediately supervised by the licensee, agent, adult member of the licensee's immediate family, or a person with an operator's license.
10.
Are there any restrictions for underage persons who are musicians or other performers? If the performer is 16 or 17, he or she may perform on Friday, Saturday, or any other day not followed by a school day.
If the performance is in a hall rented to celebrate a special event like a wedding, holiday, birthday, or anniversary, the underage performer may work until midnight on Sunday.
There are no such restrictions for performers over 18.
11.
Can I get into trouble if somebody I serve goes out and injures or kills somebody? While there is a heavy moral burden in such a situation, Wisconsin does not have a "Dram Shop" law making you responsible for mayhem caused by persons you serve, as long as they are of legal drinking age.
However, if they are minors, you may be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and 7 1/2 years in jail.
