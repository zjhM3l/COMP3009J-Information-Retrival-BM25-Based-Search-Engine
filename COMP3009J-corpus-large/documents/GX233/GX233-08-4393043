USTR ANNOUNCES ALLOCATION OF THE REFINED SUGAR AND SUGAR CONTAINING PRODUCTS TARIFF-RATE QUOTAS FOR 1999-2000 United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky today announced the allocation of the refined sugar and sugar containing products tariff-rate quotas by country today.
Ambassador Barshefsky announced that 25,000 metric tons (27,558 short tons) of the 60,000 metric tons (66,139 short tons) for refined sugar will be allocated to Mexico in order to fulfill obligations pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
As a result of an agreement reached with Canada, 10,300 metric tons (11,354 short tons) of refined sugar and 59,250 metric tons (65,312 short tons) of the tariff-rate quota for certain sugar-containing products maintained under "Additional U.S. Note 8 to chapter 17 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States" will be allocated to Canada.
Separately, an additional 2,954 metric tons (3,256 short tons) of refined sugar will be allocated to Mexico.
The remainder of the refined sugar tariff-rate quota will be available on a first-come, firstserved basis, including the 14,656 metric tons (16,155 short tons) reserved for specialty sugars.
The remainder of the sugar-containing products tariff-rate quota will be available for other countries.
Under the NAFTA, the United States is to provide total access for raw and refined sugar from Mexico of 25,000 metric tons, raw value, for this quota period in conjunction with Mexico's net surplus producer status.
Once the raw sugar tariff-rate quota has been established, this allocation is subject to the condition that the total imports of raw and refined sugar from Mexico, combined, is not to exceed 25,000 metric tons raw value.
The allocation of the refined sugar and sugar containing products tariff-rate quotas to countries that are net importers of sugar are conditioned on receipt of the appropriate verifications.
Conversion factor: 1 metric ton = 1.10231125 short tons.
