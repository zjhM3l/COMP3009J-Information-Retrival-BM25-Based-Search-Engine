6.001.02 PROCEDURES AT THE HEARING

A public hearing means that no person may be excluded by the stewards unless he is a prospective witness, he creates a disturbance at the hearing, or there is reason to believe he will create a disturbance at the hearing.
The fact that a hearing is public does not obligate the stewards to announce in advance that a hearing is being held or the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing.
(2) Each person called to testify at a hearing may retain a lawyer or invite an advisor-observer of his choosing to be present at the hearing.
An advisor-observer may testify at the hearing.

(c) a steward with direct knowledge of the events leading to the charge from his own personal observation shall provide any such information as a witness and shall not participate as one of the hearing officers;

In the event of malfunction of recording equipment, an appeal by a charged person of an adverse decision will be de novo.

(4) At the election of the stewards any and all of the procedures set forth in paragraphs (1) and (3) may be followed at any stewards hearing.
6.003 ADDITIONAL HEARING PROCEDURES WHERE CHARGE IS RELATED TO RUNNING OF RACE AND PENALTY IMPOSED IS SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE
In a hearing directly related to the running of a race where a license suspension or revocation is imposed, the hearing rights set forth in Rule 6.002 are applicable, except that a steward with direct knowledge of the events leading to the charge from his own personal observation of the running of the race may participate as one of the hearing officers.

7.002.02 PROCEDURES BEFORE COMMISSION
(1) A claim of violation must be made in writing, signed by the person alleging the violation, and filed with the Racing Commission within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and state and national holidays, after the alleged violation.
The claim must state the time and place of the alleged violation, the name and licensee status of the person who committed the alleged violation, the names of any witnesses to the circumstances constituting the alleged violation, and the particular rule alleged to have been breached.
The filed statement must also include sufficient discussion of the alleged violation for the Commission to understand the nature of the claim that the rule willfully was breached.

(1) With regard to the performance of any discretionary act under the rules, the Commission shall not substitute its judgment for that of the official directly involved.

Any claim that alleges only the failure to find contraband or evidence shall be dismissed without hearing.
(3) If the Commission concludes that as a matter of law an interpretation of a rule was in error or that there was clear error in the application of a rule, the Commission may issue a ruling providing the interpretation of the rule that is to be followed or proscribing certain conduct undertaken pursuant to that rule.
(4) In any hearing under this rule the Racing Commission shall also consider whether a claim was made in willful bad faith or was so frivolous as to demonstrate a claimant's grossly negligent disregard for proper procedure.
If the Commission so finds, it may impose against the claimant a fine, license suspension or revocation, or any other penalty it decides is appropriate.
7.002.05 PENALTIES
(1) The Commission under this chapter has the authority to impose any penalty or disciplinary sanction it deems appropriate, including a fine, dismissal or suspension from employment of a Commission employee, and license suspension or revocation.

9.001.30C In cases of emergency, a horse shipping into the state may be allowed one (1) start on lasix prior to arrival of documentation from other said state, if the stewards are satisfied that the horse is a certified bleeder in said other state by virtue of telephone communication with appropriate officials in that state.

9.002.02 Any horse which has drawn a position in a race and enters again on the next day that entries are taken shall be termed an "in-today" horse.

Allowances are optional as to all or any part thereof, and in overnight events must be claimed at the time of entry.

9.004.04 No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved from extra weight for having been beaten in one or more races, but this rule shall not prohibit maiden allowance or allowances to horses that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of specified value.
9.004.05 Failure to claim a weight allowance by oversight or omission is not cause of disqualification.

9.004.07 No horse shall incur a weight penalty for placement from which he is disqualified, but a horse placed through the disqualification of another horse shall incur the weight penalties of that placement.
No such placement shall make a horse ineligible to a race which has already been run.
