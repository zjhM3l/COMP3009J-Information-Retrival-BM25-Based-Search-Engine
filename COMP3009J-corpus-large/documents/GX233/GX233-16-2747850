Zone width is normally 50 feet, but varies according to site.
Succession (or ecological succession)-the process in which communities of plant and animal species in a particular area are replaced over time by a series of different and usually more complex communities; when no previous vegetation exists on a site, the process is called primary succession; when a site supported vegetation previously but was disturbed, the process is called secondary succession.
