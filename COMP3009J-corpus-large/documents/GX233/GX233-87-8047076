Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (Note: see also Caregiving and Aging Issues and Caregiver Resources) Alzheimer's and related dementia, and the debilitating effects of other chronic diseases, are primary causes of the rapid increase in demand for long term care services.
Perhaps more than any other disabling condition, Alzheimer's Disease affects the quality of life of family caregivers.
The prevalence of dementia and its widespread impact is a leading cause for public advocacy to increase federal support of basic research on its causes, and through states and voluntary agencies, home, community and residential services.
