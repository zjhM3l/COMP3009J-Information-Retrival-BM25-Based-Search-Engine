BIRDS PROTECTED BY THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT Species Protected by Each Migratory Bird Convention The United States has entered into four international migratory bird conventions (with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia).
Each of these conventions provides protection to a select group of species.
The Canadian convention identifies protected groups by Family or species group names (for example, Anatidae, Rallidae, loons, warblers, and so forth).
The Mexican convention identifies protected groups by Family names.
The Japanese and Russian conventions identify protected species in Appendices to the conventions.
The following list identifies those species protected by each of the conventions.
