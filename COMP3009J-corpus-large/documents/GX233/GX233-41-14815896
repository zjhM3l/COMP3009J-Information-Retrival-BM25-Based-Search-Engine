Jobs First - Connecticut's Welfare Reform Program Background and History of Welfare Reform in Connecticut
[Table of Contents]
In November 1994, Connecticut elected gubernatorial candidate John G. Rowland to office.
Governor-elect Rowland worked during the transition period to move forward a series of new welfare reforms which had been outlined in his campaign's ten point plan, "Turning Welfare Rolls Into Payrolls."
Once in office in January 1995, Governor Rowland embarked upon a major renovation of the welfare system in Connecticut to restore this program to what it was intended - a stop-gap safety net, not a way of life.
The goal of the program now is to move recipients off of welfare and into the work force.
The new program is built on the philosophy that it is better to work than to be on welfare and that welfare should be a temporary program.
In June 1995, the Connecticut Legislature passed welfare reform legislation which included many of the Governor's recommendations.
This legislation instituted significant and fundamental change in Connecticut's welfare program.
The emphasis of the legislation was on making welfare a short term support by requiring participation in the labor market as early as possible.
Employment became the centerpiece of the cash assistance program.
Certain provisions of this welfare reform could be implemented under existing federal regulations and did not need federal approval.
These changes were implemented in July and November 1995.
The July changes included elimination of a $50 excess rent special need payment for families whose shelter costs were equal to or greater than 50% of their income; reduction in the basic benefit amount by six and a half percent; and treating a portion of a housing subsidy as income.
The November changes focused on the redesign of the Job Connection policy which emphasizes quick placement into employment.
At the time, Connecticut had a waiver under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act to operate its existing welfare reform program, "A Fair Chance".
In order to implement the new welfare reform program, Connecticut submitted a request to the federal government to modify its previously approved waiver.
The completed request to waive federal regulations was submitted to the federal government on August 4, 1995.
On December 20, 1995 the U.S. Department accepted the approval of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the demonstration project "Reach for Jobs First."
On January 1, 1996, Connecticut's new time limited program was implemented.
The "Reach for Jobs First" demonstration project ended on September 30, 2001.
Following the passage of Federal welfare reform legislation in August, 1996, the Governor submitted the first State Plan to the Department of Health and Human Services defining the state's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
Connecticut took the option for an accelerated effective date under the provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, making Connecticut eligible for federal funding under the new block grant program.
This federal law gives states vast latitude in the design of their public assistance programs.
The Connecticut General Assembly passed Public Act 97-2 in the June 18, Special Session.
This legislation created the JOBS FIRST program, which is the public assistance program with a time limit, employment services requirements and a Safety Net component.
The program continues to focus on employment but also provides a Safety Net to certain families who lose eligibility at the end of the time limit.
This program was implemented July 1, 1997.
