Overview Introduction Proposals to Strengthen Public Protection Efforts and Improve Operational Efficiencies Significant Accomplishments and Major Milestones Legislation and Regulation Changes to California Pharmacy Law
BOARD OF PHARMACY
O VERVIEW
Ov ervie w INTRODUCTION
T
he Board of Pharmacy (or "board") is a consumer protection agency, charged with protecting the state's consumers with respect to prescription drugs and devices.
The board has 12 major regulatory programs that regulate both the individuals and firms that ship, store, and dispense prescription drugs and devices to the state's health care providers and patients.
This is an enormously large area of the state's economy.
In 1999, retail spending in California for prescription drugs was $9.3 billion alone.1 In the next two years, use of prescription drugs is expected to skyrocket.
Nationally, estimates are that between 1990 and 1999 the number of prescriptions dispensed in non-hospital settings increased by 44 percent, from 1.9 billion to 2.8 billion.
However by 2004, the number of prescriptions dispensed is expected to exceed 4 billion.
This growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed directly impacts the board's workload in terms of the number of applicants, licensees, complaints, and public inquiries.
Moreover, this growth in prescription volume has and will result in a huge shortage of pharmacists, directly impacting the profession, the board as a regulator and the patients and health care providers who need prescription drugs readily available.
A December 2000 Report to Congress Â­ The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Pharmacists reported a national average of 71 pharmacists per 100,000 people.
However, California has an average of only 59 pharmacists per 100,000 people.
Moreover, a 44 percent growth occurred in prescription volume between 1992 and 1998.
This growth outpaced the increase in both the general population (7 percent) and the number of active pharmacists (12 percent).
Over the past several decades, health care has undergone a continuous period of revolutionary change.
Likewise, the practice of pharmacy has rapidly evolved in new directions as well.
The result is intense pressure upon the board to change, to anticipate and certainly react to emerging issues, increasingly to seek legislative and regulation changes that will assure patient care, confidence and availability of prescription medication in the prescription drug delivery system.
The board has also met this challenge in a number of additional ways, to develop new methods for licensing and enforcing our laws, and in increasing the knowledge of patients about their medications and the role of the board.
Since the board's first sunset review six years ago, the board has evolved into a stronger 1 According to Prescription Drug Use and Expenditures in California, Key Trends and Drivers, California HealthCare Foundation, April 2001.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
O VERVIEW
agency and has been increasingly successful in fulfilling its mandate of consumer protection.
For example, since 1996 (among its many accomplishments): The board's public education and outreach efforts have produced two national awards in the last six years.
The board sponsored and implemented groundbreaking legislation to reduce medication errors, for which the board has won another national award and which at least one other state has used as its model to address prescription errors.
The board adopted regulations to enforce the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act.
The board has significantly reduced investigation and case closure times.
The board sponsored and is implementing legislation to dramatically increase the licensing requirements and standards of practice for pharmacies compounding sterile drugs.
The board reorganized and modernized its licensing act and regulations.
This report will describe the board's activities over the past six years and its future plans.
Pharmacy Trends Pharmacy is increasingly caught between twin (and frequently contradictory) trends.
The first is the dramatic increase in the volume of prescriptions.
The rapid increase in the number of prescriptions has focused much discussion on how the system will respond to this increase in prescription volume.
At the same time, pharmacists are increasingly valued for their clinical skill and expertise with drugs.
The employment of pharmacists in hospitals and other care settings to advise physicians on drug therapy and work directly with patients to optimize drug therapy is on the rise.
This leaves pharmacy with pressure from two opposite directions with growing demand for both dispensing activities and for their clinical expertise.
These twin pressures have driven (both in pharmacy and in health care generally) interest in automation, Internet technology, and electronic prescribing as means to address workforce shortages and increasing the quality and efficiency of pharmacy services.
In addition to accommodating increasing demand for dispensing and clinical services, pharmacy faces dramatic changes from other directions.
The recent and rapid growth of prescription drug benefit coverage introduces the complications of third party reimbursement and formularies, a surge in the number of new prescription medications, growing use of "alternative medications," direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs creating strong consumer demand for specific drugs, and growth in the number of health care professionals who can prescribe.
Meanwhile, cost containment and technological innovations in the broader health care system continues to move complex patient care from hospitals to office settings and into in-home care.
As a result, patients and their caregivers must learn more and more about their health care

and medication treatment plans.
Pharmacists play a key role in providing patients and their caregivers with information about their drug therapy.
These same trends have also placed a growing amount of confidential patient information in the hands of pharmacists and other health care practitioners.
Consumers have become sensitized to the use and sharing of such information, and patient privacy issues regarding the sharing of prescription information will grow.
The unauthorized sharing of confidential patient information with other entities or careless handling of patient information undermines the public's trust in pharmacy and health care in general, and violates California law.
The board will increasingly become involved in this area because of the growing public concern and the presence of extensive patient information in pharmacy data systems.
Pharmacists' Care The board promotes pharmacists' care as a model of practice.
Pharmacists' care is a comprehensive approach stressing the importance of pharmacists consulting with their patients, conducting patient profile reviews, managing drug dispensing and distribution, and collaborating with other health care providers.
The pharmacists' care model emphasizes increasing patients' knowledge about their medications and stresses the importance of patients maintaining their drug regimens in close consultation with pharmacists.
Pharmacy practice continues to evolve from the dispensing of prescription drugs and devices to the provision of pharmacists' care to patients.
Technology permits and encourages this shift in emphasis by facilitating the pharmacist's role in drug utilization and consultation.
And in the near future, technology will play an even more critical role in pharmacy as the demand for pharmacists' increases to meet the increasing demand for prescription drugs of an aging population, yet the supply of pharmacists is expected to grow at a substantially slower pace.
The role of the pharmacist as a member of the health care team must be relied upon to a greater extent than current practices dictate.
This requires continual update of pharmacy law to permit the pharmacist to manage the drug distribution process, focus on pharmacists' care and provide ever-greater patient services and education.
Patient Health Issues Nearly 50 percent of the billions of prescriptions dispensed annually are not taken appropriately, leading to increased health care costs and substandard therapy.
A study published in March 2001 found that drug-related illnesses cost the healthcare system over $177 billion per year in ambulatory settings, more than double the estimated amount of such costs in 1995.
And a projection of 4 billion prescriptions to be dispensed in 2004 creates an even greater incentive to improving patients' understanding of and compliance with drug regimens.
Finding effective methods to improve patient medication compliance to a prescribed drug regimen offers health care providers with one of the most dramatic and constructive

BOARD OF PHARMACY
O VERVIEW
ways to slow the increase in health care costs while improving patient outcomes.
Additionally increasing use of technology in the pharmacy is needed so that the pharmacist has the time necessary to perform pharmacists' care.
Prescription errors endanger public safety and confidence in the health delivery system.
According to a 1999 Institute of Medicine Report, there are 7,000 deaths nationwide due to prescription errors.
While perhaps not all prescription errors can be wholly eliminated, there is no acceptable error rate.
Prescription errors are the most common consumer complaint received by the board.
The board has responded to the focus on quality by sponsoring Senate Bill 1339 (Figueroa, Chapter 177, Statutes of 2000) that requires pharmacies to implement quality assurance programs designed to reduced medication errors.
Pharmacies must now engage in documented continuous quality improvement efforts, which will reduce the frequency of medication errors and provide a model for pharmacies to improve all aspects of their operations.
The Board The board has a highly complex regulatory structure with almost 76,000 licensees in 12 regulatory programs, and staff resources are not sufficient to provide consumer protection at desired levels.
There are 6,124 pharmacy sites and 710 clinics to be inspected.
Additionally there are 30,962 registered pharmacists, 3,674 interns and another 31,235 pharmacy technicians regulated by the board.
Finally, there are over 1,300 other sites registered in California by the board, many of which require periodic inspections.
Fiscal Year 2001/02 Pharmacy Licensee Population Total Licensees 75,552 Interns 4.9% Pharmacy Technicians 41.3% Pharmacists 41.0%
Compounding Pharmacies 0.00% Veterinary Retailers 0.02% Non-Resident Pharmacy 0.2% Out of State Distributors 0.4% Clinics 0.9% W holesalers 0.7%

Consumers have the right to expect that those to whom the responsibility of prescribing and dispensing drugs is authorized, are knowledgeable and are not influenced by profit or affected by impairment.
Enforcement, including the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes, remains the board's major public protection priority and commands the majority of board resources.
However, specialized programs used to target pharmacies suspected of illicit activities are not optimally operating due to limited staff resources.
Because of the dynamism in pharmacy, the board must continue to change the way it provides consumer protection and its services to licensees.
It also needs to develop alternative, less costly methods for securing compliance with pharmacy law.
To do this, the board needs highly trained and dedicated staff that is adept at responding to change based on the direction of decisive and visionary board members acting in the public interest.

PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC PROTECTION EFFORTS AND IMPROVE OPER ATIONAL EFFICIENCIES TO BETTER SERVE CONSUMERS AND LICENSEES The Board of Pharmacy has a number of strategic activities it will pursue over the next few years to advance consumer protection, pharmacists' care and to attain the board's mission and vision.
These activities are detailed in the board's strategic plan.
Among these activities are certain key initiatives that are highlighted below:
Communication and Public Education Restore two associate governmental program analyst positions lost because of the state's budget deficit in 2002/03.
These positions are necessary for program support and to resume the board's award winning public outreach program, quarterly publication of the board's newsletter, annual publication of Health Notes, and interactive website.
Licensing Use the national examination [North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX)] to remove an unnecessary administrative barrier to the practice of pharmacy in California while maintaining a high standard of competence that consumers expect from their pharmacists.
Address pharmacy manpower issues to ensure patient access to pharmacists' care and prescription services.
This will include the expansion of the pharmacist's control over ancillary personnel and review and modification of the registration program for pharmacy technicians including qualifications, national certification and expanded duties.
Authorize the use of technology that allows for the accurate dispensing of medication with quality assurance review and oversight by the pharmacist, biometric authentication, and e-signature.
Explore the feasibility of specialized pharmacy licenses and practice standards to address evolving trends in areas such as sterile compounding, long-term care, correctional facilities, ambulatory care settings that provide inpatient services, nuclear pharmacy, correctional facilities, and pharmacies operated remotely by a pharmacist offsite.
Expand automation capabilities to provide on-line, real time application status information, on-line renewal of licenses, and application submissions and credit card payments of fees.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC PROTECTION EFFORTS AND IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES
Enforcement Create and fund a high-level chief of enforcement position to oversee and manage the board's complex and diverse enforcement program and four supervising inspectors.
Mandate periodic inspections of all pharmacies and other board-licensed sites with appropriate staffing levels to meet this mandate.
Eliminate the triplicate prescription requirement for Schedule II controlled substances and expand the current electronic tracking of Schedule II controlled substances (CURES) to Schedules III-V to prevent drug diversion and improve patient care through better pain management.
Implement the 800 number on the board's revised "Notice to Consumers" that must be posted in all pharmacies and obtain staffing necessary to respond to consumer inquiries and complaints timely.
Obtain the requested resources to proactively investigate and prosecute pharmacies for violating Internet provisions by dispensing prescription drugs to patients who did not receive a good faith medical examination or lack legitimate prescriptions.
Organizational Development Reinstate four positions lost because of the state's budget deficit in 2002/03.
These positions are vital to the board's operations and service to the public and licensees (the two public education positions, and two consumer assistance technicians).
Receive repayment of $6 million loan (or portion thereof) from the General Fund by July 1, 2003, or a fee increase will be necessary to continue operations as will an increase in the statutory maximum fees.
The board will need to hold a regulation hearing to increase fees at its January 2003 board meeting in order to implement higher fees by July 1, 2003.
Without the repayment of the loan or fee increase, the board has a $2.4 million gap between its revenue and expenditures in 2003/04.
Obtain a budget realignment of $530,000 for 2002/03 and $618,000 ongoing.
This realignment is necessary to provide funding to budget areas that have been underfunded in prior years, but which were partially funded from salary savings from unfilled inspector positions or redirected from other budget areas.
Specifically: Printing Postage AG's Office Personnel $60,000 for 2002/03, $158,000 ongoing $75,000 for 2002/03 and ongoing $262,000 for 2002/03 and ongoing $132,700 for temporary help, proctors and overtime 2002/03 and ongoing
Obtain use of a new computer system that provides for the tracking of licensing, enforcement, application and cashiering data with the ability to image documents, to replace current system that has been in place in the Department of Consumer Affairs for at least 18 years.

Significant Accomplishments and Major Mil e stones 1997 to Present 1997 Sunset recommendations released as SB 827, Chapter 759 add one public member to the board's composition (enacted), remove the mandate that board inspectors be pharmacists (not enacted), authorize the use of in-house attorneys to prosecute disciplinary cases (not enacted), and continue board operations with a sunset date of 2004.
Board provides $1 million to fund the implementation of AB 3042, Takasugi, Statutes of 1996 a pilot study to electronically monitor Schedule II controlled substances in California (called CURES).
Board-sponsored legislation (SB 1349, Senate Business and Professions Committee) updates pharmacy law to current practice; more than 75 substantive changes are made to California pharmacy law in this major initiative.
Two-year limited funding for the board's public education and consumer outreach program begins.
Veterinary Food-Animal Retailers licensure program is implemented requiring specialized site licenses and licenses to specially qualified individuals who pass a board-developed exam.
Advocate board positions and amendments into 16 legislative bills that affect the practice of pharmacy.
Nine regulation proposals are considered by the board and six regulation changes are adopted.
An emergency regulation is adopted to permit students enrolled in a pharmacy technician-training program to obtain the required practical experience in a pharmacy.
Department of Consumer Affairs conducts an Internal Affairs investigation of the Board of Pharmacy based on anonymous complaints alleging mismanagement and criminal activity.
(See 1998 Significant Accomplishments for the investigation results.)
The California State Auditor completes its financial audit of the board and issues three findings pertaining primarily to the Department of Consumer Affairs; the board is found to be in general compliance.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND MAJOR MILESTONES
1997
continued
Board convenes roundtable discussion on independent prescribing authority for pharmacists.
Board sponsors a public presentation on pharmacy benefit management and its impact on patient care.

Board Committees Overview of the Board Committees Communication and Public Education Committee Licensing Committee Legislation and Regulation Committee Enforcement Committee Organizational Development Committee
Board Committees OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S COMMITTEES The Board of Pharmacy is overseen by an 11-member board, whose members are appointed by the Governor and Legislature.
The board's operations and activities are guided by its strategic plan, which is revised each year with the active partnership of all board members and staff.
Strategic planning and management are integral to the board's operations and successes.
The board's strategic plan establishes five standing committees through which the board articulates its goals and organizes its activities in pursuit of ensuring public health, safety and welfare, and to assure the provision of quality pharmacists' care.
These five committees develop policy related to a board mission-related goal.
This section of the Sunset Report describes the five committees, their major accomplishments and the major changes undertaken since the last sunset review.
The board formally organized itself into this committee structure during 1997/98.
The board's committees are: Communication and Public Education Licensing Enforcement Legislation and Regulation Organizational Development Each of these committees is comprised of at two board members (Enforcement currently has three) and staff members who provide technical and administrative input and support.
The committees are an important venue for ensuring that staff and board members share information and perspectives in crafting and implementing strategic objectives.
The board's committees allow board members and staff to discuss and conduct problem solving on issues related to the board's strategic goals.
They also allow the board to consider options for implementing components for the strategic plan.
The committees are charged with coordinating board efforts to reach board goals and achieving positive results on its performance measures.
The board president appoints board members to committees and designates one of the board members as the committee's chairperson.
The chairperson coordinates the committee's work and ensures progress toward the board's priorities.
35
BOARD OF PHARMACY
B OA RD C OMMIT T E E S
The committees refer policy decisions to the full board for a formal decision and vote.
During this discussion, the public is encouraged to provide comments during the same segment as when the board discusses the issues for the first time as well as any subsequent discussions during board meetings.
At each board meeting, one of the board's committees holds a public meeting to encourage input and comment.
Over the year, each committee has at least one such public committee meeting typically in conjunction with a board meeting; however, in 2002 public meetings of some committees began being held as stand-alone meetings -- typically the Enforcement and Licensing Committees hold their meetings this way.
During the public committee meeting, comments from the public are strongly sought, and the meetings themselves are frequently public forums on specific issues before a committee.
36
Communicat ion and Public Educat ion Committee Goal : Proactively provide relevant information to consumers and pharmacists.
VISIONARY LEADERSHIP Â­ SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLIS H MEN T S Â­ MAJOR CHANGE S
COMMITTEE OVERVIEW The board has a public outreach program to advise consumers about the board and its consumer protection purpose, educate consumers about how to take their prescription medication appropriately, the health benefits or risks for compliance (or noncompliance) with drug regimens, and what questions consumers should understand before they take prescription or over-the-counter medications.
The board has a diversity of consumer education materials, some in multiple languages.
There is also a component to upgrade the knowledge of board licensees, and keep them advised about pharmacy law and board policies.
The importance and structure of the board's public outreach program is described in the Board Committees section of this report under the Communications and Public Education Committee.
An excerpt of this description is repeated on the next two pages.
The board has twice won national awards for its public education program.
In 1999, the board won the Paul G. Rogers Award from the National Council for Patient Information and Education for outstanding leadership in the development, production, and dissemination of educational public services.
The board's program was noted for its focus to enhance consumers' understanding of the value of high quality communication about medication, and the development and advancement of public policy to support improved medication communication.
In 1997, the board won the Fred T. Mahaffey Board of the Year Award from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy for the state pharmacy board demonstrating outstanding leadership in protecting the public.
The board's communications and outreach program is divided into the following components: Health Notes, which is a compendium of up-to-date treatment methodologies and issues on a specific health care topic, published in a newsletter format for pharmacists and useful to other health care providers as well as to the public; Brochures, fact sheets, and newspaper columns to educate consumers about how to take their medications, the role of the board, how to file a complaint and health columns based on excerpts from Health Notes and other consumer brochures and health care issues;
37
BOARD OF PHARMACY
C OMMUNICATION AND P UBLIC E DU C A TION C OMMI TT E E
Public forums, including those where the board works with local activists to arrange health fairs, staffed by pharmacists to respond to patients' inquiries and covered by local media to disseminate the board's message to a wide audience; and Online availability of board publications to the public, licensees, and applicants at the board's Website (www.pharmacy.ca.gov).
The board has other public information functions, specifically: Producing four newsletters annually for licensees, advising them of new laws and regulations, board policies, compliance issues, and disciplinary actions taken by the board.
Responding to press inquiries, which are becoming an ever-growing source of workload.
Primary areas of inquiry in recent years have been the purchase of drugs over the Internet, patient privacy of prescription records, the number of prescription errors made by pharmacists, and the three patient deaths in 2001 due to a pharmacy's negligence in compounding medications.
Program Funding Six years ago, the board implemented its public outreach program through a series of four budget change proposals (BCPs).
Four BCPs were required because only a portion of the program was approved in any year, and then on a limited-term basis, and generally without any staff to perform the duties.
Finally in July 2001, the board received one staff position in the budget; however, the October 2001 hiring freeze blocked the board's ability to fill the position (an individual had been interviewed but had not yet been offered the position), and the position will likely be lost due to cost cutting to reduce the state's deficit.
The board's public outreach is substantially impacted by the lack of this staff position, specifically in terms of the public outreach events the board coordinates and/or attends, and the board's ability to develop new consumer materials that responds to emergent issues.
The outreach events are important to the board to directly reach consumers face-to-face.
But to extend the board's efforts to a much wider audience, the board seeks cosponsorship of public information fairs from local media.
By so doing, the board is able to obtain media coverage before, during and after the event, reaching a much wider audience than just those who attend the information fairs (such as "Talk to a Pharmacist" events).
The board was highly successful in co-sponsoring these fairs during the late 1990s principally because two board members spent considerable time in coordinating the events.
Without staff to coordinate these events, the board cannot and has not been able to co-sponsor them in the last two years.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
C OMMUNICATION AND P UBLIC E DU C A TION C OMMI TT E E
Public Education Public education is an essential element in the board's ability to provide for public protection.
To do this the public needs to know that the Board of Pharmacy exists, that it is a consumer protection agency that will assist them with jurisdictional complaints, and most importantly needs to be contacted about the questionable behavior or practices of any board licensee.
Moreover, the board's public outreach program serves a second important function; for example, to educate consumers about pharmacy issues important to their health, how to take their prescription medications appropriately, and how to minimize their risks of medication errors.
The only way the board can provide optimal consumer protection is to assure that patients know the importance of following their prescribed drug therapy and how to advocate for their own interests and health in dealing with prescription drugs.
The board wholeheartedly agrees with a conclusion of the Little Hoover Commission in November 1998 in supporting the need for consumer education: "To be sure, government cannot pretend or aspire to protect all consumers in every transaction.
That reality is among the reasons why consumer education is the best protection" Little Hoover Commission, 1998.
The need for ongoing public education is essential for consumer protection in any area, but it is perhaps most necessary in the health care field where consumer protection has life saving benefits.
The board has a number of consumer materials available to the public to educate and advise them about important issues.
In 2002 the board adopted regulation changes to its "Notice to Consumers," a collection of information which must be posted in every pharmacy or printed on a customer receipt.
The revised information focuses on the questions patients should understand before taking any prescription medication.
The board believes that by posting this information in a pharmacy where patients can see it, they will be better able to ask the questions they need to ask to take their medication more efficaciously.
Information / Education to Licensees The board's newsletter, The Script, is highly valued by board licensees for its informative articles on pharmacy practice.
After the last sunset review, the board's priority was to produce this newsletter quarterly.
Until the retirement of the editor in December 2001, this occurred with several exceptions.
However, the hiring freeze established in October 2001 has left the board unable to fill this position, and the board's existing staff will strive to produce at least one newsletter annually until the board is permitted to restore the position.
The loss of momentum in producing this publication quarterly is a substantial disappointment to the board.
Health Notes monographs provide the board a unique method to educate pharmacists about current drug therapy for specific diseases and conditions.
Since the initial publication of "Pain Management" in 1996, the board has produced five more Â­ "Women's Health," "Anticoagulation Therapy," "Care of Children and Adults with Developmental Disabilities," "Alternative Medicines," and "Quality Assurance Programs."
The board will
39
BOARD OF PHARMACY
C OMMUNICATION AND P UBLIC E DU C A TION C OMMI TT E E
publish in early 2003 a seventh issue on "Geriatrics."
These issues also provide pharmacists with a means to obtain continuing education credit by submission of an examination of the monograph's content, enabling the board a method to ensure licensees learn this information.
The information is also valuable to patients with an interest in the topic.
Additionally the board will produce special consumer articles excerpted from these monographs once a public outreach staff person is hired.
Website The board unveiled a redesigned and much more complex Website early in 2000, which among a number of other features offered a direct link with the Board of Pharmacy by which the public could contact the board's staff with general questions via the Internet.
However, the board dismantled this link after the October 2001 hiring freeze because the board lacked the staff to maintain it.
Once the freeze is removed and the board can fill its positions, the board will restore this interactive function.
The board receives over one million hits per year on its website (1.6 million hits in 2001/02) and nearly 300,000 hits on its license verification feature.
New Consumer Materials In 2000, the board produced a brochure for the public on SB 393 (Speier, Chapter 946, Statutes of 1999) that requires pharmacies to sell prescription drugs at Medi-Cal prices to Medicare patients who pay out of pocket for the medication.
This brochure has received widespread distribution, reflecting the strong interest of the public in reducing their prescription drug costs.
In 2002, the board will produce a patient fact sheet on emergency contraception that was required by SB 1169 (Alpert, Chapter 900, Statutes of 2001).
The board will absorb the workload and resources needed to develop this fact sheet since the budget change proposal to provide funding was denied by the Department of Finance.
Also, later in 2002, the board will print and distribute a new "Notice to Consumers" that by board regulation must be posted in the pharmacy or printed on the customer's receipt.
The new notice contains the five questions patients should understand before taking any prescription medication, and will contain an 800 number for consumer inquiries to the board.
This information aids patients in better medication compliance and will be available to them while they are in the pharmacy Â­ where the information is needed.
In 1999, the board created a special task force to review patient compliance programs (where a pharmacy or other entity calls patients to remind them of the need to refill medication or switch to other drugs), the use of technology, and patients' privacy rights.
One product of this task force was an article published in the board's April 2000 issue of The Script on the confidentiality of pharmacy information.
The board will develop this article into another consumer factsheet.

Licensing Committee Go al: Ensure the professional qualifications of pharmacists and establish minimum standards for board-licensed facilities.
VISIONARY LEADERSHIP Â­ SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLIS H MEN T S Â­ MAJOR CHANGE S
COMMITTEE OVERVIEW Like the other board committees, the Licensing Committee began its meetings in 1997, and meets prior to each board meeting.
This committee meets with executive staff, supervising inspectors, and key licensing unit personnel.
This committee oversees the board's 12 major licensing programs that include about 76,000 licensees.
The tables in the back of this section list the committee meetings that have been held and the agenda topics that were discussed until 2002.
All committee-meeting summaries are provided to the board at each of its public meetings and at least one Licensing Committee meeting each year is a public meeting.
In early 2002, a third board member was appointed to this committee and until June 1 when board membership on the committee changed back to two members all meetings of the Licensing Committee have been public meetings (after July 1, the Licensing Committee returned to a two-board member composition.)
Additionally, last year the committee held five public meetings on pharmacy manpower.
The first issue addressed by the committee in 1997, was the delay in the processing of pharmacy applications.
This delay was due to the major changes to the application process to ensure better protection of the public.
The board needs to ascertain that it is not issuing a pharmacy permit to "hidden" owners for fraudulent purposes.
The board added and revised forms so that it could obtain more detailed financial information in order to conduct a more thorough review and investigation of applicants.
The committee also has addressed other licensing matters such as: restocking of ambulances; recycling of nursing home drugs; repackaging of prescription medications by another pharmacy upon the patient's request; authorizing pharmacies to deliver prescription medications to a non-pharmacy location when the patient is not present; and allowing pharmacists to take continuing education by other approved healthcare program providers.

USE OF THE NATIONAL E XAMINATION [NORTH AMERICAN PHARMACIST LICENSURE E XAMINATION (NAPLE X)] In January 2001, the Department of Consumer Affairs requested that the board explore the possibility of adopting the NAPLEX.
Periodic review of the NAPLEX has been an element in the board's strategic plan and subsequent to the department's request, the board commissioned an independent audit of the NAPLEX by experts in professional licensing exams.
The 2001 audit (see List of Reports in Part I of this report) found the NAPLEX to be a valid test of competence for entry to practice in pharmacy and that its development and administration conformed with requirements in California law for professional licensing examinations.
The results of the audit were presented at the July 2001 Board Meeting and the board voted to support legislation (with two dissenting votes) that would establish the NAPLEX as the licensing examination for pharmacists in California.
The board believes that adopting the NAPLEX will remove an unnecessary administrative barrier to the practice of pharmacy in California while maintaining the high standard of competence consumers have come to expect.
The current state exam restricts candidates to two opportunities to take the test each year, whereas the NAPLEX is offered year-round and reduces the waiting time for results from two months to days.
The NAPLEX is the accepted examination for pharmacists in every other state and preserving a separate examination in California strongly discourages pharmacy graduates in other states to seek a California license.
With the adoption of the doctor of pharmacy degree as the entry-level degree requirement by all U.S. pharmacy schools and the fact that all schools of pharmacy are held to the same standards and accredited by the same agency, the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education, there is no reason for California to continue its independent testing program.
However, as a condition of adopting the NAPLEX, the board also voted to support requiring pharmacy candidates to pass the Multi-State Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE).
This test would be developed by the board to address California specific aspects of pharmacy practice and pharmacy law.
The examination would be administered by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) through its testing network and would be available on a continuous basis at testing sites nationwide, but the board would retain the validation and scoring criteria for the exam.
Licensing Processes with NAPLEX Candidates for licensure as a pharmacist begin by applying to a state board for licensure.
The candidate then applies to the NABP to sit for the NAPLEX.
On the application to the test (submitted to NABP), the appropriate board is designated as the "primary state."
When NABP has a complete test application, the candidate's name is forwarded to board in the "primary state" who then determines if the candidate is qualified to take the examination under the applicable state law.
The mechanism for this communication is a weekly listing of those candidates who have applied to take the examination and the board then marks those candidates who are eligible to take the exam and returns the list to NABP.
Candidates who are not eligible are then rolled over to the next week's list.
50
B
OARD OF PHARMACY
L ICENSING C OMM I TTE E
Once the NABP receives notice that a candidate has been determined eligible to take the examination, it issues an Authorization to Test (ATT) form.
The candidate may schedule an appointment to take the test at his or her convenience after receiving the ATT form.
The test is administered at Prometric Testing Centers, which has approximately 300 testing centers nationwide, including 29 in California.
Examination results are sent to the NABP's testing contractor (The Chauncey Group which is a subsidiary of the Educational Testing Service) where the test is reviewed and subject to quality checks.
The results are then forwarded to the NABP for final review.
Test scores are available within three business days after taking the examination, which is substantially faster than possible with the board's current exam structure and process.
Final scores are then forwarded to both the candidate and the relevant state board.
If the candidate passes the examination, then he or she is required to complete the licensure process mandated by the state board.
If the candidate fails the examination, he/she may not take the examination again until after 91 days have elapsed.
Applications to retake the examination are subject to the same procedure as initial applications.
Multi-State Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) Application processing for the MPJE is essentially the same as that for the NAPLEX.
However, the MPJE is different because each individual state develops and submits its own questions for the MPJE examination.
The NABP requires 400-500 questions to develop the MPJE for each state, and new questions must be developed every year.
The questions need to conform to the set of competency statements developed by the NABP.
The NABP staff indicates that a California specific MPJE could be developed and implemented within six months.
License Transfer The NABP also provides a "license transfer" service for pharmacists.
Essentially, the NABP acts as a clearinghouse for license transfer information.
The NABP requires applicants to submit a range of information (including disciplinary history) and compiles a full transfer application.
Upon completion, the license transfer application is forwarded to the board requested by the applicant.
The board then evaluates the application and makes the determination regarding the issuance of a license.
The NABP makes no judgments or determinations regarding the issuance of a license.
Fees Adopting the NAPLEX and the MPJE would increase the fees for initial licensure.
Currently it costs those candidates taking only the California examination $270 ($155 exam fee, $115 license fee) to take the exam and obtain a license.
Adopting the NAPLEX would increase that to $760 ($360 NAPLEX fee, $130 MPJE fee, $155 exam fee, $115 license fee), which is a 281 percent increase.
This fee increase is mitigated by several factors.
First, the NAPLEX is a 4.25 hour exam, as opposed to the current board exam that is nine hours spread over two days.
For those
51

OARD OF PHARMACY
L ICENSING C OMM I TTE E
candidates who do not live near the San Francisco Bay Area, taking the exam also requires the cost of food, travel, and an overnight stay in a hotel.
Those travel costs apply for most candidates and are at least $200, and costs exceeding $400 are entirely reasonable.
The NAPLEX is given in one day and with 29 testing centers in California alone; it is difficult to imagine a candidate who could not easily drive to a testing center for the exam.
This eliminates the food, hotel, and most travel costs associated with the current California exam.
JOB ANALYSIS -- CALIFORNIA PHARMACIST LICENSURE E XAMINATION In 2001, the Board of Pharmacy (through its Competency Committee) conducted a job analysis of pharmacist practices, which is required as part of the validation process for the pharmacist licensure examination.
The Competency Committee developed a questionnaire that was mailed to over 2,000 pharmacists throughout California.
Half of the surveys went to pharmacists licensed more than five years, and the other half to pharmacists licensed less than five years.
The committee received over 900 responses, which were used to compile a new content outline.
The committee used the content outline to revise the examination and develop new questions.
The revised format was administered in June 2001.
The next job analysis is planned for 2004.
PHARMACY MANPOWER TASK FORCE -- A WORKING GROUP TO ENSURE PATIENT ACCESS TO PHARMACIST'S CARE AND PRESCRIPTION SERVICES The California State Board of Pharmacy conducted a series of five Manpower Task Force Meetings throughout the state during calendar year 2001.
The purpose of the task force was to address the pharmacist shortage in California and generate a set of proposed solutions to be submitted to the board for review and action.
All task force meetings were open to the public.
The task force issued its final report in November 2001 and the board considered the recommendations at its January 2002 board meeting.
The task force was comprised of 15 members that included two board members who were also members of the Licensing Committee.
The 15-member task force included representatives from the four California schools of pharmacy, the California Pharmacists Association, the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists, three pharmacist labor organizations Â­ the Guild for Professional Pharmacists, the California Employee Pharmacists Associations, and the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 324, the California Retailers Association, the California Association of Health Plans and a consumer member.
The task force considered 27 proposed solutions and made recommendations on all but 11.
Through its Licensing Committee, the board reviewed the recommendations and took some type of action on each proposed solution, such as adding the proposed solution to its strategic plan for 2002/03, taking a support position on the proposal (which could require legislation for implementation), or pursuing a regulation change.

LICENSURE OF STERILE COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES Due to three patient deaths and significant harm to 33 others in mid Torlakson and Figueroa sponsored legislation (SB 293, Chapter 827, strengthen the board's ability to regulate pharmacies that compound medications.
These patients were harmed when they were injected contaminated steroid that resulted in them contracting meningitis.
2001, Senators Statutes of 2001) to sterile injectable with a bacteria-
The legislation requires pharmacies that compound injectable sterile drugs to obtain a special pharmacy license and comply with the standards developed by the board.
The law also prohibits pharmacies from undertaking sterile compounding until the board has inspected them and has found the facilities, equipment, processes, and training must meet California standards to ensure the safety of the pharmacy's medications.
The licensure and standards requirements are to become effective no later than July 1, 2003, or earlier should the board adopt the standards sooner.
The board released a draft of the proposed standards at its January 2002 board meeting and held an informational hearing on them at the board's April 2002 meeting.
Due the comprehensiveness and complexity of the proposed regulations, the Licensing Committee held another informational hearing at its committee meeting on June 24, 2002, and another informational hearing at the July 2002 board meeting.
The board's proposed standards are set for a regulation hearing in October 2002.
To implement the program, the Department of Finance approved an augmentation of $309,000 for 2002/03 and $272,000 ongoing for one supervising inspector, one inspector, one technician, and operating expenses.
Securing the needed staffing for this additional and significant program was difficult due to the state's budget deficit for fiscal year 2002/03.
CENTR AL REFILL PHARMACY California was the first state to authorize the refill of prescriptions at a central pharmacy location.
To allow this practice, the board adopted a regulation that became effective in 1999.
A pharmacy can contract with other pharmacies to refill prescriptions at a central, highly automated location and then return the filled prescription to the original pharmacy for dispensing to the patient.
The regulation specifies the conditions that both pharmacies must meet to ensure patient safety.
The board initiated activities to update pharmacy law to allow central refill to take place.
These central refill centers are highly automated and fill thousands of prescriptions daily.
LICENSING PROGR AM CHANGES Pharmacy Technicians Several changes have been made to the pharmacy technician program since its implementation in 1992 and since the board's 1996 sunset review.
Now all pharmacy technicians must be registered in order work in a community or hospital pharmacy setting.
The initial legislation
53
B
OARD OF PHARMACY
L ICENSING C OMM I TTE E
only required registration for community pharmacy technicians.
The licensing requirements were changed to require either graduation from high school or a GED certificate.
Pharmacy technician students enrolled in a technician training program operated by a California public postsecondary education institution or by a private postsecondary vocation institution approved by the Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education may complete a 120-hour externship in a community or hospital pharmacy as a "trainee" during a 12-month period.
Medical Device Retailer Program Through legislation, the Board of Pharmacy agreed to transfer the medical device retailer program to the Department of Health Services.
This program required that a facility be licensed if it dispensed "dangerous devices."
Dangerous devices require a prescription from a prescriber to be dispensed to a patient.
Sponsors of the legislation wanted to expand the scope of the licensure program to include a broader spectrum of medical supplies (not just those that require a prescription) in an effort to combat fraud.
This transfer took effect on July 1, 2001.
Wholesalers / Exemptees A business that wholesales prescription drugs and/or prescription devices to pharmacies and other licensed health professionals or entities must be licensed with the board.
The wholesale facility must place in charge of the operations either a licensed pharmacist or a person that is "qualified" as determined by the board.
Historically, the board determined that qualification by examining applicants on the law.
Moreover, the permit issued to the "exemptee" was issued to a specific wholesale location; it was not issued to the individual.
So if an exemptee's place of employment changed, a new license was needed.
In 2001, the board sponsored a legislative change to simplify the process.
The exemptee license is now issued to the individual; the individual must have at least a high school education or GED certificate, one year of paid experience related to the distribution of prescription drugs and prescription devices and have completed a training course specified by the board.
The wholesale facility also must designate an "exemptee-in-charge" who is responsible for the daily operations of the facility including compliance with pharmacy law.
The experience requirements replaced the examination of applicants for exemptee licenses as well.
The board also amended the definition of "wholesaler" to include a reverse distributor.
A reverse distributor is an entity who acts as an agent for pharmacies, wholesalers, manufacturers, and other entities by receiving, inventorying, and managing the disposition of outdated or nonsalable prescription drugs.
Mercury Fever Thermometers Legislation that became effective July 1, 2002, requires that a mercury fever thermometer may only be furnished pursuant to a prescription and requires that all entities (including pharmacies) that dispense these thermometers to obtain a hypodermic needle and syringe permit from the board.

Retired Pharmacist's License The board sponsored legislation to allow pharmacists seeking to retire from the practice of pharmacy (and without revoked licenses) to change their license status to retired.
An individual with a retired pharmacist license cannot practice as a pharmacist and must retake the licensure examination to restore his or her license to active status.
General Licensing Program Changes The Board of Pharmacy sponsored or supported additional legislation that made general changes to improve and strengthen the board's licensing programs.
These changes included: authority to cancel a license after 60 days for failure to renew a license (the exception is for a pharmacist's license which is cancelled after three years), implementation of Live Scan submission of fingerprint cards and federal background checks for all licensees, and authority to issue a temporary permit to an entity, and requirements that applicants for a pharmacist license must take 16 units of education in a school of pharmacy after they fail the licensure exam four times.

L e gisl at ion and Regul ation Committee Goal: Advocate legislation and promulgate regulations that advance the vision and mission of the Board of Pharmacy
VISIONARY LEADERSHIP Â­ SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLIS H MEN T S Â­ MAJOR CHANGE S
COMMITTEE OVERVIEW The committee's principal task is to shape legislation governing pharmacy practice to conform to the demands of a rapidly changing health care system while preserving consumer safety.
This task is complicated by the often-complex interplay of numerous state and federal laws that govern the distribution of prescription drugs (e.g., the Pharmacy Law, the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the United States Controlled Substances Act).
The rapid advance of health care technology (e.g., automation, communications, and clinical innovations), workforce issues (e.g., persistent shortage of pharmacists, geographic and socioeconomic imbalances in the distribution of pharmacies and pharmacists), demographic changes (e.g., aging population, rapidly increasing numbers of consumers from distinct racial, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds), and marketplace issues (e.g., consolidation, growth in chain pharmacies, direct-to-patient advertising of prescription medications, supermarket/mass marketer pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, rapidly rising drug costs, and rapid increases in prescription volumes) increase the complexity of the board's policymaking activities.
In formulating its policymaking agenda, the board recognized and built upon a growing body of literature that has highlighted the costs (both human and economic) of medication errors and that has demonstrated the value of pharmacist intervention in providing drug therapy both in terms of improved outcomes and increased cost effectiveness.
The passage of SB 1339 (Figueroa, Chapter 677) in 2000 (requiring pharmacies to establish quality assurance programs to evaluate prescription errors) and AB 826 (Cohn, Chapter 262) in 2001(allowing pharmacists to initiate prescription drug therapy under protocols with prescribers and to practice pharmacy wherever the pharmacist is, not just in a licensed facility) are both notable examples of the board's responses to these issues.
These measures reflect the multidimensional nature of consumer protection.
Consumer protection is cognizable as more than It includes devising and implementing prevention barriers to access to vital health care resources.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
L EGISLATIO N A N D R EG ULA T IO N C OM MIT T EE
In the last two years alone, the board has successfully sponsored significant legislation to make sweeping changes that benefit the provision of pharmacists' care to patients, fulfilling the board's vision of "Healthy Californians through Quality Pharmacists' Care."
The cumulative impact of this body of legislation has fundamentally restructured pharmacy for the future, and reflects magnitude of the board's commitment to visionary leadership.
In 2000, the board sponsored SB 1339 (Figueroa, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2000) to require pharmacies to implement a quality assurance program to prevent prescription errors from recurring and exempts quality assurance documents from discovery.
This legislation was pursued in response to the fact that prescription errors are the most common consumer complaint received by the board and growing evidence in the healthcare literature supported the development of "blame free" continuous quality improvement efforts.
The board initiated its quality assurance efforts in 1999 with a proposed regulation mandating quality assurance programs that received widespread opposition from the industry and profession.
That opposition was grounded in concerns that quality assurance documents would be used against pharmacies and pharmacists in civil suits arising from prescription errors.
In 2001, the board sponsored AB 826 (Cohn, Chapter 262, Statutes of 2001), which permits pharmacists to perform clinical and consulting functions outside a licensed pharmacy and to initiate a patient's drug therapy in all practice settings under protocol.
In 2001, the board sponsored SB 293 (Torlakson and Figueroa, Chapter 827, Statutes of 2001), which requires a separate license for any pharmacy that compounds injectable sterile drugs and requires the board to adopt standards for compounding injectable sterile drugs.
This bill was introduced in response to negligence in compounding medication that caused three deaths and multiple hospitalizations.
In 2000, the board sponsored AB 2018 (Thomson, Chapter 1092, Statutes of 2000) to make CURES (the electronic tracking of Schedule II controlled substances) permanent and eliminate the triplicate prescription requirement for Schedule II controlled substances.
However, these provisions were opposed strongly by law enforcement groups and the bill was amended instead to reform the process for issuing triplicates.
The changes removed several restrictions on the issuance of triplicates by the Department of Justice that had proven problematic.
In 2001, SB 340 (Speier, Chapter 631), sponsored by the board, allows a clinic eligible for participation in the federal 340B program to contract with a pharmacy to dispense 340B drugs to patients of the eligible clinic.
The 340B program permits non-profit clinics to purchase drugs for their patients at dramatic discounts and provide those drugs to their patients at reduced cost.
Contract pharmacy arrangements permit more clinics to participate in this program because many smaller clinics lack the resources to operate a drug dispensary.
In 2001, AB 809 (Salinas, Chapter 310), sponsored by the board, permits the use of automated dispensing devices by licensed clinics that are controlled and operated by an offsite pharmacist.

OTHER LEGISL ATIVE ACTIVITY In 1996, the board sponsored a technical reorganization and recodification of Pharmacy Law (AB 2802, Chapter 890, Statutes of 1996) to make it more coherent and eliminate archaic provisions.
That bill was followed by a substantive update of Pharmacy Law (SB 1349, Chapter 549, Statutes of 1997) that made over 75 different changes to align pharmacy law and current practice.
The committee has continued the effort to keep pharmacy law current with changes in the healthcare delivery system by participating in the omnibus bills sponsored by the Business and Professions Committee.
The annual omnibus measure provides an efficient means to perform ongoing maintenance of pharmacy law, and the board is grateful to the Business and Professions Committee for its commitment of valuable staff time and resources to author the omnibus bills.
In 2001, provisions in the omnibus bill sponsored by the board reshaped and restructured the licensing of exempt individuals who oversee drug wholesalers in place of a pharmacist.
In 2000, the board sponsored a conference on CURES to consider the direction of California's policy regarding the electronic monitoring of schedule II controlled substances.
Participants included federal and state law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, the legislature, professional health associations, consumers, pain management specialists, pain management advocates, and consumers.
This conference laid the groundwork for what was introduced as AB 2018.
This bill was a major board-sponsored effort to repeal the triplicate and implement CURES permanently as a prescription monitoring program modeled on the program operated by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy.
Also in 2000, the board supported AB 1496 (Olberg, Chapter 837) which transferred the medical device retailer program to the Department of Health Services.
2000 also witnessed the enactment of SB 1828 (Speier, Chapter 681), also supported by the board, which established a $25,000/violation fine for the illegal dispensing of drugs via the Internet.
In 2001, the board sponsored AB 108 (Strom-Martin) that would have adopted the national pharmacist examination (NAPLEX) in California.
However, the bill failed due to substantial industry opposition.
Assemblywoman Strom-Martin reintroduced the issue in 2002 as AB 2165.
In 2002, the board is sponsoring AB 2655 (Matthews) to extend the sunset date for CURES for five years and to permit provider access to CURES profiles for their patients.
REGUL ATIONS The board has followed similar modernization themes in its rulemaking activity.
However, by its nature, the rulemaking process is more reactive than the legislative process.
Nevertheless, the board was the first in the nation to adopt a rule permitting the development of central refill pharmacies.
Such pharmacies take refill requests from multiple storefront pharmacies and fill them at a central (usually highly automated) facility.
That central facility then returns the filled prescription to the storefront pharmacy for dispensing to the patient.

The board is also the first board in the department to adopt regulations to issue citations and fines for violations of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA).
The CMIA was amended by SB 19 (Chapter 526, Statutes of 1999) to permit agencies to impose penalties for its violations by administrative fine.
The board adopted this regulation in January 2002.
Other significant regulations promulgated by the board since the last sunset include: 1997 Adopted an emergency regulation to permit those enrolled in a pharmacy technician-training program to obtain practical experience in a pharmacy -- providing a means to obtain the experience required for registration as a pharmacy technician.
1998 Adopted emergency regulations, which mandated computerized pharmacies to implement the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).
Pharmacies that met the timeframe for implementing CURES (reporting the data electronically to the vendor) received a one-time license renewal fee reduction of $75.
1999 Adopted regulations to authorize the refill of prescriptions from other pharmacies at one centralized pharmacy location.
1999 Implemented the self-assessment regulation that required all pharmacies to perform a self-inspection of its facilities, aiding pharmacies in complying with federal and state pharmacy law.
The self-assessment must be performed every time a new pharmacy opens, when there is a change in the pharmacist-in-charge, and otherwise every two years.
1999 Adopted emergency regulations to permit the temporary absence of pharmacists from a pharmacy for breaks and lunch periods under new provisions of the Labor Code and orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission.
1999 Reduced fees to the levels that were in effect prior to July 1, 1995, because of the return of $5.4 million that was transferred to the state's General Fund in 1991/92.
2001 Adopted regulations to require every pharmacy to implement a quality assurance program to prevent prescription errors from reoccurring.
California was the first state in the nation to do this.
2002 Adopted a regulation that permits the board to issue a fine up to $25,000 for each violation of dispensing prescription drug via an Internet prescription and without a good faith medical examination by a prescriber.
2002 Adopted a regulation that permits the board to issue a fine up to $250,000 for each violation of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (Civil Code 56 et seq.).
2002 Adopted a regulation updating the Notice to Consumers posted in each pharmacy.
In 2002, the board will be considering regulations establishing standards for sterile compounding pursuant to SB 293 (Torlakson and Figueroa, Chapter 827, Statutes of 2001).
The board is currently preparing a rulemaking to reorganize and make technical updates to existing board regulations.
This rulemaking will be submitted as a "Section 100" filing that allows technical corrections but not substantive changes to existing regulations.

Enforcement Committee Go al: Exercise oversight on all pharmacy activities.
VISIONARY LEADERSHIP Â­ SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLIS H MEN T S Â­ MAJOR CHANGE S
COMMITTEE OVERVIEW The Enforcement Committee oversees all enforcement activities of the board; these activities are essential for the board to meet its consumer protection mandate.
Enforcement is a board priority both in terms of funding and staffing, and enforcement expenditures comprise about 70 percent of the board's $7.5 million annual budget.
The enforcement program uses a combination of education, communication, and enforcement sanctions to achieve compliance with federal and state pharmacy laws.
Where voluntary compliance and education are not enough, the board inspects, mediates, admonishes, cites and fines, and pursues formal disciplinary actions.
Pharmacy laws are enacted to protect the public and the inspection process is an opportunity for a proactive approach to educate pharmacists about the legal requirements and standards of practice they are expected to meet.
During an inspection, the inspector, who is also a licensed pharmacist, may provide information on patient consultation, pain management, quality assurance programs or advice on any other matter.
Routine inspections help ensure ongoing voluntary compliance with pharmacy law by the board's licensees because the potential to be inspected at any time serves as a major deterrent to violating pharmacy law.
Detect problems before they become major violations threatening public safety.
Inspections also identify drug diversion practices, negligence, incompetence, and inappropriate record keeping practices.
The educational component of enforcement is also provided by the pharmacy self-assessment program, responses to inquiries to the board's office and staff, information displayed on the board's Website, and during the public meetings of the board and all committees.
The board develops written materials specifically to educate licensees -- Compliance Policy Guides are developed to provide licensees with information about the board's interpretation of complex legal areas.
The board assures the periodic printing of the Pharmacy Lawbook, and as funding permits, mails a Pharmacy Lawbook to all California pharmacies (typically every two years).
The board's newsletter The Script and Health Notes monographs provide direct information to licensees about board polices and items important to practitioners' compliance with laws.
The self-assessment program requires all pharmacies to perform a periodic self-inspection of their facilities, aiding pharmacies' compliance with federal and state pharmacy laws.
But where education is not enough, the board's inspectors investigate cases than can lead to citation and fine penalties, and to more severe sanctions such as license revocations or other discipline via formal action authorized by the Administrative Procedures Act.

Since the last sunset review, a number of substantial changes have altered the board's enforcement program and the board's policies for enforcing laws.
The most notable changes are described below.
Committee and Team Meetings, and Structure The Enforcement Committee meets quarterly with all 34 enforcement program staff.
The board has 22 pharmacist-inspectors and additional complaint analysts who mediate consumer complaints.
This is the only committee that meets with all program staff and these meetings are called "Enforcement Team" meetings.
The quarterly meetings are essentially staff meetings and are not open to the public because investigative strategies are discussed.
However, teammeeting summaries are provided to the board at each of its board meetings, and at least two Enforcement Committee meetings a year are public meetings.
However, since July 2002, the Enforcement Committee has had three board members appointed as members so all meetings will be public in the future.
All policy recommendations from the Enforcement Committee are referred to the board for action at the next regularly scheduled board meeting.
The Enforcement Committee began its team meetings in 1997.
This was a crucial time because the board's enforcement program was initiating major changes to its organizational structure that affected all operations.
These changes were necessary to manage the inspector workload statewide and to improve use of the board's inspectors to investigate violations that require the expertise of a pharmacist.
It was also necessary to successfully assimilate the board's strategic plan into its enforcement operations.
During this time through the leadership of the Enforcement Committee, territory models of assigning work were eliminated and instead the board's inspectors were able to select and work on one of three teams: the Compliance Team, the Drug Diversion/Fraud Team and the Pharmacist Recovery Program (PRP) Monitoring Team.
The Compliance Team investigates complaints involving prescription errors, Internet dispensing and unprofessional conduct and performs routine compliance inspections of all board-licensed facilities.
The Drug Diversion/Fraud Team investigates alleged violations of pharmacy law involving drug diversion, excessive dispensing, corresponding responsibility, fraud, criminal convictions involving drug diversion/fraud, bid contract diversion and import/export activity.
These are usually high priority and complex cases, and require tremendous board resources.
The PRP/Probationer Monitoring Team monitors pharmacists on probation or who are in the board's Pharmacist Recovery Program.
Through quarterly inspections and other reporting mechanisms, this team ensures a probationer's compliance with the terms and conditions of the probation.
In addition, this team investigates allegations of a pharmacist's self-use of drugs.

A fourth team, the Complaint Mediation Team was also developed and staffed by complaint analysts who mediate consumer complaints, research criminal convictions, and perform in-house investigations of technical violations of pharmacy law -- work that does not require the knowledge of a pharmacist.
Beginning with the January 1999 team meeting, the Enforcement Committee established standard agenda topics that would be addressed at every meeting that were important to the board's staff and development of the team.
Primarily these were inspector issues and quality improvement efforts.
At subsequent meetings, each inspector team reported on the status of cases, significant accomplishments, completed training programs, and attendance at meetings.
Management also provided reports of case status and closure statistics by team and individual, which display the status of pending complaints and investigations.
Four years later, this same meeting format focuses on case management reports to ensure that the board's performance expectations for each team are being met.
In addition, the Enforcement Team discusses proposed or pending legislation and the implementation of new laws, reviews and proposes statutory and regulation changes, develops compliance policies and guidelines, proposes procedures for implementing new laws and educating licensees during the implementation phase, proposes strategic objectives and discusses investigative strategies.
Since 1997, all recommendations for changes to the enforcement program are first considered by the Enforcement Committee and then forwarded to the board.
The dates and the agenda topics for each Enforcement Team and Committee Meeting are charted at the end of this section.
CASE MANAGEMENT In March 2000, the Bureau of State Audits initiated an investigation of the Board of Pharmacy under the provisions of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.
The allegation was that the board had an excessive backlog of consumer complaints and was not doing its job to investigate all complaints.
In April 2001, the bureau issued its report that found that the board did not promptly resolve complaints.
The report cited data regarding the board's program that was not current and at least one year old.
The bureau reported that the board had a backlog of 770 complaints as of March 6, 2000.
The bureau calculated that this was about half of the 1,552 open complaints.
When the Bureau of State Audits released its report, the board had dramatically reduced the number of complaints pending to only 393 complaints older than 181 days that had not been investigated or mediated.
This reduction was accomplished during a time span where: complaints received by the board had increased (for example, from 1997/98 to 1999/00, the total number of annual complaints increased 49 percent from 873 to 1,298); there were substantial staff vacancies in inspector positions; eight new inspectors and one supervising inspector had been hired since July 2000; and new inspectors were undergoing the training required to function fully.

The Board of Pharmacy was very much aware of its pending backlog of complaints before the Bureau of State Audits initiated its review.
In fact, the reason why there was a whistle blower complaint in the first place was that the Enforcement Committee reported on the status of these cases during public board meetings and reported on its efforts to reduce the backlog.
Beginning in 1999, the inspector teams reported on their current caseload at each Enforcement Team Meeting and efforts were initiated to focus staff on resolving the cases expeditiously.
Not only did the organizational changes to the board's enforcement program add to the backlog, so did the high vacancy rate in inspector positions (at one time, there were 10 positions vacant or about 50 percent of these positions).
Therefore, all routine inspections were suspended and inspectors were redirected solely to the resolution of consumer complaints and investigations over one year old.
Additionally, a specialized mediation team of non-inspector analysts focused on the resolution of consumer complaints although inspectors were also trained on the mediation process as well.
Vacancies in Pharmacy Inspector Positions The Bureau of State Audits reported that if all the inspector positions had been filled in the past, there would have been no backlog of consumer complaints.
While this was a significant point, the report failed to recognize the extraordinary activities undertaken by the board since 1994 to correct what would ultimately result in the high vacancy rate of inspectors Â­ a significant salary disparity to recruit quality inspectors for the board's inspector positions.
Board action to obtain increased salaries for its inspectors began in 1994, before there was a significant vacancy problem.
Specifically the board undertook a number of activities that included: targeting the need for higher inspector compensation in its 1996 Sunset Report as key component necessary for board operational efficiency (Volume 1, page 128); developing reclassification proposals and salary realignments for the inspector series (denied by the Department of Personnel Administration); sponsoring legislation to create statutory links of inspector salaries with the salaries paid to UC pharmacists [SB 2239 (1998) and SB 1308 (1999)]; both of which were opposed by the administrations of two governors and were amended out of the bills late in the respective session; pursuing numerous high-level discussions with administration officials and written requests to the Governor to recognize inspectors as under-compensated workers (denied by Governor Wilson); securing continuous application processes to aid in inspector recruitment (previously competitive civil service examinations were given only once every two years); publishing articles about inspector positions available in the board's quarterly newsletter that is mailed to all California licensed pharmacists (for recruitment); and hiring all inspectors from the private sector at the top step of the inspector salary range (which requires specific approval from the Department of Personnel Administration).

These efforts paid off in 1999, during the collective bargaining process.
Inspectors were given a special salary alignment of 10 percent.
This augmentation, coupled with two 4 percent raises provided to all-state employees over a one-year period, reduced the salary inequity.
The higher salary for inspectors was available for recruitment purposes beginning with the April 2000 application process and was featured in another board newsletter article mailed to all California pharmacists.
It was from this applicant pool that at long last the board was successful in drawing high quality pharmacists, and as of January 2002, all 19.5 inspector positions had been filled.
Chief of Enforcement In 2001/02, the Board of Pharmacy submitted a budget change proposal to add a manager as chief of enforcement and increase the number of supervising inspectors from two to four.
The Department of Finance denied nearly the entire request but approved funding of $6,000 to upgrade an existing inspector position to supervising inspector.
Then through a spring finance letter to implement the provisions of SB 293 (to establish a specialized compounding pharmacy permit that requires annual inspections by the board) the Department of Finance approved another supervising inspector position for the 2002/03 fiscal year.
While it is noteworthy that beginning July 1, 2002, the Board of Pharmacy will have sufficient supervisors to manage its field inspectors at a ratio of 1:5, the board still needs a chief of enforcement to manage its complex and highly visible enforcement program.
The chief of enforcement would provide for a fully integrated and consistent program, and would consolidate, interpret, and develop policies for enforcing California pharmacy law.
The position would serve as the liaison with the Attorney General's Office and ensure for example, that: stipulations are consistent with board guidelines for the type of violation involved, interim suspension orders are pursued consistently and immediately when dangerous conditions exist and board expertise is available to pursue these orders, decisions from administrative law judges are evaluated for consistency with board guidelines, and feedback is provided to the executive officer and enforcement staff regarding what went right and/or wrong on formal disciplinary cases.
The chief would also work closely with the four supervising inspectors to assure consistent enforcement practices, interpretations of law and administration of pharmacy law by all 20 inspectors.
The chief would provide considerable assistance to the board and executive management in the administration of the board's total program (also involving staff from licensing, legislation, and communications), and provide a unified and concentrated head for the enforcement program.
Another duty would be the development or procurement of specialized training programs to upgrade the skills of all inspectors (e.g., aseptic compounding, nuclear pharmacy practices, quality assurance programs, root cause analyses, and the use of computer software now found in pharmacies).
This is necessary to keep inspectors' knowledge of pharmacy practice up-to-date.
The board will continue to pursue creation of this position in the future.

Controlled Substances Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) Since 1940, outpatient prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances are required to be written on a three-part, state-issued form known as the "triplicate."
Prescribers must order the preprinted triplicates from the Department of Justice.
Schedule II prescriptions for patients who are terminally ill or who are admitted to a hospital are exempt from the triplicate requirement.
Three copies are required: the prescriber retains one copy, the pharmacy retains one copy, and the original is forwarded to the Department of Justice by the dispensing pharmacy.
The purpose of the triplicate program is to reduce the diversion of Schedule II controlled substances from the legitimate pharmaceutical market to the illicit market.
The program attempts to achieve this end by restricting the availability of the triplicate forms and monitoring the dispensing of these drugs by analyzing the returned forms.
While this is the goal, the Department of Justice has been unable to accurately monitor dispensing because fewer than 1 percent of the total triplicate prescriptions dispensed were manually keyed into the computerized database of the department.
In 1998, through a $1 million augmentation, the Board of Pharmacy funded CURES, which was established by AB 3042 (Takasugi, Chapter 738, Statutes of 1996) as a three-year pilot project.
CURES tracks outpatient prescriptions dispensed in California for all Schedule II controlled drugs.
Each month, pharmacies transfer computer files detailing the Schedule II prescriptions dispensed by the pharmacy.
This data is compiled into a statewide database, which can be queried by law enforcement, regulators, and qualified researchers.
From the program's inception in May 1998 to June 30, 2002, the CURES program has processed over 10 million prescriptions.
In 1999, the Legislature approved a sunset extension for CURES (sponsored by the Board of Pharmacy) until December 1, 2003.
To implement CURES, the board passed a regulation that mandates pharmacies to participate in the program.
To encourage pharmacies to participate in the program by July 18, 1998, the board granted a one-time license renewal rebate of $75 per pharmacy.
The board outsourced the collection and maintenance of the triplicate prescription data to two vendors at a total cost of over $200,000 per year.
Thus, the $1 million augmentation carried the program through December 31, 2001.
The board did not receive additional staff or resources to implement CURES.
A pharmacy is checked for compliance during a routine inspection.
In addition, inspectors use the CURES data for inspections to ensure appropriate dispensing of Schedule II controlled substances.
This year, the Board of Pharmacy is sponsoring AB 2655 (Mathews), which would extend the sunset provision for CURES until December 2008, and would allow health practitioners to access the prescription data for their patients.
Meanwhile, the board will continue to fund the program (along with other health licensing boards) with the board's share at $70,000 per year.
Over the next year, the board's goal is use the CURES data more proactively to identify suspicious dispensing of controlled substances.
Also, the board will work with the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement and other regulatory agencies to coordinate efforts to educate

practitioners (through access to the data) about patients who are receiving Schedule II medications from multiple prescribers or pharmacies.
Quality Assurance Program to Prevent Prescription Errors In October 2000, Governor Davis signed legislation (SB 1339, Figueroa, Chapter 677) requiring all pharmacies to develop quality assurance programs to study and evaluate prescription errors to prevent recurrence of such errors.
In 2001, the board promulgated regulations to establish the parameters for the quality assurance programs, which became effective January 2002.
In July 2002, the board received the Council on Licensure, Enforcement, and Regulation's (or CLEAR's) Program Award for this major consumer protection initiative aimed at preventing prescription errors.
The board's goal for quality assurance programs is to reduce the frequency of medication errors through the systematic study of the errors.
Such study will provide pharmacists with the knowledge to improve pharmacy processes and enhance existing procedures to reduce the incidence of medication errors.
The Board of Pharmacy sponsored this legislation out of concern with the growing body of evidence documenting the threat of medication errors to patient health.
Medication errors are the most frequent consumer complaint received by the board, and the board believes that systems and process analysis is the most effective means to reduce the frequency and severity of medication errors.
California is the first state in the nation to require quality assurance programs for pharmacies.
This proposal was a strategic objective of the Enforcement Committee since 1999.
Pharmacy Self-Assessment In January 1999, the Board of Pharmacy implemented its self-assessment forms for pharmacies.
The forms must be completed by the pharmacist-in-charge (PIC) every two years and when there has been a change in the PIC.
The purpose of the self-assessment form is to educate the PIC and pharmacists on the requirements of pharmacy law, seek voluntary compliance, and remove the guesswork from what the board uses as criteria during an inspection.
Expanded Authority for Citation and Fines In July 2001, regulations to expand the scope of the board's citation and fine program became effective to allow the board to cite and fine for any violation of pharmacy law.
Prior to this change, the board issued citations and fines for failure to provide patient consultation, unlicensed activity, and continuing education violations.
The Board of Pharmacy pursued this regulation to provide it with intermediate sanctions between informal admonition and formal disciplinary action.
Virtually all pharmacy and pharmacist violations are issued by a two board member Citation and Fine Committee appointed by the board president.
All other citations and fines (for non-pharmacy entities and individuals) may be issued by the board's executive officer.

Routine Compliance Inspections The practice of pharmacy is complex and highly regulated.
It is the only profession where the practitioner is regulated (the pharmacist), the practice site is regulated (the pharmacy) and product is regulated (the prescription drug and devices that are dispensed).
Over the years, efforts to protect the public have been pursued through proactive routine inspections by board inspectors to ensure compliance with the myriad of state and federal laws.
However, there is no mandate in pharmacy law that these unannounced inspections be performed, although the board believes such inspections can correct minor problems before they become major violations and are important to compliance and education of the board licensees.
Because of limited resources, the Board of Pharmacy's policy is to inspect a pharmacy at least every three years.
In addition to routine inspections, pharmacies are also inspected as part of a complaint investigation.
However, due to vacancies and investigative priorities during the late 1990s, the board was not able to continue inspections and in 2000, the board suspended all inspections until it was able to reduce its backlog of complaints/investigations and hire more pharmacist-inspectors.
Routine inspections resumed July 1, 2001, once the board filled its vacant inspector positions.
The Compliance Team is responsible for these unannounced inspections.
Each pharmacistinspector is assigned specific pharmacies to inspect and must complete at least 32 inspections per month.
The supervising inspector may adjust the number of inspections assigned to an inspector depending on the fluctuation of that inspector's complaint/investigation workload.
For fiscal year 2001/02, the Board of Pharmacy completed 2,624 routine inspections, which resulted in the opening of 104 investigations and the ordering of over 2,000 separate corrections of pharmacy law.
Violations of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Privacy Act In 2002, the Board of Pharmacy adopted a regulation to further expand its citation and fine authority to include violations of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Privacy Act.
Senate Bill 19 (Figueroa, Chapter 526, Statutes of 1999) granted the board the authority to issue a citation and fine up to $2,500 per violation for negligent disclosure of confidential patient information in violation of the act.
The board may issue a fine of up to $250,000 per violation for a knowing or willful violation for personal gain in violation of the act.
The board is the first agency in the department to pursue this authority.
Violations of Internet Dispensing of Prescription Medications without a Valid Prescription In May 2002, the board issued an $88 million fine to a California pharmacy and the two pharmacists who were dispensing prescription drugs without a valid prescription to over 3,500 California patients.
Patients completed an online questionnaire instead of receiving a physical examination by their physicians.
The patients ordered prescription drugs from a Website by providing only such information as height, weight, gender, and their credit card numbers.
From this very limited information, a physician, not licensed in California, issued a prescription without examining the patient or having any knowledge about the patient's health or pre-existing conditions, in violation of California law.
The prescriptions were then faxed to the pharmacy

for processing and mailed to California residents.
Most of the prescription drug orders were "lifestyle" drugs.
"Lifestyle" drugs are typically used for male impotence, balding, dieting and skin care.
Patients paid substantially more for these drugs than if obtained through legal medical care routes and potentially risked their health since no medical assessment was done.
The authority to issue the fine came from legislation authored by Senator Speier (SB 1828, Chapter 681), which became law in January 2001.
The bill provides the board with the authority to pursue these fines via action with the Attorney General's Office.
The Board of Pharmacy also adopted a regulation in January 2002 to expand its citation and fine authority to $25,000 per violation for dispensing a prescription or device on the Internet without a valid prescription or a good faith examination by a physician.
The regulation is currently awaiting approval from the administration before filing with the Office of Administrative Law.

The board is constantly evaluating and pursuing new legislative means to enhance its public protection efforts.
For example, the Board of Pharmacy also sponsored provisions enabling it to suspend a license under specific circumstances: Automatic Suspension Â­ a licensee is automatically suspended from practice while incarcerated following a felony conviction.
The intent is for the suspension to continue as long as the incarceration, but the provision does not provide the final administrative resolution to be imposed for the conviction.
Summary Suspension - a summary suspension of a license is authorized for a conviction of a felony committed in the course of the business or practice for which the board issues a license, or is committed in a manner that a client, customer, or patient of the licensee was a victim.
This section also provides for the summary suspension for a crime where an element of the offense involves either the specific intent to deceive, defraud, steal or make a false statement or involves the illegal sale or possession for sale of or trafficking in any controlled substance.
Under this provision, the board could summarily suspend a licensee who is not incarcerated or is incarcerated for a conviction of a crime.
Interim Suspension Â­ an interim suspension of a license is authorized when the board determines that a felony conviction is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the licensee.
Cease and Desist Order - SB 293 (Torlakson, Chapter 827, Statutes of 2001) that became effective in January 2002, gives the executive officer the authority to issue an order to a pharmacy to immediately cease and desist compounding injectable sterile drug products.
This order must be based on information obtained during an inspection or investigation by the board and the activity of the pharmacy poses an immediate threat to the public health or safety.
The cease and desist order is only in effect for 30 days or the date of a hearing seeking an interim suspension order, whichever is earlier.

In addition to temporary restraining orders and interim suspension orders, the board uses other means to ensure public protection during the sometimes time-consuming administrative discipline process.
For example, Penal Code section 23 (or PC 23) is used to obtain suspension of a pharmacist's license through the criminal courts until the board can take administrative action.
Under PC 23, the criminal courts can impose a summary suspension of a pharmacist's license during the criminal proceedings.
These are cases where the board is aware of a criminal arrest and through the Attorney General's Office, requests during the arraignment that the pharmacist's license be suspended pending the resolution of the administrative case.

Organiz ational De v e lopment Committee Goal: Ensure the achievement of the board's mission and goals.
VISIONARY LEADERSHIP - SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS Â­ MAJOR CHANGES
STR ATEGIC PL ANNING The California State Board of Pharmacy attributes its organizational success to strategic management and planning.
Over the years, the board has been able to integrate into its strategic planning processes, budgeting, program implementation, performance monitoring and reporting and program evaluation as well as tracking essential business functions.
Because the pharmacy profession is dynamic and rapidly evolving, the board's strategic plan is a working document that is both visionary and realistic.
It anticipates the future that is both desirable and achievable.
It provides a structure to manage the future, facilitates communication and participation, accommodates divergent interests and values, and fosters practical decisionmaking and successful implementation.
The strategic plan reflects the board's basic strategies for continuing to meet is mission while working to achieve its vision.
The board uses its strategic plan to determine its priorities and allocate resources.
Board meetings are agendized using the strategic plan's five-committee structure.
Work on current and emerging issues is assigned to the respective committee for review.
In 1994, the board adopted its first strategic plan.
The board worked with a facilitator and the planning session was done during an open board meeting, which provided for input from the board's stakeholders.
While the plan was visionary and reflected a future that was desirable, it did not provide for practical decision-making and follow through necessary for a regulatory agency mandated to perform a number of ongoing activities.
The plan contained eight goal areas, but no organizational structure for implementation, follow-through and measurement.
The most significant outcome of the initial plan was the strategy for the board's successful public education and consumer outreach program.
In 1997, the board comprehensively revised and restructured its plan.
A facilitator again guided the strategic planning process in a public meeting, and this time the plan more accurately reflected the board's visionary leadership in relation to its public protection mandates and regulatory responsibilities.
One of the most meaningful changes was the development of a committee structure to correspond to the board's mission-related goals and performance measures for these goal areas.

In 1998, the most significant change to the board's strategic plan was the process.
That year, board staff through the leadership of a specialized "Transition Monitoring Team" (TMT) performed the environment scan.
The TMT consisted of nine staff representing inspectors, analysts, and clerical employees, who were elected by staff.
The TMT facilitated the environmental scan with staff and provided the results of this environmental scan to the board during the strategic planning session.
The important participation of the TMT members and staff in the strategic planning process was significant.
The board's strategic plan was developed from the bottom of the organizational structure (staff) to the top (board), instead of from the top to the bottom (from the board to staff).
This planning process produced a more realistic strategic plan and a better understanding by the board and staff of the process and plan, which is important for successful implementation.
From 1999-2001, the board updated its strategic plan annually.
This was done during open board meetings, where public participation was also encouraged.
The board's strategic plan is integrated into the board's day-to-day operations through the committee process.
Each committee oversees its goal areas and is responsible for implementation.
Each committee meets before each board meeting to discuss its activities and issues.
At the board meeting, the committee reports on the issues and makes recommendations for board action.
Each committee issues a written quarterly status report on the implementation of the strategic and ongoing objectives for each goal area.
Each year the board reviews and revises its strategic plan.
The process starts with the staff who perform an environmental scan and forward the scan to the board for inclusion in the plan.
Then through each of the committees, staff propose strategic objectives for the upcoming year.
Each year the strategic objectives are revised as well as the performance measures and indicators.
In 2002, the board initiated a substantial revision to the strategic plan, reflecting the new composition of the board and the guidance of a new facilitator.
A new vision and purpose were refined from the prior plans.
But the overall activities of the committees to secure the goals will remain, as will a quarterly reporting of each committee's progress in reaching its strategic goals.
BUDGET MANAGEMENT An integral function of the Organizational Development Committee is to oversee the board's budget and assure that adequate resources exist to perform mandated board business.
It is necessary that the board's financial resources be managed to ensure fiscal viability and program integrity.
At each meeting, the committee reviews budget forecasts and expenditure reports.
These reports are also shared with the board at every board meeting.
Since the last sunset review, the board's staff and annual expenditures have increased from $5.2 million in 1996/97 to $7.5 million in 2002/03 Â­ a 44 percent increase.

OARD OF PHARMACY

Also since the last sunset review, the board was able to reduce fees to their statutory minimum (effective July 1, 1999) as repayment of the 1991/92 General Fund transfer occurred.
(The board had increased fees to their statutory maximum in July 1995 because the transfer had so depleted the board's reserve.)
A growing reserve in the board's fund in the late 1990s made this fee reduction possible.
As such the board sought to reduce the size of its reserve; revenues are currently $2 million less than annual expenditures intentionally as a means to reduce the size of the board's reserve.
The board is directed by the Business and Professions Code to maintain a one-year reserve in its fund.
However, the transfer of $6 million from the board's reserve for the state's 2002/03 budget greatly depleted the board's reserve.
A future increase in the board's fees will be needed to bring the board's revenue back in line with its expenditures in another year unless the board substantially reduces expenses in 2003/04 or receives repayment of the loan early in the next fiscal year (July 2003).
Without repayment of the loan early in 2003/04 or unless substantial program cuts are made, the board will need to increase fees to their statutory limit, and eventually will need to seek an increase in the statutory maximum.
Over the years, the board has aggressively sought program enhancements and expansions through the budget change proposal process, which is required to increase the board's expenditure authority or add new staff positions.
Although not many of the budget augmentation requests were approved, or when approved were approved at reduced levels, the board has nevertheless added staff and resources important in the board's productivity and visibility in each of the five strategic management committees' activities.
(see Part 1, Budget and Staff for more information.)
STAFF DEVELOPMENT The board appreciates and supports its staff, and development of staff is viewed as an essential function.
Since the last sunset review, the board has instituted quarterly staff meetings with all staff to attain team building, integrate the board's strategic plan throughout the board and to share necessary information.
This is essential for the board to continue to change and meet the challenges of regulating pharmacy professionals and facilities.
The formation of the Transition Management Team (TMT) in 1998 was to provide an alternative means for staff to deal with the discomfort caused by dramatic change, and instead build a stronger organization through staff development and participation in the change process.
Recommended by consultants who advocate change management, the TMT provided a confidential means for staff to complain or approach management with concerns.
Over a one-year period and through an aggressive training program provided to all staff by board management, staff voted to rename and reorganize the TMT into The Communications Team (TCT) with a focus on strengthening communication throughout the board.
This was a significant achievement and reflection of the significant progress in both staff and organizational development.
Since 1999, the TCT has hosted and organized all quarterly staff meetings, and works on team building.
It also still serves as a confidential source of bringing problems to management's attention.
Staff membership is now six members, each of whom is elected by all staff.

Staff is encouraged to identify and attend training that will strengthen and develop their skills.
Much of the board's work is accomplished in team environments, and cross training is an important means through which the board completes work in light of vacancies, absences, and workload surges.
Many staff are promoted within the board once they are ready for more complex assignments.
Of the 52 staff currently employed by the board, 31 have been with the board more than three years (61 percent) and 20 of these staff with the board more than five years (39 percent).
OTHER MAJOR PROJECTS The board developed a Board Member Procedure Manual to advise new and ongoing board members of board policies and state policies so that they can better carry out their duties without conflict.
Since the last sunset review, the committee has also coordinated the development of the board's Operational Recovery Plan, Business Continuity Plan and a fee audit; undertaken Y2K compliance issues and expanded the board's Sacramento headquarters office into much needed larger space; and installed a new, automated phone system.

PA R T 1 Background In format ion an d Ov er vie w of the Cur r ent Regul at o ry Progr a m This section contains the board's response to specific information requested by the Joint Legislative Sunset Review Committee's Sunset Review Survey Â­ specifically Part I.
For the committee's ease in reviewing this report, the information provided in this section follows the same order as requested in Part I of their survey.
BOARD HISTORY AND FUNCTION The Board of Pharmacy was established in 1891 to protect the public by regulating those responsible for dispensing medications to the public.
In the first six years, the board registered 1,063 pharmacists and 369 pharmacists' assistants.
The board now also regulates those who wholesale prescription drugs or devices as well as entities that ship prescription drugs and devices to California patients or practitioners.
The board has approximately 76,000 licensees in 12 license categories that include both personal and business licenses.
However, the regulation of pharmacy through the licensure of pharmacists, pharmacies, and pharmacy technicians remains the primary focus of board activity, with consumer protection at the core of the board's operations.
The board is required by statute (Business and Professions Code 4011) to administer and enforce both the Pharmacy Law (Business and Professions Code 4000 et seq.) and the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act (Health and Safety Code 11000 et seq.).
These statutes (and the associated regulations) generally address the acquisition, storage, distribution and dispensing of prescription drugs (including controlled substances) and devices.
The interaction of these separate state and federal laws governing these same subjects (the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act [21USC301 et seq.] and the Controlled Substances Act [21USC801 et seq.]
As a regulatory agency whose mandate is to protect the public, before issuing any license the board ensures that businesses are in compliance with specific rules and regulations, and that individuals satisfy the board's requirements for minimum competency as demonstrated through experience and/or achievement of a successful score on a licensure examination.
Since its creation, the scope of the board's authority has remained relatively constant, although the Legislature has expanded and contracted the board's regulatory obligations in response to trends in the healthcare marketplace.
For example: Pharmacies that compound sterile injectable drug products will require a new license in 2003 pursuant to SB 293 (Torlakson and Figueroa, Chapter 827, Statutes of 2001).
101
BOARD OF PHARMACY
PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
Medical device retailers were added in the late 1980s as a new licensing group to regulate non-pharmacies that furnish prescription devices (not drugs) and durable medical equipment (e.g., wheelchairs) prescribed to patients.
This licensing program was shifted to the Department of Health Services in July 2001 by AB 1496 (Olberg, Chapter 837, Statutes of 2000).
Veterinary food animal drug retailers were added in 1995 as a specialty class of drug wholesalers who distribute and label drugs prescribed by a veterinarian for use on food animals (AB 611, Chapter 350, Statutes of 1995).
The board also serves as a conduit for information to consumers and its licensees.
It has taken several steps to fulfill its public education mandate.
The board launched an award winning public education effort in 1997 that featured the placement of informative articles in local newspapers and participated in electronic media events relating to pharmacy.
The board has also greatly expanded and improved its newsletter, The Script, and developed the Health Notes monograph series.
Lastly, the board has a substantial Web site that contains a wide variety of information regarding board activities and offers electronic versions of board publications, applications, complaint forms, and license verification.
BOARD COMPOSITION The board is comprised of 11 members: seven pharmacists and four public members.
The Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly each appoint one public member.
The nine other members (two public members and seven professional members) are appointed by the Governor.
The Business and Professions Code (section 4001) requires that at least five of the seven registered pharmacist appointees must be actively engaged in the practice of pharmacy and the board must include at least one practicing pharmacist from an acute care hospital, another from a community pharmacy, and one from a long-term care or skilled nursing facility.
This balanced composition is important for the board to respond to the rapid evolution of health care in general, and managed care in particular, in seeking to reduce the costs of providing health care in all settings, including the costs of providing pharmaceutical care and products.

All board members actively participate in board activities, and the board has not experienced problems with establishing a quorum during a public board meeting.
The board has been fortunate because its appointing authorities generally have promptly filled vacancies; Robert Elsner filled the one position on the board currently vacant until June 1, 2002, when Mr. Elsner's grace year expired.
The current size of the board promotes efficient decision making while permitting each member an opportunity to participate actively in board policy development during committee and board meetings.
The balanced composition of the professional members of the board required by statutory law prevents over-representation from one practice setting, and public members are full participants in committee and board decision-making.
The board believes that increasing the size of the board would not likely improve or speed the board's policy making processes, and instead could extend the period in which it takes to develop decisions and board policy since more members would wish provide comments.
Decreasing the size of the board could result in an imbalance in composition and decision-making.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
BOARD COMMITTEES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS The board performs much of its work in committees; some committees are standing committees, others are task forces or ad hoc committees formed to examine a specific topic, then disbanded following completion of the task.
The board also has two specialized standing committees -- one with responsibility for the California pharmacist licensing examination (Competency Committee) and the other for issuing citations and fines for alleged violations of pharmacy laws (Citation and Fine Committee).
Each of these committees is described on the following pages.
Policy Committees The board's strategic plan establishes five standing committees through which the board establishes its goals and organizes its activities in pursuit of ensuring the public health, safety, and welfare, and to assure the provision of quality pharmacists' care.

PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
BOARD COMMITTEES AND SUBCOMMITTEES The board manages, plans, and tracks its operations through its strategic plan, which is annually updated and periodically reorganized (about every five years).
The board's strategic plan establishes five standing committees through which the board articulates its goals and organizes its activities to ensure the public health, safety and welfare, and assure the provision of quality pharmacists' care.
These five committees develop policy related to a board mission-related goal.
(The previous Board Committees section of this report describes the major activities of these five committees.)
The committees and their goal areas are:
Licensing Committee Goal: Ensure the professional qualifications of pharmacists and establish the minimum standards for board-licensed facilities.
Ensuring that the qualifications of those entering the practice of pharmacy, as well as those continuing to practice, meet minimum requirements for education, experience and knowledge; and ensuring that facilities licensed by the board meet minimum standards.
Enforcement Committee Goal: Exercise oversight on all pharmacy activities.
Protecting the public by preventing violations and effectively enforcing federal and state pharmacy laws when violations occur.
Communication and Public Education Committee Goal: Proactively provide relevant information to consumers and pharmacists.
Encouraging the public to discuss their medications with their pharmacists; emphasizing the importance of patients complying with their prescription treatment regiments; and helping pharmacists to become better informed on subjects of importance to the public.
Legislation and Regulation Committee Goal: Advocate legislation and promulgate regulations that advance the board's vision and mission.
Pursuing legislation and regulations that ensure better patient care and providing effective regulation of the individuals and firms who handle, dispense furnish, ship and store prescription drugs and devices in California.
Organizational Development Committee Goal: Ensure the achievement of the board's mission and goals.
Conducting strategic planning, budget management, and staff development activities.
Each of these committees is comprised of at least two board members (both public and professional members) and at least two staff members who provide technical and administrative input and support.
The Enforcement Committee was expanded to three board members in July 2002.
The committees are an important venue for ensuring that staff and board members share information and perspectives in crafting and implementing strategic objectives.
Each committee meets quarterly prior to each board meeting and provides a report and minutes of the committee meeting during each board meeting.
The Enforcement Committee is the only
105
BOARD OF PHARMACY
PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
committee that meets quarterly with the entire enforcement staff (in Enforcement Team meetings).
When the Licensing Committee was expanded to three members for the first six months of 2002, all meetings of this committee became public, and were publicly noticed.
Nevertheless, a committee report and minutes of the Licensing Committee meetings were still provided at board meetings.
In July 2002, new committee assignments were made by the board president, who reduced the appointments to the Licensing Committee to two members and increased the appointments to the Enforcement Committee to three members.
As such, all Enforcement Committee meetings will be public.
The board's committees allow board members and staff to discuss and conduct problem solving on issues related to the board's strategic goals and jurisdiction.
They allow the board a deliberative process to consider options for implementing components for the strategic plan.
The committees are charged with coordinating board efforts to reach board goals and achieving positive results on performance measures.
The board president designates one of the board members assigned to a committee as the committee's chairperson.
The chairperson coordinates the committee's work and ensures progress toward the board's priorities.
After detailed study of an issue during one or more committee meetings, the committees refer policy decisions to the full board for a formal decision and vote.
During these discussions at board meetings, the public is encouraged to provide comments.
Committee decisions do not become board policy until the topic is publicly noticed and discussed at a board meeting and voted upon by the full board.
At each board meeting, one of the board's committees holds a public meeting.
Over the year, each committee has at least one such public committee meeting in conjunction with a board meeting.
And over the last year, the board has begun to have more frequent public meetings of the Enforcement, Licensing, and Legislation and Regulation Committees.
During the public committee meetings, comments from the public are strongly encouraged, and the meetings themselves are frequently public forums on specific issues before a committee.
A meeting summary is prepared following each committee meeting whether the meeting was a public meeting or not, and minutes are prepared.
Because the committee process is an efficient means of doing business, the board was able to reduce the number of board meetings from five to four annually.
It also became a resource issue; with the establishment of five policy committees that were meeting before each of the five annual board meetings, this added 20 new meetings that had to be staffed, scheduled, agendized, and recorded.
A calendar of the major activities of each of the board's strategic management committees is included in this section beginning on page 108.
There is also a listing for each committee of every meeting and topics discussed in the Board Committees section of this report.
Copies of the minutes and strategic activities of each committee are available from the board.

BOARD OF PHARMACY
PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
Competency Committee The board's Competency Committee develops and grades the board's pharmacist licensure examination twice each year.
The committee is comprised of representatives from a cross section of professional practice as well as representatives from each of California's schools of pharmacy.
There are 18 members on this committee.
Membership on this committee is highly selective, professionally challenging, and timeconsuming.
The committee meets six times annually in two-day meetings.
There is also a twoday annual goal setting session and item development tasks, and occasional subcommittee work.
Membership is for a maximum of eight years, and appointment is by the board president based upon professional qualifications, recommendations, and pharmacy practice setting.
The Competency Committee is a stand-alone committee that is within the auspices of the board's Licensing Committee; one board member sits on this committee and provides updates on the status of the board's pharmacist examination during board meetings, including release of statistics describing the performance of candidates on the most recent exam.
The board member is also the board's liaison to the committee.
Citation and Fine Committee The Citation and Fine Committee functions as a subcommittee under the Enforcement Committee.
The committee was established in April 2002 to issue citations and fines for any violation of pharmacy law.
The Citation and Fine Committee replaced the board's longstanding Compliance Committees, and is comprised of two board members.
The Citation and Fine Committee reviews investigation reports prepared by board inspectors, and where warranted, issues citations and fines in accordance with California Code of Regulations section 1775.
This regulation section became effective on July 22, 2001, and expands the types of violations subject to citation and fine by the board to any violation of pharmacy law.
Previously, the board's regulations had authorized citation and fine authority only for failure to consult patients, unlicensed activity and for continuing education violations.
The expanded authority to citation and fine is authorized to a committee of the board appointed by the board president.
The authority to citation and fine for any violation of pharmacy law represents an aggressive consumer protection effort by the board to assure that less serious violations that do not warrant formal discipline through the Administrative Procedure Act are nevertheless handled in a serious manner by the board, and in a manner that results in licensees correcting the violations.
During promulgation of the regulation, the board had planned to implement the expanded citation and fine authority through the board's Compliance Committees.
However, legal counsel advised the board that the Compliance Committee processes and procedures were not consistent with the provisions of section 1775, and might run afoul of the Government Code.
A new process would be needed.
Consequently, the board directed the formation of a new committee to investigate alleged violations and, if warranted, issue citations.
This is an investigative, prosecutorial and/or advocacy function, performed in closed session by two board members.
The committee's issuance of a citation is akin to the executive officer filing an accusation after reviewing an investigation.
107
BOARD OF PHARMACY
PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
The board simultaneously disbanded the Compliance Committees when it established the new Citation and Fine Committee to implement section 1775.
As a new program, evaluation of the implementation of the regulation and the committee's actions will occur over the next year during discussions at board meetings.
The purpose of the Citation and Fine Committee is to determine whether a citation should be issued in particular cases.
However, the committee does not determine the ultimate merits of an issued citation; such a determination occurs during the hearing process -- should a hearing be requested by a licensee to contest the issuance of the citation.
If a licensee requests a hearing to contest a citation or fine, the matter is moved forward in accordance with the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Attorney General's Office represents the committee [as it does for the executive officer (who is the "complainant") for accusations] in the proceedings.
The board members who participated as the Citation and Fine Committee must recuse themselves from all proceedings under appeal.
Prior to the implementation of the Citation and Fine Committee, the Compliance Committees, which were comprised of a Northern California Committee and a Southern California Committee, operated for more than 25 years as an alternative to the formal disciplinary process.
Two to three board members convened these public meetings, which were held at least quarterly.
Cases referred to the Compliance Committees were those where a licensee had violated pharmacy laws, but the violations were not serious enough to warrant a referral to the Attorney General's Office for formal discipline.
The intent of the committees was to obtain compliance and correction through a "peer review" process of board members.
Each regional committee meeting was open to the public with a public agenda listing those who were scheduled to appear and minutes were prepared following the meeting.
Since 1995, the Compliance Committees had issued citations and fines for violation of the patient consultation law.
SPECIAL SUBCOMMITTEES The board's president may establish additional committees, whether standing or special, as he or she deems necessary.
The composition of the committees and the appointment of the members are determined by the board president in consultation with the vice president, and the executive officer.
Two special committees were formed since the board's last sunset review before the Legislature in 1996.
Medication Information Technology Subcommittee Under the umbrella of the Communication and Public Education Committee, the board president appointed a special Medication Information Technology Subcommittee in 1999.
The purpose of the committee was to collect information on new pharmacy compatible technological capabilities; identify privacy and confidentiality issues as they relate to technology and prescription medications; research and analyze California pharmacy law and regulations to determine what changes in laws and regulations are necessary to accommodate new technology

capabilities; identify the obstacles to patient-focused technology; and to make recommendations to the Board of Pharmacy in these areas.
Representatives from the profession and experts in the technology field participated in the four public subcommittee meetings.
In April 2000, the subcommittee made three recommendations to the board; they were to amend pharmacy law to: authorize pharmacists to provide clinical advice or consultation from outside a pharmacy, include communication for clinical and consultative purposes as specific components in the pharmacist's scope of practice, and amend the board's regulation regarding the ability for a consumer to opt of having his or her prescription records in a common electronic file.
The board approved moving forward with all three recommendations.
The first two recommendations required statutory changes, which the board sponsored in 2001 legislation and which became effective January 1, 2002; the third recommendation involves a regulation change which is awaiting action in a future rulemaking.
Pharmacy Manpower Task Force To address the concerns of the board's stakeholders about a nationwide pharmacist shortage and the inability of many California pharmacy employers to hire pharmacists to adequately staff pharmacies in various parts of California, the board's president appointed a Pharmacy Manpower Task Force in December 2000.
In forming the task force, the board acknowledged that a pharmacist shortage exists in California and stated concern on how the shortage impacts the availability and safe delivery of pharmacists' care to patients in the impacted areas now and in the future.
The Task Force functioned through the leadership of the Licensing Committee.
The goal of the task force was to seek solutions to the pharmacist shortage and to coordinate the various efforts underway by other interested and affected parties.
The board's purpose was to identify solutions that would ensure patients' futures access to pharmacists, pharmacists' care and prescription services.
A diverse group of individuals were appointed to this task force to obtain divergent opinions.
In addition to the two board members from the board's Licensing Committee, the task force had four representatives from each of the schools of pharmacy and one representative from each of the following organizations: California Pharmacists Association, California Society of Health Systems Pharmacists, California Retailers Association, California Association of Health Plans, Pharmacists Planning Services Inc., the Guild for Professional Pharmacists, United Food and Commercial Workers, and the California Employee Pharmacists Association and a consumer representative.
Additionally public input was solicited at every meeting.
The task force met publicly five times during 2001 at various locations throughout California, and issued its final report to the Board of Pharmacy in January 2002.
The Task Force reviewed
109

PART 1 - BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PROGRAM
27 proposed solutions.
The Task Force agreed on 13 proposed solutions, they rejected three, and voted not to discuss 11.
The Licensing Committee reviewed all proposed solutions, and made recommendations to add 10 of the proposals to the board's strategic plan for 2002/03.
