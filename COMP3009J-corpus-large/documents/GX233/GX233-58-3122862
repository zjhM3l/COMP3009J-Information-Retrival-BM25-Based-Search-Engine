The Department shall keep the information in a locked, secured area of the Department office.
vii.
The steward's or designee's compliance with these rules constitutes prima facie evidence that the chain of custody of the test samples is secure.

The stewards may disqualify and declare a horse unplaced for every purpose except pari-mutuel wagering if the chemical analysis performed pursuant to subsection (15)(a) of this Section shows that a horse on the lasix list raced without the medication described in subsection (12) of this Section, or that the plasma of the horse contained trace levels of medication in excess of the level permitted by subsection (13) of this Section.
e.
The Department veterinarian shall review all reports indicating the presence of a foreign substance and consult with the stewards prior to the initiation of disciplinary action.
When a report indicates the presence of a substance classified as Class 3, Class 4, or Class 5, the Department veterinarian's review shall specifically address trace-level detection to prevent the initiation of disciplinary action based upon pharmacologically insignificant traces of a substance.
18.
The Department may suspend the license of a licensee who refuses to make a payment for financial obligation incurred in connection with racing in this state.

3.
Quarterly Breeders' Awards.
Before October 30 of each year, the Department shall determine a quarterly breeders' award payment factor that will be applied during the entire fiscal year.
The payment factor determined by the Department is not subject to appeal.
a.
The Department shall evaluate anticipated revenues for the breeders' award fund and anticipated purses for eligible Arizona-bred animals and set the payment factor at a level that permits recipients of quarterly breeders' awards to receive awards throughout the fiscal year based on the same payment factor.
b.
The Department shall notify representatives of each breeders' association of the quarterly breeders' award payment factor in writing before October 30 of each year.

4.
Substitute Breeders' Awards.
The Department shall make substitute breeders' awards if there are sufficient monies in the fund to allow for an award but not enough monies to provide for full payments of quarterly breeders' awards based on the quarterly breeders' award payment factor.
a.
The Department shall determine the substitute payment factor by dividing the total amount of monies in the Arizona breeders' award fund at the end of the quarter less the amount required to be set aside for contingent liabilities in subsection (D)(8) by the total amount of purses won by eligible Arizona-bred animals during that quarter.
b.
The Department shall calculate substitute breeders' awards by multiplying the amount of each purse won by an eligible animal during that quarter by the substitute payment factor for that quarter.

End-of-year bonus pool.
After payment of all quarterly breeders' awards and any substitute breeders' awards has been calculated, the Department shall determine the amount of monies remaining in the fund.
The end-of-year-bonus pool is the amount of monies remaining in the Arizona breeders' award fund after the payment of all quarterly breeders' awards for the fiscal year less the amount required to be set aside for contingent liabilities in subsection (D)(8).

b.
In the event the end-of-year bonus pool cannot pay supplemental breeders' awards to make up for the shortfall to all substitute breeders' award recipients, the Department shall pay supplemental breeders' awards to all breeders eligible to receive a supplemental breeders' award on a pro-rata basis.
c.
A breeder is eligible to receive a supplemental breeders' award from the end-of-year bonus pool only if the breeder received a substitute breeders' award during that fiscal year.

The Department shall not make supplemental breeders' awards if all eligible breeders received quarterly breeders' awards during the fiscal year.
7.
End-of-year Bonus Awards.
The Department shall pay end-of-year bonus awards if monies remain in the end-of-year bonus pool following any supplemental payments.
a.
The Department shall determine an end-of-year bonus payment factor by dividing the monies in the end-of-year bonus pool by the total amount of purses won by an eligible animal during the fiscal year.
b.
The Department shall calculate end-of-year bonus awards by multiplying the amount of each purse won by an eligible animal by the bonus payment factor.
8.
Contingent liabilities.
The Department shall retain $10,000 in the Breeders' Award fund for contingent liabilities.
9.
The Department shall not make quarterly breeders' awards, substitute breeders' awards, supplemental breeders' awards or end-of-year bonus breeders' awards if the total amount available for distribution is less than $10,000.
In the event the Department does not pay an award because less than $10,000 is available for distribution, the Department shall carry forward the amount in the fund for payment of awards when the Department next calculates awards.
