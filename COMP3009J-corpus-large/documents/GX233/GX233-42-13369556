Unfortunately, some companies cheat people out of money by preying on this desire to make money from home.
Most work-at-home "opportunities" are designed to look like legitimate ways to make extra cash.
They often advertise on handmade signs seen along the road, ads in local newspapers, or through e-mail.
The ads usually say something like "earn $2,500 a month without leaving your home - send $29.95 for details," or "work from home and earn $1,000 a week."
The old saying, "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," applies to these ads.
Many ads don't tell you about the hidden costs or that there may be many hours of work required for no pay.
The claims about making hundreds of dollars a week typically are just untrue.
Fraudulent work-at-home businesses usually set up fake names and post office boxes to begin business in a new area.
By the time local law enforcement or the Attorney General's Office learns about the scheme, the company has already moved.
The scammers are usually transient, moving from town to town, stealing consumers' money along the way.
Common Work-At-Home Schemes
While many variations of work-at-home scams exist, the following types of employment opportunities are classic scams:
Envelope-stuffing.
Promoters advertise that, for a "small" fee, they will tell you how to earn money-stuffing envelopes at home.
Later - when it's too late - you will find out the promoter never had any employment to offer, and that you must find clients on your own.
Instead, for your fee you're likely to get a letter telling you to place the same "envelope stuffing" ad in newspapers or magazines, or to send the ad to friends and relatives.
The only way you'll earn money is if people respond to your work-at-home ad.
Assembly or craft work.
These programs often require you invest hundreds of dollars in equipment or supplies.
You also may be required to spend many hours producing goods for a company that has promised to buy them.
For example, you might have a to buy a sewing machine or sign-making machine from the company, or materials to make items such as aprons, baby shoes, or plastic signs.
However, after you've purchased the supplies or equipment and performed the work, fraudulent operators don't pay you.
In fact, many consumers have had companies refuse to pay for their work because it did not meet undefined "quality standards."
Unfortunately, no work is ever "up to standard," leaving workers with relatively expensive equipment and supplies, and no income.
Medical billing.
Ads for these pre-packaged businesses are in newspapers, on television and on the Internet.
A solicitation may inform you that because only a small percentage of medical claims are transmitted electronically, the market for medical billing is wide open.
Because competition in the medical billing market is fierce and revolves around a number of large and well-established firms, few consumers who purchase a medical billing business opportunity are able to find clients, start a business and generate enough revenue to even recover their investment.
How to Guard Yourself Against Work-At-Home Schemes
When tempted by an advertisement offering large sums of money for you to do work in your own home, remember the following:
Investigate the company.
Find out if the Minnesota Better Business Bureau (1-800-646-6222) has any complaints against the business, or if the Attorney General's Office has taken legal action against the company.
Also check with the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office (651-296-2803) to find out if the company is registered to do business in Minnesota.
Many of these companies are supposed to be licensed with the state Commerce Department (651-296-6319) as a franchise.
Get more information.
Ask the company if you will be paid a salary, when will the first check arrive, who will pay you, and what the total cost for the work-at-home program will be.
Demand answers before you send any money.
You should never have to pay for general information about a legitimate company.
Do the math.
If a company offers you $1 per envelope and claims you can stuff 2,000 envelopes per day, you would be making at least $2,000 each day, for just two hours of work.
In most cases, companies tempt you with unrealistic figures like these, hoping you'll get involved.
Unfortunately, if it sounds too good to be true - it usually is.
