Colorado State Flag Department of Law line graphic _________________________________________________________________ July 20th, 2000 ATTORNEY GENERAL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, AND SHERIFFS ISSUE ALERT ABOUT GIFTING PROGRAM PYRAMIDS
Attorney General Ken Salazar, District Attorney Wyatt Angelo and Sheriffs Fred McKnight and William Masters of Ouray and San Miguel Counties issued a consumer alert today warning consumers to avoid certain pyramid schemes promoted as "gifting programs" in several counties on the Western Slope.
While promoted as being legal under state and federal laws, some reported programs such as "Gift Givers," "Women Empowering Women," and "Private Gifting - A Total Team Concept," appear to be classic money chains or pyramid schemes, which are illegal in Colorado and subject those who promote them to criminal prosecution and civil liability to others in the chain.
Under Colorado law, a pyramid scheme is any program which uses a pyramid or chain process in which participants pay in excess of $50 for the opportunity to receive a payoff for inducing others to become participants.
In simple terms, a pyramid scheme is a program which derives its funding primarily from money paid by newly recruited members and not from the actual sale of products or merchandise to individuals outside of the program.
This alert is being issued because of a number of complaints and inquiries from the Western Slope regarding the so-called "gifting programs."
Participants are required to invest $2,000 to $5,000 cash, with the promise by the promoters of the program that participants will eventually receive up to $35,000 for simply recruiting others to join.
These particular programs involve levels of participants, with one person at the top.
New members are required to "gift" between $2,000 and $5,000 to the top person.
The programs do not produce or sell any goods or services -- the only source for the promised payoff of up to $35,000 is through the recruitment of new persons willing to invest $2,000 to $5,000 cash.
"These type of investment schemes are highly illegal in Colorado," warns Attorney General Salazar.
"The longer they are allowed to exist, the greater the likelihood that a large number of people will lose a lot of money."
said Salazar.
Of particular concern to the Attorney General are reports that some participants in these pyramids are going into significant debt by obtaining loans and even cash advances from their credit card accounts in order to join.
"The great danger of every pyramid scheme," warned District Attorney Angelo, "is that as the pool of potential new investors dries up, later participants will necessarily lose their money."
According to Angelo, consumers should be very careful about being lured into these illegal pyramid schemes because it is a mathematical certainty that most participants in these "gifting" programs will lose their money, with very little chance of ever recovering it.
"These claims of legality are completely untrue, " emphasized Ouray County Sheriff McKnight, noting that "these schemes are classic money chains, which can only continue through the recruitment of new participants.
Sooner or later, the pool of new players dries up, and most persons will lose their money."
San Miguel County Sheriff Masters pointed out that, "What has made these recent programs particularly egregious are the attempts by promoters to persuade new participants that these schemes are perfectly legal."
Promoters are misleading new recruits into believing their programs are legal because the Internal Revenue Service allows persons to receive gifts up to $10,000, without gift tax liability.
The Sheriff noted that, "In the end, a program which claims to help those in need, will cause financial hardship to many."
Anyone with information concerning pyramid programs should contact their local sheriff's and district attorney's offices.
In addition, individuals who have lost money through pyramid promotional schemes may file small claims or county court lawsuits against their up-line sponsors, "receivers," or "seniors," to recover treble damages under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act.
