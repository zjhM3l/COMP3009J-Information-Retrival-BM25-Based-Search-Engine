Discussion Business and Professions Code section 4127.1(d) requires pharmacies that compound sterile injectable drug products to obtain a special pharmacy license from the board.
In order to obtain such a license, the pharmacy must first be inspected by the board and found in compliance with board standards for sterile compounding.
The bill exempts pharmacies that are accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or other accreditation agencies approved by the board from the license requirements.
Exempted pharmacies still must comply with board regulations regarding sterile injectable compounding, but do not have to obtain a separate license.
To meet the requirements of the new statute, the Licensing Committee requested that criteria be developed for which to evaluate the agencies.
It was noted that board's approval should be based on the accreditation agency's ability to evaluate the pharmacy's conformance with California law and good professional practice standards.
The following factors were developed for board consideration when evaluating an agency: periodic inspection, documented accreditation standards, evaluation of surveyor's qualifications, acceptance by major payors, unannounced inspections of sites, board access to accreditor's report on pharmacies, length of time in operation, out-of-state abilities to accredit, length of accreditation and process for reaccredidation.
The criteria developed by the committee are in Attachment A. RECOMMENDATION 2 That the Board of Pharmacy consider the request from the Accreditation Commission on Healthcare (ACHC) that pharmacies accredited by ACHC are exempt from licensure pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 4127.1(d).
Discussion ACHC has requested approval as an accreditation agency as authorized under current law.
ACHC currently accredits both home infusion pharmacies and specialty pharmacies that deliver biotech drugs and other specialty products.
ACHC revisits each accredited entity every three years.
Currently, 11 California pharmacies are accredited by ACHC.
Stuart Venook representing ACHC provided an overview of the accreditation process.
He stated that the company reviews the pharmacy's policies and procedures in advance of the site visit, they observe nurses at the home, review patient records, and they validate the pharmacy's processes through a site visit and review of the complaint log.
ACHC is located in North Carolina and was formed as an alternative to JCAHO, which primarily accredits hospitals.
He stated that they have over 400 clients in 43 states.
The committee requested that ACHC submit additional information to be provided as part of the evaluation process.
They requested the names of the 11 California pharmacies that are currently accredited, the number of pharmacies that have been denied accreditation or issued a "provisional" accreditation (and specifically any in California), the length of the accreditation process and the process for reaccredidation.
ACHC's response is in Attachment B.
No Action Implementation of the Licensure and Inspection Program for Pharmacies that Compound Injectable Sterile Drug Products Effective July 1, 2003, a pharmacy may not compound sterile injectable drug products in California unless: Â· The pharmacy is specially licensed by the board as a sterile compounding pharmacy, or: Â· The pharmacy has a current accreditation from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or another accreditation agency approved by the board (there is a pending request from ACHC) All pharmacies that compound sterile injectable drug products must follow the board's regulations for sterile compounding (CCR 1751).
Recently promoted Supervising Inspector Dennis Ming is responsible for the implementation of this new program.
The application forms are on the board's website and to date the board has received one application.
To assist pharmacies with compliance, Mr. Ming developed a selfassessment form that will be available on the board's website.
The initial licensure inspection will be by appointment and all inspectors will be trained on the inspection process.
Training is set for the first week in May.

Memorandum To: From: Board Members Paul Riches Legislative Analyst Date: April 14, 2003
Subject: Approval of Accrediting Entities Background on Senate Bill 293 Senate Bill 293 requires pharmacies compounding sterile injectable drug products to obtain a license from the board.
In order to obtain such a license the pharmacy must first be inspected by the board and found in compliance with board standards for sterile compounding.
The bill exempts pharmacies that are accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or other accrediting agencies approved by the board from the license requirement established by Senate Bill 293 (Section 4127.1 (d) of the Business and Professions Code).
Exempted pharmacies must still comply with board regulations regarding sterile injectable compounding, but do not have to obtain a separate license.
The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) has requested the board to approve it as an accrediting entity under Senate Bill 293.
ACHC currently accredits both home infusion pharmacies and specialty pharmacies that deliver biotech drugs and other specialty products.
A copy of material describing ACHC and a copy of its accreditation manual is attached for your reference.
ACHC revisits each accredited entity every three years and anticipates implementing random interim surveys of its accredited entities.
Currently, 11 California pharmacies are accredited by ACHC.
The Licensing Committee developed the following criteria for the evaluation of applications by accrediting entities for board approval.
The following criteria are the result of the Licensing Committee's discussions, including a presentation to the Committee by an ACHC surveyor.
ACHC followed up on specific questions raised by the Committee and those responses are follow this memo.
Factors to Consider The evaluation of accrediting agencies for board approval under Business and Professions Code section 4127.1 should be based on the accrediting agency's ability to evaluate the pharmacy's conformance with California law and good professional practice standards.
The following factors should be considered when making such an evaluation: 1.
Periodic inspection Â­ The accrediting entity must subject the pharmacy to site inspection and re-accreditation at least every three years.
2.
Documented accreditation standards Â­ The standards for granting accreditation and scoring guidelines for those standards must reflect both applicable California law and sound professional practice as established by nationally recognized professional or standard setting organizations.
3.
Evaluation of surveyor's qualifications Â­ The surveyors employed to perform site inspections must have demonstrated qualifications to evaluate the professional practices subject to accreditation.
4.
Acceptance by major California payors Â­ Recognition of the accrediting agency by major California payors (e.g., HMOs, PPOs, PBGH, CalPERS).
5.
Unannounced inspection of California accredited sites Â­ The board must conduct unannounced inspections of two or more accredited sites and find those sites in satisfactory compliance with California law and good professional practice.
6.
Board access to accreditor's report on individual pharmacies.
7.
Length of time the accrediting agency has been operating.
8.
Ability to accredit out-of-state pharmacies.
Non-resident pharmacies are eligible for licensure under the sterile compounding statutes and accreditation should be equally available to both resident and non-resident pharmacies.

ACHC Presentation To the California Board of Pharmacy 1.
What constitutes a denial of accreditation? Any scope of service section that is below 70% or the overall score of the survey is below 70% will result in denial of accreditation to the applicant organization.
The organization has two options.
(1).
Prepare for a new survey.
The company can reapply no sooner than six months from the date of denial.
The applicant organization must undergo an entirely new survey.
Recommendations for correcting deficiencies are provided to the company.
(2).
Appeal the decision.
If the company denied believes that the survey score was in error, it may submit a written appeal within 30 days of the decision date.
The ACHC Board Chair will appoint a five-person panel with Commissioners who were not involved with the initial review to hear and consider the appeal.
The applicant organization will be required to make a presentation to the panel.
2.
What constitutes a deferral of accreditation? If the survey score is in the range from 70-84, the company is deferred any decision of accreditation.
The Summary of Findings will outline deficiencies and make recommendations.
The Review Committee will require a Plan of Correction to be submitted within 30 days of the decision.
The committee will give the company up to six months to make corrections and provide evidence of compliance.
If the deficiencies are policy related, evidence of changes can be mailed to the committee.
If the deficiencies involve patient care, a return focused visit by the surveyor will be required.
Have any organizations been denied by JCAHO, but accredited by ACHC? None that we are aware of.
What payers recognize ACHC? ACHC accreditation is recognized by most national and state third party payers including, but not limited to, AetnaUS Healthcare, Humana, CCN Managed Care, Cigna Healthcare, Anthem Health Plans, most Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare state plans.
In California, Blue Cross, CCN, and Blue Shield.
Pacific Care of OR, WA and AZ reviewed ACHC standards and approved them last year.

Commenters:
Introductions Licensing Committee Chair Dave Fong explained that at its last meeting, the Board of Pharmacy created the Ad Hoc Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs).
This committee is comprised of the board's public members and is functioning under the auspices of the Licensing Committee.
As Chair of the Licensing Committee, Dr. Fong stated that his role is that of facilitator.
He acknowledged that the purpose of this first meeting is to explore what PBMs do in the context of the board's public protection mandate and necessity for regulation.
The following is a summary of the comments.
It does not represent actual findings of the Ad Hoc Committee, the Board of Pharmacy or is it all-inclusive.

General Information Employers are the largest payers of prescription drug benefits in California PBMs are companies that administer pharmaceutical benefits for health plans, HMOs, and employers There are approximately 300 PBMs nationally that cover 60-65% of lives for private payors and 10% of the lives for the public sector Pharmacy benefits are considered "riders" on the insurance plans Â­ the pharmacy benefits are typically separate from the medical benefits PBMs functions Claims processing Own and operate mail order pharmacies that are licensed pharmacies Establish the pharmacy network Design the Pharmacy Benefit on behalf of the client employer, health plan, etc.

Call to Order Committee Chairman David Fong called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m.
Update on the Security Breach and Halt of the Administration of the Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Equivalency Examination (FPGEE) Ms. Harris reported that Business and Professions Code section 4200(a)(2)(B) requires an applicant who graduated from a foreign pharmacy school to receive a grade satisfactory to the board on an examination designed to measure the equivalency of foreign pharmacy education with that of domestic graduates.
To meet this requirement, the board relies on the FPGEE developed and administered by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).
On November 18, 2002, the NABP issued notification that it halted the examination due to a security breach.
Further NABP advised that it has taken the following steps to 1
ensure the integrity of the examination: scores affected by the breach will be invalidated and those applicants must retake the examination, certificates that have been awarded to candidates who passed the exam affected by the compromise will be invalidated and those applicants must retake the examination, all FPGEE examinations have been cancelled until a new examination can be developed.
NABP stated that it anticipates that a new examination will be developed by June 2003 and the program reinstated.
On January 29, 2003, the board received an update on the security breach.
In this update were the names of 15 individuals implicated to Internet postings which may have caused or contributed to the compromise.
As such the scores of those candidates were invalidated.
None of the individuals listed are board licenses or have pending applications.
NABP continues to investigate all the right to deny or refuse FPGEC However, NABP has informed the exam of the status of their FPGEC matters surrounding the breach of security and reserves certification should the circumstances dictate.
remaining individuals affected by the compromised certification and FPGEE score recognition.
In light of these developments, the board requested verification for 101 foreign graduate applicants on February 7, 2003, and to date has received verification for 10.
Update on the Sunset Review Process Executive Officer Harris reported that the Joint Legislative Sunset Review Committee has scheduled its next hearing for April 2, 2003.
The purpose of this hearing is to consider the recommendations from the Department of Consumer Affairs.
The Committee will then hold its third and last hearing about one week later to adopt its recommendations.
Committee Chair Dave Fong expressed concern to the stakeholders that it is critical that an agreement be reached to address the pharmacy manpower issue in California.
The board took action on many of the recommendations that the Pharmacy Manpower Task Force proposed such as the changes to the pharmacy technician program, ratio requirements, and the ability to administer the pharmacist licensure examination more than twice a year.
He added that the board agreed to the stakeholders' request that they (the stakeholders) be responsible for sponsoring legislation this year with the goal of obtaining viable solutions that could be implemented.
Dr. Fong emphasized that it is especially important that the stakeholders reach consensus on these issues so that patient safety and prescription services are not impacted.
Competency Committee Report on the January and June 2003 California Pharmacist Licensure Examination Â­ Open Dialogue with the Schools of Pharmacy Ms. Herold reported that the 675 candidates sat for the January 2003 examination that was administered in Burlingame.
Examination results are scheduled for release on April 1, 2003.
The June examination will be held the 17th and 18th, at the San Jose Convention Center.
2
Committee Chair Dave Fong stated that he has had conversations with some of the deans from the schools of pharmacy and there is concern that there is a gap between the pharmacy school curriculum and the California licensure examination.
The concern is that the board may be testing candidates in subject areas that the pharmacy school has not taught.
An example is that on the January examination there were questions regarding quality assurance.
Although there are representatives from the schools of pharmacy on the Competency Committee to facilitate communications, Mr. Fong felt more efforts should be made in this area.
It was suggested that the Licensing Committee invite the deans or a representative from the California schools of pharmacy to the June Licensing Committee meeting to initiate this discussion.
Another option is invite them to Competency Committee Retreat in August for discussion directly with the examination committee.
It was noted that the Competency Committee constructs the pharmacist licensure examination using the content outline.
This outline is based on the results of a job analysis conducted by the board in 2000.
The committee also uses the Competency Statement developed by the Board of Pharmacy, which outlines the level of professional competencies expected of pharmacists.
Questions regarding pharmacy law are not included in the examination until the law has been in effect for at least one year.
Request from Department of Health Services Â­ Food and Drug Branch Â­ Requesting that the Board of Pharmacy Address the Issue of Compounding vs. Manufacturing as a Joint Venture At the last meeting, Chair Dave Fong discussed the written request from James M. Waddell, Acting Chief for the Food and Drug Branch for the Department of Health Services.
Mr. Waddell requested that due to the many recent events relative to pharmacy compounding that they would like to revisit with the board the issue of pharmacy compounding, including criteria used by the board to determine when compounding falls outside the scope of pharmacy practice.
Because the Food and Drug Branch licenses manufacturers in California, they communicated the importance of their understanding of how the board notifies individuals when pharmacy-compounding activities falls outside the scope of pharmacy practice.
The committee invited Ray Wilson from the Department of Health Services to discuss this request.
Dr. Wilson stated that it is important that a joint effort to revisit this issue be initiated so that there is better understanding on how the board determines when a practice falls outside the scope of pharmacy and becomes manufacturing.
He stated that his agency looks to the board for guidance as to the definition of pharmacy practice.
With the many dynamic changes to pharmacy over the last years and the recent Federal guidelines, Mr. Wilson reiterated the importance of a joint effort to address this area of pharmacy practice.
The Licensing Committee agreed to establish a workgroup with the Department of Health Services and the federal Food and Drug Administration to address the issue of compounding and manufacturing.
The committee agreed to begin this project upon the completion of its review of 3
Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs).
The project will be added as a committee strategic objective.
Request from the Accreditation Commission on Healthcare for Approval that Pharmacies Accredited by its Organzation be Exempt from Licensure pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 4127.1(d) Senate Bill 293 requires pharmacies compounding sterile injectable drug products to obtain a license from the board.
In order to obtain such a license, the pharmacy must first be inspected by the board and found in compliance with board standards for sterile compounding.
The bill exempts pharmacies that are accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or other accreditation agencies approved by the board from the license requirements established by Senate Bill 293 (Section 4127.1(d) of the Business and Professions Code).
Exempted pharmacies must still comply with board regulations regarding sterile injectible compounding, but do not have to obtain a separate license.
The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) requested approval as an accreditation agency under Senate Bill 293.
ACHC currently accredits both home infusion pharmacies and specialty pharmacies that deliver biotech drugs and other specialty products.
ACHC revisits each accredited entity every three years.
Currently, 11 California pharmacies are accredited by ACHC.
The committee discussed ACHC's request and the implementation of section 4127.1(d).
Stuart Venook representing ACHC provided an overview of the accreditation process.
He stated that the company reviews the pharmacy's policies and procedures in advance of the site visit, they observe nurses at the home, review patient records, and they validate the pharmacy's processes through the site visit and review the complaint log.
ACHC is located in North Carolina and was formed as an alternative to JCAHO, which primarily accredits hospitals.
He stated that they have over 400 clients in 43 states.
The Committee advised Mr. Venook that it will refer ACHC's request to be approved as an accreditation agency to the board at its April meeting.
However, they asked that the following information be provided as part of the evaluation process: the name of the 11 California pharmacies that are currently accredited, the number of pharmacies that have been denied accreditation or issued a "provisional" accreditation (and specifically any in California), the length of the accreditation process and the process for reaccredidation.
Proposed Evaluation Criteria to Approve Accreditation Agencies Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 4127.1(d) Committee Chair Dave Fong explained that Business and Professions Code section 4127.1(d) gives the Board of Pharmacy the authority to approve agencies that accredited pharmacies that compound injectable sterile products.
In order to do this, the Committee requested that criteria be developed for which to evaluate the agencies.
It was noted that board's approval should be based on the accreditation agency's ability to evaluate the pharmacy's conformance with 4
California law and good professional practice standards.
The following factors were developed for board consideration when evaluating an agency: periodic inspection, documented accreditation standards, evaluation of surveyor's qualifications, acceptance by major payors, unannounced inspections of sites, board access to accreditor's report on pharmacies, length of time in operation, out-of-state abilities to accredit, length of accreditation and process for reaccredidation.
The committee recommended that the board use these proposed factors when considering an accreditation agency's request for approval pursuant to B 
Proposed Standards for Pharmacies that Compound Injectable Sterile Drug Products At its January meeting, the board agreed to move to regulation hearing the proposed amendments to CCR, title 16, section 1751 that would establish minimum standards for pharmacies that compound injectable sterile drug products.
The regulation hearing is scheduled for the April board meeting.
The Licensing Committee scheduled this agenda item to provide another opportunity for interested parties to comment on the proposed regulations.
It was noted that the Licensing Committee was not taking oral testimony on the proposed regulation.
If written comments were received, then those comments would be provided to the board; however, oral testimony had to be given during the regulation hearing on April 29, 2003.
Proposed Strategic Objectives for 2003/04 Executive Officer Patricia Harris reported that last year during strategic planning, the board agreed to revise the format of its plan.
With the assistance of facilitator, Lindle Hatton, the board began to revise the goal areas to better identify actual objectives and not activities.
Executive staff then worked with Mr. Hatton to refine the objectives.
The revised objectives were provided to the committee for its review.
The committee will review the revisions and prioritize the objectives before the April board meeting and strategic planning session.
Adjournment Committee Chairman David Fong adjourned the meeting at 11:30 a.m.
