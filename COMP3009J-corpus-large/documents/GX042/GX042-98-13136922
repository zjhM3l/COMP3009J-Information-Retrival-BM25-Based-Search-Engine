Just a few days earlier, Italian officials found another boat near Lampedusa containing seven dead Africans and 25 survivors.
Illegal immigration from north and central African countries to Italy has sharply risen in recent months.

Smuggler King Confesses By Richard Owen, The Times, October 15, 2003 Turab Ahmed Sheik, a Maltese citizen of Pakistani origin, is being brought to trial in Sicily for his role in the 1996 drowning deaths of 283 illegal immigrants.
The illegal immigrants, most from Asia, drowned when being transferred from the rusty freighter, the Yiohan, to a Maltese launch that was supposed to take them to Sicily.
The two vessels collided in stormy seas and the launch sank.

He then switched to smuggling Asians into Europe using Aeroflot via Moscow to Athens and Valletta, the Maltese capital, and then to Frankfurt.
This garnered $17.5 in five years.
He made another $5 million using some 30 fisherman to smuggle illegal immigrants from Malta to Sicily.

Tighter Border Yields Odd Result: More Illegals Stay By Eduardo Porter, The Wall Street Journal, Dateline Stockton, California, October 10, 2003 With stricter policing of the U.S. border and higher prices being demanded by people smugglers, more illegal immigrants from Mexico are choosing to just stay in the United States.
According to a study done by Douglas Massey, co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at the University of Pennsylvania, the average stay of a Mexican illegal immigrant in the early 1980s was three years; by the late 1990s, it was nine years.
In the past, Mexicans would enter the United States illegally to take jobs, make money, and then go home to their families in Mexico.
Now they stay in the United States and pay "coyotes" to bring their families to them.
The illegal immigrants who choose to stay in the United States permanently are straining the resources of the communities where they live: Schools are crowded with Spanish-speaking students; local charities face increasing demands; and, hospitals are financially strained by the increasing number of uninsured patients.

Illegal Immigrants Wary of Poland's Move To Give Them Papers By Maja Czarnecka, Agence France-Presse, October 8, 2003 Poland has launched a program, the first of its type in eastern Europe, which allows the country's illegal immigrants to present themselves to Polish officials to receive a one-year permit to stay in the country.
The permit is renewable with a two-year residence card, followed by permission for permanent residence.
After 10 years of living in Poland, the immigrant could request Polish nationality.
Jan Wegrzyn, the director of the foreigners' office at Poland's interior ministry, is quoted as saying: "The objective for Poland is to bring itself up to European standards, and to know how many illegal immigrants live here....
The only danger is that by this move we risk attracting new immigrants who would come in the hope that the operation would be repeated."
It is estimated that between 200,000 to 500,000 illegal immigrants are living in Poland.
Many are Ukrainians, Armenians, Vietnamese, Chechens, Iraqis and Africans.
In the first three weeks of the program, 203 took the opportunity to legalize their status.
But Czarnecka writes: "In Warsaw's giant 'Russian market' illegal immigrant traders from Armenia through Vietnam are wary about a plan to give them papers, as they peddle pirate CDs, bootleg booze and counterfeit jeans."
She quotes one Armenian salesman as saying: "How can we prove that we have incomes if we are illegal workers?"
Getting the Real Goods: Getting a Real Deal on a Leather Bag Can Be a Rush, But the True Price May Be Steeper Than You Think By Isabel Vincent, The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia, Canada) October 7, 2003 This article examines how counterfeit goods, which generate sales worth billions of dollars each year, may be financing terrorist groups such as Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida, Hesbollah and Hamas.
Human smuggling is also part of the counterfeiting underworld.
Vincent writes: "Experts say that vendors selling counterfeit goods are often illegal immigrants in Europe and North America who must repay brokers who arranged their flight from their home countries."
Tim Trainer, president of the Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition in Washington, a group that tracks international counterfeiting and trains law enforcement personnel to spot fake goods, is quoted as saying: "When you buy a counterfeit product, you are feeding into a system that traffics in human beings."

"Illegals": Door to Door at Right Price By Roger Beaumont, The Nation (Thailand), October 6, 2003 This article describes the various ways human smugglers use air travel to transport their clientele.
The article also points out the increasing usefulness of the Internet to human smugglers.
Beaumont quotes his contact, a young Englishman who works for a trafficking gang run by a Kuwaiti, as saying: "There are hundreds of websites which provide false identities.
Some of them offer a do-it-yourself kit to build new IDs (identifications) with blank documents such as birth certificates and stolen passports.
And believe me, hundreds of thousands of UK (United Kingdom) passports are stolen every year and never recovered.
What's more, the software is so cool these days that documents needed to create identities can be make or copied; and they are very difficult to detect by the naked eye."

Statement of John M. Morganelli District Attorney, Northampton County, Pennsylvania Capitol Hill Hearing: "Local Enforcement of Immigration Laws" House Judiciary Committee Immigration, Border Security and Claims Subcommittee October 1, 2003 In his prepared testimony, District Attorney Morganelli argues that "illegal immigration is having an extremely negative impact upon America at many levels."
Morganelli notes: "Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged in criminal activity.
Identity theft, use of fraudulent social security numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status."
According to Morganelli, identity theft, fraud and the use of false identification "is causing havoc with record-keeping systems including but not limited to Social Security, income tax and other compilation of data that we have routinely relied upon for accuracy and identity verification."
"In addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also prevalent among illegal aliens," he says.
"Over 25 percent of today's federal prison population are illegal aliens."
Estimates are that in Pennsylvania alone there are between 100,000 and 200,000 illegal immigrants.
The direct cost to taxpayers as a result of the criminal acts committed by illegal aliens "are staggering," Morganelli says.
In Pennsylvania, in fiscal year 1999, incarceration expenses for about 196,676 days of detention for illegal aliens in state and local jails and prisons came to $13,350,000," he says.

Project To Identify Bodies at Border; Online Database to Help Families of Immigrants By T.A.
