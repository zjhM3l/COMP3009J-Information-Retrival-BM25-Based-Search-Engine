TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ THE POTENTIAL USE OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES FOR SELECTION OF LOW SATURATED FATTY ACIDS IN SUNFLOWER OIL Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary: Consumers are becoming more aware of the consumption of fats in their diet.
Studies have shown that consumption of high levels of saturated fats increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Vegetable oils are a principle source of fats in the diet.
Sunflower oil has about 12% saturated fats which is lower than some oils and higher than others such as canola oil with 6%.
Genetically altering (lowering) the saturated fatty acids of sunflower oil would make it more comparable in quality to canola oil.
Several methods are available to alter the saturated fatty acids in sunflower.
One is breeding utilizing the wild relatives of the cultivated sunflower, mutation of cultivated sunflower, or using biotechnology to bioengineer the desired levels of fatty acids.
The present study discovered three species of wild sunflower with saturated fat levels below 7%.
When grown in a uniform environment (greenhouse), similar fatty acid levels were observed.
This would indicate that the fatty acids are under genetic control and the potential to select and bred for low levels of saturated fatty acids in sunflower oil exists using these wild species.
Further research using interspecific hybridization will be necessary to transfer the genes from the wild species to cultivated sunflower.
