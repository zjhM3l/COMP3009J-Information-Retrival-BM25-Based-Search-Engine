On isolated coastal plantations, enslaved blacks created the unique Gullah culture, based on mixed European and African elements.
At the center of Gullah culture was the Gullah language, which drew most of its vocabulary from English and its grammar from West African languages.

Underground Railroad
The Underground Railroad was perhaps the most dramatic protest action against slavery in United States history.
It was a clandestine operation that began during the colonial period, later became part of organized abolitionist activity in the 19th century, and reached its peak in the period 1830-1865.
The story of the Underground Railroad is one of individual sacrifice and heroism in the efforts of enslaved people to reach freedom from bondage.
