"All anthrax hoaxes are serious violations of Federal law," said Attorney General John Ashcroft.
"Perpetrators of criminal acts, targeting Americans because of their race or heritage, will not be permitted.
We are committed to identifying, tracking down and prosecuting domestic terrorists who threaten the lives and welfare of innocent Americans."
To date the following groups have received the anthrax hoax letters: the Washington, D.C. offices of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Aspira Association, Inc., and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists; five affiliates of the National Council of La Raza in the Southwest United States; and the Sacramento, California office of the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund.
The Attorney General has directed the Federal Bureau of Investigation to aggressively investigate these mailings to uncover any potential violations of federal law.
The Department of Justice's Civil Rights and Criminal Divisions are prepared to ensure that any persons identified as having threatened or otherwise targeted Hispanic-Americans or any other Americans on the basis of their race or ethnicity are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
