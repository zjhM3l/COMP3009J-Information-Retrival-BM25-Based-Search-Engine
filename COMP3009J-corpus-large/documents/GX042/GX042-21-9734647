Cindy (and everyone else) - have you seen the text of this digital divide speech? It makes good points about literacy being the most basic of access mechanisms I think, as well as offering cautions we have already heard about what the library world sometimes calls "an information underclass."
>
Catherine K (and others) - The American Library Association has initiatives agreeing with some of your thoughts about information, education and democracy.
If you haven't seen their stuff you could start at http://www.ala.org/kranich/initiative.html and click your way to other statements from there.
O yes - I'm Karen Jones from the Missouri State Library.
I try to help libraries with literacy efforts in our state.
It's generally small scale, low budget, and hands on, but I'm convinced that ripples move outward and seeds grow...

Thank you -- thank you very much.
Good afternoon.
Now if the tech folks = could turn the screen on, I've got a little slide show to show you.
The = slide show isn't simply a cheat sheet for my own benefit -- many of you = often have to take a lot of notes when you go to a presentation, and if = you're anything like me, I have a hard time taking detailed notes and = participating at the same time.
So once we get the slideshow on the = screen, you'll notice an URL at the bottom of the page.
With that = address, you'll be able to find a 
<
(projector suddenly turns on)
There we go....
A similar slide will also be on the screen at the end = of the presentation, so if you can't copy the URL now, you'll be able = to get it later.
So put your pencils down, put your laptops down, put = your Palm Pilots down, and just listen.
If you feel the urge to stand = up and ask a question during my speech, please do -- even though I'm = standing behind this podium, I don't intend this to be a one-way = lecture.
One-way lectures can be somewhat passive for the audience, to = say the least, so I want you to be able to think and talk as much as = listen.
So if you feel the need to ask a question at any time, by all = means please do.
Otherwise we'll hopefully have some time at the end = for questions as well.
Now Andrew Rasiej joked in his introduction to me that I've been on the = Net for 16 years even though it's been only around for 15 years.
= Actually, the Net's been around a lot longer than that -- The Internet = as a popular medium has only been around for a few years, but the Net = actually evolved out of a much older network named ARPANET, which was = developed in the late 1960s.
In the beginning, it was really basic -- = literally just a couple of networks connected together by a common = technology.
Here on the screen is one of the original diagrams used in = 1969 to describe this early network.
<
That medium -- that line drawn here -- would grow up to be = the Internet.
As all of us know, in 30 years the Internet has progressed a lot.
<
In fact, if you see = these big purple circles dotted on the map, each purple circle = represents one million Internet nodes.
These aren't even the number of = users -- these are the numbers of entry points through which users can = access the Net.
It almost looks like you're looking as something from = Wargames or some other nuclear holocaust film -- the world map is = cratered with hundreds of these circles.
There are also smaller circles = representing smaller numbers of access points -- 100,000, nodes 10,000, = etc.
But as impressive as all this appears, one of the first things = you'll notice is the plethora of circles we have over western Europe, = North America the Pacific Rim, and to a lesser extent, South America.
= Compare that with what you see over Africa and the majority of Asia.
= You can detect a huge disparity, even in something as simple as a map.
= Keep this image in mind for a while.
The map clearly raises the question of Internet equity.
<
<
<
For example, if you've got a household earning $75,000 or more each = year, you're 20 times more likely to have Net access at home than those = at the lowest income levels.
Only 6.6% of people with an elementary = school education or less use the Internet -- that's barely one in 20 of = them.
In rural areas, if you have a college degree, you're 26 times = more likely to have Internet access than those folks with an elementary = school education.
One last example: those people with college degrees = or higher are 10 times more likely to have Internet access at work than = people with only some high school education.
Numbers like this suggest = that we've got a digital divide based largely on education and income = levels.
Certainly there are also racial and demographic aspects of the = digital divide, but we're finding a lot more general agreement on the = digital divide in regards to income and education issue when it comes = to access.
Now let's compare this briefly with Internet access in American = schools.
<
We're now at the point where about 63% of U.S. = classrooms have Internet access.
Two out of three -- not so bad, I = suppose.
It sounds even better when you look at where things stood five = years ago, when classroom Net access was under five percent.
But if you = take the current numbers and break them down based on a school's = community income level, you'll find serious disparities.
Seventy-four = percent of high-income classrooms have Internet access, whereas only = 39% of low-income classrooms have Internet access.
<
That's not good news, but even worse, when you compare these levels = with last year's levels, you'll find that there's been no progress = whatsoever when it comes to low-income schools.
Two years in a row: = 39%.
The statisticians who worked on these surveys checked their = numbers over and over but the data remained the same.
Stagnation.
Even = though all of this money is flowing into schools for Internet access, = something's been getting in the way of low-income schools rolling out = access in individual classrooms.
There are plenty of suspects -- budget = constraints, old buildings, and so on.
Whatever the culprit may be, it = still leaves us with the fact that there isn't equitable Internet = access in our schools yet.
Maybe a few years down the road, but there's = still a lot of work to do.
<
Based on everything I've said so far, you might sit back and say to = yourself that this digital divide thing is basically an access issue.
= 
Access, = access, access! Sure, access is an important piece of it -- if you = don't have Internet access, there's pretty much no contest determining = which side of the digital divide you're on. (laughter) 
But the whole reason I'm here in front of you today is to get you to = challenge yourself with this question -- Is the digital divide really = just an access issue? I'd like to posit that the divide is only = partially about access.
There are several other factors that are just = as important, and I'd like to spend my time up here examining some of = these factors.
<
<
First, we've got literacy.
By literacy, I mean everything from basic = reading skills to cyber fluency, where you're able to utilize all the = tools and interpret all the content you might find.
Second, we've got = to examine content issues.
And by content, I don't mean just the = ability to receive information relevant to your families and your = communities -- but also the ability to create the content that's = relevant for you as well.
Third, we'll take a look at the importance of = fostering strategic local digital divide initiative that directly focus = on community development.
We're not talking about initiatives that = simply give people Internet access for the sake of giving them access = -- it's developing a technological infrastructure that's appropriate = for your community, creating the skills to use it and getting it to = work well in order to raise the quality of life for your citizenry.
= Unless we're able to consider the divide from multiple perspectives, = we'll only be tackling the issue in a limited way.
Access, access, = access will not solve the digital divide.
<
<
Let's take a closer look at literacy.
If every single person in your = school and community had Internet access at home tomorrow, would that = really solve the digital divide? Not necessarily -- if you're not truly = literate with your language skills and your technology skills, having = Internet access sitting right in front of you won't do you much good.
= Take for example adult literacy.
The 
Department of Education's
Unless we're able to = overcome basic as well as functional illiteracy, the digital divide = will have no prospects of ever being solved.
<
Also, we have to recognize that literacy isn't as simple as effective = reading and writing.
There's a whole spectrum of literacy skills that I = would need to develop in order to harness the potential of the = Internet.
On one end of the spectrum are the literacy issues we're all = familiar with: basic literacy and functional literacy.
Beyond that, you = also have to consider technological literacy.
Take this computer = sitting here at the podium with me.
Once I've turned this laptop on -- = assuming I even know how to turn it on -- would I have the = technological literacy skills needed to use it effectively? Am I going = to know how to use Netscape in order to go on the Web? Do I have any = clue how to use a search engine successfully? Can I use Microsoft Word = to create that resume I've been meaning to get done? These are the = types of technology literacy skills we need to think about.
Lastly, we = need to consider the issue of information literacy -- can I take the = content that's out there on the Internet and analyze its value to me? = Will I be able to judge its value and apply it to my needs = successfully? 
<
As educators, of course, you've been dealing with basic and functional = literacy issues throughout your careers, so for the sake of time I = won't go into much more detail on those points.
Instead, let's briefly = concentrate on the other two issues: technological literacy and = information literacy.
Now we all know there's an important link between = technological literacy and the state of professional development in = schools today.
If you as teachers don't have the skills to use the = technology effectively, how on earth can you be expected to integrate = the technology into your lessons and have the students utilize it? It = just doesn't make any sense.
<
As it is right now, the most recent data coming from the 
As low as that is, it's actually progress -- a similar = survey one year earlier suggested that only 20% of educators -- one in = five -- felt their tech skills were high enough to give them confidence = when developing technology-integrated lesson plans.
But even with this = progress, that still means two out of three teachers don't feel = comfortable with technology.
Forget about student's technological = literacy for a moment -- it most cases, they know a lot more about = technology that you do.
There's still a lot of learning that needs to = be done on the teacher's side as well.
<
It certainly pays off when you have robust professional development: = Teachers with 32 or more hours of tech training are twice as likely to = use computers than are teachers with no training.
And if you talk to = many experts in technology planning, they'll often recommend that 30% = of a school's technology budget should be spent on professional = development.
In other words, almost one-third of your tech spending = should be dedicated to in-service opportunities.
Unfortunately, the = national average is only three percent -- just one-tenth of what's = recommended.
Let's face it -- current in-service is inadequate.
= Teachers on average receive less than 13 hours of tech training per = year, and that's just not enough to cultivate the technological fluency = needed.
On top of all this, 40% of all teachers have never received any = kind of professional development regarding technology.
<
There's so much work to be done -- especially when you consider how = many new teachers will be coming into the profession over the next = decade.
Most estimates expect no less than a shortage of two million = teachers in the next ten years.
A significant percentage of today's = teachers will be retiring soon, just when we're getting ready to feel = the impact of what's sometimes called the Baby Boom Reflection -- in = other words, the grandkids of baby boomers will soon be entering our = nation's schools.
<
In many ways, it's almost a no-brainer to say that we need to put a lot = more effort into pre-service technology professional development.
= Schools of education are beginning to address this more -- for example, = we have this national 
It's a federal program = that's been funding $75 million a year for schools of education to = create replicable edtech professional development for pre-service = teachers.
The only problem, though, is that even though the current = administration is trying to double PT3 funding to $150 million a year, = recent congressional appropriation activities have potentially nixed = the program altogether for the next fiscal year.
We'll have to wait and = see what happens next.
<
<
Let's talk about information literacy.
We all know that it's important = for us to be able to analyze and use the content we find on the Web.
= But what if I don't know how to recognize fact versus opinion, truth = versus lies, or biased versus unbiased? What if I just assume that = everything I find online is true -- what sort of effective citizen or = student would I be? It's vital to be able to judge your sources, to = gauge their biases or veracity -- and this includes all of us, = including students and teachers.
Just to give you an example of what = can happen when you accept Internet content at face value, let me tell = you a story.
<
You may recall that in the summer of 1997 that Pol Pot, the leader of = Cambodia's 
Some people had = thought he was dead.
Others though he was hiding in the Cambodian = jungle, or in the dense hill country of Thailand or Vietnam.
But then = word came from the Cambodian jungle that he was indeed still alive.
No = journalists at this point had seen him in person, but word began to = flow out of northwestern Cambodian that Pol Pot was on the run from = both Cambodian authorities and Khmer Rouge soldiers who had turned = against him.
<
One day during that summer, a Swedish PR firm with a Web site called 
Now 
As part of its mock-up site, the folks in Sweden posted a = fake story on the site with the headline "Pol Pot Reconfirms Presence = in Stockholm."
In other words, the site suggested that Pol Pot had = successfully fled from Cambodia and had been granted exile in Sweden.
= To top off the text of the story, they also decided to post a photo of = a short man with glasses.
He might be Asian, but who can really tell? = -- nobody's seen this guy in public in over 20 years.
<
Unfortunately a couple of wire services stumbled onto the site and = picked up the story.
(Even today, if you 
It was as if the 
Spread the word: Pol Pot's in Sweden, he's been granted exile.
= (laughter) Well, I read about the story and thought it was pretty = interesting.
I happened to be at a conference when this was going on -- = the 
Since = there were so many teachers attending the conference, I thought it = would be fun to put on my own little unscientific experiment to see how = they reacted to the site.
NECC is one of those huge conferences with = thousands of teachers and lots of major sponsors, so when you're there = you're pretty much guaranteed Internet access -- rows of Macs and PCs = set up for you to check email and so on.
So I planted myself in front = of one of these rows of computers and logged onto my email account.
I = then reached over to the empty computer next to mine and quietly opened = up the 
<
Within a few minutes a teacher approached the computer and was getting = ready to check her email account.
Before she could log on, she saw the = 
Soon I heard = her mutter to herself, "Oh my God, I can't believe it."
<
"What is it?" I asked her innocently.
<
"Pol Pot's gone to Sweden," she exclaimed.
"It's on this 
He's in Stockholm of = all places."
"Well that's amazing," I replied.
"What's the source? Where are you = getting this from?"
"Oh, the 
"You mean that 
"Yeah, 
= "I'll have to write my husband about this...."
Eventually the woman left, having let her friends and family know about = what she had learned.
I might have left as well but I was having so = much fun with this experiment I decided to hang out for another 45 = minutes or so. (laughter) In that period, 12 teachers visited the site, = and only one of the 12 expressed any skepticism.
The one who did, = though, raised a good question: "If this is 
Now I know this is an extreme example that doesn't happen every day, = but it still raises an important point.
If we as teachers are going to = expect our students to develop strong information literacy skills, we = too have to be on our toes at all times.
We ourselves must know how to = go to a site and judge its veracity, judge its potential biases.
If we = don't set a good example in front of our students, we'll effectively be = encouraging them to go out on the Web and accept content at face value: = "It has to be true -- I found it on the Internet."
One of the beauties of the Internet is that anyone with HTML skills can = create a Web site that looks just as good and just as authoritative as = a professionally-designed Web site.
In many ways this is great -- it = empowers all of us as content authors.
But it also makes it all to easy = for some to create content that's meant to manipulate and deceive = people.
Unless we're able to teach our students and ourselves the = skills to be mindful and vigilant when it comes to content, it'll mean = there's a whole aspect of literacy skills we'll be neglecting.
<
<
Next we've got the issue of content.
The Internet is truly as powerful = as the content that's available on it and the people who are sharing = that content.
Earlier this spring, a group known as 
They surveyed citizens of underserved communities to find out = what their content needs were, and compared these needs with the = resources currently available on the Net.
What they found out was that = content often was not meeting the needs of these citizens.
There just = wasn't enough content appropriate for their job interests, appropriate = for their language or education level, etc.
In contrast, we all know = it's not hard at all to find Web sites with content like, "There's a = sale going on at JC Penney's" or "Print this coupon and get a second = latte for free when you buy one at your neighborhood Starbucks."
So = much content is consumer oriented, seeing people as consumers instead = of citizens.
<
Among these were the lack of local = information, literacy barriers, language barriers and a lack of = cultural diversity.
<
<
Let's consider the need for local information.
It's pretty common for a = big city like New York or Chicago to have commercial community = services.
<
These sites = are full of interesting information that's been made available for you.
= In many ways these can be powerful services, but because they're = market-driven, it only makes sense for a dot-com to select communities = that have sizeable populations.
If you grew up like I did in 
That would be really nice, but it's not exactly realistic.
= Towns like Indialantic just don't have the population to attract = for-profit community services.
So despite the success of CitySearch and = other services, they don't have the capacity to reach every community, = every neighborhood in America.
Of course, there are other ways = to....
(audience member stands up to ask a question)
AC: Yes, jump right in with your question.
Q: With this being the case, doesn't it make sense for communities to = create the content themselves?
AC: You must have seen Slide 13, I guess.
(laughter) Yes, absolutely.
= We'll get to that in just a moment.
If we can continue with a look at commercial services for a moment, = there are also commercial directory services like 
These services = don't create local content on a community-by-community basis.
They = create a directory template that can highlight anything on the Internet = that's already been created for a particular community.
So if we take = another look at my hometown of Indialantic, Florida, population 2800, = you'll actually find an 
Yahoo! is serving as a = disinterested directory of community content, but they have no direct = interest or experience in the communities themselves.
They're not able = to put a true community perspective on it themselves.
<
On the nonprofit side of local content, we've got community networks to = consider.
These initiatives go directly to your point -- letting the = communities themselves create their own content.
In hundreds of towns = around the country, they're creating free community web content because = they know there's little chance of a commercial service coming in and = creating quality content for them.
I'll go into more detail on = community networks when I talk about local initiatives in a few = minutes.
There's one last thing regarding local content I'd like to mention.
At = 
As their name would suggest, = they're a dot-com, and what they're trying to do is create free = community newspaper Web sites for around 8500 communities around the = country, with populations as low as 2,500 per town.
These are the towns = that are too small to attract major community online service companies.
= Out2.com is creating a simple newspaper template, not unlike a free = community newspaper you might pick up each Sunday morning.
It's not = very high-tech, it's not very snazzy, but it's a medium through which = anyone in that community who's online can share information on what's = going on.
The town's citizens determine for themselves what types of = information they want to share with their neighbors.
The company makes = its money through targeted advertising that keeps the community = publishing tool free to all citizens.
It'll be interesting to see in a = year's time how successful this service will be, because it could serve = as a model for allowing citizens to create relevant community content = without having to invest in starting up a full-size community network = service.
<
Literacy barriers -- if you're creating content for a particular = audience, it also has to be understandable to that audience.
The = Internet, as we all know, is still very much a text-heavy medium.
Sure, = it's getting more multimedia-friendly, but for the most part, I would = be the majority of Web sites you use on any given day are almost = completely text-driven.
As long as text-driven sites are the rule, in = order to take part in the Internet you'll need to know how to read = text, how to write text.
If you don't have the skills to do this well, = you'll be left out.
<
If you look at lots of Web sites, the content that's currently out = there is often written for people with higher levels of education.
= Think about the history of the Internet -- its early years were = dominated by tech geeks. (laughter) These were folks who were mostly = researchers, grad students, professors -- people who had graduate-level = educations and were sharing information with each other.
The Internet = then caught on among those people who could afford access to it -- = better incomes, better education level.
The overall demographics of the = Internet have begun to come closer to mainstream America, but the = majority of the content you find on the Internet is still written with = an educated audience in mind.
If you go to a community in which its = citizens have been unable to achieve a certain level of education, they = may simply not have the literacy skills to take advantage of the = Internet.
If we really want to provide content that will be of use to = underserved communities, we need to recognize that the language used in = this content will be as accessible and as easy-to-understand as = possible.
<
Some people might point out that the Internet is evolving rapidly, that = streaming multimedia may soon solve these issues because you'll be able = to visualize and listen to content instead of read it.
Of course, we've = got a certain level of these media online today.
It'll be a wonderful = time when we all have the bandwidth to take advantage to robust = streaming media, but the irony of it all is that that citizens who = could truly take advantage of streaming media -- people with low = literacy skills -- are the least likely to have the bandwidth necessary = to use it.
Streaming media takes up a lot more bandwidth than text, and = for now, bandwidth is still expensive to many of us.
<
<
Language barriers -- the Internet is in many ways an English-only = environment.
Surveys suggest that around 87% of Internet content is in = English only.
Whether you're visiting Web sites that have been created = in Bombay or Bangkok, there's a good chance that the creators of the = site will have developed it in English in order to reach the largest = audience.
There's no doubt that English is the lingua franca of the Net = - but does that leave room for all the other languages of the world? = What do we do about the billions of people who don't speak English? The = folks at 
There's also an issue regarding languages and fonts.
The majority of = Western European languages are based on a Latin script, so even if = French or German doesn't dominate the Web, you can still easily post = content in those languages.
When you take a look at all the variants of = Arabic script, Indian scripts and other Asian scripts, you find that = some languages have been forced to represent their scripts in graphical = format since there aren't fonts that easily display them as Web text.
= Graphics, of course, take up more bandwidth than text, so it takes more = bandwidth to have a Web site that uses graphics to represent Mandarin = or Turkish than it would to have a translated site in English.
What = kind of incentive will a particular culture have to go online if no = one's bothered to create a simply way of displaying their language? 
Of course, there are some languages that aren't written at all, many of = which are dying off because their native speakers are dwindling.
= Whether it's one of the many Native American languages or the oral = cultures of Africa and Southeast Asia, we've got to consider just how, = if at all, these languages might be spoken eventually online.
If you're = living on the Rez in the Southwestern U.S. and your tribe doesn't have = a written language tradition, will your community be able to take = advantage on the Net in your native tongue, or will it have to resort = to English? 
It's possible to make the argument that the number of Web sites in a = particular language is a function of the number of tech-savvy = individuals that happen to speak that language.
English is dominant on = the Web because there are millions of English speakers with HTML = skills.
If you go online, you're now more likely to see content = originating from South America, from India, the Pacific Rim or the Arab = world, because these regions have produced enough technology-literate = individuals to pioneer language-appropriate content.
They all have = increasing numbers of young people graduating with IT skills, who in = turn go off and become IT entrepreneurs or online community leaders.
= Countries that lack the critical mass of tech-savvy citizens will find = it much harder to find content directly relevant to them.
<
<
Lastly in regards to content I'd like to mention cultural diversity.
= Just a couple of weeks ago, 
Based = on their research, the average Internet user in May 2000 is 33 years = old, white, with a college background and a family income of $67,000 = per year.
Now how many of you happen to be this person exactly? = (laughter - one person in 300+ raises her hand.
Andy waves at her.)
<
Congratulations for being average! (laughter) Now you'll also note the = data didn't say whether the average user was male or female -- that's = because so many women are now online, we're just shy of achieving = gender parity, just short of 50-50.
Beyond that, when it comes to age, = when it comes to color, when it comes to education and income levels, = the Net's not even close to becoming a truly diverse place.
Now some = progress, indeed, is being made -- several recent reports have = suggested progress in America's Latino community, for example.
If this = is the case, that's good news.
<
When it comes to creating content for different cultural groups, = though, businesses will naturally prefer to target groups in the = aggregate -- in other words, content targeting the entire = Spanish-speaking population or African American population.
If you've = got a group of people numbering in the many millions, there's a chance = you'll be able to create a service for them and make some money off of = it.
This is why we're finally beginning to see content targeting large = demographic groups -- 
It takes a lot of work to produce robust, = marketable content, so it makes sense to create content with the widest = audience.
<
But approaches like this mean you're only looking at demographic groups = in the broadest sense.
It's much more difficult for a commercial online = service to market content for a specific subset of a larger group.
For = example, there are several major online services targeting Latinos as a = whole, but they don't necessarily differentiate between different = groups of Latinos.
A third-generation Cuban American family has a = different perspective and different needs that a family of recent = Guatemalan immigrants working as migrant farmers in the Pacific = Northwest.
Different groups have different needs, even if they're in = many ways part of a much larger cultural unit.
What can we do to make = sure the particular content needs of these unique communities are = addressed?
<
Lastly, I'd like to talk a bit about what's going on with the digital = divide at the local level.
In many ways you can make the argument that = the digital divide is a community health issue -- in other words, = increasing involvement in the IT sector can improve the overall = prosperity and education level of an entire community.
From 1995 to = 1998, eight percent of our total national economic output came from the = IT sector.
However, in that same period, IT represented over 1/3 of our = total economic growth.
Innovations in the digital world have been the = juggernaut driving our recent economic prosperity.
Additionally, by = 2006, 50% of all US jobs will be in the IT sector or will require = information technology skills.
As it is right now, high-tech workers = make 78% more money than that overall working population average.
IT = skills will continue to become more important to economic success.
The = more skills you have, the more advantage you'll have in the digital = economy.
<
Here's an easy way to think about it.
I like to call this Carvin's = Community Infrastructure Chicken 
If you've got a = community with a critical mass of high-skilled workers, they'll be able = to attract new businesses.
As these new businesses begin to grow, they = in turn will attract even more high-skilled workers.
The more skilled = workers you have, the more likely you'll be able to bring in new = businesses and even more skilled workers, adding up to more local = prosperity.
Unfortunately there's a flip side to this theory as well.
= Communities that have few high-skilled tech workers are much less = likely to attract new businesses that rely on skilled workers.
And if = you don't have a successful business base, you're also less likely to = attract additional skilled workers.
If I'm a kid from a poor community = who manages to get strong IT skills, am I more likely to stay locally = where there are few businesses, or will I head out to Silicon Valley or = Seattle, where they can't hire people fast enough? I'm gonna head out = west.
That's where the money is.
That's where the IT economy is being = driven.
It's difficult to attract new business to a community that = lacks the skills and the entrepreneurial base to support it.

What can be done to help improve the prospects of our communities? One = major thing you can do is forge local strategic partnerships that bring = opportunities, information and skills to your citizens.
Admittedly, = there are some wonderful programs happening at the national level.
At = the same time, though, much of the work has to happen at the local = level, because communities themselves know best what their needs are.
= Here are some examples of the types of activities we're beginning to = see out there.

First we have community technology centers, or CTCs.
These are = neighborhood centers that offer free Internet access, tech skills = training and other opportunities that allow the members of their = community to come in and develop their skill sets.
There are around 350 = CTCs currently affiliated with 
CTCs are usually non-profit and = sometimes have full-time staff, though often volunteers are necessary = to keep their programs sustainable.
You find them at libraries, at = YMCAs, you find them at church centers -- they're in a diverse range of = community environments.
<
A couple of examples worth looking at: in Washington DC, not too far = from where I work, is the 
They received money a few years ago from Bill Gates to = create an Internet lab that's earmarked for student use after school.
= Of course, it's also important to offer parents a chance to utilize the = technology, so the library offers a range of IT training opportunities, = from how to use Word to create a resume to how to make PowerPoint = presentations.
They've created a place where everyone in the community = can come together and learn how to use technology effectively.
= Similarly, here in New York, you've got the 
They work = closely with

Very much related to this issue are workforce training programs.
These = are neighborhood programs that focus on technology skills training; = they're meant to serve as a place where people can come to gain new = skills and find out about potential job opportunities in their area.
= For example, in Washington DC there's 
What they've done is = partner with neighborhood community technology centers, including = several local churches.
Anyone in these neighborhoods can come in and = take classes introducing them to computers and Internet, as well as = learn how to create Web sites, Excel spreadsheets, and other skills = that can potentially improve an individual's job prospects.
Up in = Boston, there's a program called 
Cityskills, like = Byte Back, offers a range of training opportunities, but they're also = trying to serve as "infomediaries" -- in other words, they serve as a = broker for not only job skills, but job placement as well.
Employers = can come in and describe what their IT needs are.
Cityskills can then = frame their training opportunities to fit these needs, and then help = match recently-trained citizens with the jobs that are out there.
<
One last example of a successful workforce training program: in = California's there's 
As the name = suggests, the history of BAVC is rooted in video production.
Since the = 1970's they've offered cutting-edge video facilities for independent = producers and nonprofits.
But they've also become leaders in advanced = multimedia training for the general public.
The Bay Area may be at the = cutting edge of the digital economy, but there were still lots of = citizens who didn't have the skills to benefit from it.
BAVC offers = over 350 hundred courses each year in multimedia and video, with over = 5000 people a year taking part in the programs.
By completing this = training, many citizens are finding themselves getting jobs of $40,000 = a year -- well above the minimum wage salaries they might have made = previously.
BAVC and these other programs are all pioneers in their = communities.
We all need to pay serious attention to them in order to = understand the impact they're having and what we can do to encourage = their further success.
<
<
They have = a long history -- the idea's been around since the bulletin board = services on the 1980s, which were slow and text-based, but offered = robust community content.
Some of these services were also what were = called FreeNets -- in other words, free networks, services where = members of the community could access the Internet for free.
Today, = there are hundreds of community networks around the US.
Most of them = are now Web-based, and many still maintain an emphasis on community = activism and civic participation.
In other words, the community network = becomes a virtual space for community action, where people can come = together and discuss their local needs, both online and offline needs.
= Citizens can then create content and services that they deem are = locally important.
In Austin, Texas, for example, the 
= Many of the pages you'll find are in Spanish as well as English, and = they give citizens the chance to express themselves and share what's = important in their lives.
The network also offers information on the = neighborhood itself, including its history, its current activities, and = the organizations that serve the community.
<
Another example worth visiting is the 
One = of the oldest and most active community networks, BCN offers its users = virtual "centers" on a range of issues.
If you want to learn about = local job opportunities, you can visit the employment center.
If you = want to learn about public safety, you can visit the emergency services = center.
If you want to get involved in elderly issues, go to the senior = center.
The network gives the residents of Boulder a place where they = can get access to information and engage each other.
As great as it is = to attend the local city council meeting or school board meeting, these = are still discreet events that only happen at a certain time and place.
= Virtual community centers allow citizens to remain engaged in the = issues whenever they want to be engaged.

The last type of local initiatives I'd like to highlight are = school-community partnerships.
What can schools do to raise technology = involvement and technology skills locally?
First, let's look at what can go on inside the schools themselves.
Up = in Olympia, Washington, you've got the 
= This helps prevents teachers from scrambling to figure out how to use = the Internet on their own.
Students apply for the program and are then = given a course in technology skills, and also learn how to be a = successful and diplomatic mentor with an adult.
(laughter) Once they've = mastered these skills, they're sent back out into the classroom where = they partner with teachers and help them with their technology needs.
= This helps the teacher to concentrate on teaching while the student can = concentrate on technology needs.
And over time, the teachers become = more comfortable with their own technology skills, while the students = hopefully become a bit more understanding of what a teacher has to go = through on a daily basis.
(laughter)
We should also keep in mind the growing number of opportunities where = students are becoming serious content producers.
The 
It's an online competition that = encourages students to create Web sites about their communities and = what makes their communities special.
Students work with community = leaders and local organizations to highlight local history, cultural = activities and attractions, and so on.
For smaller communities with no = previous online content, CyberFair serves as a major breakthrough, = where students become the driving force for creating content relevant = to local life.
They become pioneering Internet citizens for their = towns.
<
We should also consider the question of what can be done to encourage = schools to become education technology centers (ETCs) -- a school's = answer to a CTC.
Now if you think about what's going on in our schools = when it comes to the Internet, we're spending over two billion dollars = a year in 
This investment means that schools are becoming = significant technology hubs within their communities.
In some = communities, this just means that schools are finally catching up with = the rest of the area.
But in many other places, schools are fast = becoming the only place in the community that has a high level of = technology, Internet access and IT training.
Yet too many of these = schools still lock their doors at 3pm and throughout the weekend.
Too = many of them don't offer technology opportunities to parents and other = local adults.
<
What can we do to facilitate schools to become Education Technology = Centers for their communities? What steps need to be taken to ensure = that schools can indeed be open for their communities? It's not easy, = of course -- communities in which such programs have developed are = unfortunately few and far between -- but we've got to make an effort to = identify them, to understand how they've succeeded and how they've = overcome obstacles like staffing, liability issues, etc.
If for = whatever reason schools can't host it themselves, can their = infrastructure be leveraged in some other way that can help the = community? We've put so much time and money into turning our schools = into high-tech centers, it would almost be a crime to not try to = leverage these resources for the rest of the community.
<
Well, my time has run short, so before I go, I'd just like to let you = know that if you want to learn more about the digital divide, I would = encourage all of you to visit the 
It's got all sorts of useful information regarding the = digital divide, including news, research, case studies, information on = initiatives and grant programs.
We also have a 
There are currently over = 700 members from around the world, all discussing the divide from = different points of view.
Feel free to give me a business card with = your email address and I'd be glad to sign you up.
So I thank you for your time -- I know I've taken up a lot of it.
