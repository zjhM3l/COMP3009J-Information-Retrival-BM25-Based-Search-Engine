Chapter 3 - Sponsorship Revenue
Industry Practice
A major source of revenue generated by a sports franchise is sponsorship revenue.
Most sports franchises solicit local sponsors that want to be associated with the sport franchise's team name.
Most notably, a sports franchise may have an official team bank, an official team television station, an official team radio station, an official team healthcare provider, etc.
Sponsors pay significant sums of money to enter into these contracts, which usually cover multiple years.
Unlike other categories of revenue, local area sponsorship revenue is generally not shared with other sports franchises in the league.
The sponsorship agreements entered into, for the most part, represent advertising contracts.
The sponsors receive specified advertising spots in radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, and team print media.
Additionally, the sponsors usually receive stadium signage.
The sports franchise usually receives significant advance payments from the various sponsors upon signing the contract, with periodic payments to be made during the remainder of the contract term.
Often the sports franchise's tax return will reflect less than the total amount received during the initial year as current income.
The remaining amount received will usually be reflected as deferred revenue.
Depending on the length of the contract and the nature of the advance payment, some portion may be designated as long-term deferred revenue.
Instead of including advance payments on multiple year sponsorship contracts in gross income during the tax year received, sports franchises often report advance payments prorata over the term of the contracts.
Some contracts designate a portion of the advance payment as "exclusivity."
This term indicates the vendor is the exclusive sponsor in a particular business segment (such as banking, television, radio, healthcare, etc.).
The payment made for exclusivity is usually reported by sports franchises as income over the life of the contract, with the currently recognized portion representing only the current year's prorata share.

Audit Issue
It should be determined whether the sports franchise has improperly deferred the reporting of sponsorship revenue.
More specifically, whether the sports franchise is unable to rely on the income deferral provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549, because: 1.
The sponsorship agreement provides for the provision of services after the end of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year in which the advance payments are received, and for sponsorship agreements conferring exclusivity rights.
2.
The advance payment is for property rights, rather than the provision of services by the sports franchise.
Tax Law
Prepaid Income
Under IRC section 451(a), "General Rule.
The amount of gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless, under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income, such amount is to be properly accounted for as from a different period."
Treas.
Reg. section 1.451 1(a) provides "***Under an accrual method of accounting, income is includible in gross income when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy.***"
A fixed right to receive income occurs when: (a) the taxpayer's required performance takes place; (b) payment is due; or (c) payment is received, whichever occurs first.
Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963), and Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177.
The history behind former IRC section 452 reflects Congressional intent to limit tax deferrals of prepaid income to just those narrow areas specifically provided by Congress (such as IRC sections 455 and 456).
Former IRC section 452 permitted the deferral of prepaid income.
The purpose of IRC section 452 was to bring tax accounting more in line with accepted business accounting for prepaid income.
When IRC sections 452 and 462 (which allowed deductions for reserves for estimated expenses) were enacted with the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the estimated revenue loss was $45 million.
A year later, after the American Institute of Accountants estimated the tax revenue loss resulting from these provisions to be around $500 million, Congress retroactively repealed IRC sections 452 and 462.

Revenue Procedure 71-21
Rev. Proc. 71-21 was published "to implement an administrative decision, made by the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion under section 446, to allow accrual method taxpayers in certain specified and limited circumstances to defer the inclusion in gross income for Federal income tax purposes of payments received (or amounts due and payable) in one taxable year for services to be performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year."
[underlining added]
Per section 2 of Rev. Proc. 71-21:
In general, tax accounting requires that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt.
*** The purpose of this Revenue Procedure is to reconcile the tax and financial accounting treatment of such payments in a large proportion of these cases without permitting extended deferral in the time of including such payments in gross income for Federal income tax purposes.
Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 71-21 provides:
An accrual method taxpayer who, pursuant to an agreement (written or otherwise), receives a payment in one taxable year for services, where all of the services under such agreement are required by the agreement as it exists at the end of the taxable year of receipt to be performed by him before the end of the next succeeding taxable year, may include such payments in gross income as earned through the performance of the services, subject to the limitations provided in sections 3.07, 3.08, and 3.11.
However, if the inclusion in gross income of payments received is properly deferred under the preceding sentence and for any reason a portion of such services is not performed by the end of the next succeeding taxable year, the amount allocable to the services not performed must be included in gross income in such succeeding year, regardless of when (if ever) such services are performed.
[underlining added]
Section 3.03 provides:
Except as provided in sections 3.04 and 3.05, a payment received by an accrual method taxpayer pursuant to an agreement for the performance by him of services must be included in his gross income in the taxable year of receipt if under the terms of the agreement as it exists at the end of such year: (a) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt; or (b) Any portion of the services is to be performed by him at an unspecified future date which may be after the end of the taxable year immediately succeeding the year of receipt.
[underlining added]
The Tax Court in T.F.H.
Publications, Inc. v. Commissioner, 72 T.C. 623 (1979), determined that "advertising is considered a service."
Thus, amounts received in advance for advertising are considered payments for future services to which Rev. Proc. 71-21 may apply.
Advance payments under television contracts are not services, but are considered a property right - the right to publicize the taxpayer's games.
Accordingly, a taxpayer cannot defer the reporting of the advance payments received for television contracts under Rev. Proc. 71-21.
The tax law section in Chapter 4 addresses the case law supporting this conclusion.

Tax Law Application
Advance payments received on most of a sports franchise's multiple year sponsorship contracts are unlikely to qualify for income deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21.
As addressed above, per Rev. Proc. 71-21 sections 3.02 and 3.03, advance payment for services is deferred under Rev. Proc. 71-21 only if the services are to be provided by the close of the next taxable year.
Accordingly, Rev. Proc. 71-21 only results in sponsorship income deferral if, under the specific sponsorship contract, the services are to be provided by the close of the sports franchise's tax year following the tax year during which the advance payment is received.
This results in most advance payments for multiple year sponsorship contracts being ineligible for deferral under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21.
For advance payments that are not excluded from Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral due to the requirement that the service be provided by the end of the tax year, following the tax year of receipt, only advance payments for services versus advance payments for property rights qualify for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral.
In this guide, "exclusivity rights" are defined as a sponsor's payments to a sports franchise to promote the sponsor's association with the sports franchise as the exclusive sponsor for the specific market segment or industry (banking, television, radio, health provider, etc.).
For advance payment issues on exclusivity rights, the primary argument is that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and then, if applicable, an alternative argument that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the subsequent tax year.
The distinction between property rights and services is further addressed in Chapter 4.
When the examiner determines a sports franchise is unable to rely on Rev. Proc. 71-21 for income deferral, it is not uncommon for the sports franchise to argue that its sponsorship income is deferred based on the application of general case law on prepaid services.
The case law on the taxation of fixed and definite prepaid services is addressed in Chapter 5.
Example
XYZ, a professional sports franchise, entered into a sponsorship agreement with a local bank to be the official bank of the sport franchise.
The contract provided the bank with a specified amount of advertising time during television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, as well as in the team magazine.
Additionally, the sports franchise agreed to do all of its banking with the sponsor and would encourage its employees to do the same.
The bank had the right to advertise itself as the official bank of the sports franchise.
The contract is for 5 years beginning on January 1, 1994, for a total contract price of $6 million.
The bank paid $4.2 million on execution of the contract, which represented a $3.75 million exclusivity rights fee and $450,000 for the first year's advertising.
On each anniversary date, the bank is to pay $450,000 until the end of the contract.
On its 1994 calendar year tax return, XYZ included in gross income $1.2 million on the bank sponsorship contract.
This included $450,000 for the first year's advertising and $750,000 for the first year's pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee (which is $3.75 million divided by 5 years equaling $750,000).
XYZ's balance sheet on December 31, 1994, reflected $3 million of deferred revenue (the $3.75 million total exclusivity rights fee less the $750,000 amount reported in 1994).
$750,000 of the $3 million was designated as a current liability, and $2.25 million was designated as long term liability.
On its 1995 and 1996 calendar year tax returns, XYZ reported $450,000 for the advertising fee paid in January and $750,000 for the pro rata share of the exclusivity rights fee which had been pre-paid.
At year end, XYZ's 1995 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $2.25 million, and XYZ's 1996 balance sheet reflected total deferred revenue of $1.5 million.
The sports franchise's tax reporting of the local bank sponsorship contract is summarized as follows:
Tax Year Advertising Fee Reported Pro Rata Exclusivity Fee Reported Exclusivity Fee Account Balance 1994 $450,000 $750,000 $3,000,000 1995 $450,000 $750,000 $2,250,000 1996 $450,000 $750,000 $1,500,000
During an examination of the sports franchise's 1994-1996 tax returns, the examiner determined the exclusivity rights fee advance payment was an advance payment for property rights.
The examiner's primary argument is Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because it is an advance payment for property rights versus an advance payment for services, and, alternatively, that Rev. Proc. 71-21 does not apply because the services are not provided by the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the advance payment was received.
The alternative argument applies, because under the agreement existing at the end of the tax year in which the advance payment was received (the January 1, 1994 contract constituted the terms of the agreement at December 31, 1994), the sports franchise's services (assuming not property rights) are to be provided after December 31, 1995 (the end of the year following the tax year in which the advance pavement is received).
The examiner's report adjustments are reflected as follows:
1994 1995 1996 IRC section 446 Adjustment $3,000,000 ($750,000) ($750,000) Total Adjustment $3,000,000 ($750,000) ($750,000)
The 1994 IRC section 446 adjustment includes in income the revenue improperly deferred to future years in the amount of $3 million.
The 1995 and 1996 IRC section 446 adjustments eliminate the $750,000 of income improperly deferred from 1994 that was erroneously reported in each of these years.
Because the examiner's case was closed unagreed, the examiner prepared a Form 5346, Examination Information Report, for the sports franchise's subsequent tax years which were not yet filed or due to be filed when the examiner closed his case.

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in determining whether you have one or more deferred sponsorship revenue issues include: 1.
All agreements, contracts, and other documents regarding corporate sponsors, such as official team bank, official team health care provider, etc., that remain in effect during the tax year under examination.
This includes all concession agreements.
2.
A breakdown of current versus deferred revenue (both current and long-term deferred revenue) by contract.
The breakdown of current versus deferred revenue should be tied to the income recognized during the current year, as well as the deferred revenue accounts on the return's balance sheet.
The sponsorship contracts provide specific information on what the sports franchise is providing (advertising, game tickets, etc.), as well as the specific payment, length, renewal, and other contract terms.
Additionally, the contracts sometimes call for other up-front fees and should define what the fees cover.
Since a tax distinction is made for advance payments for services and advance payments for property rights, the nature of the advance payments in question needs to be determined.
In the context of sports franchises, what is often referred to in contracts as exclusivity rights may, in fact, be property rights.
The precise nature of the payments as advertising or exclusivity rights can be determined by reference to the contracts themselves.
Exclusivity rights contracts expressly provide for the sale of the rights to use team logos and name on letterhead, etc., to promote the association with the team.
In some instances, the contracts refer to the transaction as a license.
In such a circumstance, the contracts may not be in exchange for services, but in exchange for the taxpayer's property interest in the publicity of its enterprise.
Proper application of the law for exclusivity rights would appear to require the examiner to first determine if the advance payment qualifies for Rev. Proc. 71-21 deferral (whether it is an advance payment for services or an advance payment for property rights) and then, only for advance payments for services, determine if the provisions of Rev. Proc. 71-21 are met.
However, because the determination of the nature of the payment (services versus property rights) may be less clear and more time consuming than determining the timing of the services, the examiner may want to first determine if the subsequent year rule is met before addressing the nature of the advance payments.
Because the sponsorship issue involves the timing of income, it constitutes a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for sponsorship revenue.
Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising sponsorship issues.
The IRC section 481(a) adjustment amount is the deferred income balance at the beginning of the first tax year examined.
The current year IRC section 446 adjustments are the yearly changes to the deferred income balances for each tax year beginning with the first year examined.
This is illustrated in the issue example given earlier in this chapter.
