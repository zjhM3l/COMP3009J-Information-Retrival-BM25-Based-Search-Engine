Interview on NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert Secretary Colin L. Powell Washington, DC September 7, 2003

MR. RUSSERT: Let me turn to North Korea.
One of your staff members, an Under Secretary of State, John Bolton, gave a speech, and this is how it was reported, that Kim Jong-il and his grip on the nation, the speech entitled, "Dictatorship at the Crossroads," described life in North Korea as a "hellish nightmare" and called Kim a "tyrannical rogue."
Is that helpful?
SECRETARY POWELL: It's accurate.
And John's speech was cleared within the Department, so there was nothing that was inconsistent with policy.
John happened to give it in Seoul at a time when were undergoing some delicate discussions with our friends and it got a great deal of attention, and it got a great deal of attention especially from the North Koreans.
But notwithstanding all of the attention it got, the North Koreans and all of our other neighbors in that part of the world came together in Beijing a few days after the speech to begin a six-party discussion about this problem.
MR. RUSSERT: Also this from The New York Times, however.
In an interview last year with The New York Times, John Bolton was asked about conflicting signals from the administration on North Korea.
He strode over to a bookshelf, pulled off a volume and slapped it on the table.
It was called The End of North Korea by an American Enterprise Institute colleague.
"That," he said, "is our policy."
Is that our policy?
SECRETARY POWELL: Our policy is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
It's also the policy of all of those participating in the six-party talks.
But if you think that I am any more of a fan of the North Korean regime than John Bolton is, that's wrong.
We know this regime.
We know the kind of regime it is.
We know about the prison camps that it keeps.
We know about its trafficking in drugs, its trafficking in counterfeit currency.
This is not a regime to be admired in any way.
But our policy right now is not to invade it or to overthrow it, but right now our policy is the denuclearization of the peninsula.
And then there are many other issues we have that we want to engage our friends on with respect to North Korea: these criminal activities that it participates in, as well as a large army it maintains at the expense of taking care of its people, and its proliferation of missiles and other technologies that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction.
So there's quite an agenda we have with the North Korean regime, and I think the success that we have had in recent months is making it not just an agenda between us and the North Koreans, but between us, the Russians, the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the North Koreans.
Six parties, not just two.
