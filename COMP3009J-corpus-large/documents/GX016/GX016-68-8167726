04/25/2002 EDITORIAL NUMBER=0-09845 KURDISH SERVICE TENTH ANNIVERSARY This week marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Kurdish Service of the Voice of America.
The first to broadcast in Kurdish, VOA serves a potential audience of some twenty-seven million Kurds.
Millions of Kurds have no source of reliable news and information in their own language.
And in Iraq, the Kurdish people have been victims of extreme repression.
United Nations investigators have verified mass killings of Kurds in Iraq and the destruction of thousands of villages by the regime of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Each day, VOA broadcasts to Kurdish-speakers in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East and Caucasus.
The service broadcasts in two major Kurdish dialects - Kurmanji [kurh-mahn-jee] and Sorani[soo-rah-nee]
The Kurdish service adheres strictly to the VOA charter, which requires that the news be presented in an accurate, objective, and comprehensive manner.
Consistent with the VOA charter, Kurdish broadcasts include news and information on events that affect Kurdish people everywhere.
In January of this year, the service introduced a weekly call-in show, "Hello Washington."
The goal is to increase audience discussion of such subjects as cultural rights and democratic representation for the Kurds.
The Kurds are considered to be the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East.
Among other fundamental rights, they have the right to receive and impart information and ideas in their own language.
For its part, the Voice of America, through its Kurdish service, will continue to help make that right a reality.
Kurdish listeners often express what it means to them to have a major international broadcast service that speaks to them in their own language.
"We thank you for this important work you do," wrote one listener.
