_________________________________________________________________ Civil Rights Concerns in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Area in the Aftermath of the September 11, 2001, Tragedies _________________________________________________________________ Chapter 2 Background on Arab, South Asian, Muslim, and Sikh Communities in the United States _________________________________________________________________ In planning the forum, the Inter-SAC Committee decided to focus on four overlapping communities in the national capital area that have been most severely affected by hate violence and discrimination related to September 11: Arabs, South Asians, Muslims, and Sikhs.
These "communities" are understood in their broadest sense, as including not only noncitizen immigrants but also naturalized U.S. citizens and U.S.-born Americans of these backgrounds.
In addition, the Committee identified Muslim women as a population with special concerns.
It is important at the outset to stress that the various labels, used at times indiscriminately in the media and in popular discourse, have distinct meanings and are not interchangeable.
"Arab" refers to language and culture; "Muslim" and "Sikh" refer to religion; while "South Asian" (like "Middle Eastern"[1]) refers to region of origin.
There is, of course, considerable overlap between the populations: for example, many--but not all--Arabs are also Muslims.
Panelists noted that some Americans are confused about the various labels, believing, for example, that "Muslim" and "Arab" mean the same thing,[2] or that turban-wearing Sikhs are Arab and Muslim when in fact they are neither.
This chapter briefly profiles each of the four main groups, explaining who is included and presenting selected data on the size, geographic distribution, and characteristics of each of these communities in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and nationwide.
It should be noted, however, that it is very difficult to gauge the size of these populations, either nationally or locally.
U.S. census data can in some cases provide rough estimates, but the census tends to undercount minority groups, and in any case does not ask about religious affiliation.
Arabs
Arabs are people who speak Arabic as their first language, numbering more than 200 million worldwide.[3] The "Arab world" consists of 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa where Arabic is the principal (although not the only) language spoken.[4]
Arabic-speaking people have come to the United States in several major waves, beginning in the late 19th century.
Although they share a common linguistic and cultural heritage, Arab Americans are a highly diverse group.
While all Arab countries have sent emigrants to this country, the majority of Arab Americans today are of Lebanese, Syrian, Egyptian, or Palestinian descent.[5] About three-quarters of Arab Americans are Christians (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant),[6]
However, a second wave of Arab immigration that started after World War II is predominantly Muslim, making Muslims the fastest-growing segment of the Arab American community.[8]
In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, according to one researcher's estimates, there are 60,000 to 70,000 immigrant Muslims and 25,000 African American Muslims.[
Eighty-two percent of persons of Arab descent in the United States are U.S. citizens, and 63 percent were born in this country
;[10] contrary to the stereotypes, Arab Americans are by no means completely or even mainly an immigrant group.[11]
As a group, Arab Americans are relatively young, have education and income above the U.S. average, and work mainly in white-collar occupations; many are small-business owners.
Diverse in their party affiliations, Arab Americans have held public office at many levels.[13]
South Asians
South Asians originate in the countries of the South Asian subcontinent, that is, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and Maldives.
(Afghanistan is not properly considered part of South Asia, although there are close ties.)
South Asians are linguistically, culturally, and religiously diverse, with large populations of Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, as well as many religious minorities.
The first significant South Asian immigration to the United States occurred around the turn of the 20th century, when Indian laborers, mainly Sikhs, made their way to California and the Pacific Northwest in response to recruitment by railroad, steamship, and lumber companies.[14] Congress barred immigration from Asia between 1918 and 1946, but immigration from across South Asia greatly accelerated with the immigration reform of 1965.
Today there are at least 2 million people of South Asian ancestry in the United States.
Indians are by far the largest group, with 1.7 million people reporting Indian origin in the 2000 census
; Pakistanis are second largest.[15] Some other researchers and organizations believe the totals to be much higher than the census figures indicate.[16]
The five urban areas with the largest Indian populations include the Washington/Baltimore metropolitan area as well as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.[19]
Muslims
Muslims are followers of Islam.
One of the three major monotheistic religions in the world, Islam calls for complete acceptance of and submission to the teachings and guidance of God.
Anyone may become a Muslim, regardless of gender, race, or nationality, by reciting a declaration of faith and embracing a lifestyle in accord with Islamic principles.
Specific acts, including fasting, daily prayer, and the pilgrimage to Mecca, are considered the pillars of Muslim spiritual life.[20]
There are an estimated 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide.
They live in every world region and belong to many different cultures and ethnic groups.
The 10 countries with the largest Muslim populations, in descending order, are Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, and China.[21] Of these, only Egypt is an Arab country, and despite the stereotypes, only 193 million of the world's Muslims--15 to 18 percent of the total--are Arabs.[22]
Although the presence of Muslims in the United States dates back to the 1500s, the first major wave of Muslim immigration took place in the late 19th century, with arrivals from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and other Arab lands.[23] Immigration of Muslims from many countries accelerated after 1965 and continues apace, as do conversions of U.S.-born Americans to Islam.
Estimates of the current number of Muslims in the United States vary from as low as 1.5 million to as high as 6-7 million, the latter figure being accepted by major Muslim organizations
.[24]
The number of mosques in this country has grown by 25 percent in the past seven years and now totals more than 1,200.[25]
The Muslim population in this country is ethnically diverse.
Immigrant Muslims come mainly from the South Asian and Arab countries, with smaller numbers from Africa, Iran, Turkey, and Southeast Asia.[26] There is also a growing population of American-born converts to Islam, most of them African Americans, making up perhaps a third of the total population of Muslims in the United States.[27]
In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, according to one researcher's estimates, there are 60,000 to 70,000 immigrant Muslims and 25,000 African American Muslims.[
] A recent survey of Muslims across the United States found this population to be predominantly young, well educated, and concentrated in professional, managerial, and technical occupations.[30]
Large majorities expressed support for robust participation in American life, including involvement with civic, charitable, and professional organizations, while also reporting that they are active at their mosque or other religious organization.
Sikhs
Sikhs are followers of the Sikh religion.
Founded in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century, Sikhism is a monotheistic faith that retains some elements of Islam and Hinduism while also defining important differences from them (rejecting, for example, the caste system).
It is the fifth largest religion in the world with an estimated 23 million adherents,[32] the majority of them in India, although there has been a substantial diaspora to other areas of the world.
Sikhs wear distinctive dress to signify commitment to their faith, including uncut hair covered by a turban and a small ceremonial sword known as a kirpan.
All Sikh men include "Singh" in their surnames and all Sikh women include "Kaur."
Although often perceived as foreign because of their turbans, Sikhs have lived in the United States for more than a hundred years.
Sikh immigrants first came to the Pacific Coast states around the turn of the 20th century to build railroads, farm, or work in mills and foundries.[33] Later, as Asian immigration picked up after 1965, Sikhs arrived in sizable numbers in various parts of the country.
Although no firm figures are available, the number of Sikhs in the United States today is estimated at around 500,000, with some 6,000 to 8,000 in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.[34] Although Sikh Americans, like others from South Asia and the Middle East, endured discrimination in employment and education,[35]
[1] Although used frequently in policy contexts, the term "Middle Eastern" is too broad to be a useful population identifier for the purposes of this report.
"The Middle East" is a loose designation referring to Southwest Asia along with parts of North Africa, and is usually taken to include the Arabic-speaking countries from Egypt east to the Persian Gulf, plus Israel and Iran and sometimes Turkey.
People who live in this region are diverse in language, culture, and religion.

[20] The two main branches of Islam, Sunni and Shi'a, have some doctrinal differences between them.
Worldwide, 85-90 percent of Muslims are Sunnis.
Each of these primary branches of Islam contains several different "schools" or sub-branches.
In addition, Sufism is a form of Islamic mysticism which, although a small minority, has greatly influenced the faith.
