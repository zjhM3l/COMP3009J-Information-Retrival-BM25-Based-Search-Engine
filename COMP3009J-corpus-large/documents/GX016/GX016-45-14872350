TITLE OF RESEARCH: EQUIPMENT AND METHODS TO PLANT PINES AND TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS ON SMALL LAND TRACTS
COMPANY: FLORIDA RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING CONSULTING SERVICES INC. RT. 4 BOX 1297H STARKE, FL 32091
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: DR. PAUL STILL
TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000 /6 MONTHS
Increasing numbers of people in the Southeast are moving onto small 5 to 50 acre tracts of land that are forested or were farm land.
This change in land use increases risk of property loss from wildfires, increases the percentage of timber resources in small tracts, and results in underutilized land resources.
Current equipment and methods used in forestry operations are based on large tracts of land using large high capital cost equipment.
This project will test compact lower capital cost equipment including a flail mower and a tiller mounted on a bidirectional compact 75 HP Antonio Carrao tractor.
The equipment will serve to mow understory woody plants to reduce fuel loads and to mow and till sites before planting trees.
Spray and wiper methods will be used to apply herbicides.
Two test sites in each of five Florida counties will be used to evaluate the equipment and methods.
A business model will be developed to help individuals decide if they want to provide forestry services to owners of small forest tracts.
Services would include mowing and herbicide treatment to reduce fuel loads, timber land maintenance to increase productivity of existing timber lands, and establishment of longleaf pines.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Once the equipment has been tested and the business model established, efforts would be undertaken in Phase II to set up individuals and businesses to deliver forestry services to the owners of small tracts of land.
Florida Recycling and Composting Consulting Services would coordinate training of individuals and businesses so they could expand the service of a current business or start new businesses.
Educational and informational programs would be developed to help inform the land owners of the advantage of timber management and of planting land in longleaf pines.
Grants would be sought to carry out the latter two activities.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: ALTERNATIVE CONTAINER DESIGN FOR LARGE ACREAGE REVEGETATION
COMPANY: BITTERROOT RESTORATION, INC. 445 QUAST LANE CORVALLIS, MT 59828

TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $69,550/18 MONTHS
Revegetation of arid lands disturbed by fire, or by cropping, mining, and other activities, represent a continuous and substantial expenditure by the responsible entities.
In 1999, the U.S. Department of Agriculture expenditures for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Washington were several million dollars.
Likewise, fire rehabilitation work accounts for several million dollars annually.
The dominant revegetation method currently used on large-acreage projects (i.e.,-fire rehabilitation) is helicopter seeding which has proven to be largely ineffective.
Standard containers have been developed for re-forestation and horticultural applications.
These containers are currently used in minor quantities for arid land reclamation.
Although highly successful in terms of plant survival and growth, these containers are not considered economically viable for large-scale projects.
An alternative container that allows for higher growing densities, short-term production intervals, and outplanting with the seeding would minimize economic inputs while allowing for maximum production.
Thus, BRI proposes to test the concept embodied in USDA-ARS "Booth Tube" as an alternative container for large acreage arid- land projects.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Our proposed alternative container design will provide substantial economical and ecological benefits to large acreage, arid land revegetation projects.
Economically, a smaller container size, which can be incorporated into a greenhouse production facility and mechanized planting system, could greatly reduce costs for implementing the use of containerized stock on a large-scale.
Thus, use of containerized material could become an economically viable alternative to seeding.
Ecologically, containers designed for outplanting that provides protection from wind shear, desiccation, browse and other typical arid land environmental factors could provide substantial survival benefits above reforestation containers.

Stored books and papers are being destroyed by acid deterioration and embrittlement at alarming rates.
The 1991 "A Preservation Plan for the National Agriculture Library reports that 53% of volumes in that library are either entirely or partially deteriorated due to this process.
The continual reprinting and copying that is needed to preserve documents, impacts the use of forest products.
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a new method to protect stored books and papers from ongoing acid deterioration and embrittlement.
Unless an economical method is found to protect these resources, most will be lost or require reproduction at great cost by copying onto the paper or by reformatting.
The effectiveness of alkaline materials to arrest acid deterioration of paper has been known for many years.
However, these agents continue to be difficult and expensive to apply.
The proposed research will develop a new concept, the infusion of protective alkaline agents into paper sheets.
Results will demonstrate that a simple.
effective and environmentally safe method of applying alkaline agents to deacidify paper is feasible.
Initial experiments have shown a high likelihood of success.
Libraries nationwide represent significant and viable outlets in need of this new technology.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Phase I work will demonstrate the feasibility of quickly infusing paper with alkaline materials that effectively stabilize it against the harmful effects of acids.
The engineering principles demonstrated will lead to the development of a mass deacidification method that can be simply and inexpensively applied to the millions of papers and books that need to be preserved in their original condition for posterity.
Considering current costs for deacidification, reprinting, electronic reformatting and special storage rooms to preserve manuscripts, development of this new technology will help the library and archival community save hundreds of millions of dollar annually.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: CONVERTING SAWMILL WASTE STREAM MATERIAL INTO HIGHER VALUE SOLID WOOD PRODUCTS
COMPANY: AUBURN MACHINERY, INC. 150 SUMMER STREET LEWISTON, ME 04240
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: MR. THOM L. LABRIE
TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
PROBLEM: There is a need to increase yield and reduce waste in most sawmills.
The conversion of waste stream material into higher valued products offers simultaneous solutions to both needs.
However, few recovery operations exist and data for study cannot be found.
Consequently, few sawmills believe that converting waste stream material into higher valued products offers a solution.
Millions of recoverable solid wood fiber tons are annually reduced into low value chips, mulch and fuel.
Meanwhile, sawmills continue suffering from reduced availability of forest resources, higher raw material costs, growing waste disposal problems, increased global competition, and more pressure to operate in an Environmentally Friendly manner.
PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the feasibility for converting waste stream material into higher valued products while justifying a viable solution to increasing yield, reducing waste volume and generating revenue for implementation of a profitable on or off site Recovery Value Adding (RVA) operation.
DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT: The project entails collecting waste stream material from five different types of hardwood sawmills, converting the material into uniform blanks into a range of varying Value Added products, identifying customers and values for each product, and extrapolating the accumulated data into a comprehensive report validating the concept.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Identify, establish, and validate the type and volume of raw material, equipment, processing procedures, space, staff, merchandising efforts, logistics and resources required to institute a viable RVA operation.
COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Four possibilities exist: 1) Partner with an existing sawmill to establish an RVA program at the mill site.
2) Build an off site facility that would process purchased, contracted and/or co-op raw materials, 3) Build a combination facility that would function as a production operation, as well as a demonstration, education, training and product development center.
4) Offer packaged RVA systems to the wood products and recycling industries.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: NOVEL COST-EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY PAPERS
COMPANY: BIOPULPING INTERNATIONAL, INC. P. O. BOX 5463 MADISON, WI 53705
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: DR. MASOOD AKHTAR
TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
Mechanical pulping accounts for about 25% of the wood pulp production in the world today.
This volume is expected to increase in the future.
Mechanical pulping, with its high yield, is viewed as a way to extend these resources.
However, mechanical pulping is electrical energy-intensive (a mill processing 300 tons of pulp/day spends about $10 million in electricity cost) and yields paper with less strength.
Biopulping, defined as the fungal treatment of wood chips prior to mechanical pulping, overcomes both of these problems.
Unfortunately, the process reduces the brightness and opacity of resulting biofibers.
High brightness and high opacity are highly desirable for the production of high quality papers.
Fiber loading is a technology in which calcium carbonate is deposited onto the surface and inside the fibers, which increases the brightness and opacity of papers significantly and thus has the potential of solving both problems associated with biopulping.
Therefore, the proposed research is directed at demonstrating the technical and scientific feasibility of combining the two newly-developed technologies.
Both mechanical (control and biofibers), and softwood bleached kraft pulps will be subjected to fiber loading to produce high quality papers.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The proposed research will result into an innovative technology that will save electrical energy (at least 30%); improve paper strength and optical properties; reduce the environmental impact of pulping, particularly reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; enhance economic competitiveness by lowering the production cost significantly ($7-8 million/year anticipated savings); and create jobs in rural areas.
Thus the proposed research will also satisfy the public interest by developing a sustainable agricultural system; protecting the environment; developing value-added non-food products from agricultural materials; and enhancing global competitiveness, and economic opportunity and quality of life, especially for people in rural areas.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: MICRO-INFUSION TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE EFFICACY OF PHEROMONE TO MANAGE SPRUCE BARK BEETLES
COMPANY: MED-E-CELL 10633 ROSELLE SAN DIEGO, CA 92121-1506

GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
Spruce bark beetle epidemics are responsible for the destruction of millions of acres of forests, which threaten critical habitat for endangered species, campgrounds, and create fire hazards.
Since insecticides are not practical for treating this insect in forests, pest management strategies have been developed using semiochemicals.
However, inconsistent field performance has limited the success of this pheromone- based approach, attributed in large part to the poor emission rate control and reliability of conventional diffusion controlled dispensers.
The proposed investigation will determine initial feasibility of using micro-infusion drug delivery technology to emit anti-aggregation pheromones to mitigate the effect of Spruce bark beetles in Utah and Arizona.
By actively dispensing bark beetles pheromones from point sources at a continuous flow rate into the environment, the approach will more closely simulate how the beetles themselves emit their pheromones compared to conventional diffusion controlled methods used to emit semiochemicals in forest applications.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
If feasibility and efficacy are established in Phase I 
If the proposed active delivery strategy becomes the enabling mechanism to manage bark beetles, the benefits could extend to saving millions of board feet of lumber that they destroyed each year.
If future research shows this approach to be enabling in the control of a variety of insects, the commercial applications would be sizable.

TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $62,291/6 MONTHS
The proposed research will design and build prototype hand-held tools intended to assist fire fighters during wildfire mop-up operations.
The tools will incorporate operator adjustable heat gradient thresholds for processing sensor information permitting identification of burning debris that may be underground or buried by layers of ash.
Telescopic poles will permit tool use while standing and is intended to promote worker comfort, safety, and productivity.
The tools will be provided to experienced and inexperienced fire fighters during the 2001 fire season and to fire fighting equipment distributors to assess market interest.
End-user feedback will assess tool functionality and durability.
Input regarding potential enhancements will also be sought.
Data collection by built in microprocessing elements will permit functional analysis, in conjunction with user feedback.
Qualitative data will also assess user acceptance and estimations of enhanced productivity and job satisfaction.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Study results from field-testing will permit evaluation of Cold Trailer design and may suggest directions for further design optimization.
Successful development of the tool would increase mop-up thoroughness and work efficiency.
Worker productivity and job satisfaction would be enhanced, promoting savings in both personnel costs and natural resources.
Production costs would be significantly less than currently available products using infrared detection.
The commercial potential for this product would be a niche market comprised of Federal, State, and private contract fire fighting crews.
International markets in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are also possible.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: FORWARD-LOOKING INFRA-RED (FLIR) ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM FOR FOREST FIRE MANAGEMENT
COMPANY: SEAGULL TECHNOLOGY, INC. 6400 LARK AVENUE LOS GATOS, CA 95032-2547
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: MR. J. EDWIN JONES
TOPIC AREA: FORESTS AND RELATED RESOURCES
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
The Forward-Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) sensor is an extremely valuable tool for aerial supervisors in the fighting of forest and range fires.
Due to expense and operational considerations, FLIRs have not yet been deployed widely for this task.
When currently employed, the typical FLIR installation is such that the FLIR information is only immediately viewable by the crew of the host aircraft, and the FLIR interpretation and verbal information dissemination tasks add to the crew's work overload.
This research proposes to develop an enhancement system to more fully utilize the rich information available in FLIR imagery and disseminate the information to other fire-fighting participants.
The FLIR Enhancement System captures still pictures from the FLIR imagine stream and registers the image to geodetic coordinates, adjusting for the location and viewing perspective of the host aircraft.
The system then extracts important fire intelligence like the fire boundary, hot spots, and retardant deposits, and disseminates this information in graphical form so that it can be viewed on Incident Map displays.
This tool will enable firefighters to more effectively protect forests, grasslands, property, and human lives.
The expected results include a system design from off-the-shelf components that can be operationally tested in Phase II.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This research is expected to determine effective ways to enhance the utility of FLIR and optical sensors for fire-fighting and other applications by integrating such high-powered sensors into an effective overall system context.
All applicants and markets that currently use or plan to use such optical sensors, particularly from airborne platforms, can benefit from the proposed research and development.
Such markets and application areas include law enforcement; emergency, search, and rescue operations; news and event monitoring and reporting; arial surveillance; airborne meteorology, and applications of uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

Essential oil plants in Mentha species have been valued historically for their medicinal, culinary, and fragrance properties.
Despite the existence of several mint species and many cultivars, the U.S. Mint Oil Industry is based upon three sterile clones and their minor somatic variants.
The narrow genetic base of these commercial varieties could endanger the stability of the mint industry if virulence of disease and/or large-scale fluctuations in weather occur.
Extensive genetic diversity exists among other mint species and the U.S. mint industry is considering more effective future exploitation of this diversity to broaden the genetic base.
Unfortunately, genetic diversity in mint is very poorly characterized, and the genetic relationships among known species and cultivars remain obscure.
Here, we propose evaluating the utility of simple-sequence repeat (SSR or microsatellite) DNA fingerprinting techniques for answering the following questions: What are the relative levels of genetic diversity in extent mint species and cultivars? What are the genetic relationships among those species and cultivars? How well do SSR markers discriminate among closely related cultivars?
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
We expect to determine the abundance frequency of SSRs in Mentha species.
Approximately 15 highly polymorphic SSR loci will be developed.
Different cultivars will be identified.
Genetic relationships among Mentha species/varieties will be estimated.
These results offer distinct advantages over morphological and other types of data for identification and protection of varieties for mint industry.
Information provided by the SSR markers will be used to design optimal procedures to mange germplasm collections for industry use.
Future applications of SSR-based markers include genome mapping, gene tagging, and marker-assisted selection.

The control of postharvest decay of fruit and vegetable is achieved with sound cultural practices, fungicide applications, and controlled temperature and storage environments.
While cultural practices present an integrated approach, it may not be enough under certain climatic conditions.
Synthetic fungicides have long-term limitation with the appearance of resistant pathogens.
Other methods such as controlled atmosphere storage may not be economically feasible for some commodities.
Numerous research reports are published on the fungicidal and bactericidal activity of plant essential oils.
However, there is no commercial application for their use on fruit and vegetables.
On the other hand, there is an increasing demand by the public for all-natural foods.
Premier Botanicals Ltd. proposes to develop plants producing essential oils which can be used to control postharvest decay on selected vegetables.
Phase I will screen and select essential oils for their fungicidal activity.
Methods of essential oil application (headspace, or incorporated into an edible coating) will be investigated.
Consumer acceptability of such treated vegetables will be addressed by sensory testing.
The long-term project will include a breeding program to create and select plants producing the desired oil components.
Oils will be selected for their biocidal properties and sensory qualities.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The primary application will be for the fresh tomato industry.
The use of essential oils as a natural postharvest preservative can be expanded to any fruit- and root-vegetable, such as cucumbers, squashes, peppers (fruit - vegetable) and carrots (root).
Essential oils can also be used as preservatives and flavorants in processed vegetable foods.
The use of essential oils as natural postharvest disease control will benefit the industry growing, transporting and marketing fresh vegetables.
Additionally, the success of this project will offer a production diversification to the farming community.

In 1980, USDA weed scientist Roger D. Hagin identified quackgrass as a potent slug deterrent in no - till corn.
Subsequently, he and coworkers identified the active ingredient as 6-hydroxy 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-B- carboline-3-carboxylic acid (6-HT C-3COOH), demonstrating very significant toxicity (LD50 of 5 Ã¯Â¿Â½g per gram).
The compound exhibits little or no mammalian toxicity and no effect on one species of worm and three species of worm and three species of freshwater snails.
If we can show that quackgrass leaves carry enough toxicity to kill slugs, it will be possible to create a new specialty crop and a new slug control product.
Two requirements for using quackgrass as a raw material for slug control are: 1) Slug mortality must be linked to the active ingredient concentration in quackgrass, 2) Active ingredient concentration must be high enough in quackgrass leaves to justify its use.
In Phase I, we will analyze the concentration of active compound in harvests of different growth stages of quackgrass formulate baits with concentration of active ingredient that bracket the lethal dose observed by Hagin and Bobnick (1991).
Subsequently, the two most promising bait formulations will be assessed for slug control in field trials.
Additionally, the effect of moisture on the baits' effectiveness will be documented in laboratory bioassays.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
If successful, this research will yield an entirely new, environmentally-friendly slug control and transform the prolific weed quackgrass into a new specialty crop.
The product will have appeal in a wide range of markets that need slug control, including small fruit growers, vegetable growers, professional landscapers and home gardeners.
It could replace two chemicals with mammalian toxicity that are currently used in slug baits for these markets: metaldchyde and methiocarb.

TOPIC AREA: PLANT PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION (BIOLOGY)
GRANTED AMOUNT: $69,980/6 MONTHS
Due to environmental and regulatory concerns, research and development of nonchemical alternatives for pest suppression is necessary.
Entomopathogenic nematodes are environmentally friendly biocontrol agents that can suppress a wide variety of economically important insect pests including the black vine weevil, the Japanese beetle, Diaprepes root weevil, and fungus gnats.
Commercialization of these nematodes, however, has not reached its potential.
Two critical hindrances to wider usage of entomopathogenic nematodes are inconsistent efficacy in field applications, and cost.
Our challenge is to overcome these barriers.
Prior research indicates nematodes applied in their infected-hosts may be more efficacious than nematodes applied through conventional means (i.e., aqueous suspension).
Additionally, application of nematodes in infected-hosts is likely to reduce production costs.
Our objective is to determine the feasibility of applying entomopathogenic nematodes in infected hosts.
We will develop a novel in vivo system to produce nematode-infected-hosts, compare the efficacy of nematodes applied in infected-hosts with those applied in a conventional manner, and test various methods of formulation and storage for nematode-infected-hosts.
Research will focus on Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.
Once the technology is developed with this nematode, it will be easily transferable to other species.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This research will lead to development of a powerful biocontrol technology for suppression of arthropod pests.
The cost of entomopathogenic nematode production will decrease and field efficacy will increase.
The resulting biocontrol product will be initially targeted for control of major pests of ornamental and nursery plants (e.g., the black vine weevil, and white grubs).
Once proven successful, markets can be expanded to various other commodities such as orchards, field, and even urban systems; the potential is vast.
Substantial previous research, and the expertise of the project members, indicate that this project is likely to reach fruition.

TITLE OF RESEARCH: PRODUCTION OF CROWN GALL RESISTANT PLANTS
COMPANY: DRY CREEK LABORATORY 1618 BALDWIN ROAD HUGHSON, CA 95326
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: MR. WALTER J. VISS
TOPIC AREA: PLANT PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION (BIOLOGY)
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
Crown gall is a multimillion dollar worldwide problem in fruit and nut orchards, vineyards, and nurseries.
Tumors result from overproduction of auxin and cytokinin in plant cells transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
These high phytohormone levels result from expression of three genes transferred stably into the plant genome from A. tumefaciens: iaaM, iaaH, and ipt.
Inactivation of iptand either iaaM or iaaH abolishes gall formation.
Adequate means do not exist to control crown gall on grapes, fruit and nut trees, and other nursery crops.
Our collaborators have constructed a transgene that elicits post transcriptional gene silencing of iaaM and ipt, and they have used this approach to prevent tumorigenesis in transgenic tobacco.
Post-transcriptional gene silencing is triggered by production of double-stranded RNA from a transgene, which causes systemic, sequence-specific destruction of transgene-encoded mRNA and other mRNAs that have sufficient sequence identity.
We have introduced this construct into apple.
The goal of our proposed work is to test the effectiveness of this transgene in apple and assess the level of crown gall resistance in the 50 apple lines we have generated.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Transgenic fruit, nut, and grape rootstocks that suppress crown gall may result from this research.
After Phase II and Phase III field studies of the durability of crown gall resistance and the agronomic properties of the rootstock, crown gall resistant rootstock will be ready for commercialization.
This will be facilitated by the close association of Dry Creek Laboratory with Duarte Nursery, the largest grapevine nursery in the U.S., with over 15 million potted grapevines and 500,000 potted fruit and nut trees.
Monsanto, a leading plant biotechnology firm, supported the patent application covering this invention, and they have expressed interest in commercialization by signing a licensing option agreement.

Tissue culture is used extensively in plant biotechnology, both for direct application in the clonal multiplication of plants and indirectly in providing target cells for genetic engineering.
It is of paramount importance that the plants derived from culture in either of these two processes are true-to-type, genotypically and phenotypically.
However, uncontrolled instability can occur when plant cells are cultured in vitro.
Attempts have been made to identify DNA markers that would be diagnostic of cells with altered genomes using restriction fragment length polymorphisms, random amplified polymorphic DNAs and amplified fragment length polymorphisms.
Each of these methods only surveys a small fraction of the genome at a time and has not yielded useful markers.
The proposed program is directed at generating useful markers for somaclonal variation through the use of representational difference analysis (RDA).
This technique allows a significant fraction of the genome (up to 15%) to be compared between closely related lines.
The use of RDA to isolate DNA differences between true-to-type plants and somaclonal variants will result in the development of markers for genomic instability that can be utilized throughout the in vitro propagation process.
These markers will also be useful to ensure that genetically-modified transgenic plants only differ from the starting material in terms of the added information and not in any unassociated regions of the genome.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Success in the development of markers for genomic integrity would provide an enhanced method of quality assurance of in vitro propagated plants.
The use of these markers would remove the damage due to somaclonal variation only discovered after plants had been released to producers.
The markers would also allow the monitoring of the regenerating cultures for genomic stability, further reducing the losses due to unstable cultures, and the discarding of productive, stable cultures from fear that they may become unstable.
They will also have a use in allowing a more complete description of the genome of genetically-modified crop plants.

The discovery of cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility (CGMS) in sunflower by Leclercq, P in 1968 allowed for efficient and economical production of hybrid seed.
All genetic components (A, B, and R lines) of a CGMS system have been developed.
This allows improved hybrid stalk to be transferred onto it for economical controlled production of F-1 seed.
Together with advances in seed physiology and population improvements, commercial production of hybrid sunflower seed has created a very sustainable and competitive agricultural commodity.
However, much remains to be done on improving confectionary seed size.
Substantial yield heterosis and improved seed size have presently been achieved with my hybrid varieties of confectionary seed.
This project will breed some of these superior hybrids onto established B and R line stalk with the goal of later following through to completing the process by developing the F-1 hybrid seed in Phase II.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful transfer of giant confectionary sunflower seed onto CGMS lines.
This would lead the way for new and improved F-1 seed production.
The market would increase from those now enjoying the seed to include those who presently do not consume them due to the small size.
The larger seed could be cracked open by hand like an in-shell peanut.
The industry has everything to gain with a greatly improved product.

Agriculture needs biorational pesticides to serve as replacements in an industry dominated by outdated synthetic chemicals.
Residues in the food supply, environmental impact, and worker safety issues underscore the need for novel pesticides.
Without a range of products with unique modes of action, the overuse of limited chemicals and biorational approaches (Bacillus thuringiensis-based transgenic crops) will increase the probability of induced pest resistance.
Microbial natural products offer an untapped source of agrochemical diversity.
Successful products in this category, including Avermectin, Spinosyn, and others have demonstrated highly specific insecticidal activities.
At AgraQuest, over 4000 novel microbes are evaluated every year.
Cultivation media have been designed to enhance metabolite production and screening is fully automated.
Over 3,000 in vivo plant pathogen, insect, mite, and nematode targets are evaluated every week.
Leads are rapidly de-replicated using HPLC-UV and LCMS- based data mining.
The Phase I research described in this proposal will demonstrate the commercial potential of two novel microbial strains with highly specific biopesticide activity against economically important insect and nematode pests.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Phase I research will demonstrate the pesticidal efficacy of novel microbial isolates.
Fermentation media optimization and field efficacy trials will demonstrate the economic feasibility of these isolates in agricultural environments.
Pilot scale fermentation (up to 7000-L) and analytical process development will define the parameters necessary for full-scale commercial development.
Phase II will take successful insecticidal candidates through production scale fermentation (7,000L and above), product formulation, expanded field studies, complete toxicology, and structural elucidation of the active ingredients.
Insecticidal products developed from this research will provide effective alternatives to existing chemicals used in conventional agricultural and the fast growing organic sector.

Genetically engineered products offer tremendous potential as foods, medicines, and industrial materials.
The novel process of magnetophoresis may be able to address shortcomings of existing gene transfer technologies for further crop improvement.
We propose in this Phase I project to demonstrate the technical feasibility of magnetophoresis to reproducibly deliver small magnetic particles (micromagnets) into target tissues.
Research focuses on strategies of micromagnet handling and on micromagnet geometry/composition for DNA payload sequestering.
Identification of the enabling strategies in Phase I is key to our Phase II goal of demonstrating efficient plant genetic engineering by magnetophoresis using mersistems, plastids and gametes.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Magnetophoresis is a platform delivery technology that promises needed solutions in areas of crop genetic engineering where current transformation technologies are deficient.
Through precision targeting and magnetic enrichment capabilities under conditions for elevating transgene integration, including for use in homologous recombination at both nuclear and chloroplast levels, this technology promises to hasten and broaden development of commercial line while reducing safety concerns of GM crops.
Kuehnle AgroSystems Co. will license this technology to the agricultural community and will provide the needed hardware and consumables.

Pierce's disease is a lethal bacterial disease of grapevine caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa.
The bacteria are spread by insects belonging to the family of sharpshooter and spittlebug.
The disease has the potential to cause millions of dollars of damage to California's multi-billion dollar grape and wine industry.
The bacteria also cause alfalfa dwarf disease, almond leaf scorch, phony peach disease and leaf scorch diseases in oak, elm, maple, mulberry, plum and sycamore.
If the South American Citrus Variegated Chlorosis strain gets introduced into California, citrus losses are estimated to reach $5 billion.
This project will develop a cost-effective assay that can be used for the early detection of the presence of X. fastidosa in grapevine leaves and other neighboring plant species that may act as a reservoir to spread the disease.
The assay will be easy-to-use by grape growers to enable on site monitoring of their fields.
When infestations are found, then insecticides can be sprayed to kill the insect vectors, and the contaminated vines and neighboring plant disease reservoirs can be destroyed to stop the spread of the disease.
The assay may also be used by plant inspection agencies to prevent the importation of infected plants.

The greenbug is a severe insect pest of wheat.
There is a need and market for new greenbug integrated pest management (IPM) decision-making tools.
A critical component of an IPM program is a method to monitor fields to determine if there is a pest problem.
Traditional field-based greenbug monitoring is not cost effective.
We propose to develop an aircraft based multi-spectral imaging system to identify fields with greenbug infestations and to delineate the spatial boundaries of infestations in fields.
The monitoring system would be cost effective, and fields could be treated with insecticide when, and where, needed using a "site-specific" IPM approach.
Phase I objectives are to: (1) obtain high spatial resolution multi-spectral images of greenbug infested winter wheat fields using the SST Crop Reflectance Imaging System (SSTCRIS); (2) perform simultaneous ground-based reference sampling of greenbug infestations and damage in fields; (3) use spatial interpolation techniques to create maps of greenbug density and plant damage from ground-based reference sampling data from the fields; and (4) use statistical methods to assess the degree of agreement between the remotely sensed and ground-based maps.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Results of Phase I will pave the way for developing an operational greenbug monitoring system (Phases II 
SST will install these decision-making tools in SST Information Labs located throughout the United States.
Together, the tools will add considerably to the value of services provided to customers by SST Information Labs.
The greenbug monitoring and IPM decision support systems may also be marketed as stand-alone software if a significant market emerges for such a product.

Most edible beans are currently harvested with a multi-operation system involving undercutting, windrowing, and combining.
This harvest system has high operating cost, high weather risk to the undercut plants, high soil intake into the combine, and allows few options for controlling soil erosion after harvest.
A small proportion of the crop is direct harvested but current equipment for direct harvest results in excessive field loss and too much soil taken into the combine.
We propose a new concept in combine header design that will gently lift, divide, and cut the plants with acceptable low field loss and minimal soil intake into the combine.
The goal of this project will be to test components of this header concept on a laboratory test stand to determine feasibility of building a field prototype for Phase II of the project.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The results of an improved harvesting system will be: A. Harvested beans of a higher quality B. Less field loss C. Reduced cost per acre D. Increased surface residue on field to reduce wind and water erosion.

Scierotinia sclerotiorum, or white mold, is generally considered to be one of the two most damaging diseases to the U.S. canola, dry bean, soybean, and sunflower crops.
Although controllable with timely fungicide applications, the expense of these fungicides and the lack of reliable information as to the need for the application often prohibit the preemptive action requited for disease control.
White mold's life cycle is intricately tied to the weather, requiring specific conditions for infection to occur.
However, the nature of the weather information required for monitoring disease potential makes it impractical for producers to monitor the conditions themselves.
Consequently, an alternative means of evaluating the potential for infections is desirable.
The proposed program is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of developing a decision support system (DDS) to remotely monitor the potential for white mold infections in producer's fields.
This DDS would incorporate the latest technologies in remote sensing, weather analysis and forecasting, and crop growth and disease modeling.
The ability to remotely monitor the weather to which a susceptible field is exposed through integration of data collected by various observing platforms is paramount to the success of the DSS, and is the primary focus of this Phase I investigation.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful development of the proposed DSS will provide producers of susceptible crops an invaluable tool for gauging the need for a fungicide application.
Considering the magnitude of crop losses due to white mold and the considerable expense of fungicide applications, it is anticipated that the modest expense of the DSS would lead to its acceptance as a necessary tool for growers of susceptible crops.
If successful, the core goal of remotely monitoring the weather in a farm field would have positive implications for disease prediction in other crops.
The DSS could also benefit the environment by eliminating necessary fungicide applications.

Unique challenges face agriculture diagnostics, dictated by the small profit margins in crop production and the need for rapid, reliable assay information under highly variable environmental conditions.
The need to identify genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has recently become acute due to new legislation, public demands, global transport of plants, and commercial processing of food and fiber.
Agdia, a leader in agricultural diagnostics has developed a formal agreement with AndCare, a leader in electrochemical-medical diagnostics, to develop novel, state-of-the-art electrochemical sensor arrays for the detection of analytes of importance to agriculture.
Using proprietary immunoassay technology developed by Agdia, we plan to construct 8- and 96-well sensor arrays and portable electrochemical readers to detect commercially important Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxins used in genetically modified plants (corn and cotton) to control insects.
The core technology being developed in this proposal can also be used for the detection on non-BT GMOs, plant pathogens, and pesticides.
Our new assay technology will be quantitative, fast, inexpensive, able to detect multiple analytes simultaneously, portable, and easy to conduct under field conditions without the need for specialized training.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The objective is to develop novel immuno-electrochemical sensor technology for the quantitative detection of commercial Bt toxins in transgenic plants.
The core sensor technology can also be used for the detection on non-Bt GMOs, plant pathogens, and pesticides.
These sensors will have important advantages over current technology used in agriculture and can be used in all aspects of crop production and food processing.
Agdia is optimally positioned as a worldwide leader in Ag diagnostics, to combine this novel sensor technology with their current immunochemical assay products, and commercialize a complete assay system including an electrochemical reader.

More than 200 million pounds of blueberries are sorted annually based upon visual observation by men and women on inspection lines or with equipment that observes blueberry color.
As domestic hand labor becomes more expensive, the industry continues to move towards mechanized sorting processes using less than adequate sorting technologies.
We propose a novel, commercially viable, low-cost classification method based upon controlled lighting that will meet the needs of the growers and the industry, increasing their profits, and creating new marketing opportunities for growers with product that might have otherwise been discarded.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Completion of this Phase I research project will provide a solid scientific foundation for a new blueberry maturity sorting process.
Software developed for this research project will be scaled to a production prototype and field-tested for a harvesting season in Phase II.
Upon maturation of this project, the nation will benefit by assuming a global technologically leadership position in blueberry sorting equipment and potentially becoming a net exporter of this equipment.
Anticipated benefits to growers include increased productivity and product price, reduced product loss, and new markets for previously unused product.

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: DR. CHARLES J. GANTZER
TOPIC AREA: ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION GRANTED AMOUNT: $68,900/6 MONTHS
The emission of hazardous and odorous gases from outdoor hog manure basins is a regulatory and public nuisance concern for the pork production industry.
Besides aerobic biological treatment and basin covers, few (if any) technologies are effective in controlling the emission of the wide range of gases responsible for legitimate odor complaints.
The direct application of the aeration approaches used in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment results in unacceptably high operating costs.
However, the conversion of existing outdoor hog manure basins into facultative lagoons designed and operated especially for odor control (instead of wastewater treatment) offers attractive economics.
The proposed project will evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a novel improvement to facultative lagoons that use low rate aeration.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The research project is expected to demonstrate that the improved low-rate aeration technology offers a cost-effective means of controlling the emission of offensive gases from hog manure basins.
Implementation of the emission control technology will improve the sustainability of pork production by lessening the environmental impact of manure disposal, allowing for the economic growth of the industry, and by improving the well-being of rural communities.
The emission control technology also has applications in sugar refining, diary and food processing industries.

A major pest in domestic, public, and agricultural environments Solenopsis invicta, the Red imported fire ant (RIFA), is currently being controlled with food-based baits that also affect non-target organisms, many of which are beneficial.
We propose the use blends of semiochemicals modifiers of RIFA behaviors to increase bait specificity.
RIFA workers preferentially picked up, transported and retained (in the nest chamber) inert materials laced with our semiochemical formulations.
Argentine and closely related California-native fire ants (non-target organisms) ignored them, indicating that the development of highly specific RIFA baits may be a feasible task.
Development of RIFA-specific baits will result in: 1) Monitoring devices specific to RIFA; more certainty of RIFA identification and detection.
2) Enhanced pick-up and optimal bait placement by RIFA workers, resulting in lower lethal doses of pesticides.
Possible deterrent for non-target organisms.
3) Unaffected non-target beneficial insects; biocontrol agents will not be disrupted; fire ant competitors and natural enemies will be less affected.
4) Potential use in fragile/natural ecosystems (high specifically, low pesticide doses).
5) Use with novel control agents including volatile chemicals and bio-control agents, for instance entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana, effective for controlling fire ants.
6) Storage of baits close to developing brood and queen, so targeting the source of potential future infestations.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This Phase I intends to demonstrate feasibility of the development and use of specific semiochemical baits to exclusively (1) monitor and (2) control RIFA.
Specificity in monitoring results in effective identification of problem areas.
RIFA-specific suppressant formulations with insecticides and entomopathogens will appeal to programs wishing to minimize impact on non-target organisms.
Targeted control of RIFA will leave local fauna intact.
With RIFA-specific baits, widespread actions of area-wide eradication programs will be more readily accepted.
Our specific formulations will be equally marketable to small and large scale users.
We anticipate developing baits initially against RIFA and later against other social insect pests.

This project will identify data that can be automatically collected, analyzed and shared as information for tactical (moment-to-moment) swine management.
This project has three objectives.
1) The essential data, data management methods, and key information will be identified for tactical management of pork production and maintenance of individual animal well being, using statistical process control (SPC) methods.
Regression models will be tested to predict future trends from very recent historical data.
2) Identify methods and presentation formats to deliver information.
Presentation methods for SPC outputs, such as control charts, will be identified, defined, and tested for value in presenting tactical information to the user.
Tactically useful data, easily generated by new automated pork production systems, will be accumulated in a manageable and accessible form, processed into useable SPC information, and presented in meaningful ways to users.
Heuristic on-line charts, graphs, and decision- support systems will be evaluated for ability to deliver useful and timely information from a data stream to support decisions that adjust management tactics.
3) Identify prototypical applications for demonstration and testing of data management and SPC information production in a practical setting.
Automatically collected data will be used for prototype application tests of commercial feasibility and implementation.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This project will identify information and information management methods and define software products that can be used in daily management of swine, employing EARSÃ¯Â¿Â½ automation data collection technologies.
This work will support improved methods of tactical management of swine.
Data management, using SPC methods, will leverage the new capabilities of Osborne Industries' EARS equipment and fully integrate the management of data from in-barn data entry, feeding, weighing, and other automated inputs.
These new products will track production control variables using SPC methods to ensure optimum animal well being, meat quality, production efficiency, and profitability.

NECi, The Nitrate Elimination Co., Inc. has developed a series of nitrate test kits based on the enzyme NADH: Nitrate Reductase purified from corn seedlings.
The method has been used successfully for biomedical research since 1995, and NECi's test kits have been on the market for analysis of water, wastewater, and other aqueous samples since 1998.
Simplified and environmentally benign Fields kits for on-site analysis were introduced in late 1998, and a Consumer Kit late in 1999.
The purpose of this project is to determine the utility of enzyme-based nitrate analysis for protection of livestock from nitrate toxicity due to consumption of feed with excessive nitrate content.
Field and lab personnel have cited the need for alternative nitrate analytical methods.
This need was clearly demonstrated during the drought in the Eastern U.S. during the 1999 growing season.
The main technical barrier is to establish a reproducible yet field-usable extraction method for corn and wheat.
We will then demonstrate that enzyme-based nitrate analysis can provide reliable data from these sample types, in the lab and in the field.
Replicate samples will be prepared and analyzed using automated on-line Cadmium reduction and by ion chromatography to validate the utility of the method.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
NECi develops and manufactures enzyme-based products for analysis and remediation.
There is a demonstrated need for safe, reliable, and economical alternative methods for analysis of nitrate in corn, wheat, and other crops, both in the lab and on-site in the field.
If success can be demonstrated in Phase I, nitrate test kits for Feed analysis will be developed in Phase II.
Development of a nitrate biosensor for feed and food samples would be an additional aspect of Phase II.
These products would assist Extension personnel and farmers in protection of livestock from nitrate toxicity.

Bovine mastitis is a major economic loss for the dairy industry and indirectly a human hazard because treatment selects for antibiotic resistant bacteria.
We propose to develop an novel anti-microbial therapy for dry cow mastitis based on Nisin that would break farmer's dependence on antibiotics that are currently used to treat human disease.
Nisin is a potent bacterocin that has been safely used as a food preservative and has GRAS status for certain applications.
Preliminary data suggests that Nisin may be effective for the treatment of mastitis in lactating cows.
This proposal would extend that observation to the much larger market of dry cow therapy.
Our Nisin based product would have three characteristics.
First, it would be a highly effective treatment for dry cow mastitis.
Second, it would be inherently safe for human consumption and thus raise minimal food residue concerns.
Third, it would replace antibiotics that are known to select for resistance to Class I and II antibiotics used to treat human disease and therefore not contribute to the problem of antibiotic resistance.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The current annual U.S. market for antibiotics intended to treat dry cow mastitis is 9 million doses.
The existing products are single doses that sell for $1.5 to $2 per dose.
Considering the advantages of this product, a $2 price is not unreasonable.
Thus, the projected market for this product is $18 million per year in the U.S. alone.
The international market could be at least twice as large.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome was recognized in the U.S. in 1987 as a new infectious disease of swine causing late-term reproductive failure and severe pneumonia in neonatal pigs.
The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV).
Current attenuated vaccines against PRRSV are not totally effective in prevention of the infection and disease.
In addition, there is emerging evidence that the current attenuated vaccines are not 100% safe due to reversion to virulence.
A new generation of safe vaccines with a better performance will help in prevention of this disease.
Most, if not all, viral vaccines protect via preexistent specific neutralizing antibodies.
There is also strong evidence for a protective role of neutralizing antibodies in protection to PRRSV infection.
We propose here to characterize neutralizing epitopes (mimotopes) for PRRSV using phage display libraries of peptides.
To select the mimotopes we will take advantage of the characteristic features of porcine antibodies and the humoral response of swine to PRRSV infection.
The capacity of these mimotopes to compete to neutralizing anti- PRRSV antibodies will be tested in vitro and selected ones will be used to induce a neutralizing antibody response as a proof of principle.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Our goal is to characterize specific areas of molecules (epitopes) from Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Virus that are targets for the induction of neutralizing antibodies.
These molecules or molecules resembling conserved epitopes will be used to produce a new generation of a more safe vaccine against PRRSV.
Characterization of neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes will also allow us to produce a differential ELISA test to distinguish between PRRSV vaccinated and infected pigs that could be used together with the vaccine in control programs.

Bovine neosporosis is an economically important disease of cattle.
The disease is caused by Neospora caninum, an intracellular protozoan parasite that is closely related to Toxoplasma gondii.
There is no proven vaccine or drugs to prevent or treat N. caninum infections.
Preventing and controlling neosporosis through an effective vaccination program would be a highly attractive and economically feasible approach for the cattle industry.
Research conducted to date suggest that a Th 1 type of immune response characterized by IFN-Y , but not IL-4 secretion by antigen specific CD4+ T cells, and production of specific IgG2, but not IgG1, antibodies will lead to protection against neosporosis.
The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a recombinant live vaccine that can confer protection to cattle against neosporosis and brucellosis.
The company intends to prepare such an effective vaccine by expressing potential protective proteins of N. caninum in Brucella abortus vaccine strain RB51, a bacterial vector with unique adjuvant properties to stimulate a strong Th1 type of immune response.
In the Phase I part of the project, the company intends to 1) construct recombinant B. abortus RB51 strains expressing selected potentially protective proteins of N. caninum, and 2) determine the protective ability of the recombinant strains against N. caninum challenge in gerbils.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
It is anticipated that the research proposed in this Phase I R
It is obvious such a vaccine will be of tremendous advantage for dairy and beef producers.
Successful development of such a vaccine will also lead to the utilization of B. abortus RB51-based platform technology for constructing multivalent vaccines against other intracellular pathogens of veterinary and/or zoonotic importance, such as tuberculosis and paratuberculosis.

GRANTED AMOUNT: $69,886/6 MONTHS
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel approach for the treatment of bacterial diseases in animals using unique and patented biodegradable injectable gel formulations for controlled release of the antibiotic ceftiofur.
These novel biodegradable injectable gel formulations will be able to maintain therapeutic concentrations of ceftiofur for a prolonged period of time (7 days), following a single subcutaneous injection, thereby creating a product that will significantly improve the efficiency, effectiveness and duration of treatment, with the goal of reducing clinical relapse infection, and improving the percentage of treated animals experiencing complete recovery.
Therefore, the specific aims of this study are as follows: 1) Evaluate In Vitro drug release rates from Novel Biodegradable Injectable Gels Loaded with Ceftiofur.
The first step in this study will be to characterize critical factors affecting in vitro release rates of ceftiofur.
2) Ascertain How Long Therapeutic Plasma Concentrations of Ceftiofur can be Maintained In Vivo after a Single Subcutaneous Injection of the Novel Biodegradable Injectable Gel.
The duration of therapeutic plasma concentration of ceftiofur released from optimized drug-loaded gel formulations will be examined in sheep following a single subcutaneous injection of the biodegradable gels.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Ceftiofur will be released from the biodegradable formulations in a controlled manner.
Therapeutic concentrations of ceftiofur will be maintained in sheep for at least 7 days.
Such a product would substantially reduce the stress and labor associated with animal handling for treatment purposes, and would likely result in improved efficacy due to reduction in treatment failures.
Regarding commercialization potential, a United States patent application for the system has been granted.
Patent applications for this novel biodegradable drug delivery system have also been filed in other countries, and are currently pending.

Johne's disease, a chronic granulomatous enteritis of cattle is the result of infection with the extremely slow growing bacillus Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.
It is estimated that 20-30% of U.S. dairy and cattle herds are infected with this organism with resulting combined losses to the dairy and beef industries estimated to be between $200 million and $1 billion per year.
Current vaccine strategies utilizing non-viable mycobacteria have proven to be largely ineffective and are currently permitted in only 3 states.
We further hypothesize based on our extensive experience with murine models of mycobacteria infection, that successful vaccines must incorporate proteins contained within the Culture Filtrate (CFP) extracted from the supernatant of mycobacteria during the log phase of growth.
We propose here to vaccinate several small groups of cattle with mixtures of M. paratuberculosis CFP emulsified into adjuvants which have been demonstrated to promote a T helper Type 1 (TH1) immune response; experimentally infect these animals for the emergence of T cell populations previously associated with protection.
Animals will be analyzed for DTH response.
T cell production of IFN-g, and circulating memory T cell phenotype expression.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
We anticipate that a combination of M. paratuberculosis CFP emulsified into a TH1 promoting adjuvant will stimulate a protective T cell response in experimentally infected cattle.
This response will be characterized by an emerging, circulating T cell population which produces significant amounts of IFN-Y in response to in vitro exposure to CFP and exhibits a shift towards a "memory" T cell phenotype with regard to expression of CD62L, CD25, CD44, and CD45R.
A successful vaccine would be marketable immediately to the U.S./World Dairy industries and eventually the beef industry.

Johne's disease, caused by Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (M. para), is a chronic inflamatory bowel disease of ruminants. recent literature has fueled an as-yet unresolved debate about whether this organism is also the eitiological agent of at least some proportion of Crohn's Disease in humans.
Detection of the organism in stool is difficult due to slow growth and fastidious nature of M. para, hampering many of the studies of its pathogenesis and interfering with eradication efforts in cattle.
PCR- based detection of M. para is highly specific, due to the presence of aunique sequence (IS900), but extensive sample preparation and PCR inhibitors in stool limit the sensitivity and utility of the method.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Current testing for M. paratuberculosis in stool samples requires extensive sample preparation, including disinfection steps that reduce the sensitivity of culture.
PCR testing of stool samples is hampered by inhibitors of the reaction present in stool.
The proposed IMS sample preparation method would provide increased sample throughput as well as enhanced sensitivity of detection replacing the harsh sample preparation steps with a gentle, immune capture step to isolate the bacteria prior to culture or PCR. _________________________________________________________________

Variation in growth performance and health of feedlot cattle leads to large differences in weigh or degree of finish at the point of harvest.
Carcass quality losses alone cost the industry $3.5 billion annually.
Traditional management practices of sorting cattle by weight and physical characteristics to minimize variation fail to take into consideration individual feed intake and metabolic rate as a determinant of performance.
Metabolic rate and subsequent energy losses are related to feed intake.
Infrared thermography measures radiant enerty losses from an animal's body surface.
Introduction of this technology into a feedlot environment would allow sorting of cattle into groups of similar metabolic profile.
This management application could minimize wide variability in feed intake and performance seen in unsorted cattle and allow evaluation of alternate management practices to reduce manure load and antimicrobial usage.
The objective of this Phase I proposal are to: 1) integrate rapid, automated image processing and analysis into the interpretation of thermal data and link data to a unique individual animal identifcation; and 2) establish proof of concept of a unique pen design for remote image acquisition from large numbers of cattle in a feedlot environment.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
It is expect that the results of the proposed research will have an impact, not only on feedlot economics, but also on other forms of production animal agriculture.
If the adoption of thermography is found to be economically feasible, this will initially impact the livestock industry but eventually the consumer will benefit.
In the short run as this technology is adopted, profitability of producers will increase because of improved returns.
However, in the long-run, consumers will ultimately benefit from this technology due to lower cost of beef, reduced antimicrobial use, and improved environmental conditions due to better managed fencing systems.

TOPIC AREA: ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION
GRANTED AMOUNT: $67,687/6 MONTHS
An external virtual fencing device worn as a neck-collar, or adaptable for miniaturization for attachment in or on the ear, uses a programmable repertoire of bilaterally applied cues for the autonomous control of free-ranging animals without the need for ground-based devices such as transceivers.
The animal's location is continuously monitored using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology.
The animal's location is then compared to a programmable Geographic Information System (GIS) pasture map within the device's embedded computer system.
Should the moving animal penetrate a virtual boundary, a cascade of bilaterally programmable electro-mechanical cues (normally acoustic and/or electrical) are administered to change not only the animal's location but also its direction of movement.
Algorithms calculate to which side of the animal the repertoire of cues is to be applied to ensure the furthest movement away from the virtual fence with the least amount of travel required.
Built in safety systems prevent unnecessary stress from occurring should the animal refuse to respond correctly following stimulation
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This device is suited to many of the world's rangelands that support one or more species of large herbivore, some of which are delineated by conventional fences.
However, conventional fencing is static, thus thwarting management of stocking density and limiting uniform vegetation utilization.
Virtual fencing has many potential applications since it is spatially and temporally programmable.
Besides excluding animals from ecologically sensitive areas such as riparian zones, virtual fences can surround individual animals as well as move in time and space, thus facilitating gathering animals and ultimately promoting a more uniform animal distribution over the landscape.

Construction projects generate 10 to 20 times more erosion per acre compared to neighboring agricultural activities.
Wind erosion and production of dust is considerable at large construction sites, and water erosion clogs local sewers and silts local streams and rivers.
Construction of buildings generates large quantities of waste wood which burdens landfills.
It is proposed to convert waste construction wood into cellulose soil binders for erosion control-thus ameliorating two major problems at construction sites.
Waste-wood would be ground in chippers and placed in large, water-filled, plastic vats.
Pre-industrial paper-making techniques would be adapted in which microorganisms partially decompose and unravel plant fibers.
Lime (CaO), the major constituent of cement, would be added to form calcium hydroxide providing hydroxide ions (OH) for final pulping of the wood.
Slurries of pulp would be sprayed onto soils with existing hydraulic equipment.
Adhesive properties of the tacky paper pulp fiber would bind soil particles together and inhibit erosion.
Continuous mats of protective paper would form oversoil as the pulp dries.
Because paper pulp for soil erosion control need not be of the quality necessary for printing, bleaches, sulfites, and other chemicals used in industrial paper-making to remove lignin and other colored substances is eliminated.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Construction contractors facing problems of control of dust by wind erosion, silting of local sewers, streams and rivers, and disposal of tons of waste construction wood would benefit from development of on-site conversion of construction waste wood into hydro-mulch.
Successful conversion of waste wood into paper pulp and hydro-mulch using pre-industrial paper making techniques involving microorganisms rather than industrial chemicals could be adapted for erosion control in sanitary landfills and on soils exposed during forestry operations and after forest fires.

The goal of this research is to develop an energy-efficient system that will abate the water pollution and odor problems associated with concentrated animal feeding operations and yield, as added benefits, a commercial fertilizer and a recyclable water stream.
Waste management is a major concern of every large-scale livestock operation and a growing problem nationally as animal feeding operations are increasingly concentrated.
It is not that animal wastes are without value; in fact, nearly 40 percent of feed dry matter and 75 to 85 percent of the nutrients fed to animals is excreted as waste.
The challenge is to convert what is currently viewed largely as a problematic waste into useful end products.
The wastewater treatment system proposed here integrate three treatment processes to eliminate wastewater "lagoons" and their attendant problems.
The processes are: 1) separation of the liquid effluent from the residual solids remaining after anaerobic digestion: 2) single- or - two stage aeration; and 3) appropriate membrane separation.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
An effective system for the treatment of livestock wastes at concentrated animal feeding operations that will yield a concentrated liquid fertilizer and recyclable water.

Methyl bromide is an effective fumigant that has been in use since the 1930s.
However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will soon prohibit the production and importation of methyl bromide because it has been found to be a significant ozone depleting substance.
Although a number of significant research efforts have been conducted to find alternatives for soil and post-harvest fumigation, so far these alternatives are either more costly or not as effective as methyl bromide.
Another possible approach to mitigate the ozone depleting effects of methyl bromide would be to capture and to recycle or to treat the methyl bromide to minimize its release into the atmosphere.
Recent advances in biological waste air treatment and in biodegradation of methyl bromide suggest that biological treatment of methyl bromide vapors in a biotrickling filter may be a cost effective solution.
The purpose of the proposed investigation is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of biotrickling filtration to treat offgases from agricultural operations that contain methyl bromide.
The primary objective of the first phase will be to demonstrate methyl bromide treatment, and to determine treatment performance under various, yet controlled, operating conditions and to define important design information needed for full-scale systems.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The short term cost of phasing-out methyl bromide is estimated to exceed $300 million whereas the long term cost is in the billion of dollars.
If successful, the proposed treatment of methyl bromide could demonstrate a strong case for exempting methyl bromide from regulation in applications where capture and treatment can be implemented.
The proposed technology is easily applicable for post-harvest fumigation where waste air exits a fumigation building at a centralized location.
A trailer mounted biotrickling filter would enable treatment at various sites.
For pre-plant fumigation, biotrickling filtration will require an efficient methyl bromide capture mechanism.
At least one is available for licensing from the University of California of Technology Transfer.
Biotrickling filtration is cheap and environmentally benign and very well perceived by the general public.

A novel electrochemically activated and deactivated anion-exchange system is proposed for nitrate removal from groundwater and wastewater, as well as other applications.
It will combine the best features of liquid-liquid extraction and anion-exchange using resins, while avoiding many problems inherent in these systems, and providing additional benefits.
It will employ liquid-liquid extraction using a non-volatile room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as the extractant diluent instead of a volatile organic compound (VOC) solvent, eliminating the primary objections to liquid-liquid processes while retaining their fast kinetics.
Ion-exchange resins circumvent the use of VOC solvents, but elution with a large volume of "strip solution" is typically necessary to recover the target ion and regenerate the extractant for reuse, resulting in a large secondary waste stream containing a low concentration of the target ion.
Redox-active extractants have made recovery in a small volume possible, but require chemical oxidants and reductants.
This system employs only electricity.
A redoxactive extractant is immobilized in an RTIL and oxidized electrochemically.
It is then contacted with the waste stream and the ion-exchange takes place.
The phrases are separated, the extractant is electrochemically reduced, and the target ion is released and recovered in a small volume for recycle or disposal.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This program will result in the development of a novel anion-exchange system employing a redox- recyclable extractant immobilized in an ionic liquid.
Electrochemical oxidation will activate it for extraction, and electrochemical oxidation will activate it for extraction, and electrochemical reduction will effect release of the extracted ion and regeneration of the extractant, resulting in an unprecedented reduction in the volume of secondary waste generated by ion-exchange.
It will be effective for removal of nitrate from groundwater and industrial effluent, as well as for many other applications for which conventional ion-exchange is currently being used.
Being a significant improvement over conventional ion-exchange, it will create new markets as well.

Two-cycle engines historically are the preferred choice among light industrial and recreational equipment manufacturers.
These engines are also excessively dirty due to design elements that haven't changed in over 60 years.
Pending legislation aimed at reducing emissions from these engines has put current two- cycle technology in jeopardy.
Implementation of patented induction and combustion processes to eliminate several inherent design flaws common to current two-cycle engine designs that contribute to excessive exhaust emissions.
The proposed design improvements will retain all the benefits of a simple, light-weight, high output two-cycle engine, but produce lower emissions and significantly reduce environmental impacts.
Research will play a critical role in determining the optimum configurations of our proposed technology to maximize all of the benefits available.
Interests have been aligned with a local state university and will utilize its facilities to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design.
Engineers have been enlisted from a local university and outside resources with the intent of researching and developing a low emissions-high two-cycle engine design that can be configured to fit any existing application, meet future emissions standards and capable of competing in this multi-dollar international market.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
When the necessary research needed to optimize the proposed system is completed, development of a two-cycle induction and combustion process that eliminates 75% of hydrocarbon emissions from unburned fuel, and 100% of the unburned oil emissions that are common to current two-cycle engines will be possible.
This technology could be applied to any existing two-cycle application and meet or exceed several pending emissions standards, thereby changing the public's perception of these currently dirty engines.
An improved design that is economical to manufacture could quickly result in a potential increase of products that utilize these engines.

Nitrate contamination of groundwater is widespread problem in the United States and throughout the world.
The use of agricultural fertilizers and improper disposal of industrial wastes has led to nitrate levels that exceed the National Primary Drinking Water Standard of 10 mg/l.
Nitrate contamination in drinking water has been implicated as the cause of various health problems in humans, including methemoglobinemia and spontaneous abortions.
MSE, in collaboration with the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University, has developed a biological process that combines containment of polluted groundwater with remediation of that water.
This technology uses a subsurface biofilm barrier to destroy nitrate in situ while keeping the contaminated plume from reaching fresh water sources.
MSE plans to test this technology at our Butte, Montana, field site using an existing 180 ft. by 130 ft. by 20 ft. deep test cell.
Nitrate will be injected into the test cell and monitored as it passes through the reactive zone.
It is expected that this technology will be an expensive alternative to conventional nitrate treatment technologies.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This research will result in an inexpensive alternative for treatment of nitrate-contaminated groundwater.
The U.S. EPA estimates that over 600,00 households with water wells have nitrate levels that exceed safe drinking water standards.
Much higher nitrate levels are found beneath industrial areas such as feed lots and fertilizer plants.
The widespread nature of the problem shows that there is great commercial potential for an inexpensive technology that will destroy the nitrate.
MSE's in situ biological denitrification technology, which combines hydraulic containment with treatment, has the potential to be a very effective method to clean up nitrate in groundwater.

We have developed a novel siphon-infiltration trench system to mange water and sediment budgets in riparian systems.
We have demonstrated in the laboratory and developed a numerical model showing the three hydrologically-distinct flow regimes in a infiltrating siphon system: 1) infiltrating flow at low-flow rates, 2) cycling outflow at intermediate-flow rates, and 3) constant outflow at high-flow rates.
These flow regimes are dependent upon infiltration gallery design, soil hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall intensity.
Part of the water entering the infiltration trench infiltrates into the soil, while part of the incoming water is periodically flushed out by the nonliner flow behavior of the siphon.
The coupled behavior of the infiltration trench and siphon results in the system being self-cleaning.
Stormwater or overland flow can be captured and injected into a modified infiltration gallery attached to a siphon and emplaced adjacent to a stream or arroyo bank.
This injected soil water can be used for streamside vegetation, surface-water treatment, riparian restoration, bank stabilization or other purpose.
The design is simple, low-cost and self-cleaning.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Few cost-effective tools exist for controlling runoff or for improving riparian systems.
In addition, improvement of surface-water quality is now an environmental priority.
American agriculture, in particular, is facing increasing public and regulatory pressure to reduce nonpoint source pollution from fields and rangeland and runoff from livestock operations.
By infiltrating runoff, water can be stored and treated in riparian zone soils leading to better water quality and increased water availability.
The measured and modeled characteristics show potential for use in improving surface water quality, maintaining stream base flows, establishing riparian vegetation, and reducing bank erosion and downstream sedimentation.

Nitrate is a serious water quality issue in many rural and agricultural areas.
NECi, The Nitrate Elimination Co. Inc. proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using purified and stabilized plant NADH:Nitrate Reductase (NaR) as a direct replacement for the cadmium columns used for nitrate determination in standard air segmented continuous flow (CF) and flow injection (FI) methods.
While cadmium-based methods are accurate and reliable, the extreme toxicity of cadmium poses challenges to worker safety and environmental hygiene.
NECi will partner with the Methods R
We will investigate reagent systems using soluble NaR and also develop immobilized NaR formulations.
Formulations exhibiting reproducible and linear response to nitrate in NECi's hands will be sent to the USGS lab partner for validation on a commercial CF analyzer.
Nitrate standards and natural water samples will be analyzed.
The most promising formulation(s) will be further developed in Phase II.
The long-term goals are 1) development of immobilized enzyme columns that can directly replace cadmium columns in standard autoanalyzer equipment: and 2) development of an economical and field-deployable nitrate analyzer.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
There is a need for improved methods for nitrate analysis, especially for field applications and in complex samples such as manures.
Bioanalytical methods are selective and sensitive.
The challenge is to make them user-friendly, robust and economical as well.
NECi is developing market acceptance for enzyme-based nitrate test kits, and we believe that an enzyme-based alternative to cadmium for autoanalyzers will also find a niche in the marketplace.
Reagent systems and immobilized enzyme columns that can be used with current nitrate analyzers will be developed in Phase II.

There are many areas in the world where water and soil are available but where electric power is not available for irrigation.
Solar powered pumps that use photovoltaic panels to provide electricity to drive pumps work well but are too expensive to produce sufficient water for irrigation use.
Proposals have been made to use solar thermal energy, but these require relatively expensive collectors and require photovoltaic panels to supply electric power to operate auxiliary equipment.
This proposal is aimed at developing and demonstrating a solar thermal irrigation pump that provides a large flow of water inexpensively.
The pump will perform without any electric motors, electric valves, or other electric circuitry.
The purpose of the Phase I project will be to construct a small irrigation plant that pumps water by energy from the sky.
It will prove that a new revolutionary expander (motor that operates on high- pressure gas) and a new high efficiency pump will work together to pump large quantities of water.
Solar energy will be collected and used to boil a low-boiling working fluid at high pressure.
The vapor will be used to drive the new expander, which will drive the pump.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Computer simulations show that a large quantity of water can be pumped with solar thermal energy using a small, inexpensive solar collector.
This research will demonstrate that.
There is a large market for this kind of irrigation pump not only in the U.S. but all over the world.
Sale of these units will help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.
Water has become a more critical commodity in the world than energy.
The use of solar energy to pump water would reduce the use of fossil fuel that is used in electric power plants, and in gasoline and diesel powered pumps.

This SBIR Phase I submission describes the development of instrumentation to combine GC- Olfactometry and MS-Nose functionality into an integrated multi-dimensional GC system.
Sophisticated GC-O operation identifies olfactory active components, while an innovative flow switch redirects cuts of the volatiles to a mass spectrometer in batch mode.
Discriminate analysis techniques, seeded by knowledge of the ions of interest, provide unambiguous aroma signatures.
The combination provides fast method development followed by rapid, accurate, screening procedures.
Existing E-Nose and MS-Nose instruments often depend upon the coincidental correlation of major component output signals with aroma profiles.
These instruments struggle with detection in the ppm range, whereas most aroma issues are at ppb to ppt levels.
Our approach identifies the active olfactory components, determines a limited detection ion set, and performs discriminate analysis of high specificity for the target compounds.
When primarily targeted critical correlation ions are monitored, significant sensitivity enhancement over other systems is anticipated.
Utilizing a batch in-letting mode, screening times are reduced to minutes.
The automated integrated system, with added voice recognition software, will be used to evaluate the authenticity and quality of aromatic Basmati rice.

ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Off-odor and aroma problems are estimated to cost the food and beverage industries $1.2 billion annually.
Identification of the source (by GC-O) is an essential step towards their correction while on- going monitoring (by MS-Nose) is required to monitor product quality.
Our proposed system answers both these needs.
It will be several orders of magnitude greater in sensitivity for target compounds than either E-Nose instruments or MS-Nose units operating in scan mode.
It is the first commercial instrument to combine the complementary GC-O and MS-Nose techniques, into single integrated system.
Potential customers include food/beverage processors/packagers and associated regulatory agencies worldwide.

Semi-refined carrageenan (SRC) is a minimally processed form of carrageenan that requires less energy to make, but has the same food efficacy as the traditional, more highly refined form.
Only Eucheuma(tropical red seaweeds) weeds, which yield strong gelling kappa and iota types of carrageenan have been successfully used to produce marketable SRC.
To date, Gigartina and Chondrus (cold water red seaweeds) weeds, which yield commercially important weaker gelling kappa-2 and non-gelling lambda types of carrageenan, have not lent themselves to SRC processing.
Our project seeks to use novel process chemistry to produce marketable kappa-2 and lambda carrageenans from cold water red seaweeds using the less expensive and less energy intensive SRC method.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful development of semi-refined kappa-2 and lambda carrageenans (Phase I of our project) will show that the semi-refined processing method is technically feasible for all commercial carrageenophytes.
Carrageenans from Chilean Gigartina seaweeds are used in dairy (high milk reactivity), toothpaste, and cold soluble diary products.
All of the above applications could benefit from the cost savings of a semi-refined carrageenan product which should sell for about two-thirds the price of a refined carrageenan.
By year 5 we expect 30% (1,050 MT) penetration of the worldwide dairy market.

The U.S. and many other countries have regulations preventing importation of horticultural commodities that have not been treated by an approved quarantine method insuring 100% mortality of specified insect pests.
Intermodal hypobaric (LP= low pressure) containers may be able to provide this benefit directly and residue-free, replacing the prevailing methods of chemical fumigation and hot water treatment, which tend to be injurious to horticultural commodities, and in the case of insecticides, hazardous to workers and potentially dangerous to consumers.
Significant differences in the gas exchange systems of insects and plants might be expected to cause insects to perish at the low 02 tension present at the optimal LP storage pressure for mangoes and many other horticultural commodities.
This same 02 concentration causes low 02 injury to the host commodity in controlled atmosphere storage.
The proposed research will ascertain how quickly Caribbean fruit fly eggs and larvae are killed at various LP temperatures and pressures and the effect these conditions have on mango storage life and quality after ripening.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The research will indicate whether LP will allow a higher quality, larger, and more mature mango fruit to be imported into the U.S., while protecting American agricultural areas from exotic insect pests by a completely safe, non-chemical method.
The impact of the Phase I studies is likely to extend to numerous commodities other than mangoes and eventually could promote international trade between the mainland U.S. and the Caribbean basin, Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, Hawaii and elsewhere.

In high temperature and high pressure membrane filtration applications like reverse osmosis, plastic materials in the membrane and the permeate carrier soften due to high temperature and collapse due to high pressure.
This phenomenon increases the hydraulic resistance of the permeate path and reduces the permeate flow in conventional spiral membrane module which has a small number of long membrane leaves.
A short leaf membrane module dramatically reduces the hydraulic resistance of the permeate path and increases the productivity in high temperature high-pressure membrane filtration applications.
The disadvantage of having a large number of leaves is the large unproductive membrane area consumed by seams.
This is overcome by using an innovative seaming technique that allows extremely thin seams.
The parameters for the manufacturing process will be optimized and prototype modules will be produced during the Phase I of the project.
The modules will be tested for integrity and be used in bench top testing with several food process feed water sources.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
A prototype short-leaf spiral membrane module will be manufactured, and tested on a bench-top level with several feed streams during the Phase I of the project.
This module will make high temperature reverse osmosis applications like preconcentration of thin fruit juices, thin sugar beet juice and thin sugar cane juice viable commercial processes.
Preconcentration of chromatographically separated sugar fraction in molasses desugarization plants, preconcentration of blancher water in potato par-frying and potato dehydrating plants, recovery of hot water for processing applications in a wide spectrum of industries will be made commercially viable by the success of this module.

The presence of human pathogens in uncooked sprouts has required health advisories by government agencies.
Various chemical and physical processes for seed decontamination are under evaluation.
The electron beam fluidized bed process developed by EPS under USDA grants has been shown to be an effective biocidal agent and is well suited to the disinfection of sprout seeds.
Any commercially useful process must preserve the seed's viability.
This has already been demonstrated in pilot studies on alfalfa seeds so that an optimum combination of treatment (dose) and electron energy (penetration depth) can now be developed for specific seed products.
Non-pathogenic surrogates of the microorganisms of specific concern (E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella spp.) will be used employing the seed inoculation and bioassay techniques already developed with NCFST for alfalfa.
D10 values for pathogens and their surrogates in good geometry will be determined on the EPS pilot processor.
Lethality studies will then be conducted to determine the optimum energy:dose combinations required.
Seed germination and sprout yield determinations will be made to document the utility of the process.
Based upon the outcome, the nutritional studies required to support the petition for industrial use of the process will be determined at NCFST.
The industrial ebfb system at EPS capable of ten kilogray.ton per hour under continuous (box/bag) operation will be available to the program for implementation of the process.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Commercial decontamination of various seeds used by the sprout industry.

There are an estimated 76 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States annually, resulting in 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.
The financial impact has been estimated at $35 billion.
Bacterial pathogens account for 14 million of the total cases.
To assure food safety, monitoring of these pathogens is a critical component.
Cultivation is the gold standard; however, it is laborious and time consuming.
Alternative methods are commercially available, but they do not provide information on viability and could result in the rejection of production lots that would be acceptable by cultivation.
The measurement of cellular adenosine triphosphate is an accepted method of testing for viability that is used within the food industry for monitoring hygiene.
These methods do not differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and therefore, do not provide information regarding the safety of the food.
We are currently developing a biosensor for detecting pathogens in foods.
In the current format, however, it is not capable of differentiating between live and dead cells.
Therefore, we propose to evaluate and enzyme system for incorporation into the biosensor that facilities the measurement of bacterial adenosine triphosphate thus permitting the quantitation of viable numbers of specific pathogenic bacteria in foods.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The work from the proposed Phase I project and subsequent Phase II endeavor would contribute to the development of a highly versatile biosensor that provides rapid testing of foods.
The device would be portable and provide near real-time analysis thus making it appropriate for field use.
It would be applicable to testing food on site making it useful to food processors, regulatory agencies such as the USDA and the FDA, and the military.
We estimate the current total market for rapid pathogen tests in the U.S. food industry to be $480 million annually, thus giving the device strong commercial potential.

We propose to adapt this strategy to develop a quantitative assay for the detection of Campylobacter.
The ultimate assay will be incorporated into a hand held device with an integrated platform that will accommodate high throughput, yet with simple methods that do not require a sophisticated laboratory or highly trained personnel.
Campylobacter currently contaminates from 60- 90% of poultry an quantitative monitoring in conjunction with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans is being considered by the FSIS.
Our assay would enable more rapid and specific quantitative detection of Campylobacter.
This would result in more effective monitoring of HACCP providing for immediate and more rational corrective action.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The assay we propose has the potential to enable the food industry to detect Campylobacter more rapidly and directly in conjunction with HACCP plans.
This would result in a safer food supply and has tremendous commercialization potential.
Our strategy ultimately will be incorporated into a hand held device with low complexity steps so that on site testing is possible with minimal training and instrumentation requirements.

The objective of this Phase I study is to chemically screen flower colorants, seed oils and seed meals from perennial Hibiscus species and hybrids.
Colorants will be extracted from fresh, frozen, freeze-dried and hot-air dehydrated whole flowers from FY-2001 harvests.
All hybrid samples will be harvested and analyzed by color group.
Non-hybrids will be analyzed by species (where no significant color variants are present) and/or by species and color variant as appropriate.
The purpose of these studies is to compare pigment type and density, yield and nutritional content as a function of processing methods, as well as genome.
Bulk seed will be hulled, cleaned and chemically characterized for seed oils and seed proteins.
Materials to be evaluated will consist of bulk samples of FY-2001 seed (separated by species and hybrid).
The purpose of these analysis is to compare seed oil and seed meal quality and yield between species and hybrids, and the chemically screen the oils and proteins to characterize the composition of seed components by species and hybrid.
Successful completion of these analytical screens is a necessary preliminary step to develop Hibiscus as a new crop and identify natural products from Hibiscus flowers and seeds for specialty applications.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Currently, our existing formulators and potential applications for harvestable Hibiscus components include fresh foods (flowers and green pods); value-added food products and bulk commodities; feeds; dietary fibers, starches, sugars, proteins and vitamins; industrial fiber products (fiberboards, plastics, paper, etc) and cellulosic and lignitic materials; nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals (from "green" organs, including roots); seed oils (dietary and industrial); and seed meals.
Other applications include: bio- accumulation of specific nutrients and bioactive compounds; sustainable agriculture for erosion prevention, runoff retention, and soil restoration, horticultural applications; and in situ bioremediation of chemically - and/or erosionally-compromised agricultural and industrial soils.

Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and oligosaccharides in general have received a lot of attention recently, mainly due to their many beneficial health effects and wide applications as prebiotic food.
Enzyme immobilization on cotton cloth activated with tosyl chloride provides many advantages, including high GOS yield, high reactor productivity, improved thermal stability, and good long-term operating life.
The porous cotton cloth gives low pressure drop, good mechanical strength, high surface areas for enzyme immobilization, and low mass transfer limitations, and is inexpensive and easy to scale up.
The feasibility of using such an enzyme reactor for GOS production from whey lactose will be studied in this project.
If successful, the abundant lactose in whey, a byproduct from cheese manufacturing, can be economically converted to a high-value prebiotic product.
Depending on the enzyme source and reaction conditions, the GOS yield may vary from below 20% to as high as 67% (w/w).
Methods to enhance GOS production and product yield will be evaluated to improve the production economics.
Nanofiltration to separate GOS from lactose and monosaccharides also will be studied.
A nanofiltration process may be efficiently used to separate the GOS present in the reactor product stream and recycle the unreacted lactose for improved product purity and yield.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The proposed process would produce a high-value product (more than $10/lb) that can be used as a health-promoting food ingredient and dietary supplement from the surplus whey permeate and lactose (less than $0.4/lb) currently produced in the dairy industry.
The market for GOS is at $200 million per year in Japan alone.
The large, potential U.S. and worldwide markets should exceed $1 billion.
Thus, a cost-effective enzyme technology to produce GOS from whey lactose should increase the product value and reduce the waste (whey permeate) disposal problem facing the dairy industry.

The proposed research will entail efforts to cultivate Osha (Ligusticum porteri), a popular native medicinal herb, for the purpose of developing a new commercial crop for Wyoming growers.
Presently the only source for this plant are wild populations found at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Montana.
Due to high demand for the mature root, the portion of the plant used for medicinal purposes, the species is being over-harvested.
Cultivation of Ligusticum porteri is the key to averting future supply problems and sustaining the quantity of the commodity currently sold in an international market.
The proposed work will focus on seed germination and propagation techniques.
A battery of experiments will test and compare rates of seedling emergence under a variety of conditions emulating natural environmental states.
Percentage of germination and seedling emergence of seed heads, single seeds and root cuttings will be studied and compared.
The second part of the work will consists of a survey of Osha suppliers to ascertain the volume of root traded on the market.
It is anticipated that the resulting numbers will provide incentive for Wyoming growers to raise Osha as a viable economic crop.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful replicable germination and propagation techniques are anticipated as results of this project.
These procedures represent the first step towards determining Osha's economic potential as a sustainable agricultural crop.
Ascertaining the volume of the root commodity traded commercially will provide crucial information needed for economically sound operations.
The data obtained will aid in establishing a new crop that could help boost income of growers and small landowners in a high altitude environment that generally has few alternatives to diversification.
In addition cultivation of this medicinal plant offers a practical solution to its conservation.

According to the 1990 census, the average household per capita income in Washington, Waldo, Hancock counties in Maine were $9,607, $11,047, $12,347 respectively.
About 25% of the household incomes in Washington county were under $10,000; 15% of Maine overall.
Maine's agricultural industry and dependence on tourism economy results in more seasonal part-time work and higher unemployment rates than the rest of the country.
The development and commercialization of a blueberry dietary supplement based on scientific data will expand Maine's rural economy.
Successful marketing and sale of this clinically tested supplement will: 1) Provide manufacturing managerial, professional Maine employment opportunities; 2) Furnish Maine blueberry growers with a sustainable, accessible market; 3) Elevate the standard of living through provision of a prosperous economy.
A dependable blueberry dietary supplement has not been developed in the U.S. based on scientific data.
Scientific research has revealed that blueberry anthocyanins: may contribute to vision health and may provide anti-inflammatory relief.
Phase I proposes a clinical trial investigating the effects of blueberry supplement on human sight that will support the structure/function claim.
"TO PROMOTE VISUAL HEALTH".
Phase I provides the foundation for a market feasibility study to be conducted in Phase II for the rapid commercialization of a blueberry dietary supplement.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
A favorable market feasibility study that demonstrates that rural Maine is the ideal location for a dietary supplement manufacturing facility that can provide year round employment opportunities, a sustainable market for Maine farmers, operates as a considerate environmental neighbor that can co-exist with Maine's tourist economy and has close proximity to the University of Maine and its extension service.

Rural communities benefit economically from revenues generated by outdoor recreationists.
Participation in outdoor recreation provides numerous physical, social and health benefits.
This project could increase the numbers of people who camp, and bring in revenue to rural areas by offering improved accessibility to campers with disabilities.
Tents and vestibules are relatively inaccessible to people who use wheelchairs.
The proposed vestibule will transform a tent into a universally accessible "home away from home" for rural and urban Americans with disabilities.
The accessible vestibule will enable individuals to quickly and independently get in out of the rain and store their wheelchair in a dry space without bringing it into the tent.
It also provides an area for an accessible, private toilet/commode.
The vestibule allows easy, zipperless access via an accessible door.
Inside the vestibule, there will be enough headroom for people in wheelchairs to sit upright, for others to assist in transfers, and there will be room to maneuver the chair.
A secondary application for the vestibule will be to provide a stand-alone, accessible, private shelter for a commode in a group camping situation.
Access to the countless benefits of outdoor recreation will be available to many more Americans.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The successful completion of Phase I will prove the technical feasibility of a universal vestibule and an accessible tent/vestibule design.
Focus groups of various stakeholders including campers with disabilities and outdoor program staff will provide input and feedback on the designs, and a market feasibility study will be completed.
Commercial products which could result are a universal vestibule which works with most 2-4 person tents, a new design of an accessible tent and vestibule, and an accessible, portable commode shelter for group camping situations.
Economic, social, and personal benefits will result for rural communities and campers with and without disabilities.

Agro-Plastics, Inc. has successfully developed and is commercializing a process that uses agricultural fibers as fillers in virgin plastics.
The Agro-Plastic manufacturing plants are designed for small communities, providing employment and non-farm revenues at a time when small rural communities are struggling with depressed crop prices and loss of manufacturing jobs.
As a natural extension of this work, Agro-Plastics, Inc. is proposing to modify its existing process for use with waste (co-mingled) plastic.
This will create additional income streams for rural areas, while reducing currently high waste disposal costs.
To successfully construct this research, Agro-Plastics has teamed with USDA's Forest Products Laboratory, AJ Engineering Company, and Kansas State University.
The research will demonstrate the feasibility of using agricultural fillers to add strength to co-mingled plastic and determine which plastic waste streams can be used.
The project will focus on: improved binding of the co-mingled plastic with the agricultural fillers; improved strength of the co-mingled plastic; reduced cost of the agro-plastic; impact on rural communities; and a market analysis of end uses.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This project will yield the following benefits: new cash crop for the producers by selling wheat straw or other agricultural residue ($60 per ton); recycling option for the community's plastic; high paying plastic's manufacturing jobs (approximately 25 - 30 per plant); and increased tax base.

Our rural electric utility pole distribution system has served rural America for over 60 years.
Many of the original poles from the late 1930's are still in service.
The maintenance of this multi-billion dollar investment is necessary to provide reliable and inexpensive power to rural areas.
Detection of decayed poles help ensure the reliability of this service as well as help ensure the safety of linemen and the public.
Currently used field methods for decay detection have proven useful for detecting only advanced stages of decay.
Even then, poles with advanced decay are missed by trained inspectors more often than realized.
Further consider, if trained pole inspectors make all too frequent errors, what is to be the anticipated error rates for utility line workers with less experience in pole inspection- people who work on these poles often during bad weather at all hours.
The proposed effort is directed at determining the feasibility of detecting decay earlier in the field via micro-toughness testing.
Toughness (the ability to withstand shock loading) is the strength property most severely and rapidly diminished by decay.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The ability to extend the range of decay detection in the field should be afforded by the development of a hand-held electronic micro-toughness tester.
This device should be inexpensive to manufacture, easy to use, durable for rugged field use, and, of benefit to thousands of line inspection crews and utility workers faced with deciding the condition of poles in service.

Rural school districts face major challenges each year creating and managing school bus routes and budgeting funds to pay for increasing transportation costs.
Currently, many rural schools design their school bus routes by acquiring a school district map, placing a stickpin on the where each student lives, and then creating the bus routes with string connecting the stickpins.
In the 1997/98 school year, Nebraska schools spent almost $60,000,000 on transportation costs alone.
At the same time that transportation costs have risen, rural schools have consolidated to form larger districts in order to survive and still serve the public.
Some of these large school districts require buses to travel hundreds of miles each school day.
Phase I research would identify the transportation needs of rural schools and develop a bus routing model for the Geographical Information System (GIS) to meet those needs.
This model would allow the schools to design the most efficient routes, thus reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
In addition, the safety of the children will be increased because GIS will identify dangerous spots, like railroad crossings, turn-arounds, and hazards intersections.
If transportation costs could be reduced, rural schools would save millions of dollars each year.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Phase I will result in a fully functional rural bus routing model for ArcView GIS.
This model would allow the schools to import their student databases, map the students, and then create the routes.
Upon completion of a route, a report will give the length of the route, travel time, total stops, total students, fuel consumption, number of railroad crossings, number of bus turn-arounds, number of hazardous intersections, and any additional features that the rural schools identify as a need.
This model could then be expanded into a Phase II bus routing website.

"The bright yellow roots of Goldenseal are one of the most widely consumed products sold through health and natural food stores" say Steven Foster and James Duke.
Many years of unrestricted wild collection have had devastating effects on native Goldenseal populations.
Annual wild harvests are estimated at more 60 million plants (SCPFRC, 1999).
Currently less than 300 acres are in cultivation (Davis, 1999).
Clearly there exists a pressing need for research into the cultivation of Goldenseal as a commercial crop, but as the market facts indicate there is a tremendous financial advantage to the concept of "Wild Simulated" Certified Organically Grown Goldenseal.
Large scale Goldenseal cultivation is similar to Ginseng production in that both plants require 50% to 75% shade and an investment of more than $25,000 per acre for artificial shade structures (Scott, 1995).
Small family operated farms typically have limited resources.
However, many of these small family farms have an acre of two of hardwood forest, which could easily be certified organic, that wold be suitable for Goldenseal production.
This research project proposes to establish a Certified Organic Crop Production System for Goldenseal suitable for use by these small family farms.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
A successful outcome to this project would present several commercial opportunities: 1) Production of Certified Organically Grown Seed and Rootstock for the establishment of future commercial plantations.
Currently there are few to no vendors nationwide capable of producing Certified Organically Grown seed and rootstock in the quantities required to establish new plantations and that which is available is either too expensive or not compatible with Certified Organic growing guidelines.
2) Production of Certified Organically Grown Roots for the medicinal trade and on-farm processing.
3) Development of a new organically acceptable seed germination stimulant.

China uses more Asian devil's club (Oplopanax elatus) as a medical herb than all Alaskan agricultural export production combined.
We are evaluating the harvesting, processing and marketing of the Alaskan devil's club (Oplopanax horridum) that is primarily owned or controlled by Native Alaskan residents in 13 coastal communities.
The Japanese call this plant (Echinopanax japonicus nakai) and the Chinese and Russians call it (Oplopanax elatus).
Most Asian medical research is written in either Chinese or Japanese.
The root has never been harvested commercially in North America and will make a significant economic impact on those residents of the Alaskan villages that cooperate in this sustainable agriculture endeavor to harvest Alaska's most "obnoxious" weed in a reasonable and renewable manner.
The root grows primarily in the coastal forest of Alaska from Kodiak in the west to Ketchikan in the southeastern portion of the State.
It is estimated to dominate well over 50,000 acres of land and can yield a profit in excess of $10,000 per acre if our early estimates supplied by Chinese scientists can be verified.
Each root is estimated to be worth in excess of $5 each; with the price of a dried root varying from $10 to $30 per dried pound.
Some Chinese pharmaceutical firms appear to be interested in the bark of the root, which may be worth $200 per dried pound.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The successful evaluation of the ownership, harvesting techniques and processing of this renewable devil's club plant; combined with a successful marketing effort will materially effect the economic well being of hundreds of disadvantaged Alaskan Natives that dwell in or near this renewable resource that is often owned by the local Native Village Corporations established under the ANCSA of 1976.

This project seeks to construct a pilot essential oil extraction plant to produce oregano oil and other essential oils from high phenolic plants.
The project is premised upon a strong market driven approach where the VBG as a manufacture and processor of natural products for the veterinarian and pet car industries cannot procure a reliable and adequate source of imported essential oils for their product lines.
The project will use specially selected oregano from Eastern Europe that minimally meets quality standards when grown in the U.S. under a variety of production trials to rapidly identify system(s) to obtain high volatile oil yields and high total phenol content.
Parallel studies will evaluate the best time to harvest oregano for maximum carvacrol content, and also to compare a wide range of high phenolic plants, including as alternative sources of oil.
All essential oils will be chemically characterized using GC and GC/MS analysis and quality assurance protocols will be established.
All planned studies support and are complementary to the ongoing scientific, product development and marketing studies at VBG which evaluate the effectiveness of different oregano oil blends, new oils, and phenols on the efficacy of improving pet, animal and livestock health.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
By developing a source of domestically produced essential oils, new crops can be commercially introduced into the region with minimum risk, and new value-added plant products can be extracted at the processing plant.
To transfer the production and processing information to local and regional grower associations and other farmer associations, two field days and training programs will be held.
This grant will therefore provide the foundation for the establishment of a new and larger essential oil industry focused on oregano oil.

The island of Kauai and especially Hanalei Valley, supplies the majority (approximately 60%) of the State's taro production.
The valley also is home to the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge which is part of the Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service.
Through a unique partnership controlled taro farming creates and enhances the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge programs by providing more than 110 additional acres of nesting and feeding habitats for a variety of indigenous and endangered Hawaiian water fowl.
The apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, is an edible aquatic snail that is a major pest in Hawaii, where it feeds voraciously on aquatic plants, and poses as a major threat to the taro industry.
The apple snail has made its way to the Hanalei Valley first being noticed in February of 1998 and has since spread to adjacent farms as well as into the refuge.
Despite efforts to manually remove the snail, it now threatens taro farming in the valley and ultimately the wetland habitat.
The Phase I research effort will focus on determining the feasibility of marketing wild caught snails as escargot in order to place a suitable amount of "fishing" pressure in an attempt to manage the infestation.
This proposed research will test various commercial feeds to determine a feeding regimen that will result in a processed snail product that is marketable on island during our Phase I effort and to expand to out of State sales during Phase II activities.
The potential impacts are new agricultural product(s) and a means to manage an aquatic nuisance.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Two outcomes are anticipated from the research activities being proposed under Phase I activities.
First is determining the feasibility of utilizing the wild snails, that currently infest the taro farms in Hanalei Valley, as raw material for creating value added snail product(s) that have high marketability and demand.
The production costs for all of the products will have also been identified and refinement in technologies will be implemented during Phase II efforts to produce value added snail products that are economically sustainable.
If this is achieved, the second impact of the proposed project will have also been achieved and that is there will be a means to manage an aquatic nuisance that currently threatens Hawaii's wetland habitats.

Aquaculture wastewater management presents unique problems in treatment technology.
Current methods employ settling of biosolids (fish and uneaten feed) as the primary means of treating aquaculture wastewater.
Due to their fragile nature and constant contact with water, biosolids break into smaller sizes during waste collection.
The suspended solid fraction, which requires more time to settle out, is carried into other rearing ponds of the receiving stream instead of being piped into offline settling basins.
These solids represent a significant impact to receiving streams.
Polyacrylamide (PAM) is effective in reducing soil and associated nutrient losses in irrigated agriculture by complexing soil particles to increase settling rate.
PAM has also been shown to reduce bacteria and may reduce dissolved nutrients in wastewater.
We propose to identify appropriate PAM products and determine concentrations which cost-effectively improve water quality of aquaculture waste supernatant through improved settling efficiency of fish waste.
Reductions in suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen, BOD, and bacteria will be quantified in treated test solutions of fish waste.
Phosphorus leach rates from treated solids and residual PAM levels in supernatants will be determined.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful development of PAM treatments for aquaculture wastewater will provide a cost-effective means of recovering additional biosolids and associated nutrients from aquaculture discharges through more efficient settling.
Employing PAM in aquaculture waste management will improve water quality, help reduce undesirable aquatic vegetation in receiving streams, and may facilitate reuse of nutrients through stabilization of solids and reduce leaching.
PAM-enhanced settling may allow for increased fish production without additional impacts to the resource.
Treatment of turbid water supplies in low flow facilities could also improve fish health and provide for additional production using otherwise marginal water supplies.

The demand for clams is inversely proportional to price.
Labor accounts for 50% of the cost to raise clams with harvesting adding 10% to the market price.
For the clam industry to realize its full potential, efficient harvesting techniques, that are both non disruptive to the organism and the environment need to be developed.
Clam harvesting is currently an extremely labor intensive operation as clams are typically raked manually from their growing beds.
Mechanical harvesters offset some labor cost but are extremely disruptive to the environment and have a high capitalization cost.
These systems have raised environmental concerns because they displace and suspend a large portion of the clam bed in order to filter the clams from the suspended mix.
This project is developing an innovative technique that uses mechanical vibrations to guide an extractor through the clam bed to remove only the clam.
Not only is the technique less disruptive to the environment, but there is also less mechanical work being performed.
There is a concern with the technique about the affect of vibrations on the clam.
This project will conduct the necessary biological studies to determine the impact on clam longevity and adjust the system as necessary.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The goal of this effort is to obtain a validated design concept for using vibratory techniques to aid in the harvesting of clams.
This design will serve as a springboard for Phase II prototype development and subsequent commercialization.
The design will be based on a characterization of the clam beds, extractor configuration and vibratory loads required and will be validated through field tests.
A biological assessment of the impact of vibrations on clam longevity will be conducted.
An assessment of the environmental impact and impact on non-target organisms will also be conducted.

This project will enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. aquaculture industry by providing a cost- effective means of increasing the rate of genetic improvement of hybrid striped bass.
We will compare the reproductive, hatchery and grow-out performance of selectively bred hybrid striped bass and backcross hybrid striped bass of common genetic origin.
We will also benchmark our findings via comparative trials unselected, commercially available, fingerlings.
We will also improve methods of preserving striped bass semen as a means of broadly transferring genetic gains and facilitating low-cost, on-farm selective breeding.
This approach will enable us to select potential broodstock from large populations for use in selective breeding in Phase II.
In Phase II, we will build on our initial results by: (1) evaluating the potential of different strains of selectively bred hybrid striped bass and backcross hybrid striped bass, (2) utilizing genotyping to track the pedigree of the best-performing progeny from large populations of hybrid striped bass and backcross hybrid striped bass to implement a cost-effective genetic improvement program utilizing combined selection for growth rate.
This project will leverage six years of prior work, enabling rapid, broad-based commercial diffusion years ahead of when the results could be transferred by conventional methods.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This project will dramatically reduce the cost of implementing selective breeding for aquaculture.
Results will be broadly transferable to industry, and enable growers to rely on their own female broodstock (which can be selected for on-farm performance) for hybridization using preserved milt from selected, domesticated males.
This approach to stock improvement is standard within other livestock industries, but hasn't been implemented within aquaculture.
Development of select strains will increase harvest weight and reduce unit production costs.
As such, the project holds the potential to shift hybrid striped bass from a successful "niche" product to a $100+ million/year mainstay of the aquaculture industry.

Coldwater disease (CWD), caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, results in severe losses to salmonid aquaculture worldwide.
In recent years, this disease has had a significant economic impact on commercial, Federal and State aquaculture facilities in the U.S. Immunization against this disease would provide the most benefit to producers, and although significant protection has been observed under laboratory conditions, no commercial vaccines exist.
This is likely due to virulence differences observed among F. psychrophilum isolates.
This Phase I study will evaluate and identify immunogenic antigens of F. psychrophilum and determine the role of virulence-associated proteins in conferring antibody- mediated protection.
Limited data exists on the immune response of fish to F. psychrophilum, but is considered essential to developing a vaccine to CWD.
Therefore, this study will 1) evaluate antibody responses to F. psychrophilum following immunization via injection and immersion routes, 2) identify the major bacterial protein components to which an antibody response is generated, and 3) determine the importance of these antigens in protection from pathogen challenge.
This will greatly increase our understanding of the immune response to this disease and provide a foundation for the development of vaccine in Phase II studies that would greatly benefit the aquaculture industry.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This Phase I study will serve to characterize the immune response to F. psychrophilum and identify antigens essential for the development of a protective immune response in fish.
If major antigenic proteins are identified it will be possible to move forward to Phase II development of a CWD vaccine.
This will be based upon production of either a recombinant vaccine expressing a specific gene of interest, or a traditional formalin-killed whole cell vaccine using F. psychrophilum strains expressing high levels of antigenic components.
Commercial development of such a product would greatly benefit public and private aquaculture worldwide.

The global shrimp industry (wild and farm raised) is currently valued at over $26 billion, and is suffering losses of billions of dollars annually because of disease.
Unlike other food animal commodities, the shrimp culture industry is unable to protect their crop through vaccination due to a lack of a sophisticated immune system in shrimp.
Therefore, the prevention of these devastating financial losses must be predicated on accurate early detection of pathogenic agents.
However, at present there are only limited diagnostic modalities available to the industry.
Those that are available are slow, expensive and technically exacting.
The shrimp industry, both farm raised and wild caught, is in dire need of a spectrum of diagnostic products to meet their diversified testing requirements.
Monoclonal antibody based enzyme immunoassays are being developed as a result of previous USDA/SBIR funding to help meet some of these market requirements.
However, the lack of biomass to assay, the lethality of new pathogen-host interaction before sufficient antigenic material can be produced, and the latency aspects of certain of the viruses may relegate the use of capture immunoassays to quick screening assays or simple confirmatory technologies.
The proposed research will demonstrate proof of concept in developing real- time, sensitive diagnostic formats using proven DNA probes and primers to the most economically important viral pathogen to the U.S. shrimp industry, White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV).
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The anticipated results from this Phase I project will be the development of proof of concept for the adaptation of pathogen specific nucleic acid primer sets for the rapid detection of exotic virus infections in shrimp using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
This novel diagnostic method will be a critically important tool for near zero tolerance programs such as regulatory testing of imported product and high-health broodstock certification.
Proof of concept for a second novel DNA-based detection method will also be developed using oligonucleotide modified gold nanoparticles.
This rapid, sensitive diagnostic method will fill the significant need of the industry in being able to perform real-time testing under field conditions.

Feeding fish represents about 50 to 60% of the direct production expenses of an aquaculture operation.
Wasted feed during the feeding process can range from 10 to 40%.
Feed waste has negative environmental impacts.
Waste accumulated underneath fish pens is toxic and must be removed periodically, which translates into additional labor costs.
Hand feeding methods are labor intensive while some automated or semi-automated systems can cause more waste feed.
Acoustic systems are commonly used for monitoring fish and other objects in marine and freshwater environments.
Previous attempts to apply acoustic technology to the fish farming industry for fish biomass estimates and feed monitoring have been made.
However, no cost effective or efficient system for feed and waste monitoring exists.
We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative integrated acoustic system with the following key elements: digital sonar, current meter, decision making and operator display.
Our preliminary experiments with sonar monitoring of feed pellets in fish pens have been successful.
Direct comparisons of fish feeding with and without our monitoring system will be made at a local fish farm.
A comparison evaluation will be made using a common existing monitoring technique (e.g., airlift).
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
We anticipate integrating and testing an acoustic system for fish feeding and waste monitoring.
We expect that with this system, the fish feeding process can be automated and the quantity of waste reduced.
Maximizing the efficiency of the feeding process will reduce feed costs and improve water quality.
After a feasibility study as proposed in Phase I, and further development and testing in Phase II, this technique could be applicable to the national fish farming industry where salmon are produced in sea pens.
The integrated acoustic-computer-sensor system will produce estimates of total pellet wastage by scanning an "acoustic window" underneath the net pen.

Commercial-scale marine aquaculture has the potential to close the gap between an increasing demand for high quality seafood products and a marine fisheries near maximum sustainable yields.
Intensive recirculation systems are regarded as one critical component of a commercially viable marine aquaculture development program.
However, the application of recirculating technology for the production of marine organisms has lagged behind freshwater applications, due in part to the lack of design criteria for system components operating in a marine environment.
To fully realize the economic potential of intensively stocked marine recirculating systems, a gas exchange system capable of transferring oxygen into the water, while removing carbon dioxide is critical.
This research project will modify a multi-stage low head oxygenator (MS-LHO) and its supporting gas transfer simulation program to operate efficiently in a marine system over a range of salinities with minimum energy input.
Dissolved carbon dioxide removal capability will be added by coupling a low profile packed-bed stripping column to the MS-LHO as a pretreatment step.
Overall system performance will be optimized using simulation programs for gas transfer and field experience with prototype systems.
Finally, the economic feasibility of producing full-scale marine grade MS-LHO units coupled with stripping columns will be determined.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The development of a gas exchange system designed specifically for large-scale, intensive commercial marine recirculating systems.
The combined MS-LHO coupled with stripping columns will provide for increased system carrying capacity, improved water quality and feed conversion, yielding improved economic viability.
AST plans to commercially produce and actively market several production model MS-LHO/CO2 gas transfer units.
These units will be designed to readily complement exiting commercially available recirculating system technologies.
Potential marine species for intensive recirculating aquaculture include hybrid stripped bass, black drum, pompano and flounder.
Future markets are expected to develop for saltwater ornamental fish, grouper, gray snapper, cobia and spiny lobster.

Tetrapoid Pacific oysters have been used for production of 100% triploids for four years, with production doubling almost every year.
To expand the market 100% triploids worldwide, cryopreserved tetraploid germ plasm offers the most viable strategy.
This proposal is intended to capitalize on the combined successes of tetraploid technology that have been developed by Taylor Resources, Inc. and 4Cs Breeding Technologies, Inc., and of the recent successes in cryopreservation obtained with C. virginica at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center.
Development of successful procedures for tetraploid sperm will enable immediate commercialization and make possible worldwide distribution of tetraploid oyster germ plasm.
It will also open new horizons in the breeding potential of tetraploids.
Phase I is designed simply as a "proof of concept" for cryopreservation of tetraploid sperm.
Our goal is to demonstrate that tetraploid sperm can be frozen, stored, shipped and thawed, and used to make healthy, 100% triploid crosses after as much as three months of storage.
(Of course, overall we intend to store sperm for year-long intervals.)
Our specific objectives are the following: (1) Optimize the cryopreservation of tetraplolid sperm and (2) demonstrate stable storage of the product by bioassays of thawed sperm in the hatchery.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Cyropreserved gametes (sperm in particular) will facilitate commercial production.
A year's supply of tetraploid sperm can be frozen and stored and when needed, simply shipped in from a central storage facility.
This would also alleviate the need to condition animals during periods of time when they are not normally sexually mature.
Instead, tetraploids could ripen in the field, and batch processed once at the appropriate time of year.
Cryopreservation also will allow distribution of tetraploid technology worldwide for creation of 100% triploid larvae and adults.
Cryopreserved gametes will facilitate future research on breeding approaches using tetraploids of other species.

Pearl culture is the most lucrative aquaculture industry in the Pacific Islands, and is an ideal development activity for remote, otherwise-impoverished atolls.
Commercial farmers in the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands must be hatchery-based, offering opportunity for value-added improvements from triploidy for little additional cost.
Techniques for inducing triploidy in Pinctada margaritifera will be developed by refining practices established for edible oysters and other Pinctada species.
Cytochalasin B and 6- DMAP will be tested at different timings, exposures, and concentrations.
Percentage triploids and survival of larvae and spat will be tracked.
This research represents the first known triploidy trials with tropical bivalves and the first use of 6-DMAP in Pinctada.
Advantages of triploidy may be more pronounced in tropical animals with extended reproductivity in even faster growth.
The widespread use of triploid bivalves suggests a good likelihood of success in Phase I. Phase II efforts will subsequently quantify commercial advantages of triploid pearl oysters.
Triploid animals will be seeded, and the success rates and value of pearls from triploid and diploid animals compared.
Reduced age at first seeding, increased pearl size, perpetually sterile gonads and avoiding stresses of pre-operative conditioning could all potentially increase pearl production or values and improve farm profitability.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
BPI could rapidly incorporate triploidy into our hatchery operations in Hawaii and Majuro, and hatchery projects in Cook Islands, Thailand and Phillippines.
Farm revenues could increase for little additional cost.
Increased profitability is particularly crucial to start-up farms in the fledgling hatchery-based industry in Hawaii and the Pacific.
Few other development options are feasible for these rural areas.
Pearl farming offers diverse employment opportunities, and socio-economic benefits including reversing rural-urban drift, and encouraging supportive industries.
Pearls could boost exports and increase foreign exchange.
American pearls might substitute for imports-primarily from Japan - currently worth over $400 million
annually.

The proposed work will demonstrate the feasibility of culturing foodfish in Coal Bed Methane (CBM) discharge water; water is always a byproduct of methane recovery.
A major restriction to the growth of the aquaculture industry, nationwide and worldwide, is the availability of constant temperature, consistently high quality water.
A potentially major source of this quality of groundwater could be made available for a niche aquaculture industry through the utilization of CBM discharge water.
Methane extraction is rapidly accelerating due to a recent high court ruling.
The primary constraint to aquaculture development in CBM discharge waters is the widespread perception that fish may bioaccumulate heavy metals to levels of concern for consumers.
No research has been conducted to address this issue.
In Phase I, CBM discharge water will be tested as a direct culture medium for fish.
The research will determine the bioaccumulation of targeted heavy metals in the edible portion of trout grown directly in these waters.
These levels will be compared with FDA's "levels of concerns" as well as for significance of accumulation in the edible portion of the fish.
This research program will lay the foundation for commercial prototype development utilizing this resource for intensive aquaculture applications.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Successful resolution of the bioaccumulation issue will enable demonstration of commercial prototypes for CBM aquaculture in Phase II.
While overall there are vast water volumes discharged during CBM extraction, there are not large individual flows; this necessitates unique designs that combine multipass open and recirculating criteria.
The Powder River Basin of Wyoming/Montana has existing wellheads that could produce 15,000,000 pounds of fish annually, with farmgate values over $200,000,000.
CBM aquaculture has potential nationwide, as virtually all states have coal reserves.
Methane extraction technology can be utilized whether or not coal is mined; regional aquaculture can be developed concurrent with CBM extraction.

In recent years there has been considerable interest in using natural plant fibers as reinforcements for plastics.
The motivation includes cost, performance-enhancement, and weight-reduction.
High- performance, bast fibers such as kenaf, and flax could potentially substitute glass or carbon fibers as reinforcements for plastics.
The success of these short fibers as reinforcements in plastics depends on the quality of the bond between the fibers and the resin which is determined by the amount of surface area of the fiber available for bonding.
This proposal presents a novel approach to enhance the reinforcement between the bast fiber bundles and the matrix resin during molding of the product.
This technology, if feasible, will (1) `fibrillate' the fiber bundles for better adhesion with the polymeric resin; (2) disperse the fiber uniformly within the composite product for more consistent properties; (3) reduce the damage to the fiber during fibrillation; and (4) improve the wetting and adhesion of the fiber to the matrix; (5) improve handling and mold filling; and (6) eliminate one pre-processing step to prepare the fiber during manufacture of the composite.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Natural fiber reinforcements can increase both the stiffness and strength of plastics thus increasing their use in structural applications such as containers, pallets, plastic lumber, and automotive interiors.
The proposed technology, if feasible, will allow the manufacturer of high-performance, consistent quality components.
Commercialization will involve the development of a `proprietary processing reactor' for manufacturing polymeric composites with natural bast fibers as reinforcements.
These reactors will be manufactured under a licensing arrangement for use by polymer compounding companies, extrusion companies as well as injection molders who use natural fiber reinforcements in their products.

A novel fermentation process and extraction system are proposed to produce a biodegradable, non- corrosive deicer from biomass wastes and crops containing sugars and starches.
Sodium and calcium chlorides now extensively used in road deicing cause corrosion damage to automobiles, bridges, and highway infrastructure.
Further, significant environmental damage occurs from accumulation of these salts in soils, and surface ground waters, thereby requiring capital and energy intensive treatment systems.
The effective utilization of the byproducts generated from agricultural operation is one of the cornerstones of policies aimed at energy conservation and sound environmental management.
Fermentation studies will be conducted in batch and continuous flow reactors with silica bead immobilized cells to convert lactate to acetate and propionate, using P. acidipropionici bacteria.
The effects of cell immobilization and aggregate formation on acid productivity, concentration, and yield will be investigated, as will the effect of glucose addition in maintaining high cell densities in the reactor.
A continuous flow ion-exchange system will be investigated for the extraction of the acids, and deicer production.
The methodology and approach developed in this work can be used in the design and operation of fermentation systems for the efficient conversion of a variety of waste streams to organic acids.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The annual demand for salt for deicing applications at present is about 30 million tons, and this demand is expected to increase as more roads and highways are constructed in the future.
Even at 10% use of substitute deicer in critical areas such as bridges, that market for a non-corrosive deicer will be in excess of $3 billion.
The proposed process offers the possibility of reducing market costs for a benign deicer by more than 50% compared to CMA.
Moreover, the reduction in waste treatment costs will make this process attractive to agricultural operations that generate high BOD wastes.

As a result of doubt about water quality, American consumers spend about $5 billion dollars annually on bottled water and home purification systems.
Since 1994, total revenues of the U.S. residential water treatment industry have grown at a compound annual rate of 8.2%, increasing from $1.6 billion at the retail level in 1994 to $2.2 billion in 1998.
Most of the existing home treatment systems for removal of drinking water contaminants use ion exchange resins, which are costly and short-lived.
TII proposes the development and production of versatile "Envirofilter" for use in home water treatment systems.
Envirofilter will use granular activated carbons produced from select agricultural by-products subjected to special a combination of physical, chemical and thermal treatments to create an adsorption matrix with maximum affinity for both organic and inorganic compounds found in drinking water.
Envirofilter is expected to provide consumers with an efficient, low cost and reliable purification of their drinking water while helping to preserve the environment through conversion of agricultural wastes into value added products and replacement of short-lived and costly petroleum-based ion exchange resins currently used in drinking water purification.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
If successful, the proposal research will lead to the production of custom design granular activated carbons and based filtration systems that have large commercialization potential in drinking water purification in homes, rural communities and towns.
Other potential markets include wastewater and storm water treatment, environmental remediation (treatment of polluted water streams), and food purification and recycling (e.g., recycling of frying oils generated by the food and food service industries).

With the U.S. importing over 55% of its petroleum, largely for transportation, the domestic ethanol industry has been growing to help eliminate this trade burden and long-term economic liability.
But current capacity of nearly 2 billion gallons accounts for less than 2% of this country's needs and growth has been limited due to costs compared to gasoline.
Fortunately an opportunity to expand the ethanol industry exists using the remainder of the corn plant, called corn stover, as a fermentation feedstock for ethanol.
Since less than 10% of the corn crop goes into ethanol, there is an ample supply of corn stover.
Technoeconomic estimates of producing ethanol form biomass like corn stover find it competitive with corn ethanol.
Still efficient production of fermentation products from the multiple biomass sugars is a technical challenge.
Fortunately, a microorganism has been found and developed that can produce value- added fine chemical coproducts on these biomass sugars.
The Phase I effort will demonstrate fine chemical production on corn stover-like sugar mixtures, and on authentic corn stover feedstock.
Additionally, using the same fermentation microorganism, initial steps will be taken to develop it to produce a different fine chemical product, which has a large market.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
This SBIR effort will address the problem improving ethanol economics by developing at least two value-added coproducts that can be made in an ethanol plant.
These coproducts will provide a significant revenue stream while requiring minimal plant modification.
These coproducts can be produced in either a new corn stover ethanol plant, or in numerous dry mill ethanol plants throughout the rural Midwest.
Final commercial use will be a partially purified coproduct suitable for blending in feed thus adding value to existing feed coproducts.
Also, this technology will demonstrate that many higher-value chemicals can be produced from biomass.

The primary goal of the feasibility study proposed here is to document the effectiveness of producing free fatty acids and fatty acid esters using a system where 1) a motionless mixer is the reactor; 2) free fatty acids are the catalyst; and 3) reaction times to achieve 95+ percent yields are on the order of minutes, instead of hours.
In short, this work will demonstrate the most highly intensified (high yield per volume per time) fatty acid reaction system ever developed.
The importance of this study is two-fold: 1) the high intensity reaction system will allow significant reductions in capital investment for producing fatty acid derivatives, and 2) the no-catalyst strategy based on use of free fatty acids will allow use of formerly waste feedstocks, a net reduction in raw material costs, and a net increase in overall fatty acid resource utilization.
This means more fatty acid derivatives available at lower cost, whether for industrial chemical products or for fuels.
It also means that smaller processing facilities can be economically sited in conjunction with rendering plants, oil seed processing facilities, and waste oil recovery operations.
Access to this category of intensified processing is an essential element in including fats and oils in the overall scheme of a biorefinery operation.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The new process technology offered in this proposal will directly impact the economics and utilization of fats and oils in industrial applications.
The greatest impact will be a means of utilizing poor quality resources for high quality products.
This technology will make materials like yellow grease, tallows, and possibly, soapstocks more valuable for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass.

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: MR. WILLIAM J. FLEMMING
TOPIC AREA: INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
In the production of rice crops, there is a considerable amount of biowaste generated in the forms of hulls and straw.
Hundreds of millions of tons of rice hulls are generated annually.
Rice hulls have been utilized as biofuels and as a supplement in animal feed.
However, the market for hulls is a small portion of the hulls generated, and this results in landfilling the excess.
Rice hull ash generated from biofuel operations is used to a limited degree in such markets as foundries, where it is used as ladish cover.
However, the steady growth of rice production is resulting in ever-increasing solid wastes as hulls, hull ash, and straw.
The process proposed herein is a method to utilize rice biowaste to produce liquid silicates.
The ash content of the hulls and straw are high in silica content, and the form of this silica is desirable for the production of sodium silicates.
Presently, sodium silicates are produced predominantly in high temperature reverberatory furnaces by fusion of silica sand and soda ash.
The proposed process would require a fraction of the energy required in the furnaces process, and would result in significant reductions in air emissions and solid waste generation.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The sodium silicate industry continues to see good market growth rate.
As existing furnace capacities are maximized, producers are faced with installing new furnaces.
This is capital-intensive, and retrofits into existing plants are difficult.
In some cases, producers have purchased existing glass plants and retrofitted for sodium silicate production .
The proposed process offers a technology for producing silicates which is significantly less capital intensive and will result in lower operating costs.

Pelletized Straw will develop and test formulas for the production of pellets made from grasseed straw for use as an organic mulch in support of the establishment of turfgrasses in commercial and residential applications.
We will test for pellet formulations that retain the high bulk density of initial trial product while seeking to feed an optimum fiber length to the pelleter.
We will test our best formulations under field conditions to determine how the material will react when it is hydrated and ruptured by the action of the water.
We will test for uniformity of coverage on the soil surface and for the ability to resist movement under pressure from wind and water.
We will select a formulation that shows optimum characteristics when fed to the pellet machine with excellent adhesion and flow rate yet will rupture to form a uniform ground cover that will remain in place, provide superior water infiltration and retention, and keep the soil surface open to oxygen transfer.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
We expect to be able to develop a superior product that will be in demand by the turfgrass industry.
We will develop a product that is useful and relatively mistake proof in assisting professionals and amateurs to perform a fairly complex task, starting turfgrass seed on bare soil.

GRANTED AMOUNT: $69,957/6 MONTHS
The proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a volume transport and holding container for live fish and aquatic product.
The proposed container would aerate, cool and circulate water using liquid air and no external power supply.
The technology would allow a cost effective means to maintain a hibernation-like torpor in fish to overcome physiological constraints of volume live transport and holding.
The technology would: allow up to several weeks transport/holding times; allow denser packing of fish with less water; minimize respiration and fish discharges; eliminate the need for feeding during transport/holding; and minimize stress to fish.
Preliminary estimates of shipping costs from an inland U.S. location to an Asian port would be less than $1.00 per pound of fish including: the capital costs of the container and components: all shipping and handling of fish and water; liquid air; and return shipping (empty) of the containers.
The Phase I research would focus on two major feasibility issues: 1) The engineering of the tank and components; and 2) The physiological effects on the fish of cooling, holding, and then warming.
The research utilizes a team of engineers and fish biologists employed by Allied Engineering Services, Inc. and Montana State University.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Development of a cost-effective transport/short-term holding container would open opportunities in several existing and potential future markets including: 1) live food fish such as lobster, trout, salmon, talapia, etc. to domestic and international markets; 2) live bait fish to domestic and international markets; 3) fingerlings for aqua-culture and wild stocking; 4) domestic and international niche markets such as carp to Asians; and 5) wild and farmed fish from remote locations.
Successful development of a live aquatic intermodal transport system will open new markets thereby increasing the utility, desirability, and monetary value of previously un(der) utilized aquatic resources.

TOPIC AREA: MARKETING AND TRADE
GRANTED AMOUNT: $70,000/6 MONTHS
It is believed that the future of Hawaii's agricultural diversification and sustainability efforts have great economic potential and continues to evolve as social and economic factors change.
As part of Hawaii's agricultural diversification, sustainability, and community development effort, Kini Po-Po Creations, Inc. has chosen to compete in the organic herbal tea market, utilizing traditional Hawaiian healing herbs.
The company has popularized the use of the mamaki and the kookolau plants in the development of a unique Hawaiian herbal tea that is grown organically on a commercial scale to support the local and tourists on the islands.
However, a critical component of success and for growth outside the islands is Kini-Po-Po's ability to develop a sustainable marketing strategy that allows it and other small family farms to become and remain competitive in the domestic and international tea and organic herbal tea marketplaces.
The goal of this effort is to improve the livelihoods of rural people in Hawaii in an environmentally friendly, equitable, and sustainable manner by giving people control of their resources and a lifestyle they are used to.
This proposal aims to determine appropriate marketing strategies for Kini Po-Po to pursue and to position itself in the global marketplace as a major cooperative producer, manufacturer, and marketer of organic Hawaiian herbal products in niche markets.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
It is Kini Po-Po's goal to expand the production, development, and marketing of organic Hawaiian herbal teas and to initially gain 2 percent of Celestial Seasonings total herb tea market.
This would result in an initial market size of over $2 million annually and would require an additional 68 acres of Hawaiian healing herb plants to be cultivated, at an estimated farm gate value of approximately $750,000.
It is believed that these initial results are very achievable and is based on recent sales experience of similar teas to the islands' tourist and local markets.
Within five years, it is estimated that the project will require over 200 acres and will generate over $2.2 million dollars to Hawaii's farmers.

The basic premise being pursued in this proposal is whether or not small aquaculture producers can effectively retail their product directly to the end consumer.
We are proposing a series of research steps to lead towards the development of the capability to direct retail market from an indoor fish farm.
We are focusing on direct sales to restaurants using UPS Specific Day Delivery System (can next day "locally" for $0.25 per lb=
We intend to survey and work with a specific target group of restaurants to determine their needs and suggested formats for ordering and product mixes.
After the survey results, a limited research effort will be made to implement such a sales program to evaluate its effectiveness.
Over 70% of fresh fish fillets are sold to restaurants as the final purchasing unit, generally through some type of seafood wholesaler.
Since the restaurant buyer is paying near retail prices for fresh seafood, this proposal addresses this customer base as the primary marketing target for small fish farming enterprise.
Home consumers are another direct target.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The seafood industry is still cemented into the traditional selling structure of the farmer (fisherman) to processor to wholesaler to a retailer and the retailer finally selling to a restaurant or family consumer.
These various levels result in high prices of the end product and also compromise "freshness" of an extremely perishable commodity.
Internet sales to the final consumer are increasing at an accelerated pace.
This tool may be effectively used to structure sales to capture a higher percentage of the profit margin than the traditional approach of direct sales to a processor or food service group.

The rapidly growing demand for natural and organic foods is well documented.
Much research has been done on production methods of raising "natural" chickens using a pastured poultry approach, as well as producer-to-consumer direct marketing systems such as Community Supported Agriculture and Farmers' Markets.
However, comparatively little research exists regarding any means of connecting small family poultry producers with larger volume retail markets.
Two significant barriers that currently pose obstacles for this producer group are the lack of local, qualified poultry processing plants and a steep learning curve in marketing through retail supermarkets.
This project will examine key issues in developing an integrated production/processing/marketing program for pastured poultry raised on small family farms.
Specifically, it will 1) outline the requirements for modifying existing small meat processing plants or erecting new buildings and outfitting them for processing poultry to State and federal inspection standards, 2) prepare a product cost analysis, including production, processing and distribution costs, and 3) evaluate retail consumer feedback and willingness to pay for the product to gage demand and price.
The result of this project will be a report useful to small poultry farming groups interested in capturing a greater share of higher volume retail sales opportunities
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
The results of this study will assist small farm producer groups in evaluating the feasibility of establishing local small poultry processing facilities and provide benchmark product cost and retail pricing data for business planning purposes.
Should the data predict favorable economic returns, it will support the addition of small poultry processing plants in a number of rural communities, bringing economic benefits associated with additional employment.
Establishing a more reliable market will further benefit these communities by providing an incentive to small producers to adopt affordable, higher profit pastured poultry operations.

This project will improve the market value of U.S. aquaculture products through the development of an improved system for transporting, holding and distributing live finfish.
In Phase I, we will develop a new anesthetic Aqui-S that holds tremendous promise for mitigating handling stress.
We will also develop and evaluate key components of a low-cost, modular transport system that promises to significantly increase transport densities and improve survival.
The modular container will provide partial life support and will be designed to easily interface with an external life support system for longer term holding prior to final product distribution.
This capability will eliminate the need to sequentially transfer and handle live product and will stabilize and improve environmental water quality conditions.
Innovative features include: (i) methods of reducing sloshing to minimize stress an physical damage to the fish, (ii) systems to control dissolved gasses to avoid exposure to hyperoxic conditions and elevated C02, and (iii) the ability to extend the use of the transport container for storage and final product distribution.
These elements will form the core of a more efficient distribution system, facilitating expansion of high-value, live seafood markets and increase producer profitability.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS/POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH
Improvements to live product handling and shipping technology are expected to reduce product transportation costs by 50% while extending the available time for marketing by as much as 60%.
Because transportation of live finfish represents such a large portion of the producers operating budget, advances are expected to have a very significant impact on producer profitability.
For a hypothetical producer, increased efficiency and better outcome after transport are projected to increase gross profit by 38%.
The modular system being developed will also facilitate direct marketing efforts and help establish a more efficient, flexible and robust system of distribution.
