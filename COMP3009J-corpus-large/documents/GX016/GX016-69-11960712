Near my residence along the Rock River a rainwater pond sits accross a cornfield about 150 yards from the river, the immediate area around the pond is lightly wooded.
I have visited this site on and off for many years in search of the individual species responsible for their part in the orchestra that fills the spring and summer nights.
The water only stands about three feet deep in early spring and nearly dries up during mid to late summer.
A light amount of vegetation grows in the water due to the rains expanding the shallow pond beyond its boundaries.
In late March I visited this pond/puddle and found five Chorus frogs in the water and spotted about a half dozen on land a few feet from the waters edge.
A mixture of both females and males were present(dark-male light-female).
Many others could be heard amongst the woods but were well camoflouged.
Few American toads present at this time of year.
In late April I again visited the area to find that the Chorus frogs had nearly all gone back to the deeper woods farther off and the puddle was now abundant with American Toads most were in a state of amplexus.
Large numbers of eggs had already been laid on the half dying vegetation.
I also observed six Grey's Tree Frogs all clinging to fallen timber in the puddle.
Of these I caught five (released after observation).
Of these five four were males(dark throat) and one was female(white throat).
There were also two Southern Leopard Frogs present at this time.
I will continue my observation on this location and many others and post them in the future.

In the past 10 years here in the Stony Chase trailer park, bordering the little elk river, in Elkton, Maryland I have seen the numbers of the red backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus cinereus, continue to decline to the point that now they are completely gone from this area :( __________________________________________________________________

In May of 2000, we excavated a small pond (1/5 of an acre) where previously a dry field was.
Our acreage is surrounded by pasture land.
After the first rainfall, the pond held some water, and Green frogs appeared overnight.
In the year since, we have monitored the frog population closely.
To date, the BullFrog population seems to be steadily increasing! There is still a healthy population of Green Frogs and Northern Cricket Frogs, and an overabundance of Fowler's Toads and Copes Gray Treefrogs! The most interesting find this year has been two Blue Bullfrogs, one found living at the pond's edge, the other living in a drainage ditch nearby.
For a picture of the first blue Bullfrog, go here: http://hikers.home.mindspring.com/ponds/pondpage.html
The entire region surrounding us is being heavily deforested due to urban sprawl.
One natural pond about 1 mile away was drained and paved over with a parking lot.
We will continue to monitor our local area for changes in amphibian populations.

I am a major frog lover! I have a huge frog collection and have been kissing toads since I could pucker.
I have seen the number of frogs decline rapidly in a pond near my family summer home in St. Albans Maine.
There is a small cove near our home which I dubbed "the frog pond" many years ago.
I spent hours down by the water watching the frogs and catching them - always to release them back.
In the last few years I have noticed less and less frogs there.
It really disturbs me.
Please let me know what I can do!! __________________________________________________________________
11 September 2000 Monique Sloatsburg, NY (USA)
We have been living this past 4 years on a quiet street here in Sloatsburg that is historically known as "Peepertown."
This nickname due to the annual chorus of hundreds of frogs which can be heard every spring.
We have these frogs because there are a variety of wetland sites throughout the area, including an approximately one acre pond adjacent to our home.
We don't often see the frogs, however, this past summer was very wet.
We've had dozens of tiny little green and brown frogs hopping through our gardens! I am unsure of type but know by sound that we have spring peepers and gray treefrog in the area.
Sloatsburg is a village, still rural in character, in the Ramapo Pass area of New York, just west of Harriman State Park.
The Ramapo River, a watershed, runs through the village.
We, unfortunately, are in danger of a push for massive development in the upland areas of the village.
The type that will cut through mountains, fill in wetlands, and stack homes, without regard for our environment.
I fear we too will eventually lose our little friends.
I will watch and continue to report observations as our environment changes.

22 August 2000 Renae Willamette Valley, Oregon (USA)
Frequency of Observations: Almost Daily
Species: Male Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora), Many unidentified bright green frogs, same size, red legs on inside.
Eggs, don't know if newt or frog, some new today.
Habitat: 20 acres undeveloped natural land, forest, river at end of property, creek through property, beaver dams causing marsh lands, ponds.
Lots of local wildlife.
Aquatic wildlife observed: frogs, fish, beaver, muskrat, crayfish, lots of rough skinned newts.
Great blue heron fishes almost daily.
Changes: I'm new here, but the landlord has been here 20 years and is conservation-minded, so probably not too many.
I did notice when I cleared the debris from the culvert yesterday, allowing water into the lower pond, for the first time I heard frogs at night.
Would like to know how to identify 
Red legs are listed as a "sensitive" species here.

7 January 2000 Mike Lake County, California (USA)
As a child I observed the population of yellow legged frogs which teemed in Kelsey Creek, located in the Cobb Mountain area of Lake County, California, from roughly 1961 to 1985.
Their termination was abrupt and brutal, affecting the large population of aquatic garter snakes and pacific pond turtles that fed on them.
At first I thought a that a seven year drought was responsible, but that was eight years in the past and to the best of my knowledge the population has never recovered.
The decline affected many other species of reptiles and the area is something of a reptile ghost town, given the many varieties it hosted, in the days of my youth.
A really sad business which really leaves one feeling helpless, and wondering about Northern California's future.

20 August 1999 Kyla Redding, CA (USA)
These observations take place in my neighborhood, which is near a field.
The field is a wetland full of oak trees and foxtails.
The wetland is by Highway 44.
My yard has trees, logs, and bushes, as well as a lawn.
I live in Redding, CA, which is in Shasta County.
I'm 14, and throughout my whole life (which I've lived in the same neighborhood) there have always been a lot of western toads hopping around my neighborhood.
If I walked outside at night, I could always find at least 3 toads quickly.
There were also certain places in my yard where I could always find them sleeping during the daytime.
There were always sure to be some dead ones in or at the side of the road in the summer.
Over the past several years, I've noticed a dramatic population drop.
I no longer see dead ones in the road and although I've gone looking for them many times, I have only seen one adult western toad in the past 2 years, which was in the parking lot at the Mt. Shasta Mall.
I'm very concerned about this because I remember how plentiful they used to be, and now I've only seen just one in 2 years.
I remember once, several years ago, my sister found a small, living tree frog with no skin on one of its hind legs, so the bones and the muscles were showing, but it was able to hop around without any trouble.
I haven't seen any construction, recreational use, or destruction of habitat in my neighborhood.

We have lived on a hill above a large (1 acre) pond for thirty years.
When my children were small (they are 27 and 29 now) we used to catch buckets and buckets of frogs over the course of the summer.
We would also listen to their calls at night - all kinds of calls (low rumbled, high shrill, etc.)
In the past about 6 years, when a friend's grandchildren have come to catch frogs, we have only seen a few frogs.
Also, at night, through most of the summer last summer, we heard no frogs.
I will go down this spring and check - I hear a frog from time to time interspersed with the peepers.
We have snapping turtles in our pond.
Could they affect the frog population in such drastic ways? I miss the frogs.

27 May 1999 Heather Sanford, NC (USA)
As a child (between 1980-1986) toads and frogs were in abudance here (North Carolina Piedmont).
There were so many it was an obstacle course any time you drove and a bucket could be filled in a matter of minutes.
I have noticed a major depletion of toads in this area.
What I'm sure is the major cause of this depletion is the development of new subdivisions that have cut off the water supply to most of the older neighborhood creeks, of which most are now completely dry.

10 May 1999 Katy Northbrook, IL (USA)
I'm a 21-year-old college student.
Every year of my life, I've spent vacations in Perham, Minnesota, where my family owns a cabin on Little Pine Lake.
Perham is in Ottertail County, in the west-central part of the state.
When I was a child, perhaps when I was 8-11 (which would be 10-13 years ago), my friends in Perham and I would spend our evenings catching frogs and toads.
We would just go out on the road next to a swampy area and catch dozens of them.
We would keep them for a day or so in a cooler and observe them, and we'd usually have about 25-30 in there--so frogs were definitely abundant!
I'm not exactly sure when the decline started happening, because we stopped catching frogs for fun, but I have noticed for at least the past five years that we just don't find frogs anymore.
When I go out walking on the same road, near the same swamp, I can sit there for ten minutes and not see a frog.
Of course, there a few still around, but there is a marked decline from what it used to be.

9 November 1998 April Lake Park, FL (USA)
I work in a wetland research program.
I have noticed a decline in the species diversity at our sites.
These sites are also undergoing vegetative change (exotic species invading) and hydroperiod changes due to nearby development.
Just last year I noted lots of pig frogs (Rana gyrula) calling; these were primarily in fairly pristine deepwater cypress swamps in SW Florida.
These swamps are now being overun with West-Indian Marsh Grass (Hymenachne); it agressively crowds into any open space in the center of the cypress domes, where previously there had been native lilypads (Nuphar sp.) and pickerel weed (Pontedaria lanceolata).
This year I have heard VERY FEW pig frogs, although I am out at these sites the same amount of times as last year.
I am also noting that I am not seeing nearly as many young Hylids or other Ranids...I could go on 
28 October 1998 Beth Lake Zurich, IL (USA)
Six years ago we built a small pond in our back yard (6' diameter) with waterfall 
In each of the previous 5 years we have had many (5-20) chorus frogs in and around the pond at any one time, along with a few toads and a couple very rare sightings of a leopard frog.
Our 2nd year we had tadpoles by the thousands! This year, we've only had a couple of chorus frogs, but we've had 10-20 leopard frogs in the pond at one time....the sunnier the day, the more frogs come to sunbathe on the waterfall.
There is always at least 10 of them just "hanging out" around the pond at all times.
Also, this year for the first time we've had 3 different bullfrogs appear out of nowhere.
Each time, we've captured him gently and taken him to a nearby lake 
Also, we were trying to save the lives of the leopard frogs 
Also, this year for the first time, we were visited by a "Chicago Garter Snake", who stayed for a few weeks, then just as suddenly disappeared.
It's been a very unusual year.
Out of all the frogs we've seen over the last 6 years, there has only been one that I can remember that had a deformity (deformed webbing on his foot).

7 October 1998 Jim Berkland, Geologist Glen Ellen, CA (USA)
Folks, I am a retired Geologist who has retired to my former home in the Valley of the Moon of Sonoma County, CA.
I was here from 1937-67 and returned in 1997.
I noticed with the first winter rains the total absence of toads, which used to cross the roads in abundance (often getting smashed.)
I used to turn over boards, rocks and walk along the creeks and see many toads.
The local paper does not seem interested in the loss of these interesting little fellows.
Also there used to be hundreds of Western Newts walking through the woods in Winter.
Last December along Stuart's Creek, our hiking group saw only four, and one had a forked tail.
It was an Audubon preserve, so we could not collect it.
Little by little, we are losing it.

6 October 1998 Beth Seattle, WA (USA)
I live in a houseboat in urban Seattle on Lake Union.
When we first moved here in 1974, I saw the occasional frog in the little garden along the shoreline.
Then around 1985, they disappeared.
I put out frog "houses" and worked to make the garden habitat as frog friendly as possible.
No frogs.
Suddenly this year I have over 20 frogs of two different species (One is the Cascade frog.
The other one, I haven't figured out yet) along the shoreline, and a couple of toads in the garden.
This is interesting to me because just last year, the City completed a new separated sewer system that reduces pollution in the lake.
This year, we also have--for the first time in twenty years--river otters along with a renewed population of crawdads to feed the river otters.
Is something good happening here? __________________________________________________________________
28 September 1998 Stephanie Provo, UT (USA)
The only wild amphibians I have seen since coming to Utah are toads on the Lytle Preserve in the southwestern corner of Utah (Mojave).
I was there in July and there were hundreds of young ones.
My husband says there were frogs in Utah Lake (motto: Dump your old farm equipment here!) when he was growing up here, but we haven't seen any in the last few years.

28 September 1998 Jeremy West Somerville, Victoria, Australia
Five years ago we could go out to our pool and find about 5 frogs (some deformed).
We would scoop them out and put them in a bucket and when they felt good again they jumped away.
Now, in 1998 for the past few years we have seen none.

23 September 1998 David Almquist Orlando, FL (USA)
I lived in Orlando for 3 years and found that Hyla gratiosa (Barking Tree Frogs) were not very common.
I found all of the other Hylas that live in the area, but only heard H. gratiosa once or twice.
I talked to several people who all said that they had been relatively common just a few years ago, but that they are rarely encountered now.
