General Comments [Docket No. 96N-0417] Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Dietary Ingredients and Dietary Supplements Greetings FDA, i would kindly like to make a submission to the above docket number 96N-0417.
my name is Terry S. Singeltary Sr. and on 12-14-97 my mother died from Heidenhain Variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
i have researched this daily ever since.
EXACTLY one year to the day previously on 12-14-96, my neighbor _also_ lost his mother to sCJD. both of these cases confirmed.
in the case with my _neighbors_ mother, she had been taking a nutritional supplement called IPLEX; IPLEX; (listing only potentially TSE tainted tissues) vacuum dried bovine BRAIN, bone meal, bovine EYE, veal bone, bovine liver powder, bovine adrenal, vacuum dried bovine kidney, and vacuum dried porcine stomach.
[please note, Dr. Gibbs and NIH/CDC took the particular batch of pills (what was left) from my neighbors mother house and did testing on them that came back negative.
at the same time, he told me the testing techniques to date may not have picked up any low level infectivity, and she had been taking these type supplements for years, so it could have been another batch, especially if the accumulation theory plays in as opposed to the single dose theory.
my opinion they are both likely.]

We must take all reasonable measures to prevent BSE from developing in the United States.
Therefore, the practice of using animal protein in cattle feed should be discontinued as soon as possible.
Waiting until the first case of BSE is diagnosed in the United States will certainly be closing the barn door after the horse is gone.
With a disease having a 3- to 6-year incubation period, thousands of animals would be exposed before we recognize the problem and, if that happens, we would be in for a decade of turmoil.

There were 105 newly infected flocks, reported in FY2002 (figure 4).
In addition, 379 scrapie cases were confirmed and reported by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in FY 2002 (figure 5) and (figure 6).
Five cases of scrapie in goats were reported in FY 2002 (figure 7), the last of which was confirmed in August 2002.
New infected and source flocks numbers and the number of these flocks released in FY 2002 are depicted in chart 4.
One hundred (100) flocks which is 67 percent of the scrapie infected and source flocks present in FY 2002 were released or put on clean-up plans in FY2002.
Slaughter Surveillance Slaughter Surveillance is currently in Phase II which is intended to determine the prevalence of scrapie in the US culled sheep population.
Through September 2002 samples from 3,269 sheep were submitted to NVSL for testing.
Samples from a total of 6,795 sheep have been submitted since the beginning of Phase II on April 1, 2002.
Surveillance regions are depicted in (figure 8).
Scrapie Testing During FY 2002 11,751 animals have been tested for scrapie which includes: 2,711 regular necropsy cases, 1,343 third eyelid biopsies for the test validation project, 546 third eyelid biopsies for the regulatory program, and approximately 7,151 animals for Phase I 
Laboratory testing has been taking 10 - 11 days on average with a range of 3 - 34 days.

an interesting finding from a French Iatrogentic CJD case, that was identical to a scrapie strain; NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE 4/02/01 NEW SCIENTIST EDITORIAL PAGE 3 MAD SHEEP DISEASE? IF THERE is one categorical pronouncement you can safely make about prion diseases like BSE or CJD, it is that one should not make categorical pronouncements.
British beef is safe and there is no BSE in Germany come to mind.
Now there are two more: scrapie is safe, and people don't catch sporadic CJD. Scrapie is the most widespread prion disease, infecting untold numbers of sheep worldwide.
Sporadic CJD is the old-fashioned pre-BSE kind that is supposed to happen spontaneously in unlucky people.
But a surprise observation in France suggests some sCJD cases--though by no means all--may be linked to scrapie after all (see p 4).
For years, British authorities asserted that BSE was harmless because it was a form of scrapie.
In fact, the only evidence scrapie is safe is some broad-brush epidemiology, good as far as it goes but unable to reveal occasional risks for some people from some sheep.
Alarm bells should have rung in 1980 when researchers gave monkeys scrapie by feeding them infected brains.
But that research, like so much other work on prion diseases, was never followed up.
We still have little idea what BSE does in pigs and chickens.
The Queniborough vCJD outbreak (see p 5) would be easier to understand if we knew how much brain we must eat to be infected.
As for scrapie, it shouldn't take a chance finding to tell us that there may be dangerous sheep out there.

This disease has raised concerns about the possibility of an iatrogenic secondary transmission to humans, because the biological properties of the primate-adapted BSE agent are unknown.
We show that (i) BSE can be transmitted from primate to primate by intravenous route in 25 months, and (ii) an iatrogenic transmission of vCJD to humans could be readily recognized pathologically, whether it occurs by the central or peripheral route.
Strain typing in mice demonstrates that the BSE agent adapts to macaques in the same way as it does to humans and confirms that the BSE agent is responsible for vCJD not only in the United Kingdom but also in France.
The agent responsible for French iatrogenic growth hormone-linked CJD taken as a control is very different from vCJD but is similar to that found in one case of sporadic CJD and one sheep scrapie isolate.
These data will be key in identifying the origin of human cases of prion disease, including accidental vCJD transmission, and could provide bases for vCJD risk assessment.
Introduction The recognition of a variant of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the U.K. in 1996 raised the major concern that it would correspond to human infection with the agent responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; ref. 1).
Transmission of BSE to macaques provided the first experimental evidence as it produced a disease close to vCJD in humans (2).
Strain typing in inbred mice (consisting of measuring the incubation period and establishing lesion profiles corresponding to the strain-specific distribution of brain vacuolation) allows reliable identification of TSE strains (3).
This method, together with biochemical methods, has revealed a single phenotype for the agents of BSE and the British cases of vCJD (4-6).
Mice expressing only the bovine prion protein (PrP) were highly susceptible to vCJD and BSE, which induced the same disease (7).
Thus, it is now well established that BSE has caused vCJD, probably by alimentary contamination.
In this respect, the finding of abnormal PrP labeling in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic tissues of orally BSE-contaminated lemurs shows that the BSE agent can infect primates by the oral route (8).
About 1 million contaminated cattle may have entered the human food chain, and the future number of vCJD cases could range from 63 to 136,000 depending on the incubation period of BSE in humans (9).
Unlike sporadic CJD (sCJD) and iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) linked to the administration of contaminated growth hormone extracted from human hypophyses, in vCJD, the infectious agent seems to be widely distributed in lymphoid organs, as pathological PrP (PrPres) can be detected in tonsils, lymph nodes, spleen, and appendix even in the preclinical phase of the disease (10, 11).
This raises a public health issue with regard to the risk of iatrogenic transmission of vCJD through surgical instruments, grafts, blood transfusion, or parenteral administration of biological products of human origin.
However, this risk is difficult to assess, because it largely depends on factors such as the virulence of the BSE agent adapted to primates and the efficiency of secondary transmission to humans by a peripheral route such as the i.v. one.
A further issue is whether vCJD accidentally acquired from humans would be recognized.
The latter poses the question of a phenotypic variation of the BSE agent after successive transmissions in humans: does it retain its strain characteristics, and does it induce a pathology similar to that observed in the previous host? A 9-year history of transmission of BSE to primates and mice enables us today to clarify a number of these important points.
Although BSE has mainly affected the U.K., two definite cases and one probable case of vCJD have now been reported in France in people who have never resided in the U.K. (12, 13).
We strain-typed the first of these cases to establish its origin.
Strain typing in C57BL/6 mice of BSE, French, and British vCJD was compared with that of BSE passaged in nonhuman primates, thus allowing us to study the effect of serial passages in primates.
Comparisons were also made with French cases of sCJD and iCJD and two strains of scrapie (one of French and one of U.S. origin).
Our findings provide experimental demonstration that the same agent, namely that responsible for the cattle disease BSE, has caused vCJD both in France and in the U.K., in line with biochemical data and with the fact that, until 1996, about 10% of the beef consumed in France was imported from the U.K.
We found that the BSE agent in nonhuman primates is similar to that causing vCJD in humans and tends to evolve rapidly toward a primate-adapted variant.
Furthermore, we showed that the strain responsible for iCJD is closely related to that of one patient with sCJD, and, more unexpectedly, that these agents were similar to the French scrapie strain studied (but different from the U.S. scrapie strain).
This finding requires a cautious interpretation for several reasons, not least because of the inevitably limited number of TSE strains that can be studied by such a cumbersome method as strain typing.
Nonetheless, it also prompts reconsideration of the possibility that, in some instances, sheep and human TSEs can share a common origin.

Abstract Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of deer and elk, and little is known about its transmissibility to other species.
An important factor controlling interspecies TSE susceptibility is prion protein (PrP) homology between the source and recipient species/genotypes.
Furthermore, the efficiency with which the protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) of one species induces the in vitro conversion of the normal PrP (PrP-sen) of another species to the protease-resistant state correlates with the cross-species transmissibility of TSE agents.
Here we show that the CWD-associated PrP-res (PrPCWD) of cervids readily induces the conversion of recombinant cervid PrP-sen molecules to the protease-resistant state in accordance with the known transmissibility of CWD between cervids.
In contrast, PrPCWD-induced conversions of human and bovine PrP-sen were much less efficient, and conversion of ovine PrP-sen was intermediate.
These results demonstrate a barrier at the molecular level that should limit the susceptibility of these non-cervid species to CWD. snip...
Clearly, it is premature to draw firm conclusions about CWD passing naturally into humans, cattle and sheep, but the present results suggest that CWD transmissions to humans would be as limited by PrP incompatibility as transmissions of BSE or sheep scrapie to humans.
Although there is no evidence that sheep scrapie has affected humans, it is likely that BSE has caused variant CJD in 74 people (definite and probable variant CJD cases to date according to the UK CJD Surveillance Unit).
Given the presumably large number of people exposed to BSE infectivity, the susceptibility of humans may still be very low compared with cattle, which would be consistent with the relatively inefficient conversion of human PrP-sen by PrPBSE.
Nonetheless, since humans have apparently been infected by BSE, it would seem prudent to take reasonable measures to limit exposure of humans (as well as sheep and cattle) to CWD infectivity as has been recommended for other animal TSEs. snip... http://www.emboj.org/current.shtml Scrapie to Humans? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve

about pea size.
what did Paul Brown say about this previously; i bring your attention to (page 500) Dr. Paul Brown statements; 253 1 DR. BOLTON: I have an additional question about 2 that.
What is the assurance that additional locally sourced 3 tracheas are not added into that manufacturing process, thus 4 boosting the yield, if you will, but being returned to the 5 U.S. as being produced from U.S.-sourced raw material? 6 DR. McCURDY: Are there data to indicate how many 7 grams, or whatever, of infected brain are likely to infect 8 an organism, either animal or man, when taken orally? 9 DR. BROWN: If I am not mistaken, and I can be 10 corrected, I think a half a gram is enough in a cow, orally; 11 in other words, one good dietary-supplement pill.
12 DR. McCURDY: What I am driving at is the question 13 we are asked is really not do we wish to regulate these 14 things coming in.
I think the statements about difficulties 15 in regulating things in the future or near future for new 16 regulations were probably accurate.
17 But I think that we could exhibit some quite 18 reasonable concern about blood donors who are taking dietary 19 supplements that contain a certain amount of unspecified- 20 origin brain, brain-related, brain and pituitary material.
21 If they have done this for more than a sniff or something 22 like that, then, perhaps, they should be deferred as blood 23 donors.
24 That is probably worse than spending six months in 25 the U.K. 254 1 DR. BROWN: That is exactly right.
I think that 2 is why the discussion has apparently been on things that are 3 not directly related to these questions because, in order to 4 think about deferrals for blood donors who are taking 5 dietary supplements with things like bovine brain in them, 6 it is very important that we know that those products are 7 safe.

Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of humans and scrapie disease of sheep and goats were transmitted to squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) that were exposed to the infectious agents only by their nonforced consumption of known infectious tissues.
The asymptomatic incubation period in the one monkey exposed to the virus of kuru was 36 months; that in the two monkeys exposed to the virus of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was 23 and 27 months, respectively; and that in the two monkeys exposed to the virus of scrapie was 25 and 32 months, respectively.
Careful physical examination of the buccal cavities of all of the monkeys failed to reveal signs or oral lesions.
One additional monkey similarly exposed to kuru has remained asymptomatic during the 39 months that it has been under observation.

Thank you for your interest in the paper.
In respect of your first question, the simple answer is, yes.
As you will find in the paper, we have managed to associate the alternate phenotype to type 2 PrPSc, the commonest sporadic CJD.
It is too early to be able to claim any further sub-classification in respect of Heidenhain variant CJD or Vicky Rimmer's version.
It will take further studies, which are on-going, to establish if there are sub-types to our initial finding which we are now reporting.
The main point of the paper is that, as well as leading to the expected new variant CJD phenotype, BSE transmission to the 129-methionine genotype can lead to an alternate phenotype which is indistinguishable from type 2 PrPSc.
I hope reading the paper will enlighten you more on the subject.
If I can be of any further assistance please to not hesitate to ask.

The summary does tend to give a particular slant to the epidemiology of BSE which is not totally sound.
It is a possibility that the agent of BSE may be in the cattle population in a number of countries already apart from the USA and that clinical cases are occurring on rare occasions.
It is also important to off the possibility of the relationship between BSE and certain low-temperature rendering systems.
For that reason a number of other countries apart from the USA and France are at risk and, in particular, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Belgium.
For these reasons it would be wise to move to an international ban on the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants.
Clearly
the summary also needs to refer to the incidence of BSE in the UK and not solely to Great Britain.
No doubt this has been tidied up in your comments on the summary conclusions.
It is a pity that more of the comments put forward by Dr. Kimberlin have not been included in the summary since his views on page 13 are succinct and valuable... snip... http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/yb/1989/08/29003001.pdf Is there a Scrapie-like disease in cattle ? IN CONFIDENCE R.F. MARSH snip... re-mink rancher 'Wisconsin' dead stock feeder using 
The possibility of infection with BSE in the United States, as defined by studies on the disease in Great Britain, is judged to be low on the basis of the following
: (1) meat and bonemeals imported into the United States from Great Britain between 1980 and 1988 were used mainly in poultry, not ruminant feed; (2) the Scrapie Eradication Program had reduced the prevalence of scrapie in the United States compared with that in Great Britain; and (3) little, if any, rendered animal products are used for protein supplements in cattle feed in the United States.
However, there is some evidence that there may already be a scrapie-like disease in cattle in the United States.
This evidence comes from epidemiologic studies on an incident of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) in Stetsonville, Wis, in 1985.
This mink farmer used no commercially available animal by-product mixtures in his feed, but instead slaughtered all animals going into the mink diet, which included mostly (
To examine the possibility that cattle may have been the source of this incident of TME, two 6-week-old Holstein bull calves were inoculated intracerebrally with mink brain from the affected farm.
The bulls developed neurologic disease 18 and 19 months after inoculation.
Both brains had spongiform degeneration at necropsy and both were transmissible back to mink by either intracerebral (incubation period of 4 months) or oral (incubation period of 7 months) inoculation Whereas TME has been thought to be caused by feeding scrapie-infected sheep to mink, this theory has no conclusive evidence.
Experimental oral inoculation of mink with several different sources of sheep scrapie has never been successful, and an incubation period of less than 12 months has never (sic) produced by intracerebral inoculation.
Transmissible mink encephalopathy can develop naturally by infection with incubation periods of less than 12 months.
There is reason to believe that scrapie has not been transmitted in the United States from sheep to cattle by rendered protein concentrates as it was in Great Britain.
However, some circumstantial evidence exists that cattle may be a source of some TME infections.
It is recommended that we increase our surveillance for a BSE-like disease in American cattle by encouraging state diagnostic laboratories to formalin-fix specimens of midbrain and brain stem from bovine brains submitted for rabies testing.
If results of these tests are negative, these fixed tissues can then be examined for evidence of spongiform degeneration of the gray matter.
-Comments on bovine spongiform encephalopathy J Am Vet Med Assoc 197 (4): (1990) Letter to the Editor, Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, August 15, 1990 In my article, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United States (JAVMA, May 15, 1990, p 1677), I stated that little, if any, rendered animal products are used for protein supplements in cattle feed in the United States.
I have since learned that this is incorrect, because of the recent trend of using less assimilated by-pass proteins in cattle feed.
A large amount of meat-and-bone meal is being fed to American cattle, and this change in feeding practice has greatly increased the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) developing in the United States.
Epidemiologic studies on BSE in Great Britain have indicated that the disease originated in cattle by exposure to the heat-resistant transmissible agent in compounded feed containing rendered animal protein.
The most likely source of infection was assumed to be meat-and-bone meal prepared from scrapie-infected sheep, but it is also possible that a heretofore unrecognized scrapie-like infection of cattle could have been spread in the same manner.
Because of concern for the possible development of BSE in the United States, the American rendering industry discontinued the processing of fallen and sick sheep last December.
In my opinion, this was a prudent policy, but one that will not prevent the possible transmission of BSE from cattle to cattle.
As emphasized in my article, there is some evidence that BSE-like infection may already exist in American cattle.
The current practice of feeding meat-and-bone meal to cattle solidifies the most important means to perpetuate and amplify the disease cycle.
In Great Britain, BSE has produced a great economic and emotional burden.
We must take all reasonable measures to prevent BSE from developing in the United States.
Therefore, the practice of using animal protein in cattle feed should be discontinued as soon as possible.
Waiting until the first case of BSE is diagnosed in the United States will certainly be closing the barn door after the horse is gone.
With a disease having a 3- to 6-year incubation period, thousands of animals would be exposed before we recognize the problem and, if that happens, we would be in for a decade of turmoil.

an interesting finding from a French Iatrogentic CJD case, that was identical to a scrapie strain; NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE 4/02/01 NEW SCIENTIST EDITORIAL PAGE 3 MAD SHEEP DISEASE? IF THERE is one categorical pronouncement you can safely make about prion diseases like BSE or CJD, it is that one should not make categorical pronouncements.
British beef is safe and there is no BSE in Germany come to mind.
Now there are two more: scrapie is safe, and people don't catch sporadic CJD. Scrapie is the most widespread prion disease, infecting untold numbers of sheep worldwide.
Sporadic CJD is the old-fashioned pre-BSE kind that is supposed to happen spontaneously in unlucky people.
But a surprise observation in France suggests some sCJD cases--though by no means all--may be linked to scrapie after all (see p 4).
For years, British authorities asserted that BSE was harmless because it was a form of scrapie.
In fact, the only evidence scrapie is safe is some broad-brush epidemiology, good as far as it goes but unable to reveal occasional risks for some people from some sheep.
Alarm bells should have rung in 1980 when researchers gave monkeys scrapie by feeding them infected brains.
But that research, like so much other work on prion diseases, was never followed up.
We still have little idea what BSE does in pigs and chickens.
The Queniborough vCJD outbreak (see p 5) would be easier to understand if we knew how much brain we must eat to be infected.
As for scrapie, it shouldn't take a chance finding to tell us that there may be dangerous sheep out there.

This disease has raised concerns about the possibility of an iatrogenic secondary transmission to humans, because the biological properties of the primate-adapted BSE agent are unknown.
We show that (i) BSE can be transmitted from primate to primate by intravenous route in 25 months, and (ii) an iatrogenic transmission of vCJD to humans could be readily recognized pathologically, whether it occurs by the central or peripheral route.
Strain typing in mice demonstrates that the BSE agent adapts to macaques in the same way as it does to humans and confirms that the BSE agent is responsible for vCJD not only in the United Kingdom but also in France.
The agent responsible for French iatrogenic growth hormone-linked CJD taken as a control is very different from vCJD but is similar to that found in one case of sporadic CJD and one sheep scrapie isolate.
These data will be key in identifying the origin of human cases of prion disease, including accidental vCJD transmission, and could provide bases for vCJD risk assessment.
Introduction The recognition of a variant of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the U.K. in 1996 raised the major concern that it would correspond to human infection with the agent responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; ref. 1).
Transmission of BSE to macaques provided the first experimental evidence as it produced a disease close to vCJD in humans (2).
Strain typing in inbred mice (consisting of measuring the incubation period and establishing lesion profiles corresponding to the strain-specific distribution of brain vacuolation) allows reliable identification of TSE strains (3).
This method, together with biochemical methods, has revealed a single phenotype for the agents of BSE and the British cases of vCJD (4-6).
Mice expressing only the bovine prion protein (PrP) were highly susceptible to vCJD and BSE, which induced the same disease (7).
Thus, it is now well established that BSE has caused vCJD, probably by alimentary contamination.
In this respect, the finding of abnormal PrP labeling in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic tissues of orally BSE-contaminated lemurs shows that the BSE agent can infect primates by the oral route (8).
About 1 million contaminated cattle may have entered the human food chain, and the future number of vCJD cases could range from 63 to 136,000 depending on the incubation period of BSE in humans (9).
Unlike sporadic CJD (sCJD) and iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) linked to the administration of contaminated growth hormone extracted from human hypophyses, in vCJD, the infectious agent seems to be widely distributed in lymphoid organs, as pathological PrP (PrPres) can be detected in tonsils, lymph nodes, spleen, and appendix even in the preclinical phase of the disease (10, 11).
This raises a public health issue with regard to the risk of iatrogenic transmission of vCJD through surgical instruments, grafts, blood transfusion, or parenteral administration of biological products of human origin.
However, this risk is difficult to assess, because it largely depends on factors such as the virulence of the BSE agent adapted to primates and the efficiency of secondary transmission to humans by a peripheral route such as the i.v. one.
A further issue is whether vCJD accidentally acquired from humans would be recognized.
The latter poses the question of a phenotypic variation of the BSE agent after successive transmissions in humans: does it retain its strain characteristics, and does it induce a pathology similar to that observed in the previous host? A 9-year history of transmission of BSE to primates and mice enables us today to clarify a number of these important points.
Although BSE has mainly affected the U.K., two definite cases and one probable case of vCJD have now been reported in France in people who have never resided in the U.K. (12, 13).
We strain-typed the first of these cases to establish its origin.
Strain typing in C57BL/6 mice of BSE, French, and British vCJD was compared with that of BSE passaged in nonhuman primates, thus allowing us to study the effect of serial passages in primates.
Comparisons were also made with French cases of sCJD and iCJD and two strains of scrapie (one of French and one of U.S. origin).
Our findings provide experimental demonstration that the same agent, namely that responsible for the cattle disease BSE, has caused vCJD both in France and in the U.K., in line with biochemical data and with the fact that, until 1996, about 10% of the beef consumed in France was imported from the U.K.
We found that the BSE agent in nonhuman primates is similar to that causing vCJD in humans and tends to evolve rapidly toward a primate-adapted variant.
Furthermore, we showed that the strain responsible for iCJD is closely related to that of one patient with sCJD, and, more unexpectedly, that these agents were similar to the French scrapie strain studied (but different from the U.S. scrapie strain).
This finding requires a cautious interpretation for several reasons, not least because of the inevitably limited number of TSE strains that can be studied by such a cumbersome method as strain typing.
Nonetheless, it also prompts reconsideration of the possibility that, in some instances, sheep and human TSEs can share a common origin.

Abstract Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of deer and elk, and little is known about its transmissibility to other species.
An important factor controlling interspecies TSE susceptibility is prion protein (PrP) homology between the source and recipient species/genotypes.
Furthermore, the efficiency with which the protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) of one species induces the in vitro conversion of the normal PrP (PrP-sen) of another species to the protease-resistant state correlates with the cross-species transmissibility of TSE agents.
Here we show that the CWD-associated PrP-res (PrPCWD) of cervids readily induces the conversion of recombinant cervid PrP-sen molecules to the protease-resistant state in accordance with the known transmissibility of CWD between cervids.
In contrast, PrPCWD-induced conversions of human and bovine PrP-sen were much less efficient, and conversion of ovine PrP-sen was intermediate.
These results demonstrate a barrier at the molecular level that should limit the susceptibility of these non-cervid species to CWD. snip...
Clearly, it is premature to draw firm conclusions about CWD passing naturally into humans, cattle and sheep, but the present results suggest that CWD transmissions to humans would be as limited by PrP incompatibility as transmissions of BSE or sheep scrapie to humans.
Although there is no evidence that sheep scrapie has affected humans, it is likely that BSE has caused variant CJD in 74 people (definite and probable variant CJD cases to date according to the UK CJD Surveillance Unit).
Given the presumably large number of people exposed to BSE infectivity, the susceptibility of humans may still be very low compared with cattle, which would be consistent with the relatively inefficient conversion of human PrP-sen by PrPBSE.
Nonetheless, since humans have apparently been infected by BSE, it would seem prudent to take reasonable measures to limit exposure of humans (as well as sheep and cattle) to CWD infectivity as has been recommended for other animal TSEs. snip... http://www.emboj.org/current.shtml Scrapie to Humans? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve
