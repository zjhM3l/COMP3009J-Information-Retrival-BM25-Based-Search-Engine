Magic Is Alive IN INDIA _________________________________________________________________ By LEA TERHUN George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic sets the benchmark for special effects worldwide, as it has ever since Star Wars changed filmmaking three decades ago.
Now Indian production companies are expanding capacity to meet international demands for digital animation.
Ramesh Sharma thinks the benefits will be bigtime.
A smooth glide from Delhi on the Noida Expressway, a turn into a peaceful road flanked by trees, and you are in Film City.
Buzz isn't obvious, but signs pointing the way to the Zee TV studios hint that you're in the right neighborhood for it.
A pleasant edifice rises at the end of the block, all brick, steel and glass.
It is the headquarters of Moving Picture Company.
Inside abundant light, splashes of primary colors, and emphatic vertical space create a serene atmosphere that belies the intensity within.
Computers in edit suites and open stations hum under the fingers of artist-technicians who are the stars at this high-tech dreamworks of filmmaker Ramesh Sharma and his wife Uma Gajapati Raju.
Moving Picture Company spins films from ideas into cine-reality: ads, documentaries, short subjects and, most recently, 3D animated cartoons.
It is on the front lines of an emerging trend, a product of the union of talent and technology.
India, like the surfer girl heroine of the Disney cartoon feature Lilo and Stitch, is on the crest of a wave of digital outsourcing, and people like Ramesh Sharma are ready to ride.
Sharma has been in the film business for nearly 25 years.
His first film, Monastery Wreathed in a Thousand Rainbows (1979), was a documentary about the 16th Karmapa and Rumtek monastery in Sikkim.
A few years later Sharma achieved notoriety with his exceptional feature film starring Om Puri and Shashi Kapoor, The New Delhi Times (1985).
Irked by the anti-corruption message-the story line dramatized the nexus between politicians and criminals-the government banned the award-winning film for a time.
Since then Sharma has maintained a respectable profile in film production in partnership with his wife Uma, also a well-known media professional.
Moving Picture Company has steadily grown, always with an eye toward the future.
And, according to Sharma, digital animation is the future.
"I've been very keen that we should get into animation, primarily because we are a creatively driven company and we can bring a whole lot of value to this business," he says.
Success in information technology, and the increase in diverse business product outsourcing to India, leads him to one conclusion, "India is a dominant force."
India's "incredible taskforce" and the incredible volume of potential work from customers abroad, particularly the United States, Canada and Japan, plus demands of the domestic market spell opportunity for savvy film studios
.
Digital animation is now essential for motion picture visual effects, video games-"close to a $37 billion industry," Sharma points out-workaday ads, network IDs, or bread-and-butter documentaries.
"Animation is going to be one of the biggest growth markets," declares Sharma.
He is ebullient because a special project has just been completed: the pilot for a new cartoon series based on the Panchatantra-in 3D.
Investment in 3D animation technology, currently available at only a few Indian studios, was a carefully considered decision.
Already involved in many co-productions for documentaries and with feature films on the story board, the next step for Moving Picture Company was an upgrade to 3D to complement its 2D facilities.
"We are doing ad films completely in 3D, for a company called NOW, an Internet service provider."
Now he hopes to market his winsome cast of Panchatantra-inspired animal cartoon characters in Jungle Tales (Jungal Mangal in Hindi) to a global audience.
"We started looking for stories we felt would have crossover appeal, a story that would have appeal for children all over the world.
So we selected the Panchatantra tales because they are based on animals, and animals have no culture-specific rules," he says.
Global outreach is an important part of the vision of Moving Picture Company.
"In fact," Sharma says, "we are looking at possibilities of setting up idea cells and developmental cells in the U.S. and in the U.K. where we will have writers, creative people, develop it according to the market there, but the intellectual property rights are co-owned by us.
So we don't become just a service industry, but we become partners in creativity...a kind of global partnership, so that we make a product that can be then sold worldwide."
A recently completed documentary, Afghanistan: Beyond the Taliban Years, co-produced with U.S.-based TeleProductions International (TPI), is one such film which uses all the bells and whistles of digital filmmaking and is targeted at a multinational audience.
Tweaking a film to satisfy differing country-to-country requirements is easy in the digital world.
There are two roads to travel, Ramesh Sharma explains.
One is outsourcing, "basically doing the backend work, which means the designs are all made in America.
The entire development of the story idea is done in America.
The narrative soundtrack comes from America, and we execute it here."
The other is creative co-production, for which state-of-the-art studios are well equipped.
Moving Picture Company has 30 engineers, including 18 core people who are both technical and creative whizzes.
Every-thing is done in-house.
Nothing is outsourced.
With two studio floors, eight edit bays, camera people, writers, editors and the new 3DS Max/Discreet technology, "it's one stop shopping," Sharma says.
Co-production with well-endowed foreign partners makes sense economically.
The Jungle Tales series consists of 26 episodes, 23 minutes each.
It is an expensive proposition.
In regular 2D, the minimum cost for a 23-minute cartoon is $150,000.
"3D, $200,000 minimum, maybe even more.
It can't be less," according to Sharma.
Chief animator, National Institute of Design-trained Anupama Chatterjee, adds, "It's a gargantuan task...you have to create the actors and make them act."
Regardless of the exhausting attention to detail required, she finds the work "very exhilarating."
Blossoming enthusiasm in the industry led to the founding of the Animation Producers Association of India (APAI) in October, which counts UTV Toons, Pentamedia, Padmalaya, Tata Elxi, Crest and Maya Entertainment among its members.
So far the outsourcing market has been dominated by providers in the Far East, so to get a piece of that action APAI will represent members at important international festivals, create a Web site, and generally put out the good word that magic is alive in India, too.
"Long format animation, advertising films, visual effects for movies, all of that is a part of the world of animation.
Lagaan-look at the clouds coming in.
You can't get those kinds of clouds otherwise," Sharma observes, a gleam in his eyes.
"That is computer graphics.
It can be done today.
That's the magic of cinema.
And that's what makes cinema so much more exciting today, because you can really let your imagination go wild."
