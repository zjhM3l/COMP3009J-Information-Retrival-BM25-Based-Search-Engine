This enzyme is essential for HIV to incorporate its genetic material into cells.
AZT belongs to a class of antiretroviral (anti-HIV) drugs called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Other agents in this class include ddI (Videx), ddC (HIVID), d4T (Zerit), 3TC (Epivir), and abacavir (Ziagen).
In combination with other drugs, AZT may lower your HIV viral load, increase your CD4 cell ("T-cell") count, reduce your likelihood of developing complications, and prolong life.
Viral load refers to a measurement of HIV in your bloodstream (a lower value is better), and CD4 count is a marker of your immune function (a higher value is better).
What are the reasons my doctor might prescribe AZT? AZT is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV infection.
It is usually prescribed with a second NRTI and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI), which are other classes of anti-HIV drugs.
AZT is also sometimes prescribed with two other NRTIs.
Antiretroviral therapy is generally recommended if: 1.
you have significant symptoms related to HIV infection; 2.
your CD4 cell count is less than 350/mm3; 3.
your viral load is greater than 30,000 (bDNA) or 55,000 (PCR) copies/ml.; or 4.
you acquired HIV infection within the prior six months.
AZT penetrates the brain and spinal cord well, and it has been shown to benefit persons with HIV-related memory problems (encephalopathy).
It is also useful for the treatment of low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) associated with HIV disease.
In addition, when given during pregnancy, AZT significantly reduces the likelihood of spreading HIV infection to the newborn.
How do I take it? AZT is available as a capsule or tablet that is taken by mouth.
It is better absorbed on an empty stomach.
The usual dose is 300 mg twice a day.
AZT is also available in a combination preparation with 3TC (Combivir: 300 mg AZT and 150 mg 3TC), which is taken in the dose of one tablet twice a day.
In addition, it is available in combination with 3TC and abacavir (Trizivir: 300 mg AZT, 150 mg 3TC, 300 mg abacavir), which is taken as one tablet twice a day.
You should discuss with your doctor any issues that may interfere with your ability to take this or other antiretroviral medications as prescribed.
Taking these medications on time, every day, is a very important factor in determining successful therapy.
Frequently missed doses diminish the effectiveness of medications and increase the likelihood that your virus will develop resistance.
What are its side effects? The most common side effect of AZT is nausea.
Others include headache, trouble sleeping, vomiting or diarrhea, muscle soreness, rash, and discoloration of finger and toe nails.
Many of these symptoms are temporary and will go away as your body adjusts to the medication.
AZT may also interfere with the ability of your bone marrow to produce red and white blood cells, although this does not occur as often with the currently prescribed doses.
Your doctor will perform periodic blood counts to screen for these conditions.
If low red blood cell count (anemia) develops, your doctor might recommend reducing the dose of AZT; stop AZT and start another antiviral drug that does not cause anemia; or continue AZT and adding a drug called erythropoietin (EPO) that helps your bone marrow produce more red blood cells.
EPO is given by needle subcutaneously (under the skin) three times a week.
If low white blood cell count (leukopenia) develops, your doctor may reduce the dose of AZT; stop AZT and start another antiviral drug that does not cause leukopenia; or continue AZT and add a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is also given by subcutaneous injection.
Abnormalities of fat and sugar metabolism, and redistribution of body fat have also been described in patients using combination antiretroviral therapy.
If you develop any unusual symptoms while taking AZT, notify your doctor promptly.
What if I am pregnant or nursing? In a research study sponsored by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, pregnant HIV-infected women receiving AZT were much less likely to transmit the virus to their newborns.
Studies are ongoing to determine if there are any long term side effects in children born to mothers who took AZT during pregnancy and delivery.
If you are pregnant and have HIV disease, you should discuss antiretroviral therapy management with your doctor.
In general, breast feeding is not recommended in HIV-infected mothers if other options are available because of the possibility of viral transmission to the newborn.
It is unknown whether AZT prevents this from occurring.
How much does AZT cost? The approximate retail price of AZT is $4,487 a year for the standard dose.
If you have Medicaid or health insurance that covers the cost of medications, your insurance should pay for the drug.
If you are uninsured or cannot afford the co-payments of your plan, you may be able to get financial assistance through a state drug reimbursement program, if available, or from the company that manufactures AZT.

AZT (Retrovir) * WHAT IS AZT? * WHO SHOULD TAKE AZT? * WHAT ABOUT DRUG RESISTANCE? * HOW IS AZT TAKEN? * WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS? * HOW DOES AZT REACT WITH OTHER DRUGS?
WHAT IS AZT? AZT (RetrovirÃ¯Â¿Â½), is a drug used for antiviral therapy.
It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.
AZT is also known as azido-deoxythymidine, zidovudine or ZDV. AZT was the first drug approved for the treatment of HIV.
It is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or nuke.
These drugs block the reverse transcriptase enzyme.
This enzyme changes HIV's genetic material (RNA) into the form of DNA.
This has to occur before HIV's genetic code gets inserted into an infected cell's own genetic codes.
WHO SHOULD TAKE AZT? AZT was approved as an antiviral drug for people with HIV infection.
Most doctors start antiviral therapy when a person has some symptoms of HIV disease, has a T-cell count (CD4+ cells) below 350, or has a viral load (a measure of the amount of virus in the blood) over 30,000.
There are no absolute rules about when to start antiviral drugs.
Some people want to "hit HIV hard and early", starting with the strongest drugs to preserve the immune system.
Others want to save the strongest drugs until they are needed, later in the course of HIV disease.
You and your doctor should consider your T-cell count, your viral load, any symptoms you are having, and your attitude about taking HIV medications.
Because AZT was the first anti-HIV drug approved, it has been studied more than any other drug.
New drugs have been tested by comparing them to AZT.
And because there is more research on AZT than on any other anti-HIV drug, it is prescribed the most often.
"Early treatment" with AZT was tested in people with no symptoms of HIV disease.
The study showed no benefit to taking AZT.
But AZT is used as part of combination therapy for people who are exposed to HIV through a workplace accident (needlestick or splash).
AZT greatly reduces transmission of HIV from the mother to her child.
It is given to HIV-positive pregnant women from the 4th month of pregnancy until their baby is born, and to the newborn baby for 6 weeks.
WHAT ABOUT DRUG RESISTANCE? The HIV virus is sloppy when it makes copies of its genetic code (RNA).
Many new copies of HIV are mutations: they are slightly different from the original.
Some mutations can keep multiplying even when you are taking an antiviral drug.
When this happens, the drug will stop working.
This is called "developing resistance" to the drug.
With combination therapy (taking more than one antiviral drug at the same time), HIV mutates very slowly.
Resistance may not develop for several years, if at all.
HIV that is resistant to AZT can be transmitted from person to person.
Someone infected with AZT-resistant HIV will not benefit from taking the drug.
HOW IS AZT TAKEN? The recommended dose of AZT for adults is 500mg to 600mg daily.
AZT comes in 100mg and 300mg capsules and in liquid form.
AZT is also available in Combivir and Trizivir.
Combivir contains AZT and 3TC.
Trizivir contains AZT, 3TC, and abacavir.
For more information, see Fact Sheet 426 on Combivir or Fact Sheet 427 on Trizivir.
WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS? When you start any anti?viral treatment you may have temporary side effects such as headaches, hypertension, or a general sense of feeling ill.
These side effects usually get better or disappear over time.
The most serious side effects of AZT are anemia, granulocytopenia, and myopathy.
Very few people have these side effects.
Anemia is a shortage of red blood cells caused by damage to bone marrow.
If you get anemia, your doctor might reduce your dose or switch AZT for another antiviral drug.
If the anemia is severe and you have to keep taking AZT, you may need a blood transfusion, or you might take the drug erythropoietin.
Granulocytopenia is a shortage of white blood cells caused by damage to bone marrow.
If it occurs, your doctor should switch from AZT.
It can be treated with a "colony stimulating factor" called G-CSF, which stimulates the production of white blood cells.
But G-CSF is very expensive.
Changing drugs may be a better choice.
Myopathy is muscle pain and weakness.
There is no specific treatment for myopathy.
HOW DOES AZT REACT WITH OTHER DRUGS? AZT is more effective if taken with other antiviral drugs.
AZT should not be combined with d4T (stavudine, ZeritÃ¯Â¿Â½).
AZT's side effects may be worse if taken with several other drugs.
Be sure your doctor knows about all the medications you are taking.
