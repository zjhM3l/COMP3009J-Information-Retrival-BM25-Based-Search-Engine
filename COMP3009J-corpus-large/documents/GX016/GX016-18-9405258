Foreign Trade Zone 27, Boston; Application for Subzone at Lawrence Textile Shrinking Company, Lawrence, Massachusetts
TEXT: Notice is hereby given that an application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Massachusetts Port Authority, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 27 in Boston, for a special-purpose subzone at the textile processing plant of the Lawrence Textile Shrinking Company (Lawrence Textile), Lawrence, Massachusetts, within the Lawrence Customs port of entry.
The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400).
It was formally filed on February 3, 1983.
The applicant is authorized to make this proposal under chapter 771 of the Acts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1971.
There have been preliminary discussions of the proposal with Customs officials and the Commerce Office of Textiles and Apparel.
The subzone would involve Lawrence Textile's 2 1/2 -acre plant located at 516 Broadway, Lawrence, Massachusetts.
The company performs a variety of services for foreign and domestic textile mills and textile product users, primarily for wool and wool blend materials.
Its activities under zone procedures would be limited to the following inspection and processing operations: examination, repair, sponging, "London" shrinking, folding, measuring, tentering, drying, back coating, color evaluation, packaging and labeling.
The processes would involve no changes in Customs classification.
Zone procedures would allow the company's customers to avoid duty payment on material that is either reexported or rejected.
On their domestic sales, the firms would be able to defer duty payment until after inspection and processing.
Because duty rates range from 5 to 38 percent with most of the material subject to a 38 percent duty, savings from zone procedures could be substantial.
These procedures could not be fully utilized at the zone in Boston.
Their availability at the Lawrence plant would help Lawrence Textile compete with offshore operations.
In accordance with the Board's regulations, an Examiners Committee has been appointed to investigate the application and report thereon to the Board.
The committee consists of Dennis Puccinelli (Chairman), Foreign-Trade Zones Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; Edward A. Goggin, Assistant Regional Commissioner (Operations), U.S. Customs Service, Northeast Region, 100 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110; and Colonel Carl B. Sciple, Division Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer Division New England, 424 Trapelo Road, Waltham, Massachusetts 02154.
Comments concerning the proposed zone expansion are invited in writing from interested persons and organizations.
They should be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below and postmarked on or before March 11, 1983.
A copy of the application is available for public inspection at each of the following locations:
Office of the Director, U.S. Dept. of Commerce District Office, 441 Stuart Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02116
Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution, NW., Room 1872, Washington, D.C. 20230
Dated: February 7, 1983.
John J. Da Ponte, Jr.,
Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board.
