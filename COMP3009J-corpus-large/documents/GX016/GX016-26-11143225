FLORIDA CITRUS View Table Data September was a very wet month.
All areas of the citrus belt have received above average rainfall, with some coastal and southern counties recording twice the monthly average.
Tropical Storm Gabrielle crossed Florida the week of September 16-22 and was responsible for high winds on the west coast and lots of rain.
Many of the groves in the wetter areas had standing water for a few days with only little adverse effects to some of the citrus trees.
However, there has been a little fruit splitting on some of the early fruit in the low lands.
The hot, humid and moist conditions have produced a lot of new growth on trees of all ages.
The first crops of the 2001-02 season were picked, packed, and shipped the second week of the month.
A few white and colored grapefruit, Navel and Ambersweet oranges, and Robinson tangerines were shipped by September 16.
Caretakers were very active during the month mowing, chopping, and discing cover crops that were making excellent growth with the help of the tropical weather.
Some growers have been removing dead trees and burning them along with the general grove trash and debris.
