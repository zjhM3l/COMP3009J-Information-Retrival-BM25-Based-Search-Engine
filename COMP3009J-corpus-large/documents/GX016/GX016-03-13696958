Listen to: Peter Boro performing "Solo on mjersnice [misnice] (bagpipes)" on May 7, 1939 [b_audio.gif]
The misnice is a bagpipe-like instrument made out of the skin of a goat.
In Europe, references to the misnice are found as early as the ninth century.
The misnice was found in North Africa and in somewhat different forms in Eastern Europe (Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, and elsewhere).
As you can see from the picture, the musician blows into one pipe while moving his fingers over holes in another pipe.
Listen to the recording of the misnice.
Does it sound different from the Scottish bagpipes we know today? [trans.gif]
