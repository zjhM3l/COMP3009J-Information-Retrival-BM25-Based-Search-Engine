In humans, this disease is called CJD or vCJD (variant Creutzfelt-Jakob Disease).
No evidence of transmitting BSE through vaccination: The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) learned early in 2000 that some vaccines were manufactured with bovine-derived materials obtained from countries where BSE, or a strong risk of BSE, exists.
CBER convened a special joint meeting of the Transmissible Spongiform Encepahalopathy Advisory Committee (TSEAC) and the Vaccines Related Biological Products Committee (VRBPC) on July 27, 2000, to assess the risk of transmitting BSE through vaccines.
The joint committees concluded the risk of transmitting BSE to humans through vaccines is theoretical and remote.
There is no evidence that any vaccine is contaminated with agents that can cause BSE.
The Committees also noted that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any remote risk of vCJD.
However, as a precautionary measure to reduce the remote risk of vCJD from vaccines even further, the FDA has requested that manufacturers replace bovine-derived materials obtained from countries where a risk of BSE exists with materials obtained from countries where a risk of BSE does not exist.
A summary of the meeting can be found on the FDA's web site at http://www.fda.gov/cber/advisory/tse/tsesum072700.htm

Interest in source of vaccine materials: Materials derived from animals, including cows, are often used in the production of vaccines.
Animal-derived products can include amino acids, glycerol, detergents, gelatin, enzymes and serum.
Based on a recent assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Public Health Service (PHS) has no preference for using one licensed vaccine product over another based on the source of bovine-derived materials used in vaccine production.
The PHS recommends that all persons continue to be vaccinated according to the current schedules.
Failure to obtain a recommended immunization with licensed vaccines puts a person at risk for contracting a serious, and potentially deadly, disease.
Interest in the source of vaccine materials has been raised because of concerns related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a rare but fatal neurological disease.
No cases of (vCJD) have been reported in the United States, but as part of the Public Health Services ongoing vaccine safety efforts, the Food and Drug Administration recently examined whether there could be any relationship between vaccines and the vCJD.
Both the FDA and its joint advisory committee concluded that any risk was "remote and theoretical."
As a precautionary measure, the FDA is now requiring that vaccine manufacturers that use material derived from cattle, obtain those materials from countries that are not on the U.S. Department of Agricultures list of countries in which BSE or a substantial risk for BSE exists.

BSE, the disease:
BSE, sometimes known as "mad cow" disease, is a fatal neurological disease of cattle.
It was first identified in 1986.
BSE is thought to be spread through cattle feed containing meat and bone meal from infected cows.
The vast majority of cases of BSE (more that 99% as of 1999) have been reported in the United Kingdom.
BSE has not been detected in the United States.
BSE belongs to a group of neurological diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalophies (TSEs).
TSE diseases in humans are very rare.
However, the human TSE known as variant Creutzfelt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) may be attributed, among other possibilities, to eating beef products from cattle infected with BSE.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare and fatal human neuro-degenerative condition.
There is no evidence to date that vaccines have contributed to the cases of vCJD seen in Europe.
Nor is there evidence that any vaccines harbor the BSE agent.
Further, no cases of vCJD have been reported in the United States.

CJD, the disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal human neurodegenerative condition that occurs worldwide.
It is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) because of characteristic spongy degeneration of the brain and its ability to be transmitted to laboratory animals.
TSEs also affect a range of animal species including sheep, goats, cows, mink, and deer.
