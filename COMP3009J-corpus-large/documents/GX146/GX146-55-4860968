Hearing on "Transit Security: One Year Later."
2:30 p.m., Wednesday, September 18, 2002 - Dirksen 538
Chairman Reed, thank you for calling this second hearing of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation to discuss the important issue of the safety of our transit systems.
As we move forward in fortifying our nation in the aftermath of September 11, I look forward to hearing from Federal Transit Administrator Dorn and the General Accounting Office about the progress we have made in securing our nation's mass transit system and what remains to be done.
Mr. Chairman, since our nation was viciously attacked on September 11th, we have taken a long look at how to make our modes of transportation safe and secure.
Most of our attention has focused on aviation.
But now we must consider the security needs of our mass transit system as well.
One of the many lessons we learned from this tragedy in my home state is how much of a strain a terrorist attack can put on a mass transit network.
I'm proud to say that the state agencies that coordinate transit between New York and New Jersey - New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey - met the challenge of helping to evacuate thousands from lower Manhattan.
We need to make sure that all transit agencies are able to assist in the event of any disaster - natural or otherwise.
We need to do all that we can to ensure that our bus, trains and ferries are as secure as they possibly can be.
I will look hard at the question of how additional funds may be set aside for safety under the reauthorization of TEA-21.
I will also work hard to obtain additional money for New Jersey under the appropriations process.
I was proud that along with Senator Torricelli, I was able to obtain $100 million to the Federal Transit Administration for Transit Improvements, including improvements to the damaged PATH tunnel to the World Trade Center.
Senator Torricelli and I were also able to obtain $100 million for repairs to the aged Amtrak-owned tunnels that go to New York City under the Hudson and East Rivers.
These funds will enable the metropolitan New York region, including northern New Jersey, to better respond in the event of an emergency, whether natural or man-made.
Mr. Chairman, we also to ensure that there are enough mass transit options to support our cities in both during normal times as well as in times that are not normal.
We saw the crush of people that were forced to leave both New York and Washington on foot on September 11th.
In order for mass transit to be truly a safe and secure option, it must also be an option that is readily available.
That's why I am supporting major rail projects for the New York metropolitan area such as building a rail tunnel under the Hudson River from New York into New Jersey.
Only by increasing the availability of mass transit, as well as increasing the safety levels on buses, trains and ferries, can we say that we have a safe and secure transit system.
Thank you again Mr. Chairman and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.
