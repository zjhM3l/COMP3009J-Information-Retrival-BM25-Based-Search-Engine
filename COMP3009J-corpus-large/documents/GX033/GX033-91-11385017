The graphics options use scalable vector graphics technology (SVG) and require the use of an SVG viewer such as the Adobe SVG Viewer 3.0 (or above).
The graphics options are currently available for the following types of data: * Single-year bar graphs for a particular state/jurisdiction; * Multiple-year line chart for a particular state/jurisdiction; * Single-year Cross-State comparisons (comparing one or more states to each other or the nation for a particular variable); * Multiple-year cross-state comparisons (comparing a variable between two or more states across years).
To see either the single-year bar graphs or the multiple-year line chart, click on "Show Graphic" in the right-hand side above the table.

Once you have selected the "Show Graphic" option, you will see a "Graphics Options" box at the top of your screen that will allow you to dynamically generate new graphics based on the following: * Data Type (Average Scale Score or Row Percentage) * Year (if applicable) * Subgroup (if applicable) * Display (color or grayscale).
[Note: you can add/delete years or subgroups by selecting the "User Options" pull-down menu.] screen shot of graphic options
To generate an SVG dynamic map of the United States that compares results of selected states/jurisdictions, you must perform the following steps: 1.
Generate a table of data with desired variables.
2.
Add the states/jurisdictions you are interested in comparing by selecting the "User Options" pull-down menu.
3.
Once your data table has been generated, run a significance test using "Check Differences" within the "User Options" pull-down menu.
4.
Click on the "Show Graphic" option after your significance test results have been computed.
This will give you your SVG map of the United States.
Click on any of the pre-selected states/jurisdictions to make it the "focal" state/jurisdiction.
Printing/Saving the SVG images
You can easily cut and paste any of the SVG images into software packages such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint or Excel.
To do this, right click on the SVG image and select "Copy SVG."
Then go to your desired application and select "Edit/Paste Special" and select "Bitmap."
