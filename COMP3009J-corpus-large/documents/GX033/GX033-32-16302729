President Clinton announced December 31 that the United States is signing the 1998 Rome Treaty on the International Criminal Court, but said he will recommend that President-elect Bush not submit the treaty to the Senate until "fundamental concerns are satisfied."
Following is the text of the president's statement, released at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland:

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT: Signature of the International Criminal Court Treaty
THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary
(Camp David, Maryland)
December 31, 2000
The United States is today signing the 1998 Rome Treaty on the International Criminal Court.
In taking this action, we join more than 130 other countries that have signed by the December 31, 2000 deadline established in the Treaty.
We do so to reaffirm our strong support for international accountability and for bringing to justice perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
We do so as well because we wish to remain engaged in making the ICC an instrument of impartial and effective justice in the years to come.
The United States has a long history of commitment to the principle of accountability, from our involvement in the Nuremberg tribunals that brought Nazi war criminals to justice, to our leadership in the effort to establish the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
Our action today sustains that tradition of moral leadership.
Under the Rome Treaty, the International Criminal Court (ICC) will come into being with the ratification of 60 governments, and will have jurisdiction over the most heinous abuses that result from international conflict, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
The Treaty requires that the ICC not supercede or interfere with functioning national judicial systems; that is, the ICC Prosecutor is authorized to take action against a suspect only if the country of nationality is unwilling or unable to investigate allegations of egregious crimes by their national.
The U.S. delegation to the Rome Conference worked hard to achieve these limitations, which we believe are essential to the international credibility and success of the ICC.
In signing, however, we are not abandoning our concerns about significant flaws in the Treaty.
In particular, we are concerned that when the Court comes into existence, it will not only exercise authority over personnel of states that have ratified the Treaty, but also claim jurisdiction over personnel of states that have not.
With signature, however, we will be in a position to influence the evolution of the Court.
Without signature, we will not.
Signature will enhance our ability to further protect U.S. officials from unfounded charges and to achieve the human rights and accountability objectives of the ICC.
In fact, in negotiations following the Rome Conference, we have worked effectively to develop procedures that limit the likelihood of politicized prosecutions.
For example, U.S. civilian and military negotiators helped to ensure greater precision in the definitions of crimes within the Court's jurisdiction.
But more must be done.
Court jurisdiction over U.S. personnel should come only with U.S. ratification of the Treaty.
The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the Court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction.
Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.
Nonetheless, signature is the right action to take at this point.
I believe that a properly constituted and structured International Criminal Court would make a profound contribution in deterring egregious human rights abuses worldwide, and that signature increases the chances for productive discussions with other governments to advance these goals in the months and years ahead.
