STRATEGIC AGENDA FOR THE NEW YORK STATE RESEARCH LIBRARY AND THE TALKING BOOK 
The New York State Library is comprised of the Research Library, including the Talking Book 
Together all components of the New York State Library serve in a leadership role to assist libraries and New Yorkers in navigating the road to the information highway of the 21^st century.
The Research Library is the principal library for New York State government.
It extends its services to the entire state.
Its collection numbers more than 20 million items.
The collection is particularly strong in law, social and health sciences, legislative matters, technology, education, and history.
It is one of the 125 largest research libraries in North America and the only state library to qualify for membership in the Association of Research Libraries.
Its federal and state government documents and manuscript and rare-book collections are treasures of the State.
The skills, knowledge, and performance of its staff are important to libraries and individuals of all ages throughout New York.
Collection Acquisition and Processing
The Collection Acquisition and Processing Section (CAP) is responsible for the acquisition, accounting, cataloging, serials control and processing of all materials in all formats added to the collection and information resources of the New York State Library.
In addition, the section oversees the NEH grant funded New York State Newspaper Project.
CAP consists of four distinct units: Acquisitions/Gifts, Cataloging, Government Documents, and the New York State Newspaper Project.
The section's primary goals are to purchase materials and information resources requested for collection development, provide bibliographic access to these items, administer the New York State Document Depository Program, and oversee the Federal Depository Library Program in New York State.
Collection Management/Network Services
The Collection Management/Network Services Section (CM/NS) provides public service support to a number of client groups and collection maintenance.
Services include interlibrary loan, talking book and braille materials, photoduplication, microfilming, digital imaging, preservation and binding, automation, telecommunications, a variety of Web-based services and legal information services to State prisoners.
In addition, the section monitors environmental conditions and is actively involved in addressing facility-wide environmental and engineering problems, health, safety and security, and emergency planning.
The Talking Book and Braille Library, which is part of the Research Library's CM/NS Section, serves nearly 40,000 people who have visual, physical, or learning disabilities in the upstate 55 counties.
Public Services
The Public Services Section, including Manuscripts and Special Collections, assists all customers in obtaining access to the collections, information, and services of the New York State Library.
This is accomplished by staffing five service points, answering requests from State government and other customers through many different media, collaborating with other Library work units to identify and make available electronic resources for remote access, and providing outreach/training for customers on State Library collections and services.
Public Services also maintains, retrieves, and circulates (to direct borrowers) the physical collections; selects new materials in accordance with the State Library's Collection Development Policy; and provides processing, cataloging, and user guides for the manuscripts and special collections at the State Library.
Research and Preservation Grants
For a number of years the Research Library has received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities for the New Netherland Project and the New York State Newspaper Project.
The New Netherland Project translates and makes available documents of the Colonial governments of New Netherland and New York from the period 1654-1680.
These documents provide insights and detail regarding the transitions from Dutch to English rule in New York and the early development of American law and culture.
The New York State Newspaper Project identifies, catalogs and microfilms newspaper holdings in the State.
Since the project was established in 1989 nearly 21,000 newspaper titles have been inventoried and more than 2.5 million pages have been microfilmed.
The master microfilms are securely stored so the information will be available for future generations.
DIVISION OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT
The Research Library works collaboratively with the Division of Library Development on statewide projects.
Library Development partners with the State's library systems to bring cost-effective, high-quality library services to the millions of people who use New York's 7,000 libraries.
The Division of Library Development makes recommendations on statewide library policy and administers more than $100 million in state and federal aid for the improvement of library services in New York State.
STRATEGIC PROCESS
In 1998 the Research Library developed its first Strategic Plan and a set of Core Work Values that aligned with the State Education Department's strategic plan.
The first plan was intended to set the direction for the Research Library for three years.
In early 2001 the Research Library, including the Talking Book 
However, there were some key strategies that needed review in the context of the evolving technological environment and the Regents Commission on Library Services recommendations.
Specifically, Regents Commission recommendation ten "provide leadership for change by strengthening the expertise and accountability of the New York State Library and by creating a statewide advocacy coalition" identified an essential step towards achieving the Commission goals.
In the next three years the information environment will continue to become significantly larger and more complex.
The role of the Research Library and TBBL will be to provide leadership and access to information resources with the appropriate technology to meet the information and research needs of its customers.
This will include expanding the New York Online Virtual Electronic Library (NOVEL), implementing its new, more focused Collection Development Policy, providing access to its unique collections and serving State government and the people of the State onsite and through interlibrary loan and talking book and braille services.
The key strategies and objectives to support this role are included in the strategic agenda as: * Excellent services * Focused, timely access * Increased public information about the collections and services * Hiring and developing competent staff * Improving the work environment.
The specific key strategies and objectives, performance measures, timeframe and assigned responsibility of the Strategic Agenda are included in the attached plan.
STAFFING NEEDS
The NYS Library's goals include providing statewide leadership and expertise, communicating and advocating for the New York Online Virtual Electronic Library (NOVEL), and assuring Talking Book 
To meet these current service goals as outlined in the Strategic Agenda the Research Library and the Talking Book 
To achieve its goals, the State Library depends on enhanced and expanded staff development and training programs.
This training needs to include management and supervision, technology, customer services and programs that will assist staff in improving their skills and competence.
Goal five lists the specific strategies and objectives to meet this need.
Collaboration with other Office of Cultural Education program offices, Information Technology Services and the Office of Human Resources Management will support these activities.
Increased technology training support from the State Education Department's Information Technology Services team is needed to provide an array of offerings and diversity of training sites.
There is a continuing need to provide expanded career ladder opportunities for staff.
The Library is addressing this issue in a couple of ways by reviewing every position that becomes vacant and recommending adjustments where possible.
Positions classified as Supply Assistants are being changed to Clerks when they become vacant.
Also, the parenthetics for Senior Librarians are being realigned and in some cases eliminated to increase career opportunities for current staff and enhance the ability to attract staff.
New librarians entering the job market the need for ongoing communication with the Office of Human Resources and with Civil Service on strategies to accomplish these changes is needed.
Some key responsibilities that need to be addressed are advocacy, public relations and outreach efforts including regular news items on events and collections at the State Library, as well as enhanced knowledge of the availability and preservation of electronic information.
Increasingly more of the Library's functions and services involve technology and all staff need to be more knowledgeable about technology and computer applications to be more productive.
