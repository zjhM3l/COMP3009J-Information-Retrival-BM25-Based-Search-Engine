[wwwgspacer.gif] Muslims Reach Out to Non-Muslim Americans During Ramadan Muslims seek to clear up misperceptions about Islam
By David Shelby Washington File staff writer Washington -- The holy month of Ramadan offers Muslim Americans a unique opportunity to share their religion with non-Muslim Americans, according to Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
Speaking as a guest on the November 19 "Global Exchange" television program, Awad said, "I believe that Ramadan is the best opportunity for Muslims to teach others about Islam because everybody wants to know what this month is all about."
CAIR is a Washington based advocacy group that seeks to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America and present an Islamic perspective on issues of importance to the American public.
The group carries its message through newsletters, on its Web site, and in books and media information materials that it distributes to thousands of libraries and press organizations through its network of 25 regional offices, and through mosques and Islamic centers around the country.
Since 1995, CAIR has been preparing press packages regarding Ramadan and distributing them to 25,000 different media outlets.
The packages include articles ready for publication as well as background information on Islam and the meaning of Ramadan.
Awad said that due in part to this program, the number of positive reports on Ramadan in the American press climbed from 314 in 1998 to 1,400 four years later.
He described this as "a clear indicator that there is really a good rapport ... between the Islamic activists and the Islamic community on the one hand, and the local media on the other hand."
He went on to express his belief that "this has had a great impact on communicating a clear, objective and positive image of what Muslims and Ramadan are all about to the American people and helps people to understand that Islam is supportive of Americans and not against them."
Through CAIR's press initiatives, more journalists are covering stories such as the special circumstances of Muslim students fasting in a country where fasting is not the norm, the rising awareness within American companies of the special scheduling needs of Muslim employees during Ramadan, and the daily life of Muslim families during Ramadan.
Awad highlighted the centrality of the mosques and Islamic centers in American Ramadan celebrations.
He explained that Muslim-American families prepare food and bring it to the mosque to share it with other families in the Muslim community at the evening iftar.
He also noted that the Muslim community often invites non-Muslims to participate in the celebrations in order to give them a better understanding of Islam.
Awad also discussed the rising attention that Muslims are receiving in official circles.
He described the recent iftars at the White House and in Congress as "manifestations of the presence of Islam in the United States and an acknowledgement of this religion in this country as well as an acknowledgement of the contributions of Muslims to American civilization."
Responding to questions from Moroccan journalists regarding the situation of Muslims in America since the attacks of September 11, Awad sought to dispel certain misperceptions.
"If the Arab and Islamic world think they are crushing Muslims in the United States, that is not correct," he said.
"There is freedom here in the United States, and we defend against any transgression on this freedom.
Americans practice their religion freely in mosques.
As a Muslim you can pray anywhere and you can criticize the policies of the administration."
He explained, however, that the September 11 attacks generated tremendous misunderstanding in mainstream America about the nature of Islam.
In this context, he said, the actions of Muslims are more important than ever.
"Polishing the image of Islam is the hope and duty of each and every Muslim in the world, and in the United States it is more important and the mission is more difficult," Awad said.
He articulated that "Muslims in the United States and around the world have to prove that they are really compassionate towards others and that they are good to their own people and to the rest of the world through their practices and their behavior because religion is really a practice.
We should be judged through our deeds."
He went on to say that "this is a religion that preaches compassion, brotherhood and showing charity and brotherly love towards our fellow human beings, and we should always strive to do that, and I think the history of Islam is right there to guide us."
Awad said Ramadan helps Muslims to work together to achieve this goal.
He said "There is a feeling of unity, there is a feeling of strength, there is a feeling of solidarity among Muslims in the United States during the month of Ramadan.
We hope that it is always an occasion ... to work together to face the negative atmosphere while being positive in our approach and to teach people and to educate them about what the occasion of Ramadan is."
