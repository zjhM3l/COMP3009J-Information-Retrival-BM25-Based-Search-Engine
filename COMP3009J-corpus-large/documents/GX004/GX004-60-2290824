USTR Announces Tariff-Rate Quota Allocations for Raw Cane Sugar, Refined Sugar, and Sugar-Containing Procucts for 2003/2004
WASHINGTON - The Office of the United States Trade Representative today announced the country-by-country tariff-rate quota allocations of the raw cane sugar, refined sugar, and sugar-containing products for Fiscal Year (FY) 2004.
A tariff-rate quota is an import policy that allows countries to ship specified quantities of a product to the United States at a relatively low tariff, but subjects all other imports of that product to a higher tariff.
The Secretary of Agriculture established the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for raw cane sugar for FY 2004 at 1,117,195 metric tons.
This is the minimum level to which the United States is committed to under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.
The country-by-country allocations are:
Country FY 2004 Allocation in Metric Tons Argentina 45,281 Australia 87,402 Barbados 7,371 Belize 11,583 Bolivia 8,424 Brazil 152,691 Colombia 25,273 Congo 7,258 Cote d'Ivoire 7,258 Costa Rica 15,796 Dominican Republic 185,335 Ecuador 11,583 El Salvador 27,379 Fiji 9,477 Gabon 7,258 Guatemala 50,546 Guyana 12,636 Haiti 7,258 Honduras 10,530 India 8,424 Jamaica 11,583 Madagascar 7,258 Malawi 10,530 Mauritius 12,636 Mexico 7,258 Mozambique 13,690 Nicaragua 22,114 Panama 30,538 Papua New Guinea 7,258 Paraguay 7,258 Peru 43,175 Philippines 142,160 South Africa 24,220 St. Kitts 
These allocations are based on the countries' historical shipments to the United States.
The allocations of the raw cane sugar tariff-rate quota to countries that are net importers of sugar are conditioned on receipt of the appropriate verifications of origin.
This allocation includes the following minimum-quota countries: Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Haiti, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, St. Kitts 
The in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for refined sugar for FY 2004 has been established by the Secretary of Agriculture at 39,000 metric tons, raw value (42,990 short tons).
Of this, the Secretary reserved 18,656 metric tons (20,565 short tons) for specialty sugars.
Of the quantity not reserved for specialty sugar, 10,300 metric tons (11,354 short tons) is allocated to Canada and 2,954 metric tons (3,256 short tons) is allocated to Mexico.
The remaining 7,090 metric tons (7,815 short tons) of the in-quota quantity may be supplied by any country, subject to any other provision of law, on a first-come, first-served basis.
The 18,656 metric tons reserved for specialty sugars may also be supplied by any country, subject to any other provision of law, on a first-come, first-served basis.
With respect to the tariff-rate quota of 64,709 metric tons (71,329 short tons) for certain sugar-containing products maintained under Additional U.S. Note 8 to chapter 17 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 59,250 metric tons (65,312 short tons) is being allocated to Canada.
The remainder of the sugar-containing products tariff-rate quota is available for other countries on a first-come, first-served basis.
Conversion factor: 1 metric ton = 1.10231125 short tons.
