Taxanes have a unique way of preventing the growth of cancer cells: they affect cell structures called microtubules, which play an important role in cell functions.
In normal cell growth, microtubules are formed when a cell starts dividing.
Once the cell stops dividing, the microtubules are broken down or destroyed.
Taxanes stop the microtubules from breaking down; cancer cells become so clogged with microtubules that they cannot grow and divide.
Paclitaxel
In 1984, NCI began clinical trials (research studies with people) that looked at paclitaxel's safety and how well it worked to treat certain cancers.
In 1989, NCI-supported researchers at The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center reported that tumors shrank or disappeared in 30 percent of patients who received paclitaxel for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
Although the responses to paclitaxel were not permanent (they lasted an average of 5 months, some up to 9 months), it was clear that advanced ovarian cancer patients could benefit from this treatment.
In December 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of paclitaxel for ovarian cancer that was resistant to treatment (refractory).
Paclitaxel was later approved as initial treatment for ovarian cancer in combination with cisplatin.
Women with epithelial ovarian cancer are now generally treated with surgery followed by a taxane and a platinum (another type of anticancer drug).
The FDA has also approved paclitaxel for the treatment of breast cancer that recurred within 6 months after adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy that is given after the primary treatment to enhance the effectiveness of the primary treatment), or that spread (metastasized) to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
Paclitaxel is also used for other cancers, including AIDSrelated Kaposis sarcoma and lung cancer.
Side Effects of Paclitaxel
Like most cancer drugs, paclitaxel has side effects that can be serious.
It is important for patients to talk with their doctor about possible side effects.
For example, paclitaxel can cause hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions such as flushing of the face, skin rash, or shortness of breath.
Patients often receive medication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions before they take paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel can also cause temporary damage to the bone marrow.
The bone marrow is the soft, sponge-like tissue in the center of large bones that produces blood cells, which fight infection, carry oxygen, and help prevent bleeding by causing blood clots to form.
Bone marrow damage can cause a person to be more susceptible to infection, anemia (a condition in which the number of red blood cells is below normal), and bruise or bleed easily.
Other side effects may include joint or muscle pain in the arms or legs; diarrhea; nausea and vomiting; numbness, burning, or tingling in the hands or feet; and loss of hair.
Nevertheless, for many patients with cancer, the benefits outweigh the risks associated with this drug.
Paclitaxel Supplies: Old Problems and New Approaches
Paclitaxel is a compound that was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia).
Early research using paclitaxel was limited due to difficulties in obtaining the drug.
The amount of paclitaxel in yew bark is small, and extracting it is a complicated and expensive process.
In addition, bark collection is restricted because the Pacific yew is a limited resource located in forests that are home to the endangered spotted owl.
As demand for paclitaxel grew, NCI, in collaboration with other Government agencies and the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb, worked to increase the availability and find other sources of paclitaxel besides the bark of the Pacific yew tree.
This work led to the production of a semi-synthetic form of paclitaxel derived from the needles and twigs of the Himalayan yew tree (Taxus bacatta), which is a renewable resource.
The FDA approved the semi-synthetic form of paclitaxel in the spring of 1995.
This form of paclitaxel has now replaced the drug derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree.
Docetaxel
Docetaxel, a compound that is similar to paclitaxel, is also used to treat cancer.
Docetaxel, like the semi-synthetic paclitaxel, comes from the needles of the yew tree.
The FDA has approved docetaxel to treat advanced breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.
Side Effects of Docetaxel
The side effects of docetaxel are similar to those related to paclitaxel.
Additionally, docetaxel can cause fluid retention, which is the accumulation of fluid in the body.
This can result in shortness of breath, swelling of hands or feet, or unexplained weight gain.
Before receiving docetaxel, patients are often given medication to prevent fluid retention.
Current Clinical Trials with Taxanes
Researchers continue to look for new and better ways to use taxanes to treat cancer.
They are studying paclitaxel in combination with other anticancer drugs to treat many different types of cancer, including lymphoma and cancers of the head and neck, breast, esophagus, stomach, bladder, prostate, endometrium (uterus), and cervix.
In addition, researchers are studying ways to overcome some cancers resistance to paclitaxel.
Clinical trials are also in progress to test the effectiveness of docetaxel, alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs, for several types of cancer, including cancers of the head and neck, prostate, breast, lung, and endometrium (uterus).
