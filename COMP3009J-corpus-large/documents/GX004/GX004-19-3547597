Boreal toad (Bufo boreas boreas) from Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (federal candidate species; listed as endangered by the state of Colorado; the species has undergone about an 80% decline in southern Rocky Mountains).

New USGS Research Shows How Land Use Affects Amphibians
Northern cricket frog Northern cricket frog.
Photographer: Allen Sheldon.
The cricket frog has disappeared from the northern portions of the Midwest for unknown reasons.

Leopard Frog Northern leopard frog.
Photographer: Mike Lannoo.
Leopard frogs are a common species in the Midwestern U.S., but in certain locations can exhibit deformities.
The exact cause of these deformities in the Midwest is still under investigation

X-Ray Studies Shed Light on Frog Deformities
amelia amelia x-ray Amelia.
No bone has developed beyond the pelvis and the contour over the right hip is smooth.
Displacement of the coccyx gives the appearance of scoliosis (curve to the right) although the vertebrae are properly aligned.
The pelvis is usually abnormal in frogs with amelia.
This frog is missing the right ilium.
polymelia polymelia x-ray Polymelia.
Although the multiple right limb does not appear separated in the live specimen, the entire limb is very wide and bony and there are 12 toes.
This provides good evidence that the bones of the limb are duplicated.
The radiograph shows that there are two femurs, 5 tibia / fibula bones and 5 tibiale / fibulare bones.
phocomelia phocomelia x-ray Phocomelia.
The right limb is very short with no true femur or tibiafibula.
This foot is very abnormal with only four metatarsal bones (ectrodactyly) associated with four terminal phalanges (brachydactyly).
