Cape Farewell Expedition's Arctic Voyage, 26 May - 8 June 2003.
From the Southampton Oceanography Center (U.K.).
"As the North Atlantic spring moves towards the Arctic, the [schnooner] Norderlicht leaves Tromso in Norway, for a voyage through the North East Atlantic to Spitsbergen - the largest island in the Svalbard Archipelago.
The voyage crosses a region of the ocean that plays in important role in the Earth's climate system.
During the voyage the Cape Farewell team will explore this unique region of the Arctic.
Artists, teachers, education policy writers and ocean scientists will record their experiences from the voyage in their different ways.
In this way we hope to make more people aware of this remarkable area, and its importance to the Earth as a whole."

Coastal Cities Turn up the Heat on Rainfall.
According to a new NASA-funded study, "urban heat islands, created from pavement and buildings in big coastal cities like Houston, cause warm air to rise and interact with sea breezes to create heavier and more frequent rainfall in and downwind of the cities.
Analysis of Houston-area rain-gauge data, both prior to and since urbanization, also suggests there have been observed increases in rainfall as more heat islands were created.

NOAA Forecasters Say Six to Nine Hurricanes Could Threaten in 2003.
Top hurricane experts from NOAA today said the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season will likely have above normal levels of activity.
The outlook calls for the potential of 11 to 15 tropical storms, with six to nine hurricanes, and two to four classified as major hurricanes.

Most recent El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Diagnostic Advisory.
Issued monthly by the US Climate Prediction Center/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).
According to the most recent report (19 May 2003): " Warm episode (El NiÃ±o) conditions rapidly dissipated in the tropical Pacific during March and April 2003, as sea-surface temperature anomalies continued to decrease across the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and drier-than-average conditions developed over the central equatorial Pacific...[B]ased on current conditions and recent observed trends, it appears likely that cold episode (La NiÃ±a) conditions will develop in the tropical Pacific during the next few months."

Coastal Cities Turn up the Heat on Rainfall.
According to a new NASA-funded study, "urban heat islands, created from pavement and buildings in big coastal cities like Houston, cause warm air to rise and interact with sea breezes to create heavier and more frequent rainfall in and downwind of the cities.
Analysis of Houston-area rain-gauge data, both prior to and since urbanization, also suggests there have been observed increases in rainfall as more heat islands were created.
