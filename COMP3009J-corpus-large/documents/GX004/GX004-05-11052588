April 30, 2003 LIMITATIONS ON THE DETENTION AUTHORITY OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE INSDetention.htm (HTML) INSDetention.wpd (WPD) Size 122K
The Immigration and Nationality Act by its terms grants the Attorney General a full 90 days to effect an alien's removal after the alien is ordered removed under section 241(a) of the Act, and it imposes no duty on the Attorney General to act as quickly as possible, or with any particular degree of dispatch, within the 90-day period.
This reading of the Act raises no constitutional infirmity.
It is permissible for the Attorney General to take more than the 90-day removal period to remove an alien even when it would be within the Attorney General's power to effect the removal within 90 days.
The Attorney General can take such action, however, only when the delay in removal is related to effectuating the immigration laws and the nation's immigration policies.
Among other things, delays in removal that are attributable to investigating whether and to what extent an alien has terrorist connections satisfy this standard.

Section 235A does not oblige the Attorney General or any other Executive Branch official to enter into diplomatic negotiations with foreign countries in order to obtain their consent to the establishment of preinspection stations on their territory, and it does not require that preinspection stations be established before the preconditions have been satisfied.
Accordingly, section 235A does not unconstitutionally infringes on the President's authority to conduct diplomatic relations.

December 10, 1999 TRIBAL RESTRICTIONS ON SHARING OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE ON USES OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES biodiv14 (HTML) biodiv14 (WPD) Size 55.8K The Indian Civil Rights Act, rather than the federal Constitution, limits the power of an Indian tribe vis-a-vis its members.
In interpreting provisions of the ICRA, it is appropriate to look to precedents under analogous constitutional provisions constraining federal and state action, although particular facts about tribal structure and traditions may be relevant to the analysis.
In some factual circumstances, a tribal ordinance prohibiting members from sharing, with researchers or others outside the tribe, information on possible commercial uses of biological resources would raise concerns under the free speech provision of the ICRA.
The legality of such an ordinance would depend on a number of factorsincluding how widely known the information is; whether those who hold the information have a particular relationship of trust with the tribe; the magnitude of the tribal interest underlying the tribe's effort not to disclose the information; and whether the information can be viewed as tribal property under an intellectual property regime that is otherwise consistent with applicable law.

July 14, 1999 AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO ENTER SETTLEMENTS LIMITING THE FUTURE EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH DISCRETION consent.decrees2 (HTML) consent.decrees2 (WPD) Size 176K Attorney General may enter into settlements that would limit the future exercise of executive branch discretion when that discretion has been conferred upon the executive branch pursuant to statute and there exists no independent statutory limitation on the authority of the executive branch to so limit the future exercise of that discretion.
The Attorney General's power to enter into settlements that would limit the future exercise of discretion that has been conferred upon the executive branch directly by the Constitution is constrained by the very constitutional provisions that vest discretionary authority in the President and therefore necessarily preclude the President from subjecting the exercise of that discretion to the control of the other party to a settlement or to judicial enforcement.
Article III of the Constitution does not preclude the executive branch from entering into judicially enforceable discretion limiting settlements as a general matter or bar federal courts from entering consent decrees that limit executive branch discretion whenever such decrees purport to provide broader relief than a court could have awarded pursuant to an ordinary injunction.
Article III limitations may arise, however, when, for example, the terms of the governmental promise are too amorphous to be susceptible to Article III federal judicial enforcement.
Although there may be sound policy reasons to reaffirm Attorney General Meese's 1986 policy regulating the use of discretion limiting settlements, the concerns that led to its adoption do not, in general, amount to legally binding limitations on the scope of the executive branch's power to settle litigation in a manner that may limit the future exercise of executive branch discretion.

May 11, 1999 WHETHER AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES GOVERNMENT REPRODUCTION OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS IS A NONINFRINGING "FAIR USE" UNDER SECTION 107 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1976 pincusfinal430 (HTML) pincusfinal430 (WPD) Size 150K Although government reproduction of copyrighted material for governmental use would in many contexts be a noninfringing fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, such government reproduction of copyrighted material does not invariably qualify as a "fair use."
An agency that decides to negotiate a photocopying license should seek to limit the scope of the licensing agreement so as not to cover those photocopying practices that the agency, in good faith, concludes are not infringing.
In order to determine whether a particular government photocopying practice is a "fair use," the ultimate question to be answered is whether permitting the government to continue to engage in the practice without paying a licensing fee would stimulate productive thought and public instruction, or yield other societal benefits, without excessively diminishing the incentives for creativity.

Overlapping provisions of the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 and the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998, although redundant and burdensome in some respects if both statutes are given effect, are not inherently conflicting or mutually exclusive, and therefore the provisions of both laws must be treated as valid and effective.

Congress may not, pursuant to the Intellectual Property Clause of the Constitution, create "sweat of the brow" protection for compiled facts, at least insofar as such protection would extend to what the Supreme Court has termed the nonoriginal portion of such a compilation.
Either or both the Intellectual Property Clause and the First Amendment may impose limitations on the exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause that would raise serious constitutional concerns regarding the constitutionality of the bill.

July 22, 1998 WAIVER OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE solmem_612 (HTML) solmem.612 (WPD) Size 68K The Supreme Court's decision in Irwin v.

Irwin and the cases following it therefore provide no support for the novel conclusion that the executive branch has the discretion to dispense with a congressional mandated statute of limitations in litigation or the compromise of claims.
Unless Congress provides to the contrary, adherence to the relevant statute of limitations remains a strict and non-waivable condition on suits against the federal government.
Enactment of legislation authorizing the payment of claims barred by the statute of limitations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is the necessary and constitutionally appropriate means of satisfying such claims.

Because Department of Justice regulations implementing 28 U.S.C.

In circumstances where there is a compelling necessity for grand jury material to be made available to the President in furtherance of his constitutional responsibilities over foreign affairs and national defense and where the President has authorized the provision of such material to the Intelligence Community, we believe that a court should and would authorize such disclosure outside the provisions of Rule 6(ee), on the basis of Article II of the Constitution and separation of powers principles.
Indeed, in such compelling circumstances, a constitutionally necessitated disclosure could properly be made b attorneys for the Government even without prior court approval.

Although 18 U.S.C.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2171(b)(3), which prohibits the appointment as United States Trade Representative of any person who has "represented, aided, or advised a foreign entity" in a trade negotiation or dispute with the United States, is an unconstitutional intrusion on the President's appointment power and thus has no legal effect.

The President submitted a certification that indicated that the executive branch had not provided the House documents as to which it had informed the House that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to provide the documents to the House.
The Act is best interpreted as incorporating an exception for those documents as to which disclosure would not be in the public interest.

The provision intrudes on the Executive's exclusive constitutional powers to interpret and execute treaties and to recognize foreign States.

June 21, 1996 SEVERABILITY AND DURATION OF APPROPRIATIONS RIDER CONCERNING FROZEN POULTRY REGULATIONS chadusda (HTML) chadusda (WPD) Size 72K A provision of the Department of Agriculture appropriations legislation for Fiscal Year 1996, providing that a regulation otherwise rendered inoperative could be put into effect if a revised version of the regulation submitted by the Secretary of Agriculture was received and approved by two committees of Congress, violates the constitutional separation of powers by purporting to provide for the legislative enactment of a regulation without bicameral passage and presentment, as required by Article I of the Constitution.
This unconstitutional provision is severable from the remainder of the section and statute in which it is contained, so that the section's prohibition against the use of appropriated funds to implement the subject regulation, and its provision that the regulation may not take effect absent authorizing legislation, are both constitutionally enforceable.
All provisions of the section, including its prohibition against the regulation taking effect absent future authorizing legislation, are limited in duration to the 1996 Fiscal Year.

Agency contracting officers who act consistently with this opinion, and in derogation of the contrary view of the Comptroller General, would face little or no risk of civil, criminal, or administrative liability.

Granting the President the authority to waive the prohibition if he provides a certification and report to Congress would not remove the funding restriction's constitutional defect, because Congress cannot burden or infringe the President's exercise of a core constitutional power by attaching conditions precedent to the exercise of that power.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS delly (HTML) delly (WPD) Size 287K This memorandum provides an overview of the constitutional issues that periodically arise concerning the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.
Although that relationship is shaped in part by the policy and political concerns of the President and Congress of the day, the political interaction between the President and Congress takes place within an enduring constitutional framework that confers powers and responsibilities on both elected branches.
In this memorandum we discuss the general principles underlying separation of powers analysis, and we address certain specific questions that have arisen in the past.
Any set of examples is necessarily illustrative rather than exhaustive, however, and the Office of Legal Counsel is always available to assist in reviewing legislation or other congressional action for potential separation of powers issues.* May 7, 1996

If he chooses to certify a country under section 490(b)(1)(B), he can withhold funds from the country to encourage compliance with a set of specified conditions.
Alternatively, the President can determine not to certify a country in his annual certification report but inform the country that it might be recertified outside the annual cycle if it meets certain conditions.
The first alternative offers greater flexibility to the President as, under the latter approach, the President is constrained in the exercise of his discretion by specific statutory requirements and his determination is subject to congressional review.

The Secretary of the Treasury has discretion to designate the length of a debt issuance suspension period based on factors, identified by the Secretary, that are reasonably relevant to his determination.
The suspension during a debt limit crisis of CSRDF investment and the redemption of CSRDF investment assets would not cause a violation of the public debt limit.

Where the FDA has already approved a method for detecting the presence of residues of carcinogenic concern, the DES proviso does not require the FDA to revise its regulations to adopt the "best available" such method.
The FDA lacks the discretion to determine that an edible tissue contains "no residue" when a method of detection reveals the presence of residues of carcinogenic concern that is below the "no significant risk" level.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2006(a) prior to the proposed date of issuance and is pursuing good-faith negotiations towards such purchase as of such date, the USPS is not free to proceed with issuance of the bonds to other purchasers solely because Treasury has not completed purchase of the bonds within a 15-day period following USPS' initial notice of the proposed issue.
If, in the above circumstances, Treasury and the USPS are unable to negotiate mutually agreeable terms within a commercially reasonable period of time following USPS' proposed date for the issuance of its bonds, then the USPS may proceed with the issuance of such bonds to other purchasers.
Treasury is not authorized to dictate or control the terms of the USPS offering, but it must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to reach mutually agreeable terms with the USPS when the original terms proposed by the USPS are unacceptable.
That reasonable opportunity is not rigidly limited by the 15-day period for declaring an election to purchase.
October 10, 1995 AUTHORITY TO EMPLOY THE SERVICES OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICE EMPLOYEES DURING AN APPROPRIATIONS LAPSE lapsed.wh.22 (HTML) lapsed.wh.22 (WPD) Size 15K The Antideficiency Act permits the White House Office to employ personnel during an appropriations lapse for functions that are excepted from the Act's general prohibition: functions relating to emergencies involving an imminent threat to the safety of human life or protection of prperty; other functions as to which express statutory authority to incur obligations in advance of appropriations has been granted; those functions for which such authirty arises by necessary implication; and certain functions necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties and powers.
Suche personnel may not be paid, however, until appropriations are enacted.
The President may use his authority under 3 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 105 to create and fill nonsalaried positions in the White House Office during an appropriations lapse, but nonsalaried employees cannot receive an obligation of payment for the services they perform in that capacity.
White House Office employees appointed under 3 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 105 may waive their compensation, and if they do so, their services may be accepted during an appropriations lapse..
September 13, 1995 CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATION IN BINDING ARBITRATION arbitn.fin (HTML) arbitn.fin (WPD) Size 146K The Appointments Clause does not prohibit the federal government from submitting to binding arbitration.
Nor does any other constitutional provision or doctrine impose a general prohibition against the federal government entering into binding arbitration, although the Constitution does impose substantial limits on the authority of the federal government to enter into binding arbitration in specific cases.
September 7, 1995 LEGAL GUIDANCE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PEÃ¯Â¿Â½A adarand (HTML) adarand (WPD) Size 169K This memorandum sets forth preliminary legal guidance on the implications of the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. PeÃ¯Â¿Â½a, which held that "strict scrutiny" is the standard that governs judicial review of the constitutionality of federal affirmative action programs that use racial and ethnic criteria as a basis for decision-making The memorandum is not intended to serve as a definitive statement of what Adarand means for any particular affirmative action program; rather, it is intended to provide a general overview of the Court's decision and the application of the strict scrutiny standard in the context of affirmative action.
June 28, 1995 EFFECTS OF A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON pardon3.19 (HTML) pardon3.19 (WPD) Size 48K A full and unconditional presidential pardon precludes the exercise of the authority to deport a convicted alien under 8 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1251(a)(2)
A full and unconditional presidential pardon removes a state direarm disability arising as a result of a conviction of a federal crime.
A full and unconditional presidential pardon extends to the remission of restitution ordered by a court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 355-1(b)-(c) as a "sanction" authorized in addition to imprisonment, probation, or a fine until such times as the restitution award is paid to the victim.
June 19, 1995 WAIVER OF CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF COOPERATIVE SPACE ACTIVITY opinion.003 (HTML) opinion.003 (WPD) Size 116K Congress has not authorized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to waive subrogated claims on behalf of federal agencies against certain foreign States for damages arising out of cooperative space activity.
An amendment to the Space Act would be necessary to grant NASA the authority to waive subrogated claims on behalf of federal agencies against foreign States for damages arising out of cooperative space activity.
The President may waive claims, including subrogated claims, against foreign governments, in exchange for a reciprocal waiver from the foreign government.
The President may delegate this authority to an agency head.
The weight of authority supports the President's power to waive state claims against a foreign government.

(HTML) usmsdep.sa1 (WPD) Size 47K Appointment of the House Sergeant at Arms as a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal would entail an overlapping of congressional and executive accountability that is incompatible with separation of powers requirements.
Appointment of the House Sergeant at Arms as a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal would impermissibly involve the institution of Congress in executive branch law enforcement.
April 10, 1995 EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 12954, ENTITLED "ENSURING THE ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLETION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS" eostrike (HTML) eostrike (WPD) Size 67K The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act vests the President with authority to issue Executive Order No. 12954 in light of his finding that it will promote economy and efficiency in government procurement.
March 9, 1995 USE OF THE EXCHANGE STABILIZATION FUND TO PROVIDE LOANS AND CREDITS TO MEXICO esf2 (HTML) esf2 (WPD) Size 68K As part of an international financial support package for Mexico, the President and the Treasury Secretary have the authority under section 10(a) of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, as amended, to use the Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide loans and credits to Mexico in the form of (i) short-term currency "swaps" through which Mexico will borrow U.S. dollars in exchange for Mexican pesos for 90 days; (ii) medium-term currency swaps through which Mexico will borrow U.S. Dollars for up to five years; and (iii) guaranties through which the United States will back-up Mexico's obligations on government securities for up to ten years.
March 2, 1995 PERMISSIBILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND USE OF THE FEDERAL PAYROLL ALLOCATION SYSTEM BY EXECUTIVE BRANCH EMPLOYEES FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES pacman3 (HTML) pacman3 (WPD) Size 68K Federal employees who would offer the use of, or administer, the federal salary-allocation system for allotments to political action committees, would not, without more, violate 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 602 and 607, or the civil provisions of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993.
The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 would prohibit certain high-level and Executive Office employees identified in 5 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 7324(b), the duties and responsibilities of whose positions continue outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post, from using the salary-allocation system to make contributions to political action committees.
The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 would not prohibit the remainder of federal employees covered by those Amendments from making contributions to political action committees through the salary-allocation system; however, 5 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 7324(a) would expressly prohibit such employees from taking steps to use the salary-allocation system to make such contributions while they are on duty or in a federal building.
While use of the salary-allocation system for contributions to political action committees would be lawful under certain circumstances, the head of each federal agency has the discretion to decide whether to make the system available for that purpose to employees of the agency.
February 22, 1995 AUTHORITY OF FBI AGENTS, SERVING AS SPECIAL DEPUTY UNITED STATES MARSHALS, TO PURSUE NON-FEDERAL FUGITIVES fistopcc (HTML) fistopcc (WPD) Size 77K Regardless of whether federal process is outstanding or anticipated, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have authority to investigate fugitive felons when there is a reasonable basis to believe that doing so will detect or prevent the commission of a federal crime.
U.S. Marshals, including FBI agents serving as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals, have authority under 28 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 566(e)(1)(B) to investigate and pursue fugitives wanted under state felony warrants whenever such action is undertaken pursuant to a special apprehension program approved by the Attorney General.
Where a U.S. Marshal or Special Deputy U.S. Marshal is engaged in an approved investigation of state law fugitives under section 566(e)(1)(B), the marshal's derivative state sheriff powers under 28 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 564 and the marshal's inherent authority to take enforcement actions necessary to carry out his federal duties provide bases for the marshal to arrest such fugitives.
Neither the doctrine of legislative ratification nor the U.S. Marshals Service's inherent or "federal common law" authority provide independent, non-statutory legal authority for marshals to pursue or arrest fugitives sought for state law violations only.
In circumstances where there is good reason to believe that the pursuit or arrest will prevent the commission of a federal felony, marshals do have limited inherent authority to take the necessary preventive measures.
February 21, 1995 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE NOTICES OF LEVY ON UNDELIVERED COMMERCE DEPARTMENT FISHING QUOTA PERMITS fishtaxop1 (HTML) fishtax.op1 (WPD) Size 62K Internal Revenue Service notices of levy may lawfully be applied to the undelivered quota shares or individual fishing quotas to be issued by the Department of Commerce to taxpayers who have otherwise qualified for them.
January 26, 1995 THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT jtecon.95.8 (HTML) jtecon.95.8 (WPD) Size 84K The lack of any enforcement mechanism in current proposals to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget could result in the transfer of power over fundamental political questions of taxing and spending to the courts.
This would represent a substantial reordering of our basic constitutional structure.
Before resorting to the drastic step of amending the Constitution, Congress should explore other reasonable alternatives, including line item veto legislation.
January 23, 1995 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEYS AND PERSONS ON WHOSE BEHALF THE UNITED STATES BRINGS SUITS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT civrts2mem (HTML) civrts2.mem (WPD) Size 59K When the Department of Justice undertakes a civil action on behalf of a complainant alleging a discriminatory housing practice under the Fair Housing Act, Department attorneys handling the action do not enter into an attorney-client relationship with the complainant, nor do they undertake a fiduciary obligation to the complainant.
Because no attorney-client relationship is established in such undertakings, no retainer agreement between the complainant and the Department attorneys should be entered into.
January 20, 1995 AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AGENCIES UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT cra(HTML) cra (WPD) Size 59K The federal financial supervisory agencies lack authority under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to provide by regulation that financial institutions that do not meet the credit needs of their communities may be subject to administrative enforcement actions under 12 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1818.
December 15, 1994 WHETHER URUGUAY ROUND AGREEMENTS REQUIRED RATIFICATION AS A TREATY gatt (HTML) gatt (WPD) Size 104K The Uruguay Round Agreements concluded under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade did not require ratification by the Senate as a treaty, but could constitutionally be executed by the President and approved and implemented by Act of Congress.
November 22, 1994 CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY OF AN ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS naausa (HTML) naausa (WPD) Size 54K The Department of Justice correctly takes the position that it may not prohibit an Assistant United States Attorney ("AUSA") from testifying before Congress in his or her personal capacity on behalf of the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys.
The Department of Justice rules regulating such testimony are consistent with the First Amendment.
Those rules require that the AUSA make it clear that he or she is not speaking for the Department, avoid using or permitting the use of his or her official title or position in connection with the testimony (except as one of several biographical details), and comply with rules on the protection of confidential information.
November 7, 1994 APPLICATION OF 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 205 TO COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE naausa2 (HTML) naausa2 (WPD) Size 75K The restrictions of 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 205 preclude current federal employees from representing the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys ("NAAUSA") before the Department of Justice regarding compensation, workplace issues, and other issues that focus on the interests of Assistant United States Attorneys ("AUSAs") or another discrete and identifiable class of persons or entities.
Section 205 does not preclude several other kinds of communications between the Department and NAAUSA or similar associations.
The Department is not precluded from dealing with individual AUSAs or groups of AUSAs in their official capacities on matters affecting AUSAs, even if those AUSAs are coincidentally members of NAAUSA.
Nor does section 205 place any restrictions on representatives who are not current federal employees, such as NAAUSA's executive director or former AUSAs no longer employed by the government.
Finally, discussions of broad policy directed towards a large and diverse group of persons would be permissible under the statute.
November 7, 1994 PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO DECLINE TO EXECUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATUTES nonexcut (HTML) nonexcut (WPD) Size 71K This memorandum discusses the President's constitutional authority to decline to execute unconstitutional statutes.
November 2, 1994 THE TWENTY-SECOND DECENNIAL CENSUS census224a (HTML) census224a (WPD) Size 67.4K
Neither the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution nor the Census Act precludes the Bureau of the Census from statistically adjusting "headcounts" in the decennial census for the year 2000 or conducting the non-response follow-up on a sample basis.
The provision in the Census Act prohibiting sampling for purposes of apportionment of the House of Representatives does not preclude reliance upon statistical adjustments that would improve the accuracy of "headcount" data.
October 7, 1994 AVAILABILITY OF MONEY DAMAGES UNDER THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT damages (HTML) damages (WPD) Size 47K Section 3(c) of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which makes available "appropriate relief" in judicial proceedings against federal and state government entities, does not waive or abrogate the sovereign immunity of federal and state governments against the award of money damages.
October 7, 1994 DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES INTO HAITI haiti (HTML) haiti (WPD) Size 61K The President possessed the legal authority to deploy United States Armed Forces into Haiti.
The planned deployment accorded with the sense of Congress, satisfied the requirements of the War Powers Resolution, and was not a "war" with the meaning of the Constitution.
September 27, 1994 CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LEGISLATION EXTENDING THE TERMS OF OFFICE OF UNITED STATES PAROLE COMMISSIONERS paroleco (HTML) paroleco (WPD) Size 60K Legislation extending the term of an officer who serves at will does not violate the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.
Because United States Parole Commissioners may be removed by the President at will, Pub. L. 101-650, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 316, which extends the terms of office of certain Parole Commissioners, does not violate the Appointments Clause.
July 15, 1994 UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES THAT SHOOT DOWN CIVIL AIRCRAFT INVOLVED IN DRUG TRAFFICKING shootdow (HTML) shootdow (WPD) Size 101K The Aircraft Sabotage Act of 1984 applies to the police and military personnel of foreign governments.
In particular, the Act applies to the use of deadly force by such foreign governmental actors against civil aircraft in flight that are suspected of transporting illegal drugs.
There is accordingly a substantial risk that United States Government officers and employees who provide flight tracking information or certain other forms of assistance to the aerial interdiction programs of foreign governments that have destroyed such aircraft, or that have announced an intent to do so, would be aiding and abetting conduct that violated the Act.
July 14, 1994 REVIEW OF 1988 OPINION CONCERNING THE APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT TO INDIVIDUALS INFECTED WITH HIV hiv.fin (HTML) hiv.fin (WPD) Size 61K The 1988 Office of Legal Counsel opinion accurately describes the duties imposed by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to individuals infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
The subsequent passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act did not alter the analysis of cases arising under the Rehabilitation Act, although an amendment to section 504 now requires reference to standards set forth in the ADA.
Application of the standards set forth under section 504 in any particular case requires consideration of current scientific understanding of HIV infection.
Advances in the scientific understanding of HIV infection since 1988 may undermine some of the discussion in the 1988 opinion about the application of these standards to individual cases.
July 8, 1994 APPLICABILITY OF 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 208 TO PROPOSED APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL TO THE BOARD OF CONNIE LEE conniemem220a (HTML) conniemem220a (WPD) Size 24.6K
An executive branch officer or employee appointed to the Board of Directors of Connie Lee would be a "director" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 208(a) and therefore would be disqualified from participating "personnally and substantially" in any "particular matter" implicating the financial interests of Connie Lee unless the conditions of subsection 208(b) are satisfied.
June 22, 1994 PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST UNDER THE BACK PAY ACT FOR REFUNDS OF FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT OVERPAYMENTS backpay (HTML) backpay (WPD) Size 63K The Back Pay Act's authorization of prejudgment interest does not apply to the return of a Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax overpayment.
Even if the Back Pay Act did apply to such returns, an agency's specific exemption from liability under FICA would override the provisions of the Back Pay Act.
May 31, 1994 DEPUTIZATION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS SPECIAL DEPUTY U.S. MARSHALS depmar (HTML) depmar (WPD) Size 45K The deputization of members of Congress as special Deputy U.S. Marshals is inconsistent with separation of powers principles and with the statutory language and historical practice governing special deputation.
May 25, 1994 RECONSIDERATION OF APPLICABILITY OF THE DAVIS-BACON ACT TO THE VETERAN ADMINISTRATION'S LEASE OF MEDICAL FACILITIES davbac (HTML) davbac (WPD) Size 96K Contrary to the view expressed in an earlier Opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, the plain language of the Davis-Bacon Act does not bar its application to a lease contract on the ground that such contracts are per se not contracts for construction.
The applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to any specific lease contract can be determined only by considering the details of the particular contract.
May 23, 1994 AUTHORITY OF DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT TO INITIATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT AGAINST OTHER EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES fha (HTML) fha (WPD) Size 72K Because substantial separation of powers concerns would be raised by construing the Fair Housing Act ("the Act") to authorize the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to initiate enforcement proceedings against other executive branch agencies, the Act cannot be so construed unless it contains an express statement that Congress intended HUD to have such authority.
Because the Act does not contain such an express statement, it does not grant HUD this authority.
There is no basis for construing the Act so that the HUD investigative and administrative process under the Act may be deemed applicable, but the judicial enforcement procedures deemed inapplicable.
May 17, 1994 ELIGIBILITY OF INVOLUNTARY WARTIME RELOCATEES TO JAPAN FOR REDRESS UNDER THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF 1988 14815.mem (HTML) 14815.mem (WPD) Size 58K The proposed Department of Justice change in its interpretation of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to extend redress under the Act to minors who accompanied their parents to Japan during World War II and to adults who are able to show that their relocation to Japan during that period was involuntary is a reasonable and permissible interpretation of the statute.
Although an agency interpretation that has been modified or reversed is likely to receive less deference by a reviewing court than a consistent and contemporaneous interpretation, the fact of modification does not preclude the court from granting deference to the new interpretation.
May 10, 1994 EQUITABLE TRANSFERS OF FORFEITED MONIES OR PROPERTY asset2 (HTML) asset2 (WPD) Size 52K When the federal government makes an equitable transfer of forfeited monies or property to a state or local law enforcement agency, that transfer is more appropriately characterized as a conditional gift to the agency rather than as a formal contract between the federal government and the agency.
If the state or local agency fails to use the transferred property for law enforcement purposes, the federal government may be able to pursue restitution of the property.
April 19, 1994 MARAD RULEMAKING AUTHORITY UNDER CARGO PREFERENCE LAWS cpaop (HTML) cpaop (WPD) Size 90K The U.S. Maritime Administration has the authority to promulgate rules establishing mandatory uniform charter terms for the carriage of cargoes subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954.
April 19, 1994 AUTHORITY OF USDA TO AWARD MONETARY RELIEF FOR DISCRIMINATION usda (HTML) usda (WPD) Size 107K The Department of Agriculture has authority to award monetary relief, attorneys' fees, and costs to a person who has been discriminated against in a program conducted by USDA if a court could award such relief in an action by the aggrieved person.
That question is controlled by whether the anti-discrimination provisions of the applicable civil rights statute apply to federal agencies, and if so, whether the statute waives the sovereign immunity of the United States against imposition of such relief.
The anti-discrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 do not apply to federal agencies.
Some anti-discrimination provisions in each of the other civil rights statutes addressed in the opinion do apply to federal agencies, but only one of the statutes, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, waives sovereign immunity with respect to monetary relief, authorizing imposition of compensatory damages.
The Fair Housing Act and the Rehabilitation Act do not waive immunity against monetary relief.
Attorneys' fees and costs may be awarded pursuant to the waiver of immunity contained in the Equal Access to Justice Act.
April 18, 1994 SIXTH AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT WITH CORPORATE EXECUTIVES garland (HTML) garland (WPD) Size 67K Law enforcement contacts with high-ranking executives of a corporation after criminal charges have been filed against the corporation violate the corporation's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
No Sixth Amendment violation occurs when law enforcement contacts with high-ranking executives occur while civil penalty proceedings are in progress against the corporation.
April 15, 1994 WHETHER MEMBERS OF THE SENTENCING COMMISSION WHO WERE APPOINTED PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF A HOLDOVER STATUTE MAY EXERCISE HOLDOVER RIGHTS PURSUANT TO THE STATUTE sentcomm (HTML) sentcomm (WPD) Size 89K Statutory provisions that allow members of the United States Sentencing Commission to hold over in office after their terms have expired apply to incumbent members who were appointed prior to the enactment of the holdover statute.
Commissioners who were appointed prior to the enactment of the holdover statute may constitutionally exercise such holdover rights without violating the Appointments Clause.
April 5, 1994 APPLICATION OF THE BRADY ACT'S CRIMINAL PENALTIES TO STATE OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS brady (WPD) Size 53K The criminal penalties contained in the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act do not apply to state or local law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties under the Brady Act.
Accordingly, the United States lacks the authority to prosecute state or local officials for violations of the Brady Act.
March 16, 1994 OCC MORTGAGE LENDING TESTING PROGRAM occ (HTML) occ (WPD) Size 71K Individuals who serve as "testers" in a proposed Office of the Comptroller of the Currency program designed to identify discriminatory lending practices by national banks would not violate any federal criminal laws if, as part of the program, they provide false information to targeted banks.

February 2, 1994 RECONSIDERATION OF PRIOR OPINION CONCERNING LAND-GRANT COLLEGES reconsid (HTML) reconsid (WPD) Size 124K After reconsideration of a prior opinion, we adhere to the conclusion that the State of West Virginia may validly designate West Virginia State College as the beneficiary of appropriated funds under the Second Morrill Act of 1890.
Reversing a prior conclusion, we find that the State's designation of the College as a Second Morrill Act beneficiary does not make that institution eligible for funds appropriated under certain statutes administered by the Department of Agriculture.
December 23, 1993 ADMISSIBILITY OF ALIEN AMNESTY APPLICATION INFORMATION IN PROSECUTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES PROSECUTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES ircaop (HTML) ircaop (WPD) Size 69K The confidentiality provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 generally bar federal prosecutors from introducing information from alien amnesty applications as evidence in criminal prosecutions of third parties, but the use of such information is not barred in prosecutions of third parties for crimes that facilitate, or are closely related to, the filing of a false amnesty application.
Justice Department use of amnesty application information is also subject to regulations issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Those regulations limit such use against third parties to the prosecution of persons who have "created or supplied a false writing or document for use" in an amnesty application.
December 22, 1993 CLARIFICATION OF PRIOR OPINION REGARDING BORROWING BY BANK EXAMINERS bankex (HTML) bankex (WPD) Size 51K 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 213, which prohibits federal bank examiners from borrowing from Federal Reserve member banks or other entities subject to examination by them, does not prohibit such examiners from receiving loans or credit from affiliates of covered banks merely because such affiliates are under "common control" with the bank or because the covered bank and the affiliate have a common majority of corporate officers or directors.
An examiner would be prohibited from borrowing from such an affiliated entity, where the affiliate is serving as a conduit or "front" for the implementation of a loan that is actually extended due to the direction, instigation, or influence of the affiliated member bank or person connected therewith.
December 20, 1993 AUTHORITY TO PAY STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ON PROPERTY AFTER ENTRY OF AN ORDER OF FORFEITURE asset3 (HTML) asset3 (WPD) Size 70K The Attorney General has discretionary authority to make payments of state and local tax claims against civilly forfeited property after a forfeiture order has issued, based on her equitable discretion to administer civilly forfeited property, under 21 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 881(b)-(e) and 28 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 524(c)(1).
The Attorney General has discretion to pay state and local tax claims against criminally forfeited property, under the authority in those statutes to "take any other action to protect the rights of innocent persons which is in the interests of justice."

November 10, 1993 THE LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS signing (HTML) signing (WPD) Size 73K Many Presidents have used signing statements to make substantive legal, constitutional, or administrative pronouncements on the bill being signed.
Although the recent practice of issuing signing statements to create "legislative history" remains controversial, the other uses of Presidential signing statements generally serve legitimate and defensible purposes.
November 3, 1993 CONSTITUTIONALITY OF HEALTH CARE REFORM 1stlady (HTML) 1stlady (WPD) Size 64K The proposed Health Security Act is well within the authority of the Congress under the Commerce Clause, and it does not violate Tenth Amendment or other principles of federalism.
The proposal contains no unconstitutional takings of private property or infringement of liberty interests.
The proposed delegation of administrative authority to the National Health Board, and, from it, to state alliances, is not an impermissible delegation of legislative authority.
October 29, 1993 APPLICABILITY OF THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE TO NON-GOVERNMENT MEMBERS OF ACUS acus (HTML) acus (WPD) Size 75K Non-government members of the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) are prohibited by the Emoluments Clause from accepting, absent Congress's consent, a distribution from their partnerships that includes some proportionate share of the revenues generated from the partnership's foreign government clients.
Non-government members of ACUS are also generally forbidden, absent Congress's consent, from accepting payments from commercial entities owned or controlled by foreign governments.
October 28, 1993 LIABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ON SEIZED AND FORFEITED PROPERTY asset4 (HTML) asset4 (WPD) Size 50K In civil forfeiture proceedings (under 21 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 881), the United States is obligated to pay liens for state and local taxes accruing after the commission of the offense leading to forfeiture and before the entry of a judicial order of forfeiture, if the lien-holder establishes, before the court enters the order of forfeiture, that it is an innocent owner of the interest it asserts.
