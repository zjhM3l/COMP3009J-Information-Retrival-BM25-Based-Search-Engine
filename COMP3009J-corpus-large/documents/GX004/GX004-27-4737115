In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War.
Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917 and popularly elected governors have served since 1948.
In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self-government.
In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998 voters chose to retain commonwealth status.
