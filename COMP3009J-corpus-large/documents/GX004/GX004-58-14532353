December 21, 2000 (30 CFR Part 948) 65 FR 80308 West Virginia Regulatory Program ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment.
OSM is announcing its approval, with certain exceptions, of an amendment to the West Virginia regulatory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The program amendment consists of changes to the West Virginia regulations (38 CSR 2) contained in House Bill 4223 concerning Homestead postmining land use.
The amendment is intended to comply with the Consent Decree that was agreed to by the plaintiffs and the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on February 17, 2000, in the matter of Bragg v.

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), are publishing final rules to amend application and permit information requirements and to redesign permit eligibility criteria under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), as amended.
In this final rule, we are also amending related provisions in our regulations to incorporate changes for internal consistency.
This rule fulfills our April 21, 1997, commitment to undertake new rulemaking, including public notice and comment, on ownership and control and related regulatory issues in the wake of the January 31, 1997, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
This final rule also reflects the findings in another decision of the United States Court of Appeals.
On May 28, 1999, the appeals court issued a ruling shortly after the initial close of the comment period for the proposed rule upon which this final rulemaking is based.
We later found it advisable to reopen and extend the comment period in order to seek public comment on the effects of the May 1999 decision.
As a result, we modified the provisions in this final rule in order to be consistent with the 1999 decision.
Thus, this final rule is fully consistent with both court decisions.

September 6, 2000 (30 CFR Part 917) 65 FR 53909 Kentucky Regulatory Program ACTION: Final rule.
OSM is announcing its final action to preempt and supersede portions of Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) 350.060(16).
The 1998 Kentucky General Assembly enacted this provision, which pertains to the renewal of expired permits, into law by passing House Bill 593.
It proposed that if a permit has expired or a permit renewal application has not been timely filed and the operator or permittee wants to continue the surface coal mining operation, Kentucky will issue a notice of noncompliance (NOV).
The NOV will be considered complied with, and the permit may be renewed, if Kentucky receives a permit renewal application within 30 days of the receipt of the NOV.
Upon submittal of a permit renewal application, the operator or permittee will be deemed to have timely filed the application and can continue, under the terms of the expired permit, the mining operation, pending issuance of the permit renewal.
Failure to comply with the remedial measures of the NOV will result in the cessation of the operation.
Portions of this provision would allow a permittee to continue mining on an expired permit after the permit renewal application has been filed within 30 days of the receipt of the NOV, regardless of whether the application is timely filed, and even if the application is filed after permit expiration.
OSM is taking this action because the provisions are inconsistent with the requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
This determination is based on reasons cited in the "Director's Findings" section in a separate notice published on May 10, 2000 (65 FR 29949), announcing disapproval of the statutory provision.

June 26, 2000 (30 CFR Part 917) 65 FR 39319 Kentucky Regulatory Program ACTION: Proposed rule; public comment period.
OSM is announcing a proposed action to preempt and supersede portions of Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) 350.060(16).
The 1998 Kentucky General Assembly enacted this provision, which pertains to the renewal of expired permits, into law by passing House Bill 593.
It proposed that if a permit has expired or a permit renewal application [*39320] has not been timely filed and the operator or permittee wants to continue the surface coal mining operation, Kentucky will issue a notice of noncompliance (NOV).
The NOV will be considered complied with, and the permit may be renewed, if Kentucky receives a permit renewal application within 30 days of the receipt of the NOV.
Upon submittal of a permit renewal application, the operator or permittee will be deemed to have timely filed the application and can continue, under the terms of the expired permit, the mining operation, pending issuance of the permit renewal.
Failure to comply with the remedial measures of the NOV will result in the cessation of the operation.
Portions of this provision would allow a permittee to continue mining on an expired permit after the permit renewal application has been filed within 30 days of the receipt of the NOV, regardless of whether the application is timely filed, and even if the application is filed after permit expiration.
OSM is taking this action because the provisions are inconsistent with the requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
This determination is based on reasons cited in the "Director's Findings" section in a separate notice published on May 10, 2000 (65 FR 29949), announcing disapproval of the statutory provision.

On December 21, 1998 (63 FR 70580), we, the Office of Surface Mining (OSM), proposed a rule to amend our permanent program regulations for surface coal mining operations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201, et seq., as amended (SMCRA or the Act).
We are reopening the comment period for the proposed rule in light of a judicial decision in a case decided after the close of the comment period.
The comment period was originally scheduled to close on February 19, 1999, but was subsequently extended to March 25, 1999 (64 FR 8763; Feb. 23, 1999), then to April 15, 1999 (64 FR 15322; March 31, 1999), and ultimately to May 10, 1999 (64 FR 23811; May 4, 1999).
Shortly thereafter, on May 28, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed down a decision in National Mining Ass'n v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 177 F.3d 1 (D.C.
Cir. 1999) (NMA v. DOI II).
Because we incorporated certain provisions and concepts into our December 21, 1998 proposed rule, which were later invalidated by the court, we feel it advisable to obtain input from the public on the effects of the appeals court's decision on our proposed rule.
By this notice, we are reopening and extending the comment period for an additional 30 days to seek comments on the effects of the court decision on our proposed rule so that we can ensure that our final rule is consistent with the NMA v. DOI II decision.
