What is the 5-year driver license?
A 5-year driver license is a license that will remain valid for five years and must be renewed every fifth year.
Since 1981 and until June 30, 2000 the driver license was valid for four years.
__________________________________________________________________
What else does the 5-year license do?
In April 1999, the legislature passed House Bill 2259.
Effective July 1, 2000, this bill: Increased the license period from 4 years to 5 years and raised the following fees: * Original driver license from $14 to $25.
* Renewal driver license from $14 to $25 (from $3.50 to $5.00 per year).
Original motorcycle endorsement from $6 to $10.
* Original motorcycle endorsement from $6 to $10.
* Renewal motorcycle endorsement from $14 to $25 (from $3.50 to $5.00 per year).
* Original commercial driver license from $12 to $20.
* Renewal commercial driver license from $12 to $20 (from $3.00 to $4.00 per year).
__________________________________________________________________
Why the fee increase for a 5-year driver license?
This is the first driver license fee increase in Washington State in more than 25 years.
The Legislature raised the fee for a Washington driver license from $3.50 a year to $5 a year (or from $14 for a four-year license to $25 for a five-year license).
The fee increase is required to finance major Department of Licensing (DOL) enhancements to the driver licensing process, facilities, and the driver license document, including a new digitized driver license, new computer testing and customer management systems, and upgraded counters to help improve services.
The main purpose of the extended license period is to reduce customer wait times at our Licensing Services Offices (LSO).
The shift from four to five-year expirations will result in a 20 percent reduction in renewal customers per year.
__________________________________________________________________
Is the fee increase subject to I-695 voting requirements?
No, because the increase became law in 1999 prior to the passage of I-695.
__________________________________________________________________
Will everyone receive a 5-year driver license?
Yes ... eventually.
The majority of the driving public will receive a 5-year driver license as soon as their current license expires.
However, about 14,200 drivers each month will receive extensions (twenty percent of the 71,000 that are due to renew).
Drivers that receive an extension will wait until 2004 or 2005 to get their 5-year license issued.
__________________________________________________________________
I've heard there is a mail-in extension - is it part of the 5-year license?
Yes.
In order to stagger expiration dates evenly across the next five years not everyone will get a 5-year driver license right away.
Each month, twenty percent of driver license holders due to renew will receive a mail-in driver license extension letter.
Extensions will be issued for terms that are of 1 to 4 years, depending on when it is issued.
The extension process will begin July 1, 2000, and continue through June 2004.
__________________________________________________________________
What is an extension?
An extension simply adds on another period of time to the life of the driver license.
It means that someone selected for an extension to his or her driver license will not have to visit an LSO for renewal until a later date.
In the first year of transition to a 5-year license, the extensions will be valid for four years.
In the second year, the extensions will be valid for three years; in the third, for two years; and in the final year of the transition, a one-year extension will be issued.
All extensions will expire on the driver's birthday between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005.
__________________________________________________________________
What if I don't want the extension? Can I renew my license by mail?
No, renewal by mail is not an option in Washington.
If you prefer not to obtain the extension, you may renew in person at a LSO and you will be issued a 5-year license.
__________________________________________________________________
Can I volunteer to extend my license by mail?
No, DOL cannot accept voluntary extensions by mail without losing control over how many drivers extend and when the drivers move to the 5-year license expiration.
It would be very hard to achieve an even distribution of all our customers over the 5-year expiration cycle without actively managing this transition.
__________________________________________________________________
Why give extensions rather than just issuing a 5-year license?
The extensions are necessary to spread the number of driver license renewals over five years.
It allows DOL to stagger expiration dates of the driver licenses more evenly.
Twenty percent of renewal customers will have their renewal cycle shifted from each of the first four years of implementation to the fifth year.
When the implementation is complete, renewal customer workloads in each LSO will be at 80 percent of the current level.
Extending a percentage of clients each month to spread the customer volume over all five years immediately gives customers and LSO staff the benefit of less-crowded offices.
__________________________________________________________________
Will people who get an extension pay $25 regardless of extension length?
No.
Only people who receive a 5-year driver license will pay the $25 fee.
When applicable, motorcycle endorsement renewal fees of $5 to $20 will be added.
The license extension fees are now calculated at $5 per year, therefore drivers who receive a: * four-year extension will pay $20 (driver license expiration date between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001) * three-year extension will pay $15 (driver license expiration date between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002) * two-year extension will pay $10 (driver license expiration date between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2003) * One-year extension will pay $5 (driver license expiration date between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2004) * When applicable, motorcycle endorsement renewal fees of $5 to $20 will be added
__________________________________________________________________
Is everyone eligible for an extension?
No.
The people getting extensions are randomly selected from among all the eligible drivers due to renew their driver license during a particular month.
Only drivers age 22 to 65 will be eligible for a license extension.
Drivers younger and older than this group will be required to renew in person.
Other drivers not eligible for an extension will include those: * With a monitored medical and/or vision cycle.
* With a probationary license, suspended license, or a pending reissue fee.
* Renewing a commercial driver license.
__________________________________________________________________
Why did DOL exclude those younger than 22 and older than 65?
Public safety is the paramount responsibility of DOL.
Statistically both young and senior drivers are involved in more accidents.
In addition, data shows that about 83% of all drivers cited for reexamination are age 65 or older.
Requiring drivers age 66 and older to renew in person will ensure that their visual acuity and fitness to drive are appropriately evaluated by qualified licensing staff.
__________________________________________________________________
What is the process for the mail-in extension?
If you've been selected for a driver license extension, you will receive a letter about 4 to 6 weeks before your renewal date.
The letter contains instructions to guide you through the process.
You will be asked to update your address and send in a check for the amount due.
The check must be made payable to the Department of Licensing.
The form and payment are mailed to Olympia in the postage-paid envelope provided for this purpose.
In return, you will receive a sticker to place on the back of your license.
The sticker indicates that the driver license has been extended until your birthday in the year shown on the sticker.
__________________________________________________________________
Can I pay for my extension at a licensing services office?
No, in order to avoid possible errors in handling the extension application and fee, and delays in delivering the license extension, LSO staff cannot accept the extension form or payment.
You must mail the form or renew in person at the LSO. __________________________________________________________________
What happens if I never receive my sticker after paying for it?
If you do not receive the sticker that you paid for, you should call DOL Customer Service at (360) 902-3900 and they will see that a replacement sticker is sent to you.
__________________________________________________________________
What happens if I lose my sticker or it gets ruined?
You will go to a LSO to be issued a replacement license for a fee of $15.00.
A replacement sticker will not be issued when a sticker has been lost or ruined.
__________________________________________________________________
I lost the extension application that came in the mail.
Can I still apply for an extension?
No, you will need to renew your license at a driver licensing office.
The application you received is required to extend your license.
Also, because these applications are produced in batches of 8-12,000 at a time, a second application cannot be sent.
__________________________________________________________________
Can I get a driver license extension sticker over the Internet?
No, driver license extension is not available over the Internet.
Unless a driver is mailed an extension application they must renew at a driver licensing office.
__________________________________________________________________
Will a new driver license be issued with the extension?
No.
You will be mailed a sticker to place on your current driver license that will indicate your license is valid for the extension period.
__________________________________________________________________
Will someone be able to tell that my driver license has been extended?
Yes.
The extension sticker will be attached to the back of the license.
It will clearly show when the extended license is due to expire.
__________________________________________________________________
Is the sticker going to be accepted as valid identification and will it last the length of the extension?
Yes.
The department has worked with law enforcement, the business and banking communities, and other stakeholders to inform them of the sticker and its validity.
The sticker is durable and made of material designed to last the entire period.
__________________________________________________________________
How did DOL arrive at the extension process?
DOL's goal was to evenly distribute the current 4-year renewal customer volume across the new 5-year term.
It evaluated the processes and experiences of other states to determine how to accomplish that goal.
The use of license extensions was the most common process in use by the other states.
It also has the immediate benefit of reducing the number of customers in each LSO, and means one less trip to DOL for over 700,000 drivers.
__________________________________________________________________
Have other states used extensions? Yes.
Extension processes have been successful in other states and their experience with them has been quite good.
Many states also use a similar process to renew licenses by mail.
__________________________________________________________________
Should I be worried about fraud stickers?
No, but caution is always wise when accepting a license for identification purposes.
Based on the experience of other states, the vast majority of drivers selected for an extension use it properly.
As a deterrent to fraud, DOL has designed the stickers in a manner that is not easily reproduced and assigned each extension a unique number.
The driver record will be updated to show the extension number that was issued.
Law enforcement will be checking for the presence of the sticker on the driver license.
__________________________________________________________________
Are you making sure that the person sending in the payment for the sticker is the person it says it is?
Yes, but by mail there will only be a few ways to help confirm that the person who pays is the eligible driver.
One will be that the letter is received.
A second will be the personal check submitted will often be preprinted with the same name and address of the driver.
The third will be obtaining the driver signature on the application form returned to DOL.
This signature can be compared with existing records when necessary.
__________________________________________________________________
Can I contact DOL with questions about my 5-year license, my extension or the extension project?
Yes.
You can get information about the 5-year license expiration, driver license extensions and stickers and about the project: * By email to Driver Responsibility * By calling Customer Service at (360) 902-3900 __________________________________________________________________
If you have sent in your payment for an extension sticker but haven't received it, you may want to consider doing the following before your license expires: Call your licensing services office * Staff will check your record to see if the extension has been recorded or not.
* If an extension has been recorded they will tell you the day of the update and let you know that your extension has been mailed.
* If it hasn't been recorded, staff will ask if you can wait 2-3 days before your license expires and then if the sticker still hasn't come you should go into an LSO.
We apologize for any inconvenience that you may experience because of a delay.
Please be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this problem, and to handle your payments and deliver your extension sticker to you as quickly as possible.
Thank you.
__________________________________________________________________
When you go into your licensing services office * Staff will check your record to see if the extension has been recorded or not.
* If an extension has been recorded they will tell you the day it was mailed.
And, if your license has expired you will be issued a new license at no charge and should destroy (shred or cut-up) the extension sticker when it arrives.
* If it hasn't been done and your license is still valid, staff will ask if you want to wait for it to come in the mail, or if you prefer to get a license renewal immediately.
