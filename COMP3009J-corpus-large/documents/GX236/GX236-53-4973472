Appendix C Unfounded Allegations of Criminal and Professional Misconduct and Spurious Claims of Privilege Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 95 I. Introduction [i] T his Office faced numerous challenges to its professional integrity and the lawful exercise of its authority, ranging from unsubstantiated allegations of criminal and professional misconduct to unsupported claims that the Office and its duly empaneled grand jury were not legally entitled to evidence in the possession of witnesses, many of whom were White House employees.
Responding to all of these claims in court and in public affected the Office's ability to fulfill its mandate in a timely and cost-effective manner.
In the end, no attorney or other employee of this Office was ever found to have engaged in any form of criminal or professional misconduct, and the courts determined in every case that privileges asserted by President Clinton, the Office of the President, and others did not form a legal basis to withhold evidence from this Office and the grand jury.
This appendix chronicles the claims made in connection with the Lewinsky investigation, as well as additional claims that, although related to other matters, arose during the last months of the Lewinsky investigation.
Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 97 II.
No Person in this Office Was Found to Have Violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).
O n February 6, 1998, two weeks after the public disclosure of this Office's investigation relating to Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton's private counsel, David Kendall, issued a public statement alleging "a deluge of illegal leaks from that office of false and misleading information."1 Stating that he intended to seek judicial relief from the leaks under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), Kendall continued: The leaking of the past few weeks is intolerably unfair.
It violates not only the criminal rules, rules of court, rules of ethics and Department of Justice guidelines, it also violates the fundamental rules of fairness in an investigation like this.
We've seen leak after leak, which ultimately and in the fullness of time turns out to be false information.
These leaks make a mockery of the traditional rules of grand jury secrecy.
They often appear to be a cynical attempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses, to deceive the public and to smear people involved in the investigation.2 On October 30, 1998, slightly more than a month after this Office submitted its Referral to Congress pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 595(c), Chief Judge Johnson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia disclosed that she had named a special master to determine whether the Office of the Independent Counsel had illegally leaked secret grand jury information to the media in violation of Rule 6(e).3 Notwithstanding the intensity of the charges in February 1998, in March 2001, three years later, and two months after President Clinton left office, the former President, the Office of the President (prior to January 20, 2001), Bruce Lindsey, and Sidney Blumenthal agreed to a joint stipulation with this Office to the dismissal of all sealed proceedings involving alleged violations of Rule 6(e).4 [ii] [iii]

1 Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 99 On March 23, 2001, Chief Judge Johnson filed an order accepting the joint stipulation and dismissing the remaining matters without any finding of a violation of Rule 6(e).5 The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") also rejected Mr. Kendall's allegations that an article appearing in the January 31, 1999 New York Times, while the Senate impeachment trial was pending, included material disclosed by individuals in this Office in violation of Rule 6(e).6 The D.C. Circuit concluded that the material disclosed in the article was not covered by the rule because it did not constitute matters "occurring before the grand jur y." 7 This ruling came more than eight months after Mr. Kendall's charges and only after this Office appealed the district court's decision and obtained a summary reversal to prevent the district court from conducting a proceeding against this Office or any of its personnel on the basis of those charges.8 Order, In re: Grand Jury Proceedings, Misc.

14 102 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
All Complaints to the Department of Justice of Professional Misconduct Were Rejected.
T he Department of Justice also received numerous complaints about the conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and his staff.16 These complaints were referred to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR"), which investigates complaints concerning the conduct of Department attorneys in the exercise of their official responsibilities.
The Attorney General undertook a review of these allegations pursuant to her authority to remove an independent counsel for cause.17 None of these complaints resulted in a finding of professional misconduct by any person in the Office of the Independent Counsel.18 On November 15, 1998, shortly before Independent Counsel Starr was scheduled to testify on the referral under 28 U.S.C. 595(c) before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Janet Reno informed him that OPR had recommended further inquiry about complaints of professional misconduct.
At the request of the Attorney General, OPR ultimately identified nine allegations that appeared to OPR to require further analysis.19 In May 1999, the Office of the Independent Counsel provided OPR with a detailed submission addressing these allegations,20 which OPR reviewed in conjunction with other materials.21 [vi]

21 See Mem. for the Attorney General from H. Marshall Jarrett, Counsel, Office of Professional Responsibility, stating recommendations regarding disposition of allegations against Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr at 1 (Oct. 15, 1999) [hereinafter "Jarrett Mem."].
Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 103 [vii] On October 15, 1999, the Attorney General, acting on OPR's recommendation, concluded that no further inquiry was necessary regarding eight of the nine allegations.22 Four of these allegations were deemed unlikely to develop evidence warranting the removal of the Independent Counsel from office, and three allegations lacked a factual basis.23 One allegation included a primary and two subsidiary charges.
The primary charge was rejected on the ground that the issue had been properly resolved through litigation before a federal district court judge in the course of pretrial motions.24 The two subsidiary charges were referred back to the Independent Counsel for his consideration and action.25 In sum, OPR recommended further inquiry into only one of the nine allegations, which related to the Office of the Independent Counsel's first contact with Monica Lewinsky.26 A. Four Allegations Were Rejected on the Ground That, Even if Substantiated, They Would Not Have Warranted the Removal of Independent Counsel Starr.
With respect to four allegations, the Attorney General accepted OPR's conclusion that a full investigation would not develop evidence of misconduct warranting the removal of Independent Counsel Starr from office pursuant to the Attorney General's authority under Title 28, United States Code, Section 596(a).
Those allegations were: (1) whether communications between Linda Tripp, or persons acting on her behalf, and Independent Counsel Starr's law partner, Richard Porter, were consistent with the client representation restrictions governing Independent Counsels, their staffs, and attorneys associated with them, as codified at 28 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 594(j), and with other applicable provisions governing conflicts of interest;27 (2) whether the Office of the Independent Counsel made material misrepresentations to the Attorney General, and to other Department attorneys, in connection with its request for jurisdiction over the Lewinsky matter;28 (3) whether Independent Counsel Starr's prior contacts with people working on the Jones v. Clinton civil case gave rise to a conflict of interest in the request for and acceptance of jurisdiction to investigate the Lewinsky matter, including whether the Department of Justice was provided appropriate information about those prior contacts at the time of the request for jurisdiction;29 and (4) whether the Office of the Independent Counsel made improper statements about Presidential advisor Sidney Blumenthal.30 [viii] 22 See Letter from Janet Reno, Attorney General, to Kenneth W.

104 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
With respect to three other allegations, the Attorney General accepted OPR's conclusion that none was supported by any factual basis.31 Those allegations were whether (1) the Office of the Independent Counsel improperly influenced the conduct of Linda Tripp prior to January 12, 1998 in order to create a basis for obtaining jurisdiction over the Lewinsky matter;32 (2) the Office of the Independent Counsel misled the D.C. Circuit on June 29, 1998 regarding the likelihood of impeachment proceedings;33 and (3) the Office of the Independent Counsel conducted investigative activities without any jurisdictional basis, including whether it was proper to offer Linda Tripp immunity from prosecution and surreptitiously record conversations involving Linda Tripp before receiving jurisdiction over the Lewinsky matter.34 [ix] C.
One Complaint, Which Included Two Subsidiary Complaints, Regarding the Steele Investigation Were Rejected.
With respect to one complaint--that the Office of the Independent Counsel lacked jurisdiction to investigate Julie Hiatt Steele--the Attorney General also accepted OPR's recommendation to reject the allegations.35 OPR reviewed the record of pretrial motions in the Steele case and concluded that the trial judge had properly disposed of those allegations.36 Pursuant to OPR's recommendation, the Attorney General referred to the Independent Counsel two subsidiar y allegations that the trial judge had not addressed.
These allegations concerned the filing of an ex parte brief in another court and the alleged harassment of Steele's daughter in the grand jury.37 The Independent Counsel reviewed the matters and, in December 1999, found the relevant attorneys to have acted appropriately in both instances.38 Jarrett Mem., supra note 21, at 1.

31 32 Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 105 [x] D.
The Independent Counsel Accepted the Conclusion of a Special Counsel Concerning the January 16, 1998 Contact with Monica Lewinsky that No Attorney Committed Professional Misconduct.
OPR decided that additional investigation was needed in order to determine whether this Office complied with Department of Justice regulations then in effect relating to contacts with individuals outside the presence of an attorney in their dealings with Monica Lewinsky on January 16, 1998.39 In November 1999, in response to a request by Independent Counsel Ray, Attorney General Reno referred that matter to the Independent Counsel for investigation with the agreement that the Attorney General would accept his findings.40 On February 16, 2000, Independent Counsel Ray appointed Jo Ann Harris, former Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division during the Clinton Administration, as Special Counsel to this Office to conduct an independent review of the allegation.41 Special Counsel Harris and her cocounsel, former Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General, Mary Harkenrider, completed their review and submitted a report to Independent Counsel Ray on December 6, 2000 for his consideration and final determination.42 The Report of the Special Counsel acknowledged the full cooperation and support of the Office of the Independent Counsel.43 The Report of the Special Counsel concluded that no attorney in the Office of the Independent Counsel engaged in professional misconduct in connection with the approach to Monica Lewinsky on January 16, 1998 because the Department's regulations did not unambiguously define Lewinsky as a represented person.44 The [xi] Specifically, this Office had been accused of violating then-applicable ethical provisions regulating contact by federal prosecutors with persons represented by lawyers.

Continued-- 39 106 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
Upon full consideration of the Report of the Special Counsel, written comments, an oral presentation by the attorney in question, the recommendation of two senior attorneys in the Office who reviewed the report, and consultation with counsel for this Office, the Independent Counsel decided to overrule the Special Counsel's finding of poor judgment.
[xii] 1.
The Independent Counsel Accepted the Determination that No Attorney Had Committed Professional Misconduct.
The Independent Counsel accepted the Special Counsel's determination that no attorney had engaged in professional misconduct.
The Special Counsel concluded that whether Monica Lewinsky was a "represented person" within the meaning of the regulations was ambiguous.
The Special Counsel specifically found that the regulations, commentary on the regulations, and other materials relevant to the inquiry supported two different ways of analyzing whether a person is represented with respect to a matter.46 After acknowledging these two modes of analysis, one of which was used in the contact with Monica Lewinsky, the Special Counsel found no professional misconduct occurred because "the regulation does not clearly answer the question of the scope" of the representation of Lewinsky.47 2.
The Independent Counsel Rejected the Special Counsel's Finding of Poor Judgment.
The Independent Counsel rejected the Special Counsel's finding that one attorney exercised poor judgment, on the ground that the Independent Counsel considered it fundamentally unfair to single out one attorney for decisions that were made in consultation with supervisors, other colleagues, and a representative of the Department of Justice, which resulted in a decision that the Special Counsel herself recognized was proper under one mode of analysis supported by relevant authority.48 The Independent Counsel concluded that the attorney had [xiii] While the issue here arose in the context of the Department's ethical rules rather than the Sixth Amendment, the "closely related to" or "inextricably intertwined" test raises similar difficulties in determining whether Lewinsky's representation for the purpose of filing an affidavit in the Jones case constituted representation with respect to the criminal investigation of her filing a false affidavit.
Cf. Shelton v. Hess, 599 F. Supp. 905, 909 (S.D. Tex. 1984) (case cited and relied upon by OPR during its preliminary inquiry in which court disqualified lawyer from representation because subject of the existing representation was "strikingly similar" to and "inextricably intertwined" with the matter for which the contact was initiated).

Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 107 [xiv] adopted a mode of analysis used by the Justice Department in analyzing its own regulations, and despite lecturing for the Department numerous times on the subject, had never been informed by the Department of any other mode of analysis.49 Accordingly, in the Independent Counsel's view, no finding of poor judgment could be fairly sustained that was entirely dependent upon which mode of analysis was correct.50 Moreover, the Special Counsel's investigation revealed that there were many others involved in the planning and execution of the encounter, including senior staff of the Office of the Independent Counsel and representatives of the Department of Justice, who did not make clear--with opportunities to do so--their specific concerns, if any, regarding the proposed contact.51 Under these circumstances, the Independent Counsel concluded that the finding of poor judgment could not be fairly sustained.
See id. at 54, 97.
See id. at 3297.
The Independent Counsel further concluded that the judgment exercised under these circumstances was not "in marked contrast" to the judgment of an attorney exercising good judgment--OPR's standard for finding poor judgment.
The Independent Counsel determined that an attorney who used a mode of analysis that was recognized by the Department could not be found to have used judgment "in marked contrast" to the judgment of an attorney exercising good judgment.

49 50 108 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
O ver the course of the investigations conducted by this Office, various complaints were lodged before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas seeking the appointment of special counsel to investigate alleged prosecutorial misconduct against this Office.
The complainants were Francis T. Mandanici (a public defender from Connecticut with no known connection to the investigation), Julie Hiatt Steele (a defendant in a criminal trial conducted by this Office), Stephen A. Smith (former Chief of Staff to Governor Clinton who pled guilty to a misdemeanor and testified for the government at the trial of Susan McDougal, Jim McDougal, and Jim Guy Tucker), and the United States district judges (except for Judge George Howard Jr. who recused himself) of the Eastern District of Arkansas.
No counsel was ever appointed, and the complaints were all dismissed as without merit by another judge designated by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to consider these matters.
A.
The Complaints of Mandanici, Smith, and Steele Were Rejected.
On September 11, 1996, March 11, 1997, June 19, 1997, and June 4, 1999, Francis T. Mandanici filed "grievances" with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas seeking the appointment of counsel to investigate whether (1) Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr was subject to conflicts of interest in connection with his investigation involving the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") because his law firm had been sued by the RTC, (2) his planned acceptance of the deanship at the School of Public Policy at Pepperdine University reflected a conflict of interest, (3) the Office had improperly leaked grand jury material about Susan McDougal and Hillary Clinton, (4) Independent Counsel Starr had solicited false testimony from Susan McDougal and Julie Hiatt Steele, (5) Independent Counsel Starr violated the independent counsel law in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the Referral under 28 [xv] Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 109 [xvi]
53 The Eighth Circuit dismissed Mandanici's "appeal" finding that a complainant in a disciplinary matter has no standing to pursue an appeal.54 On September 17 and October 12, 1999, Stephen A. Smith and Julie Hiatt Steele, respectively, filed grievances expressly adopting the June 4, 1999 Mandanici grievance alleging that Independent Counsel Starr had solicited false testimony.55 They both claimed that Independent Counsel Starr or his staff had solicited false testimony from them.56 Ms. Steele also claimed that Independent Counsel Starr suffered from a conflict of interest because of his prior contact with the lawyers for Paula Jones.57 With respect to Mandanici's June 4, 1999 complaint, and the subsequent complaints by Steele and Smith adopting Mandanici's complaint, all of the judges of the Eastern District of Arkansas recused themselves on December 21, 1999 and asked that the Chief Judge of the Eighth Circuit appoint another judge to sit by designation to consider these claims.58 The Chief Judge of the Eighth Circuit first appointed the Honorable Warren K. Urbom,59 who was already sitting by designation on a petition for disclosure of grand jury material related to the Office of the Independent Counsel filed in the Western District of Arkansas by the judges (except for Judge Howard) of the Eastern District.60 On January 26, 2000, Judge Urbom recused himself from further consideration of the "grievances" (as well as the petition for disclosure of grand jury materials), stating in both cases: "After being apprised of the nature of the matters involved in these assignments and reflecting upon my relationships with the identifiable persons whose legitimate interests are at stake, I am confident that I must disqualify myself....My impartiality might reasonably be questioned."

Rejecting Mandanici's allegation that Independent Counsel Starr solicited false testimony from Susan McDougal or Julie Hiatt Steele, the court said: "[T]here is not one shred of support in the hundreds of pages of documents submitted by Mandanici to support the[ ]
63 With respect to Mandanici's other substantive allegations, the district court described them variously as "ridiculous," 64 "the stuff that dreams are made of," 65 indicating "no suggestion of bias or conflict," 66 and finally "nonsense."
67 In short, Mandanici's allegations, both independently and as adopted by Smith and Steele, were emphatically rejected by the court.
Judge Nangle also rejected Smith's and Steele's individual claims, finding no evidence that Independent Counsel Starr or the Office of the Independent Counsel attempted to suborn perjury from Smith or Steele.68 The court also found Steele's claim of a conflict of interest was "without merit."
69 [xviii] B. Judge Nangle Rejected the Claims of the Judges of the Eastern District of Arkansas.
Judge Nangle, sitting by designation also in the Western District of Arkansas, rejected the request of all of the judges of the Eastern District of Arkansas (except for Judge George Howard Jr. who had recused himself) to appoint counsel to investigate whether any person improperly sought to have Judge Henry Woods removed from the trial of the then sitting Governor of Arkansas Jim Guy Tucker.70 conducted by Michael E. Shaheen Jr.

May 22, 2000) (under seal).
Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 111 [xxi] The court found that "there is absolutely no basis for the motion of the Eastern District judges and accordingly said motion is denied."
71 This ruling was the culmination of nearly a year of efforts by the judges of the Eastern District to investigate these allegations.
These efforts began in June 1999, apparently after some members of the court received copies of handwritten and typewritten documents that allegedly supported these allegations.72 To pursue these allegations, the judges (1) sought copies of the report that Michael E. Shaheen Jr. prepared in connection with unrelated allegations that witnesses in the investigation received payments or other things of value in exchange for their testimony;73 (2) petitioned for disclosure of the grand jury transcripts and exhibits from Mr. Shaheen's investigation conducted in the Western District of Arkansas;74 and (3) ultimately, having obtained the report (but not the grand jury materials)--over the Independent Counsel's objection--from former independent counsel and federal judge Arlin Adams,75 withdrew the petition and asked Judge Nangle to determine whether an ethics investigation was warranted based on the available materials.76 Chief Judge Wright and Judge Reasoner, while concurring in the filing of a petition for grand jury materials, declined to "sign Judge Wilson's brief."
77 When the judges withdrew their petition for grand jury materials and instead moved for an ethics investigation based on already available materials, only Judges Wilson, Woods, and Moody filed the motion;78 Judges Wright and Reasoner, while concurring in the request, filed a separate concurring petition expressing their reluctance to join in the majority's specific allegations of misconduct.79 Judge Howard recused himself, and Judge Eisele did not participate in the motion.80 Judge Nangle's ruling reflected that he "read and studied and re-read and restudied" the motion of Judges Wilson, Woods, and Moody, and its exhibits; the concurring motion of Chief Judge Wright and Judge Reasoner; the Independent Counsel's response and all exhibits; Mr. Shaheen's report; the withdrawn petition for disclosure of grand jury materials; the Independent Counsel's response; and "all Eastern District of Arkansas and Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rulings related to this question and all applicable case law."
81 On the basis of that consideration, he denied the motion as having "no basis."

71 72 112 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
The Courts Ruled in Every Case that the Independent Counsel and the Grand Jury Were Entitled to Evidence from White House Employees.
T he Independent Counsel repeatedly faced invalid assertions of legal privileges that were either well recognized but unavailable under the circumstances or previously unrecognized.
In the Iran-Contra investigation, President Ronald Reagan waived all claims to executive privilege and attorney-client privilege.83 In the investigation of President Jimmy Carter, he too waived all privileges.84 The assertion of privileges in this investigation required substantial litigation, including appellate litigation in the Supreme Court, and caused substantial delays in obtaining the testimony of government employees, including law enforcement officers, significantly increasing the costs of the investigation.
In every case, the courts found that the grand jury was entitled to the evidence claimed to be shielded by privilege.
A. Privilege Litigation.
During the initial stages of the Lewinsky investigation, Bruce Lindsey (then Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel),85 Sidney Blumenthal (then Assistant to the President),86 and Nancy Hernreich (then Deputy Assistant to the 83 See Peter J. Wallison, Clinton's Claim of Privilege Is A Crime, Wall St. J., Oct. 19, 1998 at A26 (stating that "Presidents have routinely waived executive privilege and attorney-client privilege when they had no objection to disclosing the information involved.
President Reagan waived both [executive and attorney-client privilege] in the Iran-Contra matter, without adverse effect on the privileges themselves"); see also Final Report of the Independent Counsel for the Iran/Contra Matter, Vol. III at 704 (comments of former President Ronald Reagan).
84 Paul Curran, Answer the Questions, Mr. President, Wall St. J., June 4, 1998 at A18 (contrasting President Carter's public pledge to cooperate and his subsequent conduct, including raising no claims of privilege, with President Clinton's public pledge to cooperate and his subsequent claims of privilege).
85 Lindsey testified before the grand jury on November 20, 1997, February 18 and 19, March 12, and August 28, 1998.
86 Blumenthal testified before the grand jury on February 26, June 4, and June 25, 1998.
Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 113 [xxiiii] [xxiv]
88 The President also invoked executive privilege with respect to the testimony of White House counsels Cheryl Mills and Lanny Breuer.
See, e.g., Mills 8/11/98 GJ at 7173; Breuer 8/4/98 GJ at 2223.

Hernreich later acknowledged that the executive privilege was not hers to assert, withdrew any prior attempt to assert it, and agreed to testify.
See Hernreich 3/26/98 GJ at 38.
Before the grand jury, Hernreich ultimately testified: "I am now free to answer questions about those conversations."
Id. at 34.
The assertion of executive privilege for Hernreich, an assistant who managed the secretarial work for the Oval Office, was frivolous.
See Hernreich 2/25/98 GJ at 57.
At the time that President Clinton was invoking executive privilege for one assistant, another assistant (Betty Currie) had already testified extensively.
See Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 188.
Even though the White House withdrew this claim, such an invocation caused a needless, but substantial, expenditure of litigation resources and delay of the grand jury process.

114 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
I strongly felt we should not appeal your victory on the executive privilege issue.103 Notwithstanding this testimony, four days later, on August 21, 1998, the President filed a notice of appeal with respect to the executive privilege claim for Lanny Breuer, which Chief Judge Johnson had denied ten days earlier.104 The President also asserted executive privilege when Bruce Lindsey appeared again before the grand jur y on August 28, 1998--even though the President had dropped the claim of executive privilege for Lindsey while the case was pending before the Supreme Court in June.105 [xxv] B. Secret Service "Protective Function" Privilege.
In addition to the President's and his staff's spurious claims of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege, the Secretary of the Treasury, with the full support of the Department of Justice, including the Solicitor General of the United States, claimed that the United States Secret Service ("Secret Service")--a federal law enforcement agency obligated by statute to cooperate in federal criminal investigations106--could shield its agents from giving testimony to a federal grand jury under a privilege referred to as the "protective function" privilege.
The Independent Counsel sought the testimony from the President's Secret Service detail in an effort to obtain evidence from individuals who were likely to have [xxvi] Id. at 9697, 10809.

98 99 Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Others 115 [xxvii] [xxviii]
111 On May 22, 1998, Chief Judge Johnson granted the motion to compel.112 She concluded that no such protective function privilege existed.113 The court recognized that the protective function privilege has no history in federal law and that the Secret Service has, in fact, "testif[ied] in judicial and non-judicial proceedings with respect to President Nixon's taping system and John Hinckley's attempted assassination of President Reagan."
114 The court found "that the Secret Service's own history, the lack of any constitutional support for the claimed privilege and the federal case law regarding newly asserted privileges under [Fed.
Rules Evid.]
Rule 501 all weigh against recognizing the privilege."
115 The Secretary of the Treasury immediately appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit where the appeal was briefed and argued by the Department of Justice and filed on behalf of Attorney General Reno.116 Amici Curiae former Attorneys General of the United States William P. Barr, Griffin B. Bell, Edwin B. Meese, and Richard L. Thornburgh opposed the Secretar y of the Treasur y's position.

107 116 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
Cir cuit held: "We do not think... that the Secret Service has shown with... compelling clarity . . . that failure to recognize the proposed privilege will jeopardize the ability of the Secret Ser vice effectively to protect the President."
120 Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's decision denying recognition of the privilege.121 The Secretary of the Treasury, again through the offices of the Department of Justice, sought a stay of the district court's order pending the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.122 The district court and court of appeals denied the stay.123 The Secretary of the Treasury, represented by the Solicitor General, then filed a petition for certiorari.124 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, acting as the Circuit Justice for the D. C. Circuit, denied an application for a stay pending disposition of the petition.125 On November 9, 1998, the Supreme Court denied certiorari.126 The rejection of the protective function privilege by the D.C. Circuit delayed by more than three months the receipt of testimony from Secret Service agents and officers and resulted in even further litigation ending in the Supreme Court nearly six months after the original assertion of the privilege.
[xxix] C. Attorney-Client Privilege (Crime-Fraud).
On February 2 and 9, 1998, a grand jury in the District of Columbia issued two subpoenas to attorney Francis D. Carter.127 The grand jury sought to obtain evidence from Lewinsky's lawyer during the time she prepared and filed a false affidavit in the Jones v. Clinton lawsuit.128 The subpoenas requested that Carter testify and turn over certain documents related to his representation.129 Carter moved to quash the subpoenas under a number of privileges.130 In an unpublished order, Chief Judge Johnson rejected Carter's arguments that attorney-client privilege and work product immunity would justify his refusal to comply with the subpoena.131 The court held that the crime-fraud exception to these doctrines applied because "Ms. Lewinsky consulted Mr. Carter for the Id. at 1076.

133 Lewinsky, Carter, and the Independent Counsel all appealed the district court's order.134 The D.C. Circuit agreed with the Independent Counsel's position that full compliance with the grand jury's subpoenas did not implicate Lewinsky's Fifth Amendment rights.135 The D.C.

118 Final Report of the Independent Counsel In Re: Madison Guaranty Savings 
The Independent Counsel's Announcement of His Findings and Conclusions in the Madison Guaranty/Whitewater Investigation Was Entirely Lawful and Appropriate. [xxxi] O n August 31, 2000, United States Senator Carl Levin charged that the Independent Counsel would be "defying the law" by announcing his findings and conclusions in the Whitewater/Madison Guaranty investigation.138 On September 7, 2000, Senator Levin addressed the charge that such an announcement would violate the independent counsel statute in letters to the Special Division and to the Attorney General.139 He also made a statement on the floor of the United States Senate charging that the disclosures, which he claimed to consist of material in the final report, were subject to lawful disclosure only by order of the Special Division.140 In a September 8, 2000 letter, the Independent Counsel responded that Senator Levin's charge was unjustified because the Independent Counsel's public statement was not a portion of a final report and because the U.S. Attorneys' Manual expressly authorizes public statements about matters that "`have already received substantial publicity.'"141 The Special Division and the Attorney General, charged with oversight of the Independent Counsel, expressly declined to take any action despite Senator Levin's request that they do so.142 Press Release, Statement of Senator Carl Levin, (DMI) on Independent Counsel Robert Ray's Intention to Release His Conclusions in the Whitewater Matter (Aug. 31, 2000).

Conclusion [xxxii] T he allegations of professional 
Nevertheless, the many attacks that accumulated during the course of the investigation had a substantial impact on the prompt completion of this Office's work, delaying in some cases for months access to available evidence.
Responding to these allegations and claims also increased substantially the expense of this investigation, but it was essential to do so in order for the Independent Counsel to fulfill the mandates sought by the Attorney General and conferred by the Special Division.
The Independent Counsel's prosecutorial decisions could not have been appropriately made unless the investigation and the grand jury had access to all relevant evidence.
Moreover, it was imperative that this Office defend itself against unfounded allegations of misconduct.
Public confidence in the integrity of the prosecutorial decisions of the Independent Counsel demanded nothing less.
