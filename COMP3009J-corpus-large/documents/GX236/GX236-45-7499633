BUTTER: At the CME, the cash butter price continues to trade within a narrow range.
The current cash price is basically at the level of last year at this time.
Churning schedules across the country are seasonally strong, although surplus cream offerings are less available than in recent weeks.
In many areas of the country ice cream production and other Class II cream based products are absorbing heavier volumes of cream.
In most areas, butter production continues to outpace demand, thus additional butter stocks are clearing to inventory.
Butter stocks are running well ahead of last year at this time.
Overall butter demand is slow to fair.
Some retail orders are being stimulated by scheduled feature activity with food service and restaurants in resort and vacation areas preparing for the summer vacation season.
CHEESE: The cheese market is firming.
Current offerings are not as heavy as expected for this time of year, at least east of the Rockies.
Process interest is building seasonally.
Natural interest is mixed, mainly about steady.
During the week ending June 6, CCC purchased Central process under the price support program and some previously offered Western blocks were cancelled.
Estimated January - April 2003 cumulative cheddar cheese (variety traded on the CME) production totals 945.3 million pounds, down 35.8 million pounds (-3.6%) from the same period in 2002.
Total cheese production for the same period in 2003 totals 2.829 million pounds, down 18.4 million pounds (-0.6%) from last year.
FLUID MILK: National milk production is unevenly steady.
Notable declines are seen in the Southwest where warm weather is taking its toll.
However, unseasonably cooler weather in other regions of the nation is encouraging steady to higher milk outflows.
Milk movement is disrupted in areas as schools close for the summer.
Consequently, milk volumes into bottled milk plants are lighter yet heavier into manufacturing facilities.
Condensed skim interest is fair to good into cheese and ice cream facilities.
Cream demand is improved compared to the week prior.
Supplies of fluid cream are tighter, encouraging less churn activity.
Cream prices are higher in response to increases in the CME AA butter average and higher multiples reported.
DRY PRODUCTS: Dry products markets are trending steady to weak.
NDM sales to the CCC persist.
Concerns regarding CCC-traded NDM undercutting current market prices are being expressed.
Production is steady to lower in response to decreases in the milk supply.
Buttermilk markets remain lackluster.
Discounts are not stimulating any increased interest so producers are opting to store product until market conditions improve.
A similar notion is suspected in the whey markets.
Possible export trades may alleviate heavy whey stocks in the West.
Traders are undercutting manufacturer prices in the Central region while activity is lackluster in the East.
WPC prices continue to trend lower despite noted export interest.
WPC production is steady and stocks are in balance to heavy.
Lactose continues to trend firm.
Some third quarter negotiations are commencing with offers noted at higher prices.

Product available from brokers remains more attractively priced than direct manufacture list prices.
Multiple loads continue to be traded to brokers at a discount.
However, some producers are opting to store whey rather than sell at a discount and consequential loss.

EDIBLE: .1600 - .2350 MOSTLY: .1700 - .1900 DRY WHEY WEST No price changes are noted for Western whey powder.
Some contacts believe that the steady prices are not fully indicative of what is going on with the market and there continues to be a weak undertone.
The real issue for discussion this week is what will happen with the tender due in late next week.
If the U.S. gets most of the volume it could clear up some of the heavy stocks, but it may take lower prices to get it done.
If the U.S. doesn't get any of the tender it may mean that prices will have to go lower to clear out heavy supplies.
There are too many unknowns at this time for the market to be able to pick up a true direction.

DAIRY MARKET NEWS, JUNE 2 - 6, 2003 -8INTERNATIONAL DAIRY MARKET NEWS VOLUME 70, REPORT 23 Information gathered May 26 - June 6, 2003 Prices are U.S. $/MT, F.O.B. port.
Information gathered for this report is from trades, offers to sell, and secondary data.
Th is bi-weekly report may not always contain the same products and/or regions.
Future reports may be included or withdrawn depending on availability of information.
MT = metric ton = 2,204.6 pounds.
WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPE OVERVIEW: WESTERN EUROPE: Milk production trends in most European countries remain strong.
Many milk handlers are reporting that milk volumes seem to be holding steady at a high level, thus indicating to them that the seasonal peak is at hand.
Although some continue to report slight increases, others are reporting slight declines from recent weeks.
Currently, temperatures in many milk producing regions of Europe have been reported as hot, thus this could reduce the peak of the milk production cycle quickly, but no indications of this is reported as of yet.
Much conversation continues to center around the firm Euro.
The recent export subsidy adjustment a few weeks ago for skim milk powder and last week's export subsidy increase for full cream powder are two factors some traders and handlers are attributing to resumed buyer interest.
Although this buyer interest is not significant, suppliers are hopeful that this is the start of sales activity out of Europe.
All in all, Europe is the only source for dairy products at this time.
Milk production in the Oceania region has ended for the season and orders are being filled from inventoried stocks with no significant volumes available for spot buyer needs.
This situation will maintain itself for the next few months until the start of their new milk production season in August/September.
South American stocks are limited and U.S. prices are too high to attract buyer interest without DEIP, although U.S. stocks are available.
European traders indicate that U.S. supplies may become available under the new DEIP program after July 1 or if industry conversations of a possible CCC support tilt for butter/powder occurs.
European skim milk powder continue to clear to intervention.
Many traders and handlers report that intervention offerings are heavier than anticipated, but are now not surprised at the volumes in light of limited international sales.
As of May 28, intervention volumes total about 48,000 mt versus 75,000 mt last year at this time.
Most feel that offerings will slow once international sales resume, which many feel is not too far away.
BUTTER/BUTTEROIL: European butter markets and prices are steady.
A slight renewal of buyer interest is starting to develop for European dairy products.
Butter production is reported to be lighter.
Butter producers indicate that cream is less available for the churn.
Increased demand of cream for other uses and lower butterfat tests are two reasons for light cream offerings.
Active clearances to PSA and intervention have slowed.
82% BUTTERFAT: 1,250 - 1,300 99% BUTTERFAT: 1,550 - 1,650 SKIM MILK POWDER (SMP): European skim milk powder markets are unsettled with prices unchanged to slightly lower.
Trader and handler opinions on the recent export subsidy increase of a few weeks ago and its' impact on prices/sales are still mixed.
Some state that this is the start of better thing to follow, while others are not as optimistic.
Some are indicating that sales activity, or at least buyer interest, is starting to occur.
They have put together a few small lot, immediate shipment sales, with additional sales to hopefully follow.
Traders report that Europe is basically the only source of skim milk powder (at world prices) at this time and indicate that European sources will be competing among themselves when buyer interest develops.
1.25% BUTTERFAT: 1,675 - 1,750 WHOLE MILK POWDER (WMP): European whole milk powder markets are generally steady, although prices are unchanged to lower.
On May 28, the EU Management Committee increased the export refund for dry whole milk by 10%, from 930 Euros to 1,024 per mt.
Many traders and handlers were lobbying the Commission for such a move due to the firm Euro against the U.S. dollar.
Opinions were unclear at that time what this might do to encourage full cream powder sales, but by midweek this week, reports of buyer interest and small lot sales were being uncovered.
Many feel that this may be the start of renewed buyer interest.
26% BUTTERFAT: 1,625 - 1,675 OCEANIA OCEANIA OVERVIEW: Milk production patterns in Oceania are at seasonal low levels.
The winter season is at hand in all areas, but spring, and the start of the new milk production season, is not far off.
Producers and milk handlers are already looking forward to the new season with optimism.
Moisture during the fall/winter season has or is occurring in most milk producing areas, although additional volumes are needed.
Yearend milk production reports out of New Zealand and Australia are much the same as have been released during the season.
New Zealand is reporting a 2% gain over the 2001 2002 year, while Australia continues to project a 10% decline for the same period.
Some projections for the new season are that New Zealand handlers anticipate gains in line with last season and the Australian outlook is 1 2% gains over the year just completed.
Sales activity out of Oceania is limited as most activity is centering around shipments of previously placed orders.
At this time, dairy product handlers still feel comfortable with their supplies in relationship to orders, with most indicating that they will have very minimal volumes, if any at all, to carry into the new year.
Oceania handlers and traders are closely monitoring international political and monetary developments at this time and analyzing what impact these developments might or will have on new season product prices.
BUTTER: Oceania butter markets and prices are basically steady.
No new buyer interest or sales activity is being reported from this part of the world.
Traders and handlers report that shipments are leaving the Oceania region as scheduled and stocks are sufficient to maintain steady deliveries.
Most traders and handlers report that inventory levels are sufficient to fill known orders with minimal volumes available for spot buyer interest.
They indicate that if stocks are carried into the new production season, they will be quite minimal and not a major concern.
82% BUTTERFAT: 1,250 - 1,275 CHEDDAR CHEESE: Oceania cheese markets are steady at unchanged prices.
Stocks are sufficient to maintain steady shipment schedules to regular and ongoing customers.
New buyer interest is very limited as most of Oceania's cheese stocks have been previously committed.
39% MAXIMUM MOISTURE: 1,700 - 1,950 SKIM MILK POWDER (SMP): As in most Oceania dairy product markets, prices and the market tone are steady.
The milk production season has now ended for the year and orders are being filled from inventoried stocks.
Shipments are reported to be on schedule and most handlers are comfortable with their supply situation in relationship to known orders.
1.25% BUTTERFAT: 1,650 - 1,750 WHOLE MILK POWDER (WMP) : Whole milk powder markets are generally steady with prices adjusting to previous weeks'.
Stocks are sufficient to maintain steady shipment schedules.
Orders are being filled from inventoried stocks with handlers indicating that they are comfortable with their supply situation.
Most handlers state that they will basically be cleaned out when the new production season resumes.
26% BUTTERFAT: 1,700 - 1,775 Exchange rates for selected foreign currencies: June 2, 2003 .7300 .3512 .0976 .2642 Canadian Dollar Argentina Peso Mexican Peso Polish Zloty .0212 Indian Rupee .5811 New Zealand Dollar .6574 Australian Dollar .0084 Japanese Yen 1.1751 Euro SWEET WHEY POWDER: Whey powder markets and prices are weak.
Cheese production schedules have been very active during recent weeks which have generated heavy whey volumes.
At this point, international sales activity has been limited for European whey, thus available volumes have had to clear into domestic or internal markets.
These markets have not been able to fully absorb the heavy volumes, thus prices are weakening in hopes of encouraging buyer interest.
Traders are wondering if any European stocks will clear as a result of the Japanese tender which is to be awarded soon.
Many still feel that prices are too high for consideration.
NONHYGROSCOPIC: 350 - 400 To compare the value of 1 US Dollar to Mexican Pesos: (1/.0976)= 10.2459.
That is 1 US Dollar equals 10.2459 Mexican Pesos.
Source: "Wall Street Journal" OVERVIEW: EASTERN EUROPE: Milk production patterns in Eastern Europe continue to increase toward seasonal peak levels.
Temperatures are also reported to be warming which may slow the growth if they persist.
Milk volumes are sufficient to maintain active manufacturing schedules.
Stocks of Eastern European dairy products are increasing as international sales activity continues to be reported as light.
Although some buyer inquiries are starting to occur.
