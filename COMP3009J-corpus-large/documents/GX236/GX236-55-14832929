AQUATIC WILD Links/Science Activity Title: WATERSHED Activity Guide Page # 172
Objective(s): Students will: 1) describe the characteristics of watersheds; 2) discuss the role of watersheds in providing wildlife habitat as well as human habitats; and 3) give examples of how watersheds can be conserved and protected.
Method/Overview: Students measure the area of a small watershed, calculate the amount of water it receives each year, and discuss the varied roles the watershed plays in human and wildlife habitat.
Subject Area(s): Science, Math, Social Studies Performance Indicators Standards (by grade clusters) Elementary Grades 3-4 Science and Technology 1. Make accurate observations using J. Inquiry and Problem Solving appropriate tools and units of measure.
Students will apply inquiry and problem-solving approaches in science and technology.

Middle Grades 5-8 1. Make accurate observations using appropriate tools and units of measure.
Secondary Grades 1. Make accurate observations using appropriate tools and units of measure.
Evidence of alignment (text from activity description) Procedure #5 As a group, have the students determine the location of the control stake at the "bottom" of the watershed.
