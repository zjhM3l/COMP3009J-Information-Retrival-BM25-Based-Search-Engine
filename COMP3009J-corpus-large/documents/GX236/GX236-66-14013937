The Human-Animal-Health Connection Animals and people have been living and working together for thousands of years, but in the past 100 years, an extraordinary amount of change has taken place in those relationships; in recent years, people have significantly changed their perceptions, their relationships, and their uses of animals and animal products.
In the past, nearly all dogs were used for herding, hunting, tracking, or protection and were seldom allowed in the house, almost never in the bedroom.
In the United States today, most dogs are kept in the house for companionship; just a very few are kept for work.
Current studies also show that 60-80% of dogs sleep with their owners at night in the bedroom, either in or on the bed. (http://www.censhare.umn.edu/spotlight2.htm )
In the past, cats were used to hunt and kill mice or rats; they were usually kept outdoors and rarely allowed inside the family home.
Today, studies show that the majority of cats in homes sleep in the bedroom at night, and most sleep on or in the bed. (http://www.censhare.umn.edu/spotlight2.htm )
These trends illustrate the closeness of a human-animal relationship and the significant change in our attitudes towards treating pets as family; today most people consider their pets to be members of their families.
Today we have a better and greatly expanded recognition of the mutual benefits of the human-animal bond to health and spirit; in fact, there is scientific evidence supporting many of the healthy effects of pet ownership.
For example: * Seniors who own dogs go to the doctor less than those who do not.
In a study of 100 Medicare patients, even the most highly stressed dog owners in the study had 21 percent fewer physician's contacts than non-dog owners.
(Siegel, 1990).
* Activities of daily living (ADL's) levels of seniors who did not currently own pets, deteriorated more on average than that of respondents who currently owned pets.
(Raina, 1999).

* Medication costs dropped from an average of $3.80 per patient per day to just $1.18 per patient per day in new nursing home facilities (in New York, Missouri and Texas) that have animals and plants as an integral part of the environment.
(Montague, 1995).
* Pets in nursing homes increase social and verbal interactions adjunct to other therapy.

(Bergensen, 1989).

(Melson, 1990).
* Children exposed to pets during the first year of life have a lower frequency of allergic rhintis and asthma.
(Hesselmar, 1999).
* Children who own pets score significantly higher on empathy and prosocial orientation scales than non-owners.
(Vidovic, 1999).
* Pets fulfill many of the same support functions as humans for adults and children.
