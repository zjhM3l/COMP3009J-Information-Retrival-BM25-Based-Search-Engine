Use GREAT poster as a means of reminding staff that customer service is our most important goal.
Ensure consistent answers to questions or resources when answers are unknown Encourage staff to take time to ask their own questions to more fully understand the customers' situation Show genuine interest in each and every customer Follow up on e-mail responses Complete "Creating Magical Moments For Our Customers," Employment Security's customer service training, and foster an environment that supports staff in applying the training to their everyday work.
