T
he buyout plan recently submitted to NASA Headquarters has been approved.
The buyout period opened Tuesday and closes on Dec. 31.
The official notice and various attachments are being distributed to all employees.

five-minute firing of the Integral Propulsion System aboard the Marshall-managed Chandra X-ray Observatory was successfully completed Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 4, raising the perigee, or low point, of the observatory's orbit by an estimated 1,373 miles (2,210 kilometers).
Controllers at the Chandra Operations Control Center in Cambridge, Mass., commanded the observatory's engines to ignite at 12:36 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
The burn which raised Chandra's perigee to an estimated 3,535 miles (5,689 kilometers), left the observatory's apogee, or high point, essentially unchanged at 86,448 miles (139,125 kilometers).
"Initial indications are that today's firing went very well," said Fred Wojtalik, Chandra program manager at Marshall.
"Our next firing is planned for Saturday, and will be an approximately six-minute burn to further raise Chandra's perigee."
Meanwhile, the Chandra control team continues to step through activation and checkout of observatory systems and instruments.
"We are extremely pleased with the performance of Chandra and the way activation is progressing," said Wojtalik.

Rep. Cramer discusses NASA budget cuts Editor's Note: The following are comments made by Rep. Bud Cramer of Huntsville about the recently announced NASA budget cuts.
wanted to give you the opportunity to hear from me a more complete explanation about the way we've wound up here in this NASA cut that I believe we will only have to temporarily endure.
Of course I'd rather be there in person but I'm up here in Washington staring down the last stages of this appropriations cycle.
I'm coming to you somewhat informally even though it's through this technology.
I've been your representative for nine years now; I'm in my fifth term.
Ever since the day I got here, I've hit the ground running on NASA and Marshall issues.
I've worked hard to build a coalition so that we have a NASA support group to win the battles we need to win.
We've fought in 12 space station battles -- and we've won them all.
One came a little closer than I would have liked, but the other 11 were big wins that we won with considerable margins.
More than two years ago I went to the Appropriations Committee, and this year I went to the subcommittee on VA/HUD and Independent Agencies that unfortunately gave NASA the bad budget cut on July 26 which at that time was $1.4 billion.
However, as early as April or May we could foresee that the end game of this budget process was going to be bad news for NASA.
The chairman of the committee, Rep. Walsh, warned me that because the NASA bill falls last in the cycle, because there were going to be budget issues not settled, because the tax cut issue would also not be settled, this bill and two other bills would receive bad marks.
We were warned they would be devastating marks but that the end game would be reconciliation at the end of the year.
We foresaw temporary bad news.
We got the bad news on July 26 in subcommittee when we heard about the $1.4 billion cut.
We took it to full committee at the end of the week and were able to restore $400 million of the $1.4 billion bringing the cut down to $1 billion, still an absolutely intolerable level of cuts.

Marshall Values Dedication, hard work by people accomplishes Marshall's mission, goals Editor 's note: This is the first in a five-part series addressing Marshall's core values.
like safety and ISO 9000 policies, information from the Project LIGHT initiative, and NASA and Center mission and goals.
Looking at all of those documents, the five values we selected became obvious.
"Our mission and goals can only be accomplished by the dedication and hard work of our people," Scales said.
"Creating a safe and healthy environment is a key component of this value.
The safety of people, equipment and property must always be the first consideration in our decision-making process."
Valuing people means creating an environment that encourages balance between personal and professional life.
It means being accountable to our customers, meeting our commitments, supporting our team members, and being innovative and creative.
"As a people-oriented organization, we must also provide the tools and training necessary to enable professional growth," Scales said.
"While it's important that we accomplish our mission and goals on schedule and within budget, it's just as important how we do it.
That's why a key component of our people value is a commitment to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior.
At the end of the day, it's important to look back and say we did it right both technically and ethically.
"Valuing people also means recognizing the individual and cultural differences of Marshall's diverse workforce," Scales said.
"Striving for diversity in our workforce is not only the right thing to do, it also gives us a competitive advantage because we will get diverse ideas.
Of course, having -- as part of our people value -- a commitment to reward and celebrate our accomplishments is a fun way to highlight our successes."
August 5, 1999
T
he Marshall team is committed to five core values: People, Customers, Excellence, Teamwork and Innovation.
These values serve as the principles that guide our decisions and behaviors.
This week the Star looks at the value of people.
Charles Scales, director of Marshall's Equal Opportunity Office, discusses how the values were selected and why "people" is at the top of the list.
PEOPLE: Â· We recognize that the people who work here are "most important" -- and are our greatest strength.
Â· We create a safe and healthy environment.
Â· We encourage balance between personal and professional life.
Â· We enable personal and professional growth.
Â· We commit ourselves to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior.
Â· We reward and celebrate our accomplishments.
Â· We recognize individual and cultural differences and treat each other with dignity and respect.
"These values are the result of input from employees throughout the Center," said Scales, who chaired a small group of employees tasked with bringing the Marshall values into focus.
"We looked at existing Center policies and procedures 2
Annual Honors Day Awards Ceremonies Center director praises employees' accomplishments NASA Distinguished Service Medal The Distinguished Service Medal is the highest honor that NASA confers to a Government employee.
The award is granted only to employees who, by distinguished service, ability or courage, have personally made a contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission in the interest of the United States and are so extraordinary that the other forms of recognition by NASA would be inadequate.
W
e honor the Marshall Space Flight Center spirit of excellence as evidenced by this distinguished group of recipients.
Their achievements bring honor to the Center, their families and co-workers.
Over the last year, the Marshall Center recipients, including employees and contractors, continued NASA's march toward a new millennium of space exploration that will enhance the quality of life for our friends and our nation.
We commend them for their perseverance, dedication, commitment to safety and plain hard work.
They remained firmly focused on the future even in the midst of change.
The recipients demonstrated excellence in technical, administrative and managerial assignments.
Their work reflected the Marshall Center's dedication to its assigned responsibilities as NASA's leader in Space Transportation Systems Development and as the Center of Excellence for Space Propulsion.
For example, hardware delivery started for the X-33 technology demonstrator vehicle.
The X-34, with the Marshall-developed Fastrac engine, also met key milestones.
These efforts continued to provide significant technology information to aid U.S. industry in building a full-scale Reusable Launch Vehicle.
In line with our commitment to safety, increased reliability and reduced costs, we witnessed the first flight of the Super Lightweight Tank and the Shuttle Main Engine Block IIA configuration.
Our leadership in Microgravity Research continued broad, productive Earth-based and space-based research including a new treatment for influenza, developed with the aid of space-grown crystals.
We also explored improvements in plant growth Light Emitting Diodes by Quantum Devices to help advance photodynamic cancer therapy.
Our Space Optics Manufacturing Technology team designed, developed and tested numerous optical systems and technologies to help us better view and understand our universe.
We eagerly await the discoveries Chandra will make.
Along with Unity, the U.S. Laboratory and the Airlock Module, were built by Boeing in Marshall facilities in support of the International Space Station effort.
The ISS holds untold promises for the future of space exploration.
The last 12 months illustrate the dedication and commitment shown by every member of the Marshall team.
We express special appreciation to our recipients for bringing people to space and space to people in new and extraordinary ways.

Minority institutions team with Marshall to conduct NASA education, research projects by Sherrie Super en faculty and student teams from six minority universities recently were awarded Partnership Awards to conduct education and research projects with Marshall.
Partnership Awards are designed to foster cooperation between NASA employees and faculty and students at historically Black colleges, Hispanic serving institutions and Tribal colleges and universities.
The university teams collaborate with Marshall employees onsite at Marshall and the universities, said Willie Love, assistant director of Marshall's Equal Opportunity Office.
To qualify for support, each university project must be unique, innovative and fall within research and mission areas.
Partnership Awards are grants of up to $100,000 per year for up to two years.
"It's a win-win situation," Love said.
"Marshall benefits from university-led research supporting the Center's mission.
And the universities gain real-world research experience, infrastructuredevelopment opportunities, exposure to highly technical areas, the potential to publish in professional journals and the professional exposure gained from working for NASA."
The NASA Office of Equal Opportunity Programs has awarded 72 Partnership Awards this year.
The 10 teams that are designated to work with Marshall have proposed projects directly related to Marshall's strategic mission.
Alabama A
Professors leading the teams include Dr. Goang Liaw, Dr. Maged A. Elshamy, Dr. Enoch C. Temple and Dr. Mohan D. Aggarwal.
Other university teams working with Marshall include Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., led by Dr. Arnold Burger; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, led by Dr. Mark J. Schulz; Southern University and A
Each team's progress is reviewed by NASA technical experts.
Earnest C. Smith, assistant to the director of Marshall's Engineering Directorate, will work with Marshall specialists to review each university's initial proposal, identify its merits and ensure its relevance to the Center's mission.
In addition to fostering cooperation between NASA and minority institutions, Partnership Awards are designed to enhance collaborative research and educational efforts with NASA Centers, the aerospace industry, public schools and other institutions of higher education.
A goal of the awards is to enhance development of a competent scientific and technical workforce of outstanding U.S. citizens.

Employees reminded to take added precautions on hot days
T
he high heat index of 100oF or higher experienced last week will probably occur on many days throughout the summer.
This extreme heat places employees at a higher risk of heat related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion, heat cramps and even heat stroke.
For those employees whose job requires working outside, please do the following to avoid a heat related illness: 1) Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing.
2) Drink plenty of liquids, preferably water.
3) Reduce your exposure time to the heat.
Acclimate yourself by beginning with shorter heat exposure periods followed by gradual increases.
A work and rest regimen may be alternated with longer rest periods in a cool area.
4) Reduce strenuous activity.
Work loads should be increased gradually.
If you feel you are suffering from a heat-related illness, report to the Medical Center immediately or call 911.

Technical library staff ready to help with research needs by Pamela Vaughn f you're looking for a Sports Illustrated magazine or the latest John Grisham novel, try one of the local bookstores.
But if you're looking for information contained within a particular technical document, the best and most convenient resources are in the Marshall Technical Library.
Many people on the Center may not realize there is a library on-site.
Still others don't utilize the facility, perhaps because they don't know what it offers.
"It's not just a place where you come and check out a book or look at a magazine," said Deborah Wills, the librarian.
"We offer other services as well.
If you need help finding something, we can assist you in your search.
People just don't realize there's so much available."
The library, located in G11 on the ground floor of Bldg. 4200, houses thousands of documents and publications -- many of them authored by Marshall employees.
Others are available on microfiche.
Information ranges from the NASA engineering training collection and NASA current Formal Series (i.e., technical memorandums, special publications, conference publications, reference publications) -- to documents that date back to the opening of the library in 1962.
Hard copies and microfiche are not the only ways of viewing some of these publications.
Many documents may be accessed online.
There are workstations available to employees who wish to do their research away from the office, but the library can be searched in the NASA GALAXIE (a catalog for other NASA Centers) and RECONplus databases from employees' office desktops.
The Technical Library has its own home page, located at: http://library.msfc.nasa.gov/library/ allowing linkup directly to the databases.
Other systems, servers and databases also are linked to the site.
The staff also will demonstrate how to search the different systems available.
And for help from the library staff via e-mail, there's a section of the

home page titled "Information Request."
While some documents on the Web are available in full text, "most of the older things people are looking for are not available online in full-text," said Jackie Pates, a technical information specialist.
"They are identified with a citation -- a title, date, report number, author -- a basic bibliography.
We can help you find it.
If we don't have it, we'll attempt to order it through the Redstone Arsenal Library or other NASA Centers."
Other services offered by the library include a television and VCR available in a room ideal for small group meetings.
It can be scheduled in advance by phoning the library.
There is a shortterm checkout for non-reference materials.
The library is open Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
For more information, call 544-4524 or 544-4525.

Budget Continued from page 1 This place doesn't work as you or I think it should.
Sometimes we put the cart before the horse.
In a year like this, we've definitely put the cart before the horse.
This year we've got the news of a budget surplus.
We're making headway though with the deficit and the debt situation.
Those two issues have punished NASA's budget in the past.
NASA's done a good job in the past under difficult circumstances of reassigning roles and redesigning the space station so that it's cheaper.
That's the way we've survived during very difficult budget times.
But when budget times are better, NASA ought to enjoy budget marks that are better.
We've tightened our belts in the appropriate way.
We're not there yet, but I want to assure you with my experience and the support group we've built up, we'll survive these budget cuts.
I 10 hate that you will have to endure this anxiety for weeks, maybe months before we solve this.
I'm working on this daily, I have been and I'm in a position now to be proactive rather than reactive.
I told the Marshall Center director (Art Stephenson) several months ago that I could foresee the VA/HUD bill marked up in a way we wouldn't like.
Rest assured we take it seriously.
We understand the anxious impact this has on you and your families.
At all times to get this news -- when we've just celebrated the 30th anniversary walk on the Moon, the success of the Chandra launch and the recent mission of Columbia -- this is not the time to endure this.
We will correct this.
In the meantime, keep your spirits up, keep up the good NASA work and I look forward to celebrating better days ahead with you.

Eligibility to use Marshall Medical Center explained
A
contract employee recently was bitten by fire ants.
His supervisor did not allow this employee to go to the Marshall Medical Center for assistance.
Contract personnel are authorized to visit the Medical Center when they experience any work-related injury or illness or for a scheduled physical examination.
Contractors who have potential adverse exposures on-the-job are provided physical exams tailored to their work environment.
These potential exposures include radiation, lasers, chemicals, asbestos, noise, lead or mercury, and include occupations such as food handler, security guard, heavy equipment operator or pilot.
Contractors should not report to the Marshall Medical Center for injuries suffered off the job or when an illness is not workrelated, such as colds, flu, etc.
Civil service personnel should report to the Medical Center when they experience any work-related injury or illness or for immediate attention for minor illnesses or injuries.
Normally, patients will be given an initial dose of medication and a prescription for the rest of the required medication, when indicated.
If appropriate, a patient will be advised to seek help from his or her private physician for continuing monitoring and/ or follow-up.
Civil service personnel also should report to the Medical Center when a physical examination appointment has been scheduled.
Civil service personnel may be scheduled for a physical under one of two categories: a periodic examination or a monitoring/mandatory examination based on potential work exposures.
For medical emergencies, anyone can summon an ambulance by dialing 911.
UMS contract presents check to Huntsville Youth Orchestra by Catherine Kholanjani he Lockheed Martin Space Operations Utilization and Mission Support (UMS) contract in Huntsville, recently presented a $2,000 check to the Huntsville Youth Orchestra in support of upcoming events planned for the orchestra's 19992000 season.
The Huntsville Youth Orchestra is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing youth with the opportunity to study, rehearse and perform fine music in public concerts under the direction of professional conductors.
The organization does not deny participation to any child due to inability to pay membership fees.
In addition, its concerts are free.
Last year the orchestra supported over 120 musicians from pre-school beginners to
T
high school seniors from several northern Alabama and southern Tennessee counties.
Lockheed Martin's contribution will help fund two new ventures for the orchestra's 1999-2000 season.
One of the projects involves performing this season's concerts at the Von Braun Center Concert Hall in downtown Huntsville.
Moving the concerts to the Von Braun Center will enhance both the acoustics and the young musicians' performing experiences.
The concerts are scheduled for October 17, March 19, 2000, and May 14, 2000.
The second venture Lockheed Martin Space Operations will help fund is the broadcasting of the youth orchestra's concerts on the Internet.
LiveOnTheNet.com, a Huntsville-based company, will broadcast the performances
live and on demand for several months following the concerts.
Area schools will be encouraged to use the Internet concerts as part of their music curricula.
"Lockheed Martin has a vital interest in the Huntsville community, and the Huntsville Youth Orchestra helps instill confidence and discipline in the youngest members of our community," said Frank Barnes, Lockheed's program manager.
"We are proud to be a sponsor of the Huntsville Youth Orchestra and these events in support of the young musicians."
For more information on the concerts, call the Huntsville Youth Orchestra office at (256) 880-0622 or visit the Website at: www.hsv.tis.net/~hyo.
