CARGO AIRLINES LTD. for a foreign air carrier permit under 49 U.S.C. Â§ 41301 ORDER ISSUING FOREIGN AIR CARRIER PERMIT Summary In this order we are issuing C.A.L.
Cargo Airlines Ltd.
(C.A.L.
Cargo) an initial foreign air carrier permit to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail between Israel and the United States consistent with the Israel-U.S. bilateral aviation agreement.
Application By application filed April 13, 2000, as amended,1 C.A.L.
Cargo requests that we issue it an initial foreign air carrier permit authorizing C.A.L.
Cargo to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail from points behind Israel, via Israel and named intermediate points, to specified points in the United States; and authority to conduct all-cargo charters in accordance with Part 212 of the Department's rules, consistent with our bilateral aviation agreement with Israel.2 Docket OST-2000-7251
On June 13, 2001, C.A.L.
Cargo filed a related permit application in Docket OST-2001-9918.
We will incorporate the evidentiary information filed in Docket OST-2001-9918 in the context of the permit application here (Docket OST-2000-7251) and dismiss C.A.L.
Cargo's request in Docket OST-2001-9918.
2 C.A.L.
Cargo holds Department exemption authority to conduct all-cargo services between Tel Aviv and New York and Chicago, via specified intermediate points.
See, e.g. Notices of Action Taken of February 25, 2003, in Docket OST-2000-7252; and April 22, 2003, in Docket OST-2001-9137.
C.A.L.

In support of its application, C.A.L.
Cargo states that it has been licensed and designated by the Government of Israel to perform the proposed services; that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by citizens of Israel; and that it is operationally and financially fit to perform the proposed services.
No answers were filed in response to C.A.L.
Cargo's permit application.
Decision We have reviewed the record in this case and have decided to grant the application using simplified Subpart B procedures.3 The public was informed of the application by notice in the Federal Register and the Department's published weekly list of applications filed.4 The notice described the authority sought and gave interested persons an opportunity to submit evidence and objections to the award of the authority.
Simplified procedures are appropriate in this case because there are no material determinative issues of fact requiring other procedures.
We find that grant of this foreign air carrier permit is in the public interest, and that C.A.L.
Cargo is qualified to conduct the proposed operations.
Public Interest Considerations The U.S.-Israel bilateral aviation agreement (the Agreement) provides the rights to conduct the all-cargo services proposed by C.A.L. Cargo.
Operational and Financial Fitness We find that C.A.L.
Cargo is operationally and financially fit to conduct the operations at issue here.
C.A.L.
Cargo is a private corporation incorporated on July 15, 1976, by Israeli agricultural organizations with the primary objective of offering the agricultural sector in Israel convenient and economical air service to Europe.
C.A.L.
Cargo has been providing all-cargo services between Israel and the United States since obtaining initial Department exemption authority on July 14, 2000.
C.A.L.
Cargo has experienced management, and has had no safety violations, fatal accidents or tariff violations in the last five years.
C.A.L.
Cargo services to the United States are operated with B-747 freighter aircraft registered in Israel.
Maintenance on its aircraft will be performed by GE-IAI, a company

jointly owned by GE Electric Corporation and Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd.
C.A.L.
Cargo holds effective authority from its homeland to conduct the proposed operations.5 By memorandum dated June 2, 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration advised us that it knows of no reason why C.A.L.
Cargo's request for a foreign air carrier permit should not be approved.
Finally, we have verified C.A.L.
Cargo's compliance with 14 CFR Parts 203 (Waiver of Warsaw Convention Liability Limits and Defenses), 205 (Aircraft Accident Liability Insurance) and 129 (Foreign Carrier Operations Specifications).
C.A.L.
Cargo has provided financial information which indicates that it can conduct the proposed services without jeopardizing shipper funds.
Specifically, for calendar year ending December 31, 2001, C.A.L.
Cargo reported total assets of $92 million and total liabilities of $82 million and owners' equity of $10 million.
For calendar year 2001, C.A.L.
Cargo reported a net loss of approximately $3 million.
For the year ending December 31, 2000, C.A.L.
Cargo reported total assets of $62.6 million, total liabilities of $52 million, and owners' equity of $10.6 million.
For calendar year 2000, C.A.L.
Cargo reported a net loss of approximately $600 thousand.
Ownership and Control We find that C.A.L.
Cargo is substantially owned and effectively controlled by homeland nationals.
Specifically, C.A.L.
Cargo is owned by four Israeli entities.6 In addition, all of C.A.L.
Cargo's officers, directors and key management personnel are citizens of Israel.
In view of the foregoing, and all the facts of record, we find and conclude that: 1.
It is in the public interest to issue C.A.L.
Cargo an initial foreign air carrier permit in the form attached; 2.
C.A.L.
Cargo is fit, willing and able properly to perform the foreign air transportation described in the attached permit and to conform to the provisions of the Act, and to our rules, regulations, and requirements;
On December 13, 1999, C.A.L.
Cargo was issued a Commercial Operating License (No. 91/10/99) by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport.
By diplomatic note dated July 6, 2000, the Government of Israel designated C.A.L.
Cargo to operate scheduled and charter all-cargo services under Article 3 and 4 of the Agreement.
6 Nir Shitufi National Cooperative Society for the Settlement of Hebrew Workers in Israel (43%), The Vegetable Production and Marketing Board (29%), The Production and Marketing Board of Ornamental Plants (21%), and the Fruit Board (7%).
The Vegetable Production and Marketing Board and The Production and Marketing Board of Ornamental Plants are both owned by the Government of Israel.

3.
The public interest requires that the exercise of the privileges granted by the permit should be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations contained in the attached permit, and to such other reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations required by the public interest as we may prescribe; 4.
The issuance of this foreign air carrier permit will not constitute a "major regulatory action" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as defined in section 313.4(a)(1) of our Regulations;7 and 5.
The public interest does not require an oral evidentiary hearing on the application.
ACCORDINGLY, 1.
We issue, in the form attached, a foreign air carrier permit to C.A.L.
Cargo authorizing it to engage in (1) scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail from points behind Israel via Israel and Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, Romania, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Montreal, and Toronto, to New York (and ten additional points in the United States to be selected by Israel and notified to the United States), and beyond (a) one specified U.S. point to Mexico City, and (b) any specified U.S. points to South America and Asia, without traffic rights between U.S. points beyond the United States.
2.
C.A.L.
Cargo is also authorized to engage in all-cargo charter trips in foreign air transportation, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the Department's regulations governing charters; 3.
The exercise of the privileges granted above is subject to C.A.L.
Cargo's compliance with the conditions listed in Attachment A; 4.
We dismiss as moot the request of C.A.L.
Cargo's permit application in Docket OST2001-9918; 5.
To the extent not granted, we deny all requests for relief in Docket OST-2000-7251; 6.
Unless disapproved by the President of the United States under Â§ 41307 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code, this order and the attached permit shall become effective on the 61st day after its submission for Â§ 41307 review, or upon the date of receipt of advice from the
