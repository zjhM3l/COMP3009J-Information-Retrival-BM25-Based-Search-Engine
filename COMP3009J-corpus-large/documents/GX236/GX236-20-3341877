"It is a key issue for astrobiology and could demonstrate that life's essential, pre-biotic, carbon-based building blocks are abundant in the ISM."
Without carbon, life as we know it would not exist.
The element plays key roles in the evolution of stars, planets and human bodies because carbon is abundant and can form complex structures.
PAH research may also help to solve a problem that scientists have struggled with for most of the century.
They have detected more than 100 mysterious interstellar "holes" in the spectra of starlight.
Scientists now believe that a form of PAHs might be the unknown matter producing these interstellar holes (or bands in the spectra).
PAHs, thought to be formed in a star's atmosphere, are stable carbon molecules formed at high temperatures.

Ames astrobiologist seeks clues to origin of life An Ames scientist has shown that organic chemistry is abundant in the universe, implying that carbon-based life is possible beyond Earth's boundaries.
In a paper published in the December 18 issue of Science titled "Carbon in the Universe," Ames researcher Farid Salama, collaborating with Thomas Henning of the Astrophysikalisches Institut in Jena, Germany, reports finding the unique signatures of an exotic form of carbon in deep space.
Known as PAHs (short for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), these carbonbased molecules, shaped like fragments of chicken wire, are thought to be ubiquitous in space.
The existence of PAHs in the interstellar medium (ISM) may explain the mysterious spectral signatures that are common throughout interstellar space.
"Understanding the makeup of the ISM will help us better understand the origin withstand the intense radiation and harsh environment of interstellar space.
On Earth, PAHs cause pollution and cancer.
PAHs are found in diesel exhaust, burned pots and pans, charred hamburgers and cigarette smoke.
Simulating the conditions of space, Ames scientists measured the spectra of large, carbon-bearing molecules in the ultraviolet and visible light bands and compared the spectra to astronomical data from Kitt Peak and other observatories.
The scientists simulated the space environment using extreme cold, a nearvacuum and artificial starlight.
During the next phases, scientists will continue research using a more sensitive gas-based measuring technique that almost precisely approximates interstellar conditions, Salama said.
The Astrophysikalisches Institut explored the same problem tackled by Ames' scientists by studying larger, grain-sized carbon, another type of carbon material produced by stars.
"I'm a big fan of science collaboration," said Salama.
"It helps push the boundaries of science, generates new ideas and speeds the research process."
The paper explored key astrobiology issues such as how the study of cosmic carbon provides clues to the solar system's origins, how life may have been introduced to Earth and the very structure of the universe.
Stars create carbon in their interiors and release it into space, making carbon an ideal probe and tracer of the birth and death of stars and planetary systems.
Carbon could also help unlock the mysterious processes in deep interstellar space.

Center Briefs NASA technology detects natural marine oil seeps NASA is partnering with industry to identify natural marine oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, offering clues about oil deposits.
Through the commercial remote sensing program at NASA's Stennis Space Center, Stennis, MS, NASA is demonstrating practical applications of space technologies in America's marketplace.
Using remote sensors mounted on aircraft and satellites to look at the Earth's surface, scientists gather information for many uses, including roadway planning, disaster assessment, or in this case, to help identify marine oil seeps.
They occur naturally as oil migrates through cracks from deposits deep below the ocean floor and then rises to the surface, becoming oil slicks.
The seeps offer a clue to the location of underwater oil deposits.

Stardust mission set Set for launch from Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL, on Feb. 6, Stardust will be the first U.S. mission dedicated solely to a comet, and the first return of extraterrestrial material from outside the orbit of the Moon.
The primary goal of this Discovery program mission is to collect comet dust and related measurements during a planned close encounter with comet Wild 2 (pronounced "Vilt-2") in January 2004.
The Stardust spacecraft will also bring back samples of interstellar dust particles, recently discovered material streaming into the Solar System.
Ground-based analysis of these samples after their return in January 2006 should yield important insights into the evolution of the Sun and planets, and possibly into the origin of life.

ISO 9001/Astrobiology
Is Ames ready for ISO 9001 certification? --another perspective might help Mel Brooks movie fans will recall Igor greeting young Dr. Frankenstein at the train station with "walk this way."
To pass our ISO 9001 certification audit in April, it might help to "think this way" -- like an auditor! To auditors, just remember that they are all from Missouri--the Show Me State.
Ames personnel are already working on the center's audit preparation checklist--a carefully selected sample from the 160 "shalls" in the ISO 9001 international standard.
Thinking like auditors will help us get the most benefit from that audit preparation checklist.
More importantly, thinking like auditors will help us understand our own quality system.
The most fundamental thing on an auditor's mind is "objective evidence."
ISO auditors all have the same coffee mug with Say It!, Do It!, Prove It! in big red letters.
Auditors need to see tangible evidence that the quality system is more than just warm words on paper.
Auditors collect objective evidence by analyzing documented procedures, observing practices, interviewing personnel at every level and reviewing data and records.
Objective evidence is what allows an auditor to verify our conformance to each one of those 160 requirements in the ISO standard.
An inability to show evidence that our quality system is both implemented and effective will result in a finding of nonconformance.
Most auditors have technical degrees and take a very systematic approach that Ames engineers and scientists may find familiar.
Each of us can duplicate an auditor's approach.
First, look at the Ames web site at http://dqa.arc.nasa.gov/iso9000 to find the latest revision of each center, directorate, division and branch procedure that applies to your position.
If you are unsure which procedures apply, discuss them with your supervisor.
Next, an auditor would highlight the word "shall" every time it appears in a procedure.
This might produce a number of requirements like, "The project engineer shall define test requirements for each configuration."
Or, "Each researcher shall initial and date their entries in the lab log book."
An auditor will look for tangible evidence that each of these requirements has been implemented.
At this point, you can duplicate the third step an auditor would take by asking, "Can I show an example of how I have implemented this requirement?" The researcher involved with that procedure might ask, "Is the lab log book readily available, and do my entries have initials and dates?" Or if you are that project engineer, "Are my test methods documented and easily retrieved, and do they clearly identify the test requirements for every configuration?" If asked by an auditor, will you be able to show an example and describe how you implement each of the applicable "shalls" that you highlighted? This three-step approach might be called procedure-based auditing.
It is one way auditors verify that procedures comply with the standard, and that we comply with our own procedures.
This model is also good for individuals who want to better understand our quality system and get ready for the ISO certification audit by thinking like an auditor.
Another common approach that auditors use is more process oriented.
They "walk" through a process from start to finish to see how we address the common sense operating practices that have been captured as requirements in the ISO 9001 standard.
This is one way auditors can go beyond just auditing for compliance, and assess whether our processes will effectively produce quality products and services.
Managers and supervisors that have overall responsibility for individual processes may find this end-to-end process approach the best way to think like an auditor.
One way to do this is MBWA - Management By Walking Around.
Start at the start.
Walk through the process in the same way that work flows.
Talk to personnel who take in new work.
Are the requirements for new work documented and unambiguous? How well documented are changes to those requirements? How are these requirements reviewed and accepted? Once the requirements are clear, does the work just commence or is it planned first? Is the work broken down into tasks and communicated to work groups in a logical and documented manner? Once requirements are communicated, are the methods used to produce the product or service logical and appropriate? Are requirements for purchased goods sufficiently specific to ensure that you'll get what you need in order to meet final product requirements? Should the supplier be pre-qualified? What quality controls should the supplier implement? How will you verify that purchases fully meet your own requirements? When producing the product, would it be easy to use the wrong procedure, tool, measuring device, software or specification? How is the right processing sequence and method communicated? If the process doesn't operate as intended, will appropriate metrics warn you--before customer complaints are received? How easily can errors be made that might go undetected? Is it important that personnel demonstrate proficiency at a pre-determined level before being assigned? Is it reasonable to wait until the product is complete before verifying conformance to requirements, or are there logical intermediate verification points? Are all specified product requirements being verified? Are verification methods logical and documented--when, who, how, acceptance criteria? Is product integrity protected throughout all processing, verification and delivery? How are these product protection requirements defined? When complete, do your products and services rank with the best in the world-how do you know? Do your customers agree that their requirements have been met? Ultimately, for Ames to achieve certification, auditors must assess whether our quality system effectively implements the Ames quality policy.
We can maximize our success by thinking in the same way.

Turtle nebula under observation Planetary Nebula NGC 6210, (the "Turtle" nebula), taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in August 1997.
Shrouds of gas comprise the nebula; material is flung off by a dying, sunlike star, and streams out in opposite directions.
Ames scientists and collaborators from other institutions are concentrating on this object, currently studying its spectra using the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) to determine the star's temperature, density and chemical composition.
The analysis of the biogenic elements present--hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen--has important implications for astrobiology (the study of the origin and evolution of life in the universe).
NGC 6210 is about 6,600 light years from Earth in the constellation Hercules.
The nebula measures 1.6 light years from the top of the turtle shape to the tip of the bottom.

Ames' researchers support Mars robotic exploration NASA Ames researchers are playing a key role in supporting two Mars robotic exploration missions.
The Mars Polar Lander, which launched on January 3, has two Mars microprobes with advanced thermal protection systems designed, tested and manufactured at Ames.
(The Mars Microprobe mission is also called Deep Space-2, the second New Millennium deep space technology-validation mission, which is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.)
The Mars Polar Lander is part of NASA's long-term program to explore Mars using robots.
The lander will touch down on a frigid, barren steppe near the edge of Mars' south polar cap and dig for traces of water ice beneath the surface.
Equipped with a robotic arm, the lander will also carry two tiny microprobes with penetrators that will smash into the surface and test new space exploration technologies.
According to Huy Tran (Code ASM) who heads Ames' thermal protection team, the Ames-developed heat shields will protect the two probes from the very high temperatures (approaching 3200 degrees F) expected during the Mars entry with minimal recession.
The probes will impact the Martian surface with a terminal velocity of 200 millimeters per second.
As the probes smash into the Martian surface, the heat shields will shatter and allow a clean penetration into the rust-colored Martian soil.
The two probes will collect samples and do spectral analyses for water signatures.
To meet the reentry technology challenge, the Ames team developed a new heat-resistant material that can withstand high temperatures and is also thin and light.
The new material is about 1/5th the thickness of the space shuttle heat shield.
The new material is called SIRCA/SPLIT (short for "Silicone Impregnated Reusable Ceramic Ablator/Secondary Polymer Layer Infiltrated Tile.")
The heat-shield technology was developed at Ames about 1-1/2 years ago.
"The entire Ames TPS team, including project manager Dan Rasky, and the technical staff of Christine Johnson, Ming-Ta Hsu, Timothy Chen, Harry Dill and Bill Mars Vujevich, worked very hard; we took it all the way -- from concept to flight," said Tran.
The entire heat shield weighs only 368 grams, compared to older technology heat shields that typically weigh triple that amount.
Future uses of the Ames-developed material might include space commercialization, Tran said.
The Mars Microprobes will touch down on the red planet in December 1999.
"We won't know if the heat shield is successful until a signal (from the probe) comes back," said Tran.
Past work by the Ames team includes developing heat shields for the Stardust and Mars Pathfinder missions.
A science team from Ames (comprised of Drs. David Catling, Aaron Zent, Julio Magalhaes and Jeff Moersch) also will play an important role in the mission.
They will analyze the data from four water detection,
microprobe heat shield developed at Ames
soil analysis and atmospheric structure analysis experiments aboard the probes.
In addition, Dr. Zent is also a team member for a thermal evolved gas experiment on board the Mars Lander.
Ames researchers are also supporting the Mars Climate Orbiter mission, which launched on December 10, 1998.
The Orbiter will achieve a stable orbit around Mars, and then use atmospheric instruments and cameras to provide detailed information about the surface and climate of the Red Planet.
Dr. Robert Haberle is coinvestigator for an experiment that will characterize Mars' atmosphere.

Center Activities
Celebration--Black History Month As Ames prepares to celebrate Black History Month, it is important to remember that a full appreciation of the celebration requires an understanding of the social and academic climate that prevailed in the Western world, particularly in North America, before 1926 when Black History Month was established.
It is important to recall that between 1619 and 1926, African Americans and other peoples of African descent were classified as a race that had not made any contribution to human civilization.
Within the public and private sector, African Americans and other peoples of African descent were relegated to the position of non-citizens and often defined as fractions of humans.
In fact, African Americans were so dehumanized and their history so distorted in academia that "slavery, peonage, segregation and lynching" were considered justifiable conditions.
It was this kind of climate and the sensational, racist scholarship that inspired the talented and brilliant African American scholar Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson to lead the struggle and search for the truth and institutionalize what was referred to as "Negro History Week."
Under Woodson's direction and contributions from other African American and white scholars, the "Negro History Week" was launched as a serious platform in 1926 to neutralize the apparent ignorance and deliberate distortion of black history.
Meetings, exhibitions, lectures and symposia were organized to climax the scientific study of the African experience throughout the year in order to give a more objective and scholarly balance in American and World History.
Today, this national and international observance has been expanded annually to encompass the entire month of February.
For those wishing to learn more about African history, it is suggested that you read works by distinguished African historians, such as: Cheikh Anta Diop, Chancellor Williams, Walter Rodney, Adu Boahen, John Jackson, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, John Hope Franklin, Leronne Bennett Jr., John Henrik Clarke, J. F. Ade Ajayi and many more.

The first flight occurred Agility Research Aircraft to NASA Dryden on May 17, 1997; the final flight took place Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA, for on Nov. 12, 1997 and lasted 34 minutes.
future flight tests.
The X-36 flew a total of 15 hours and 38 NASA completed its X-36 flight research minutes and used four different versions of program last November, successfully demonstrating the feasibility of future tailless fighters to achieve agility levels superior to today's best military fighter aircraft.
The Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton OH, was scheduled to begin its Reconfigurable Control for Tailless Fighter Aircraft (RESTORE) flight tests on the X-36 at Dryden on Dec. 12.
The RESTORE program will use advanced flight control software to respond to a variety of battle damage and hardware failures.
The program will provide demonstrated technology that increases aircraft From right to left: Ames Center Director Dr. Henry survivability and significantly reMcDonald and Kevin Petersen (Acting) Director, Dryden duces life cycle costs of military and Flight Research Center, signed an agreement last month commercial aircraft.

It is powered by a Williams International Corp., Inc., Walled Lake, MI, F112 turbofan engine that provides 700 pounds of thrust.
The aircraft is remotely controlled by a pilot in a groundstation cockpit, complete with a head-up display.
Ames and The Boeing Company Phantom Works developed the technologies required for a tailless fighter beginning in 1989.
In 1993, the Phantom Works proposed the remotely piloted aircraft technology demonstration to validate the technologies in a real-flight environment.
In 1994, Phantom Works began fabrication of the two aircraft in its rapid prototyping facility in St. Louis.
The aircraft was designed and built in only 28 months.
NASA and Boeing were full partners in the $21 million program that was jointly funded under a roughly 50/50 cost-sharing arrangement.
During NASA's X-36 flight tests, Ames led the program; Boeing conducted the flight test operation; and Dryden provided range and technical support.
