(03/73) EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP - The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers today announced that the Broad Thorofare section of the Intracoastal Waterway - closed for more than a decade due to shoaling, will be dredged to provide access and safe passage for commercial and recreational vessels.
"The Broad Thorofare project - long overdue - will reopen this important artery for thousands of New Jersey boaters and highlight the importance of clean, open waterways for the many residents and transient boaters who contribute to our shore economies," said DEP Commissioner Bradley Campbell.
"I am especially grateful to Congressman LoBiondo for fighting for federal funding to match the state share for this and other projects."
"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is very happy to be a partner in this project to open this portion of the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway Federal navigation project to commercial and recreational vessels," said the Army Corps Philadelphia District Commander Thomas C. Chapman.
"The boating public will definitely benefit from this combined federal/state effort."
As part of the Broad Thorofare project, approximately two and one-quarter miles of sediments (estimated to be between 40,000 to 80,000 cubic yards of sand) will be dredged along the Intracoastal Waterway - west of Longport and north of Ocean City in Atlantic County.
Through an agreement between the DEP and the state Department of Transportation, approximately $75,000 from the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund is available for the placement of the dredged sediments.
The actual dredging activities are funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which was appropriated $500,000 for maintenance dredging in New Jersey.
Dredging of the Broad Thorofare will begin in July.
Recognizing that shore tourism contributes more than half of the $31 billion in tourism expenditures in New Jersey, Nancy J. Byrne, executive director of the NJ Office of Travel and Tourism, applauded state and federal efforts to move the dredging project forward.
"One of the many reasons for the great appeal of the New Jersey coast is the tremendous diversity of our shoreline," said Byrne.
"We are delighted to work with the DEP, the federal government, and organizations like the Marine Trades Association to increase awareness and expand boating and marine opportunities for visitors and residents alike."
For nearly a decade, Broad Thorofare remained closed to recreational and commercial vessel access by order of the U.S. Coast Guard and was last dredged in 1982.
The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway is a navigable interconnected thread of passages running 1,500 miles between the mainland and offshore islands, along rivers, through lakes, lagoons, bays and canals, from the tip of Florida to Maine.
