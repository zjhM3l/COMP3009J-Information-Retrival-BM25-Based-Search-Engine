Section 232A--Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain
Geomorphology.
This Section is in the Coastal Plains geomorphic Province.
The predominant landform consists of a flat, weakly dissected alluvial plain formed by deposition of continental sediments onto submerged, shallow continental shelf, which was later exposed by sea level subsidence.
Along the coast, fluvial deposition and shore zone processes are active in developing and maintaining beaches, swamps, and mud flats.
Landforms on about 50 percent of this Section consist of flat plains.
Much of the other landforms are irregular plains.
Elevation ranges from 0 to 80 ft (0 to 25 m).
Local relief ranges from 10 to 20 ft (3 to 6 m) on flat plains and from 20 to 40 ft (6 to 12 m) on the irregular plains.

Rocks in this Section formed during the Cenozoic Era.
Strata consist of Quaternary marine deposits (shales and sands).
Small areas of Tertiary marine deposits (silts and clays) are exposed along some larger rivers.

Surface Water Characteristics.
This area has a moderate density of small to medium size perennial streams and a low density of associated rivers, most with moderate volume of water flowing at very low velocity.
Water table is high in many areas, resulting in poor natural drainage and abundance of wetlands.
A poorly defined drainage pattern has developed on this relatively young plain.
