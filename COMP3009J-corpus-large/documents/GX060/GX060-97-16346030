Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) offer residents a variety of services ranging from independent living in a cottage setting to skilled nursing care.
CCRCs are designed to promote wellness, independence and socialization in a residential environment.
CCRCs offer a wide variety of services.
These services may be all-inclusive, modified to meet the needs of the resident, or may be offered in a fee-for-service arrangement where the resident pays for each service they choose to receive.
CCRCs should not be confused with retirement communities that offer limited services but do not offer life care contracts.
Services at CCRCs vary greatly, so you should contact any communities you are considering to get more information.
For more information on CCRCs and other long-term care options, visit our Publications page and look under the subject headings "Continuing Care Retirement Communities" or "Long-Term Care".
You can also contact us for more information or assistance.
