National Park Service Sites
The National Park Service operates three historic sites in the 12th District and a fourth in Fayette County just outside the District: Allegheny-Portage Railroad National Historic Site was an engineering marvel that opened Pittsburgh and the entire Ohio River Valley for development as the "mountain" link in the Pennsylvania Canal.
The site was expanded in 2001 with the opening of the oldest railroad tunnel in America, the Staple Bend Tunnel.
Johnstown Flood National Memorial tells the story of the worst man-made disaster in U.S. history; other key flood sites are the nearby St. Michael National Historic District with the Clubhouse and Cottages of wealthy industrialists who owned the dam that collapsed, and the Johnstown Flood Museum in downtown Johnstown.
Fort Necessity National Battlefield was the site of George Washington's first battle as a commander and opened the French and Indian War; the site also features the fully restored Washington Tavern, an early 1800s establishment on the National Road (see National Road State Heritage Park below).
The site will expand in 2002 with a new Joint Interpretive 
Friendship Hill National Historic Site was the home of Altert Gallatin, first Secretary of the Treasury under President Thomas Jefferson; Gallatin developed a long-term debt-reduction plan, financed the Louisiana Purchase, and convinced the nation to use tax dollars for road construction (see National Road State Heritage Park below).

* National Road State Heritage Park links sites along the first "highway" build after a major national debate about whether highways had national significance and therefore deserved national support -- or should be left to local communities to finance.
The roadway improved on the Path George Washington had used and the corridor is rich in sites of significance in every era ranging from original tollhouses at Addison and Searights, to "motor touring" era of the 1950s.
* Allegheny Ridge State Heritage Park presents the challenges our young nation faced in "conquering" the first major physical hurdle in our western expansion -- the nearly 3,000-foot-high Allegheny Ridge.
Key sites include the still-used Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark, which enabled trains to cross the mountains, and other railroad, canal, steelmaking and coal sites.
* Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor showcase the scenic, cultural and historic resources along the nation's first cross-country highway, better known as today as Route 30, which developed from a Native American path to become part of teh nation's first coast-to-coast highway.
It links the historic Greensburg Train Station, Fort Ligonier and various other historic sights, as well as lots of antique shops and runs parallel to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Fallingwater
Fallingwater, Kentuck Knob
Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, now with this official home page, has won all sorts of accolades, including being named "The best all-time work of American architecture" in a 1991 poll of members of the American Institute of Architects.
Fallingwater is the quintessential example of Wright's ability to make a structure blend in with the natural environment! Open for tours from Arpil through mid-November every day except Mondays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Phone 724-329-8501.
Fallingwater is owned by the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy.
Congressman Murtha has helped to deliver more than $1 million for badly needed repairs and improvements at the site (see news story or search this site from the Sitemap).
Kentuck Knob or the I.N. and Bernardine Hagan House, another Frank Lloyd Wright house about 10 miles from Fallingwater, opened for tours in 1996.
In May 2000, the site was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of Interior.
It was designed in 1953 for the I.N. Hagan family of Uniontown.
The site represents a refinement of many principles of organic architecture explored by Mr. Wright.
It is open to tours on Tuesdays through Sundays, Spring, Summer and Fall, and by reservation only, weather permitting, in winter.
Reservations are required for all tours: 724-329-1901.
Because there is such strong interest in Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob, we have added these links to resources on the Web for anyone interested in learning more about these site or about the mastermind behind them, Frank Lloyd Wright.
As of this posting, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy has not established a Fallingwater site.
