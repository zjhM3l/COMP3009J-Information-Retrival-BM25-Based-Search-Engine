Seventh Grade
Unit 3: Ratio, Proportion, and Percent
Abstract
In this unit students learn to reason proportionally.
Proportional reasoning provides an underpinning for the study of algebra in future years.
Students learn to think in relative amounts as expressed by ratios and rates (e.g., 15 miles/gallon, 4/3).
When students perceive relationships involving growth, unit costs, etc., they are thinking proportionally.
They learn how to apply ratio and proportion to many daily activities such as sales tax, the relationship between hours worked and earned income, actual distances between cities compared to map distances, and unit pricing at grocery stores.
Percents are studied as ratios in which the divisor is 100, and students apply percent in many practical situations.
Unit Title: Ratio, Proportion, and Percent
Grade Level/Course Title: Seventh Grade/Mathematics
Focus Questions:
1.
What is proportional reasoning and how do we use it?
2.
Do you need one hundred things to use percent?
3.
How can proportional relationships be represented using tables, graphs, and algebraic equations?

Benchmarks
Students will: * express numerical comparisons as ratios, rates, and percents (IV.3.MS.2). * apply understanding of ratio, rates, and proportion in solving problems (IV.3.MS.5). * solve linear equations based upon ratios and rates (V.2.MS.1). * explore everyday uses of ratios and proportions using a graphing calculator (V.2.MS.5).

Assessment Tasks
1.
Given a collection of comparisons expressed as rates, (e.g., $5/3 pounds; 22 miles/gallon; 150 km/1.5 hours) determine the ratios (IV.3.MS.2).
2.
Given a table involving a number of proportions with either the percentage or the actual number of items omitted, determine the missing numbers (IV.3.MS.2, IV.3.MS.5).
3.
Given physiological information such as "The length of one's digestive system is approximately three times one's height," create a table of class members showing their heights and respective digestive tract lengths (IV.3.MS.2, V.2.MS.1).
4.
Given a dosage/weight formula for medicine and using a graphing calculator, create an appropriate list for the students in the class (IV.3.MS.2, V.2.MS.1, V.2.MS.5).

Connections
Arts
Students can apply ratios and proportions to concepts of scale as used in visual arts.
Social Studies
Students apply their understanding of percents to many social variables, e.g., voter turnout, population distribution, or unemployment rate.
Students apply their understanding of ratio when making comparisons, e.g., legislative representation, determining unit prices, or interpreting map scales.
