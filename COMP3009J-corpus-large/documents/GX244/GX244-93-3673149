Introductions
Carol Benner, Director of the Office of Health Care Quality at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, called the meeting to order at approximately 9:00 AM.
Ms. Benner thanked those present for their interest in Maryland's assisted living program and asked that all Advisory Workgroup members and stakeholders introduce themselves and note what organization they represent.
Ms. Benner relayed that there are many misconceptions and rumors circulating in the assisted living community about the activities of the Assisted Living Advisory Workgroup.
She reminded the members of the workgroup and those stakeholders present that the Assisted Living Advisory Workgroup is not required by law.
The Department put the workgroup together to assist it in its review of Maryland's assisted living program.
This is an open and inclusive process.
She encouraged members and stakeholders to access the Advisory Workgroup's web site for correct information.
It is important to note that there have been no conclusions drawn from the activities of the Advisory Workgroup nor are any there state plans or recommendations that have been developed to revise the assisted living regulations.
Consensus statements are still in the process of being developed and are a reflection of the consensus of the majority present, Advisory Workgroup members and stakeholders alike, at the meetings.
Moreover, these statements are reviewed at each meeting to enhance the consensus building process.
Attention was called to the fact that the consensus statements that have been developed thus far are no where as stringent as those recommended in the National Assisted Living Workgroup report.
That report, which was requested by the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, was intended to be used by policymakers at the federal and state levels guide their policy making for assisted living.
Izzy Firth, President of Mid-Atlantic Life Span, stated for the record that the Association can not endorse or take part in consensus building process as the Association is still developing its position on these issues.
Class "A" Provider Sub-Workgroup
The Class "A" Provider Sub-Workgroup meeting was called to order at approximately 9:00 AM.
Consensus Statement: Maryland needs to strengthen the regulatory structure for "large" providers by increasing oversight and accountability.
It was the consensus of the sub-workgroup that the term "large" should be replaced with the term Class "A" provider.
A Class "A" Provider would be defined as an assisted living program that operates an assisted living facility with a total number of beds equal to or greater than 17 beds.
The program requirements for Class "A" providers would include full licensure, annual inspection surveys, and complaint investigations.
Consensus Statement: Maryland should require awake overnight staff in programs operated by Class "A" Providers.
A research program coordinator with the Division of Geriatric and Neuropsychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University presented unpublished findings from a cross-sectional study of randomly selected small and large assisted living programs in Maryland.
The rationale for the study was that there is little known about the clinical characteristics of residents in assisted living facilities.
The results of the study were startling; approximately 50 percent of those diagnosed with dementia did not receive necessary care.
Consensus Statement: Maryland does not need to strengthen or increase documentation and service plan requirements for Class "A" Providers.
It was the consensus of the sub-workgroup that the current regulations provide sufficient guidance to providers and protection for residents.
Consensus Statement: Maryland should require that there be some type of stable, consistent, on-site licensed nursing oversight that is different from the role of the delegating nurse.
It was the consensus of the sub-workgroup that the on-site licensed nurse would work in a team relationship with the delegating nurse.
It was also the consensus of the sub-workgroup that the following staffing requirements should be required for Class "A" Providers:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 17 to 25 Beds - An on-site licensed nurse is required for at least 20-hours a week and should be available on an on-call basis;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 26 to 49 Beds - An on-site licensed nurse is required for at least 40-hours a week and should be available on an on-call basis; and
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 50 to 100+ Beds - An on-site licensed nurse is required seven days a week, for at least eight hours a day and should be available on an on-call basis.
Consensus Statement: Maryland needs to require that Assisted Living Program Managers of Class "A" Providers be certified by an appropriately represented licensing board.
It was the consensus of the sub-workgroup that a regulatory board, with appropriate representation, be given the statutory authority to develop, control and enforce examination, education, and practice standards for assisted living program managers.
The regulatory board would certify, monitor and discipline assisted living program managers and have the ability to remove certification from those program managers whom it determines are bad actors.
The regulatory board would also develop curriculum requirements and approve organizations to provide assisted living program manager training.
The sub-workgroup also recommended that the minimum requirements for assisted living program managers include possession of a high school diploma and being at least 21 years of age.
Consensus Statement: Maryland needs to require those programs, which hold themselves out as having Special Care Units, notify and submit for approval to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene a plan that includes, at a minimum the following information: description and scope of services provided; how the services will be provided; security considerations; training requirements,; activities/recreation; safety precautions; staffing; and, medication administration.
Consensus Statement: Maryland needs to create a separate licensure category for multiple (chain) assisted living programs and programs that operate multiple sites on one campus.
The sub-workgroup discussed the issue of multi (chain) assisted living programs and those programs that have multiple sites on one campus.
The consensus of the sub-workgroup was that a Class "B" Provider license be established to capture these entities.
However, the issue of how to effectively manage this licensure category is problematic.
An idea that was raised for consideration was modifying the model currently used for programs for the developmental disabled by licensing these multiple programs through the agency concept.
There needs to be an advantage to converting the current single operator based license to the agency concept license.
Possible advantages discussed may include: economies of scale for staffing, requirements pertaining to program managers, etc.
The sub-workgroup will discuss these concepts in more detail at its next meeting.
Full Advisory Workgroup Meeting
The meeting of the full Assisted Living Advisory Workgroup was called to order at approximately 10:00 AM and the meeting agenda was reviewed.
Lynne Condon, Education and Training Supervisor at the Office of Health Care Quality, provided a presentation on the activities of the Assessment Tool Sub-Workgroup.
Ms. Condon reported that the sub-workgroup is comprised of members who are large, small and mid size providers, medical persons such as a physician and delegating nurse, representatives from the state and mental hygiene.
The members include Crystal Green, Valerie Richardson, Dr. A. Baker, Barbara Newman, Darlene Fabrizio, Wesley Malin, Johnnie Love, Paula Carder, Marie Ickrath, and Karin Lakin.
The sub-workgroup has met three times to discuss issues relating to the scoring for the level two residents and to review the assessment tool for areas that may require revision and/or clarification to enhance the tool's accuracy.
The problems with the present scoring range being too broad may be attributed to the following reasons: the wide range allows for heavy care residents to be scored as level two; majority of level two residents start scoring at around 35 points or above.
The current scoring range does not adequately capture: (i) the behaviors that would require greater need for attention by the assisted living program manager and/or staff to manage (e.g. combativeness, biting, kicking, starting fires, disrobing or defecating in public, etc.); (ii) the increased physical dependencies that when linked with a behavior presents care/staffing issues (e.g. any of the above with medical complexity such as bed sores, renal dialysis, seizures, oxygen, post surgical wounds).
It was the consensus of the sub-workgroup, upon review and discussion with unanimous vote, that the scoring of the level two resident should be changed to 26-50 points.
Consensus Statement: The assessment scoring for level two residents should be changed to 26 to 50 points.
The sub-workgroup still have the remaining issues to discuss: language revision in the assisted living manager portion of the assessment tool; necessary changes to the scoring guide; possible scoring for impact on level 3+ ; when are the 3+ residents candidates for nursing home placement; what the scoring will be for the 3+ resident if scoring is to drive placement; and, arrangements for testing of the revised assessment and scoring tool for reliability.
Discussion - Medication Administration: The full workgroup discussed the issue of medication administration and the findings of the University of Maryland study that was presented at the last Advisory Workgroup meeting.
The workgroup came to consensus that there exists a problem with medication administration in assisted living facilities in Maryland.
Consensus Statement: There exists medication administration problems in Maryland assisted living facilities.
The following problems with medication administration were noted: safety, training, quality control, packaging, storage, choice, reimbursement, lack of knowledge, samples, cost, administration, communication, lack of system, etc.
The workgroup will discuss these and other issues related medication administration in more detail at its next meeting.
