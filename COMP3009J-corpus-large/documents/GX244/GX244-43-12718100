For the purposes of the Coastal Zone Management Program, St. James Parish has been divided into seven management units by the CZMAC (see Map 2.11.
Additionally, the CZMAC reviewed and described each management unit as delineated on the Coastal Resource Maps for the parish.
Each unit is described according to information gathered from three primary sources: (1) Coastal Resources Maps and U.S.G.S.
Topographic Maps; (2) St. James Parish CZMAC Members; and, (3) studies undertaken by Burk and Associates for the State Coastal Resources Program.
Other sources, as referenced, were also used.
Maps of the individual management units follow Map 2.1.
In assessing the St. James Parish management units, two general environmental categories were developed: alluvial ridge units and swamp units.
While differing in specific details, units exhibit similar characteristics within each category.
St. James' seven study units can be placed in either of these categories , as listed below.
Alluvial Ridge Units Swamp Units * Donaldsonville * Edgard * Gramercy
* Bayou Citamon Wetland * Johnson Island Wetland * Blind River * Maurepas
Alluvial ridge units are those lands located on the natural levees of the Mississippi River.
These are prime agriculture lands and also prime development lands.
In general, the soils are good.
Elevations along the river reach up to 20 feet MSL.
Drainage is away from the river and adequate.
Some localized swamps and marsh areas do, however exist on the alluvial ridges.
The swamp units are the interdistributary drainage basins, or back swamps, sloping away from the natural levees.
Swamps are generally of the cypress tupelo-gum type, grading into marshes that surround Lac Des Allemands and Lake Maurepas in St. John the Baptist Parish.
Problems inherent in each unit were delineated by the CZMAC.
Problems of management units are also characteristic of their respective environmental units (i.e., alluvial ridge or swamp).
Table 2.1 illustrates the relationship between management units and environmental units.
Problems common to each unit are also shown.
These problems are rated as slight, moderate, or severe, according to information in the management unit descriptions.
Both the alluvial ridge and the swamp units show distinct environmental characteristics, making an easily defined boundary for management of coastal problems.
The following are the seven management units in St. James Parish.
1.
Bayou Citamon Swamp 2.
Johnson Island Wetland 3.
Donaldsonville 4.
Edgard 5.
Gramercy 6.
Maurepas 7.
Blind River
Descriptions of each management unit are presented in Section 2.2, which follows Table 2.1.
2.2 MANAGEMENT UNIT DESCRIPTIONS 2.2.1 Bayou Citamon Wetland [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: The soils Of this management unit are almost entirely of the Barbary-Sharkey association.
These are very poorly drained, low lying soils with one (1) to five (5) feet MSL elevations.
Typical soils of this type are gray clays underlain by grayish-brown mulch and greenish-gray, semifluid clay.
Frequent flooding, high shrink/swell potential and subsidence potential place very severe limitations on this type of soil for any type of development (agricultural, residential, urban, transportation) (U.S. Dept.
Of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1973).
VEGETATION: Swamp vegetation is characterized by dominant trees of bald cypress, tupelo-gum, drummond, red maple, water ash and pumpkin ash.
Understory vegetation is typically a floating mat of water hyacinth or duckweed.
Dense tree growth allows for very little light penetration, thus affording growth for only a small number of floor species.
Vines, such as poison ivy, evening trumpet flower, greenbriar, Silva manse, and Ampelopsis cordata are the most common vegetation types found.
Epiphytes, especially Spanish moss, are also abundant in the swamp (LOOP, Inc., no date, Volume 3:VI. 3-4).
Drainage is the most important factor influencing swamp growth.
Cypress and tupelo-gum are found in the poorer drained areas while dense hardwood stands characterize the better drained land (LOOP, Inc., no date, Vol. 3:VI. 3-3).
LOOP, Inc. (no date, Vol. 13-VI. 3-54), studied two sampling areas along Bayou Chevreuil and compared the biomass (total vegetation covering) of a flooded and an unflooded swamp area.
Table 2.2 shows the Findings.
Their study shows the overall biomass is nearly doubled by the presence of greater swamp tree growth in the flooded sample.
Studies show drainage of swamp forests lead to reduction of 40 percent of their original productivity (LOOP, Inc., no date, Vol.
I:3-12).
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: The entire management unit has a moderate subsidence potential (3 to 16 inches) if drained.
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Medium (in a high medium-low range) susceptibility to continuous land loss if channelized.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: The Bayou Citamon Wetland is a large area of semi-natural, relatively unaltered, cypress-tupelo-gum swamp in both Lafourche and St. James Parishes.
Bayou Citamon crosses the central area of the unit from Bayou Verret and Baker Canal East in Assumption Parish to Bayou Chevreuil in St. James.
Several large canals and bayous drain into Bayous Citamon and Chevreuil (St. James Canal, Bayou Pirogue, Bayou Onion, canal linking Grand Bayou).
Elevations in the management unit are generally less than one (1) foot MSL Spoil banks along canals in the Burton Gas Field are eight (8) feet MSL Along LA 20, elevations are generally five (5) feet MSL Several roads lead off of LA 20 to oil and gas wells.
These are built up to five (5) feet above the surrounding swamp.
At least One major pipeline crosses the unit from the Southern Pacific Railroad line in Lafourche Parish to the Mississippi River west of St. James Parish.

The Bayou Citamon-Chevreuil system is the major drainage system of the swamp extending between the Bayou Lafourche and the Mississippi River natural levee.
The land is the interdistributary basin, the drainage basin, for the two major waterways.
An abandoned aqueduct 0.2 extends in a straight line from Bayou Lafourche at Thibodaux to near Lagan at the Mississippi River.
The aqueduct is elevated between St. James Canal and Bayou Onion.
FLOODING POTENTIAL: The entire area is flood prone.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: None
USE OF LAND: The land is relatively unaltered swampland.
Some major pipelines, a road (LA 20) and communication lines cross the management unit.
Recreational uses (hunting, fishing) and wildlife habitats predominate.
The LOOP pipeline system from the Onshore Terminal to the St. James Cap line crosses the Bayou Citamon Swamp.
Construction of a pipeline extending from the Weeks Island salt Done to the St. James Terminal has been approved as part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program.
The 36-inch oil pipeline crosses the Bayou Citamon Wetland from the St. James Terminal to Pierre Part in Assumption Parish and then continues across the Atchafalaya Floodway.
In St. James Parish, the line cuts across Bayou Verret and St. James Parish Canal (U.S. Department of the Army, 1977).
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: A. Geological Features: None.
B. Zoological Features: None.
C. Botanical Features: The Bayou Citamon Wetland (approximately 3,693 acres) is an excellent example of a typical interdistributary (the basin between two large waterways, i.e., the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche) swamp forest.
Bayou banks are lined with hardwoods, such as oak, that grade into the swamp.
Characteristic swamp trees are cypress and tupelogum.
The swamp is semi-natural and has both recreational and scenic value (Burk and Associates, 1977:27).
As part of the Lac Des Allemands drainage system, LOOP, Inc. (no date: Vol.
I:3-13) found that 19.8 million pounds of organic carbon are transported through Bayou Chevreuil annually.
Figure 2.1 lists organisms of special interest or economic significance to man typically found in the area including Bayou Citamon Wetland.
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: The swamp is an excellent recreational area for hunting and fishing.
The cost of developing such land make it better suited for recreation, scenic value and wildlife habitats.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: The southwestern (in Lafourche Parish) portion of the unit has little or no potable water, grading into fresher deposits to the northeast in St. James Parish, at a depth of 300 feet.
Primary contact recreation in the area requires a high bacteria standard (not to exceed a fecal coliform log mean of 200/100 ml. of water).
FIGURE 2.1 ORGANISMS OF INTEREST OR ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE TO MAN IN THE LAC DES ALLEMANDS SWAMP FOREST SYSTEM
Bald Cypress: This tree is extremely valuable as timber due to its decay resistance and its very slow growth rate; it is also valued for its esthetic beauty.
Tupelo-Gum: This tree grows faster than cypress and makes good timber since it is generally tall and straight.
Crawfish: The crawfish is harvested in quantity in the swamp forest area and is commercially important as a food item.
Pest Insects: Of direct importance to man are the blood-sucking insects, mostly members of the order Diptera (true flies).
These insects often have an aquatic stage in their life cycle and occur locally in all wetland areas from the swamp forest to the salt marsh.
Various mosquitoes, gnats, green head flies, etc. attack both men and his domestic animals.
The forest tent caterpillar, which affects the tupelo-gum and other trees used by man, also qualifies as a pest species.
Catfish: Although several species of catfish are harvested from waterbodies in the swamp forest and fresh marsh areas, the blue catfish and channel catfish are probably most important.
Other Finfish: Miscellaneous fish also harvested in swamp forest waterbodies include largemouth bass, bluegills, black crappies, and bowfin.
Alligators: The alligator, which has been considered rare and endangered until recently because of over harvesting by man, has made a comeback, and is now harvested annually under the supervision of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
Mammals: Swamp rabbits, deer, raccoons, and nutria are all hunted or trapped to some extent in the swamp forest study area.
Osprey: Fish hawks, which are rare in Louisiana and have been seen in the swamp forest area, probably occur to some extent across the entire study transect.
These birds are on the "blue list" of declining species of birds.
Red Shouldered Hawk: This bird is included on the "blue list" of declining species.
It has been seen in the study area.
SOURCE: LOOP, 1nc.; no date, Vol.
I: 3-13 to 3-14.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL: No known archaeological, historic or cultural sites are listed for this management unit.
However, according to members of the CZMAC, it is believed that ruins of a settlement do exist in the Bayou Citamon Swamp behind the community of St. James.
PROBLEMS: 1.
Flooding hazard due to low elevations, poor permeability of soils, and poor drainage through the Bayou Citamon-Chevreuil systems.
2.
Subsidence potential if drained (3 to 16 inches).
3.
Land loss potential if channeled.
4.
Possible loss of primary contact recreation, and wildlife and fish habitats due to pollution in runoff water and to drainage of swamp floor.
5.
Possibility of loss of a mayor watershed and natural drainage collection system if the land becomes too channelized, drained, leveed, populated or lumbered.
6.
Overgrowth of swamp floor by water hyacinth and duckweed.
2.2.2 Johnson Island Wetland [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: Barbary-Sharkey association soils composed of frequently flooded clayey soils.
Semifluid clay and soft muck underlay slowly permeable and poorly drained clays.
Soils are not suitable for cultivation or urbanization.
VEGETATION: Cypress-tupelo-gum swamps.
Predominate hardwoods include bald cypress, water tupelo and red maple.
Understory with a floating mat of water hyacinth or duckweed and scattered shrubs.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: Moderate (3 to 16 inches).
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Medium, moderately susceptible soils.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: Johnson Island Wetland is part of a large management unit that covers Lafourche, St. James, St. John the Baptist and St. Charles Parishes.
The focal point of the unit is Lac Des Allemands.
St. James Parish contains a small portion of the unit bounded by Vacherie Canal.
The parish also has the only road leading to Lac Des Allemands: LA 643 through Lower Vacherie.
FLOODING POTENTIAL: The entire management unit is flood prone.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: None.
USE OF LAND: That portion of the Johnson Island Wetland in St. James Parish is essentially swampland, somewhat altered by the presence of drainage canals.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: None.
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: Hunting and fishing are excellent throughout Johnson Island Wetland.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: Freshwater grades down to 300 feet.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL: None.
PROBLEMS: 1.
Flooding associated with runoff and drainage is the major problem in the St. James portion of Johnson Island Wetland.
2.
Subsidence and loss of land if drained and channeled.
2.2.3 Donaldsonville [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: Levee and batture soils are of the Convent-Silty-Alluvial land association.
This association is comprised of recently deposited sediments of the Mississippi River.
Soils are silty loams and sandy loams, generally poorly drained and moderately permeable.
Soils are very fertile and scrub hardwood forest grows on most of the batture.
Some of the higher land is used for pasture.
Commerce-Sharkey association are loamy and clayey soils found on the Mississippi River's natural levees.
Soils are generally poorly drained with very slow permeability.
Surface drainage is necessary for optimum cultivation.
Limitations for urban, industrial and recreation uses are related to wetness, high Shrink/swell potential and poor trafficability.
Some Sharkey association soils are found adjacent to the river, but most are found behind Commerce-Sharkey association soils grading down to the swamplands.
Sharkey soils are dark-grey clays underlain by gray clay mottled with shades of brown.
The soils are very slowly permeable and poorly drained.
Surface drainage is necessary for optimal cultivation.
Limitations for most urban, industrial and recreational uses are due to wetness, high shrink/swell potential and poor trafficability.
VEGETATION: The natural vegetation of the unit is mixed hardwood forest, including dominant trees such as live oak, water oak, pecan, sycamore, hickory, cottonwood, hackberry, elm and locust.
However, most of the hardwood forests have been cleared for agriculture.
Some forests are found on the edges of the levee, grading into swamplands, and on the batture.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: Generally, none.
Most of the soils have no organic layers susceptible to shrinkage.
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Low, slightly susceptible to gradual, continuous land loss.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: The management unit consists of the land from the Mississippi River to the backswamp.
Elevations range from 20feet MSL along LA 18 to below the 5 foot contour grading into the swamp.
The Mississippi River flood protection levee, maintained by the Lafourche Levee District to a height of at least 30 feet, follows LA 18.
On the other side of the built-up levee, elevations grade down to river level.
Agricultural and domestic drainage canals run from the land along the Mississippi River to St. James Canal and Dredge boat Canal.
Other than LA 18, the only major transportation arteries to cross the unit are LA 20 through Vacherie and the Texas and Pacific Railroad line.
The largest community in this management unit (other than Vacherie) is St. James.
An aqueduct crosses the unit from the Mississippi River near Lagan to near Chackbay in Lafourche Parish.
A small landing strip is found near Bon Secours (Graugnard's) Plantation.
Four oil and gas fields are found in the unit: Vacherie Oil and Gas Field, Hestor Oil and Gas Field, St. James College Oil and Gas Field, and Lapice Oil Field.
One major pipeline presently crosses the lower part of the unit.
The St. James pipeline for the LOOP facility crosses the Bayou Citamon and Donaldsonville management units, terminating at the Shell Capline.
FLOODING POTENTIAL: None.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: All land in the management unit is considered prime farmland.
Such land is the top quality land available for producing food, feed, fiber, forage and oilseed crops after necessary clearing, drainage and plowing.
USE OF LAND: The land is primarily devoted to sugarcane farming, with some minor soybean and vegetable crops (cabbage, peppers, shallots, beans, tomatoes and similar truck crops).
Small areas of the old plantations have been subdivided for residential use.
All development is in strips along LA 18 or LA 20.
Some industrial activity is clustered near the Sunshine Bridge.
The Port of St. James is located at the Shell Capline Terminal.
The area around St. James Community is expected to continue to grow as commercial and industrial development continues along the new Sunshine Bridge Highwaythat crosses Ascension and St. James Parishes.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: A. Geological Features: None.
B. Zoological Features: None C. Botanical Features: (1) Unique Botanical Specimens or Communities: Oak Alley: famous row of oaks
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: Recreation in the Donaldsonville management unit is associated with miscellaneous facilities such as tennis courts, community facilities and community parks.
Major recreation is also associated with scenic driving.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: Subsurface freshwater deposits grade down to depths of 300 to 600 feet.
Soft ground water is found around the old Welcome Community and artesian wells can be drilled.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL:
A. Historic Sites: St. James Parish has many old plantation and church sites of both historic and cultural significance.
1.
Felicity Plantation, 1.5 miles west of Vacherie on LA 18.
2.
Armant Plantation, above Vacherie on LA 18.
3.
Valcour Aime Plantation, 2.5 miles west of Vacherie on LA 18.

B. Cultural: The land between Vacherie and Donaldsonville has historically been agricultural land.
The area has been settled since the early development of New Orleans by French, Spanish and Acadian settlers.
Originally large plantations covered the land with settlements growing up around the plantations. railway and river access.
C. Archaeological: Two known archaeological sites are found in the Donaldsonville management unit.
(1) SJ 2 Plantation Mill (2) SJ 3 Plantation Mill Figure 2.2 lists all archaeological sites known in the parish.
PROBLEMS: 1.
Stress on prime agricultural lands due to expanding residential, commercial and industrial development.
2.
Runoff from agricultural lands into the backswamps.
2.2.4 Edgard [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: Along LA 20 between Lower Vacherie and Vacherie is a narrow ridge of Convent - Commerce - Sharkey association loamy and clayey soils.
These soils are generally level, with a gradient of less than 1 percent.
Main limitations of Convent and Commerce soils are wetness and poor tilth, but they are suitable for most urban, recreational and industrial uses.
Sharkey soils are poorly drained clays with very slow permeability.
Limitations, for most urban and industrial uses are due to wetness, high shrink/swell potential and poor trafficability.

Commerce - Sharkey association soils are nearly level, loamy and clayey soils.
Commerce and Sharkey soils are suitable for agriculture.
The major limitation is wetness.
Surface drainage is necessary for optimal growth.
Commerce -Sharkey association soils are found in the management unit along the Mississippi River and along LA 20 next to the Convent-Commerce -Sharkey soil ridge.
Between the swamplands of the Johnson Island Wetland and the natural levee soils along the Mississippi River is a broad strip of clayey soils of the Sharkey association.
These soils are poorly drained and very slowly permeable.
Sharkey soils are suitable for agriculture with the use of proper surface drainage, but are limited for urban and recreational uses due to wetness, high shrink/swell potential and poor trafficability.
Slow permeability in all of the above soils limits their use for septic tank filter fields.
VEGETATION: Natural vegetation of the management unit ordinally was mixed hardwood forest.
Most of the area has now been cleared and is devoted to agriculture, particularly sugarcane.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: The entire management unit has an extremely low subsidence potential.
Sharkey soils on the levee swamp margin are a bit more susceptible to subsidence as a result of drainage than the other two soil associations.
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Low throughout the management unit, with the exception of Sharkey association soils which have a moderate land loss potential
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: The management unit is characterized by agriculture i.e., sugarcane fields.
Highway LA 20 forms the western boundary of the unit.
Most land along the highway is agricultural, with commercial and residential buildings occurring nearer to Vacherie.
Two major access roads connect to LA 20 at Lower Vacherie.
This area is a small community characterized mainly by residential areas.
One road continues through Golden Star Plantation to Lac Des Allemands along Coulee du Cimentier.
Vacherie Canal forms the southern boundary of the management unit with a major artery of the canal entering at Golden Star Plantation.
Elevations in the Lower Vacherie area range from the 5 foot contour where the higher ground grades into swampland.
Access roads (shell surfaced) cross the area through agricultural fields throughout the management unit.
Brazen Canal forms part of the eastern boundary, perpendicular to LA 20 and Webre-Steib Plantation.
A major oil and gas pipeline crosses the unit above Webre-Steib Plantation.
In the Vacherie area, elevations exceed the 15 foot contour line.
Highway LA 20 ends at the Mississippi River levee, where the MSL elevation is marked by a 36 foot bench mark east of the St. James Ferry landing.
Highway LA 18 (20) follows the levee.
Urban and agricultural roads, many shell surfaced, cross the management unit.
The Texas and Pacific Railroad line parallels the river, but is set far back from it.
Agricultural drainage canals running perpendicular to the river discharge into Brazen Canal and Bayou Lassene.
Both of these flow into Lac Des Allemands.
FLOOD POTENTIAL: Except for small areas of swampland around Brazen Canal, the management unit is not considered flood prone.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: The entire management unit has soils of prime farmland quality, except those swampland soils adjacent to Brazen Canal.
USE OF LAND: The majority of the land is in agriculture, in particular, sugarcane.
Commercial vegetables are also raised in smaller quantities.
The lower Vacherie and Vacherie communities are primarily residential, with essential commercial establishments.
Development along the river is predominantly strip-type directly on the River Road.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: None.
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: The management unit provides access to excellent recreational areas, especially via the LA 643 extension through Lower Vacherie to Lac Des Allemands.
Other types of recreation in the area are provided by community facilities such as tennis courts, swimming pools and ball parks.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: Fresh water deposits are found grading down to depths below 300 feet.
Ground water for drinking is generally not available in large supply due to objectionable quantities of iron in solution.
Water supplies are From the Mississippi River.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL:
A. Historic Sites: Three old homes of historic interest are found east of Vacherie on the River Road (LA 18).
1.
Whitney Plantation House 2.
Waguespack Home 3.
Hymel Home
B. Cultural: Two sizable communities exist in the St. James portion of the Edgard management unit: Vacherie and Lower Vacherie.
Both have schools and churches.
A hospital and a library are located on LA 20 between Vacherie and Lower Vacherie.
Lower Vacherie was first settled by Germans, who crossed Lac Des A11emands from the German Coasts in the 18th Century (Bourgeois, 1957).
C. Archaeological Sites: Two known archaeological sites exist in the management unit.
One is believed to be a Bayou Goulas Indian site.
1.
SF 2 Indian Site 2.
SF 6 Plantation
PROBLEMS:
1.
Loss of prime farmland due to subdivision and development of land.
2.
Added stress on the existing services available in Vacherie and Lower Vacherie, and on the narrow corridors of high land along the river and LA 20, as a result of increasing population in the area.
3.
Drainage of agricultural runoff, sewage and drainage into swamplands adding to the eutrophication process in Lac Des Allemands.
2.2.5 Gramercy [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: The soils in the Gramercy management unit reflect the soil associations and conditions found in the Donaldsonville management unit.
Along Bayou Des Acadiens, Sharkey association soils penetrate the levee almost to LA 44.
Also, Convent-Commerce-Sharkey association soils are found behind the natural levees at Belmont and Romeville.
These are loamy and clayey soils formed during crevasses of the Mississippi River.
Soils of this association are poorly drained and slowly permeable.
Limitations for most urban, industrial and recreational uses are due to wetness, high shrink/swell potential and poor trafficability.
Limitations for farming are related to wetness and drainage.
Some swamp soils of the Barbary-Sharkey association are found between the St. James Parish Canal and the higher land of the natural levee.
These are frequently flooded clayey soils with poor trafficability, high shrink/swell potential and low bearing capacity.
VEGETATION: Natural vegetation of the management unit was mixed hardwood forest (oak, pecan, sycamore, elm, locust) grading down to cypress-tupelo gum - red maple swamps.
Most of the land has been cleared for agricultural purposes.
Scrub hardwood forests are still found on the batture and on the swamp-levee edge.
Hardwood and cypress are also found along the Bayou Des Acadiens crevasse.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: None for soils directly adjacent to the river; moderate for swampland.
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Low.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: Elevations grade from above 20 feet MSL at the Mississippi River to below the five foot contour.
The built up levee adjacent to the river is maintained by the Lake Pontchartrain Levee District at 30 feet MSL.
The main transportation arteries in the unit are LA 44 (at the River Road) and US 61, with major roads between the two including LA 20.
A new road links the Sunshine Bridge Road (LA 641) to Gramercy.
A 3.06 mile extension of this road (LA 641 Extension) will link Gramercy to I-10.
Ninety-five acres of swampland and seven acres of upland forest will be lost.
Another 130 acres will be used for spoil disposal and drainage areas upon completion of the highway.
The road will be elevated to 6 feet MSL Commercial and industry-related businesses are expected to locate along its length (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1975:19).
The Sunshine Bridge crosses the Mississippi River near the community of St. James.
Both the existence of the Sunshine Bridge, and the completion of the two new roads will encourage development.
Two railway lines cross the management unit, the Kansas City Southern and the Illinois Central; both have spurs into industrial areas.
A large utility power line follows US 61.
Pipelines for oil and gas transportation also cross the unit.
Agriculture and urban drainage canals flow into the St. James Parish Canal, the northern boundary of the management unit.
Bayou Des Acadiens flows from the Parish Canal to College Point.
Gramercy and Lutcher, through separately incorporated, form a large commercial-residential area from the Mississippi River to US 61.
The two towns spread along LA 20 and LA 44.
Three disposal ponds are found in the unit, two oxidation ponds exist for Gramercy and Lutcher, and one sewage disposal pond is located adjacent to a large industrial complex on the St. James-St. John the Baptist Parish line.
Belmont Crevasse is found between Hester and Welham Plantations; the date of the crevasse is 1892.
The site of another crevasse, Nita Crevasse, is found just below Romeville.
This crevasse occurred in 1890 and is one of the largest historic crevasses on this part of the Mississippi River.
An Indian mound of some size is located behind Belmont.
The mound was originally one of three, the other two were eroded away (Bourgeois, 1957).
FLOODING POTENTIAL: None throughout most of the management unit.
However, some flood hazard areas are found in the lower lands between St. James Parish Canal and the higher natural levee and along the upper part of Bayou Des Acadiens.
Backwater flooding has been an increasing problem in the back parts of Gramercy, Lutcher, and Grand Point.
The mayor source of the backwaters is flooding from Blind River.
Improper drainage of runoff into Lake Maurepas after heavy rains, coupled with strong northerly winds, cause water to overflow in the upper portion of Blind River (N-Y Associates, Inc., 1977: I-6 I-7).
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: Generally, all land in the management unit is considered prime farmland (see Donaldsonville management unit).
However, land along Bayou Des Acadiens is usually too wet to farm.
About 300 acres of land at Grand Point is devoted to farming of Perique tobacco.
This valued blending tobacco is grown no where else in the world (Bardwell, 1976).
USE OF LAND: The majority of the land area is devoted to sugarcane farming, with some minor vegetable crops.
Three sizeable urban residential communities exist at Gramercy, Lutcher, and Convent.
Most development has occurred directly along the Mississippi River and LA 44.
Gramercy and Lutcher have extended back toward US 61 (Airline Highway).
Industrial development is also found along the Mississippi River.
Commercial and industrial businesses are expected to develop along LA 641.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: A. Geological Features: None.
B. Zoological Features: None.
C. Botanical Features: None.
1.
Unique Botanical Specimens or Communities: Manresa: row of oaks
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: Major recreation activities are those associated with community facilities such as tennis courts, swimming pools, and ball parks.
Scenic driving is also a recreational activity common along LA 44 (the River Road).
Boat launches are found near Gramercy.
A boat launch is located off of US 61 providing access to Blind River.
Another behind Grand Point gives access to St. James Parish Canal.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: Freshwater is found in a small area at Convent.
Generally, freshwater deposits extend down 500 feet.
Water is much shallower (100 feet) in the Lutcher area.
Ground water in the vicinity of Welham is not potable due to saltiness (CZMAC, 1977-78).

B. Cultural: The area is part of the Acadian coast first settled in the mid-18th Century by the French and Acadians.
The parish seat has been Convent since 1869.
Two incorporated towns exist in this management unit: Lutcher, incorporated in 1890, and Gramercy, incorporated in 1947.
Lutcher is originally the site of the Lutcher-Moore Lumber Company town.
Gramercy grew up around the Colonial Sugars Company mill and refinery (Martin, 1958 and 1960).
C. Archaeological Sites: At present, known sites include at least one large Indian mound behind Belmont Crevasse.

2.2.6 Maurepas [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: Barbary-Sharkey association soils are found throughout the management unit.
These are frequently-flooded to almost continuously-flooded clayey soils, unsuitable for the majority of agricultural and urban-industrial uses due to severe limitations.
The limitations include low bearing capacity, high shrink/swell potential, frequent flooding and poor trafficability.
VEGETATION: Swamplands are found throughout.
Vegetation is typically cypress, tupelo and red maple.
Understory vegetation consists of scattered shrubbery and a floating mat of water hyacinth or duckweed.
There is probably no sizeable cypress timber left in the area, most is second-growth.
All swamps in the area have been cut-over.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: Moderate (3 to 16 inches).
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Medium to moderate susceptibility.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: The St. James Parish Maurepas management unit is part of a larger unit bordering on Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain.
In St. James Parish, the land is swampland bordered by drainage canals and US 61 (elevation 5 to 8 feet MSL) and its adjacent borrow pit.
Elevations in the unit are low, generally below 2 feet MSL Three old railroad grades cross the unit with 2 feet MSL elevation.
The western part of the unit is crossed by the Blind River Natural and Scenic River.
Several canals and bayous enter the system including Bayou Des Jones, Tennessee William Canal, Old River, Bayou Fusil, Bayou Secret, Bayou Andre David, Old New River, Tchackchou Bayou, Joe Bourgeois Canal and Bayou Shepard.
Old lumber canals can be found throughout the management unit.
FLOODING POTENTIAL: The entire management unit is flood prone.
Highway US 61 has less flooding hazard problems because of its elevation.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: None.
USE OF LAND: The land is swampland, mostly second-growth trees.
Recreational uses such as hunting and fishing and camps are common.
Highway US 61 and I-10 are major transportation routes.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: A. Geological Features: None.
B. Zoological Features: None.
C. Botanical Features: Blind River Swamp (see Blind River Management Unit)
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: The area is suitable for outdoor sports such as hunting and fishing.
Blind River is a Natural and Scenic River.
Camps are found throughout much of the unit.
The area is also considered to have a high aesthetic and scenic value.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: The saltwater-freshwater interface is shown on the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program Map to be 500 to 600 feet deep throughout the management unit.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL: None.
PROBLEMS: 1.
Subsidence and land loss potential if channeled or developed.
2.
Backwater flooding problems in Blind River and New River.
3.
Possible loss of natural drainage system if too much developmental stress is placed on the management unit.
4.
Pollution problems from agricultural and urban drainage.
5.
Possible loss of unique ecological feature (Blind River) due to developmental stresses (sewerage, drainage, channelization).
6.
Aquatic weeds have overgrown many of the water bodies (hydrilla, duckweed, water hyacinth, popping weed).
7.
Need for more accurate data concerning hydrologic resources.
2.2.7 Blind River [stjames_but.gif]
SOILS: Barbary-Sharkey association soils are found throughout the management unit.
These are clayey soils that are frequently to nearly continuously flooded.
Soils are poorly drained and slowly permeable.
Limitations for farming and urban-industrial development exist due to the frequent flooding, poor trafficability, shrink/swell potential and low bearing capacity.
VEGETATION: Typically water tupelo, baldcypress and red maple swamp.
Understory consists of a floating mat of vegetation such as water hyacinth or duckweed.
Swamp vegetation is second growth in much of the management unit.
Lumbering removed large numbers of the trees in the first part of the 1900's.
SUBSIDENCE POTENTIAL IF DRAINED: Moderate throughout the management unit (3 to 16 inches if drained).
LAND LOSS POTENTIAL DUE TO CHANNEL CONSTRUCTION: Medium; moderately susceptible to gradual continuous land loss if channeled.
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES: Land elevations are low, generally 3 feet MSL and below.
St. James Parish Canal forms most of the southern boundary; the boundary diverges to include swamp on the south side of the canal.
Spoil banks occur along the canal.
Blind River slows through the northeast portion of the management unit.
It is connected by canals to St. James Parish Canal in two places.
Bayou La Trainasse and Tchackchou Bayou can also be found in the southeast corner of the management unit.
A Kansas City Southern Railroad line and US 61 cross the eastern border of the unit.
Elevations along the road are five to seven feet MSL Remnants of numerous canals can be seen in aerial photos.
These are generally lumbering canals though some may have been crevasses.
FLOODING POTENTIAL: The entire management unit is flood prone.
Highway US 61 has less flooding problems because of its elevation.
Flood problems are due to backup of drainage waters entering Lake Maurepas.
The problem results after heavy rains and strong north winds.
While the St. James Parish drainage system adequately drains the higher ground, differences in elevations in the lake and several bayous and rivers entering the lake create much of the problem.
Drainage into Lake Maurepas from the Comite and Amite Rivers backs up into Blind River causing it to overflow its banks.
Another source of flooding problems originates with drainage into Bayou Conway (Ascension Parish).
Bayou Conway drains a large area into old New River and Blind River.
IMPORTANT FARMLANDS: None
USE OF LAND: Land is essentially second-growth swamp.
Extensive lumbering occurred throughout before the 1950's.
The management unit is used frequently for outdoor recreation such as hunting, fishing, and boating.
Highway US 61 and the railway line are important transportation links.
Camp sites (second homes) and recreation are mayor uses along Blind River.
UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES: A. Geological Features: None.
B. Zoological Features: None C. Botanical Features: Blind River swamp and natural area is an abandoned Mississippi River distributary about 20 miles in length containing about 25,000 acres of cypress-tupelo gum forest.
Blind River was classified as a Scenic River in 1973.
Dependent upon tidal actions in Lake Maurepas, flushing of the river takes place at an extremely slow rate.
Blind River is considered good for secondary contact recreation (fishing, wading, boating, and for propagation of wildlife) (Burk and Associates, 1977, 6:10).
RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL: The management unit is excellent for outdoor sports including hunting, fishing and scenic boating.
Blind River is a Natural and Scenic River.
Camps exist along the river and in other parts of the management unit.
HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES: Freshwater is found to depths of 600 feet below the surface.
HISTORIC/CULTURAL/ARCHAEOLOGICAL: None.
PROBLEMS: 1.
Flooding due to runoff and drainage backwaters along St. James Parish Canal from Blind River causing overflow of both the canal and the river banks.
2.
Pollution possible from agricultural, industrial, and domestic runoff and drainage.
3.
Need to preserve Blind River and regulate activities along the river causing possible damage to its uniqueness.

Donaldsonville
Although being considered separately, the next three study units are relatively similar in nature and composition topographically, ecologically, geologically, botanically and zoologically.
The Donaldsonville study unit has under usual circumstances no areas subject to Coastal use permits.
It is located on the alluvial ridge parallel to the Mississippi River.
Any use of this land, however, should undergo scrutiny on the part of the Coastal Zone Management Advisory Committee on its southern boundary, where it contacts the Bayou Citamon Wetland, and its northern boundary, the Mississippi River, to insure that all effluents and emissions comply with state and federal regulations and proper certification is ascertained from the person seeking to make use of this area.
Edgard
The Edgard study unit abuts the Bayou Citamon Wetland on its south and west border and the Johnson Island Wetland on the east and south with the Mississippi River north.
This area is usually not subject to Coastal use permitting because of its elevation.
however, any proposed use should be monitored.
Compliance, certified by the state and federal government, that any and all emissions and effluents will not have a direct and significant effect on coastal waters.
Gramercy
The Gramercy study unit extends the full length of the alluvial ridge of the east bank of the Mississippi River.
On the north boundary it abuts the Maurepas and Blind River study units and the lands in this area are usually not subject to permitting.
All emissions and effluents, however, shall comply with state and federal regulations and shall be certified by the person planning to use that area so as not to impact coastal waters surrounding the study unit.
Maurepas
The Maurepas study unit extends north from U.S. Highway 61 to the Parish Line.
All of the area in this study unit is subject to Coastal use permitting.
Blind River Natural Scenic River occurs in this area and its associated bayous Des Jones, Andre David, Tchackchou, Fusil, Secret, Shepard as sell as Tennessee Williams and Joe Bourgeois Canal, Old New River, the Airline Borrow Canal, and various lumber canals all require permit management to prevent Loss of ecological habitat, and land through subsidence and degradation of water quality.
