The goals of the incentive included raising Scratch Game sales and building lottery awareness among staff.
In preparation for the incentive, mystery shoppers visited each store once during the week before the incentive.
The mystery shoppers rewarded store managers with Tom Thumb gift certificates if they found that the store was following Tom Thumb merchandising guidelines for Lottery products.
Store managers were encouraged to remind sales associates to ask every customer 18 years of age or older if they'd like to purchase a lottery ticket.
Cheryl Conroy, Corporate accounts manager, reports, "Eighty-three out of 86 stores received Tom Thumb gift certificates.
These are outstanding results."
Each week, the stores earned points based on the amount Scratch Game sales increased over the store's sales base.
More than 50 percent of the stores earned enough points throughout the incentive to earn prize packages that included a Tom Thumb gift certificate, Scratch tickets and T-shirts.
When sales goals were met, stores were automatically entered into the grand prize drawing that included: hotel accommodations for two at the Grand Casino Mille Lacs Hotel, the buffet for two at the Grand Buffet, a meal for two at the Grand Northern Grill and four coupons for $5 in quarters.
