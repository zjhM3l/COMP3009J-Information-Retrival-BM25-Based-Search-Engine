Anthrax Hoax Advisory
Anthrax continues to be the agent of choice for bioterrorism threats and hoaxes.
There have recently been several hoaxes both in the United States and in Canada.
These attacks usually involve the delivery of a suspicious package and substance and can target any public or private facility.
Our response needs to be appropriate and based on a sound understanding of what anthrax is and how it works.
Anthrax is a serious but treatable disease that is rarely a threat to intact skin.
To conduct an effective attack using anthrax, a bioterrorist would have to overcome numerous serious technical challenges such as the acquisition, culturing and weaponization of a virulent strain.
However, anthrax is a real threat that must always be treated seriously and investigated thoroughly.
What would be your first response to an anthrax threat in your community? Do not panic! The following is a summary of current guidelines provided by the National Domestic Preparedness Office and the Center for Disease Control: * Double bag the package (using latex gloves and a particulate mask if available) * Evacuate and close the immediate vicinity (the room) * Thoroughly wash hands with antibacterial soap and water * Contact the FBI and local police.
The FBI will always investigate these threats, arranges rapid testing, and will provide additional guidance as needed.
The FBI Denver field office phone number is 303.629-7171.
* Contact the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment at 1-877-518-5608.
They will provide further guidance and contact local health and medical partners.
* List all persons who physically handled the package and provide the list to authorities.
On-scene body decontamination, quarantines and antibiotic prophylaxis are unnecessary.
The more often we over respond to these types of attacks, the greater the media coverage and the more likely copycat attacks will follow.
If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact Greg Moser at (303) 273-1640.
or greg.moser@state.co.us.
