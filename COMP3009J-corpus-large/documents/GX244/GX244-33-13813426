. .
Kudzu, the ivy-like noxious weed that has smothered parts of the Southeastern United States, has been found once again in Oregon this summer.
This follows two separate initial discoveries of kudzu last year and suggests there may be more plants elsewhere in the state.
"It's not a widespread invasive plant in Oregon, but it is something that definitely could be out there," says Tom Forney of the Oregon Department of Agriculture's Weed Control Program, which continues to look for more sightings.
Last year, kudzu was discovered in Oregon for the first time in a quarter-acre area of Clackamas County, along U.S. Highway 99E near Aurora.
A second detection of kudzu was made in a residential area of Southwest Portland.
The new site is within a mile of the original Portland site, near Barbur and Terwilliger Boulevards, and is also relatively small.
The creeping weed is located on a steep embankment and has probably been there for several years.
"It was the landowner who reported it to us," says Forney.
"They had observed it for a couple of years and thought it was wisteria.
A friend had suggested to them that it might be kudzu and to give us a call."
Sure enough, ODA was able to confirm the noxious weed.
If not for all the publicity surrounding kudzu last year, the friend's diagnosis may never have been made.
Cloaked in a canopy of other green foliage, the kudzu on this new site would be hard to find from other vantage points.
The citizen's call made the difference.
"With any of the weeds like kudzu, it's important to have the public assist us in identifying additional sites because it gives us more eyes out there," says Tim Butler, supervisor of ODA's Weed Control Program.
"We can't cover everything."
But it seems the weed itself can eventually cover everything, if not controlled.
Kudzu is a creeping, high-climbing viny plant that often completely blankets trees in rapid fashion.
Its leaves are much larger than those of ivy.
Unlike the slower-growing ivy, kudzu's vines can grow as much as 60 feet each year.
The weed overwhelms native plants, literally smothering other species, and is a threat to riparian areas and watershed health.
Kudzu, with a deep and extensive root system, is difficult to control once it has become established in an area.
Roots can go as deep as 12 feet into the ground.
"One of the major concerns is how rapidly it grows," says Forney.
"It also forms such a dense canopy, it tends to shade out more desirable vegetation and trees."
Last year's discovery in Oregon was the first reported case of kudzu infestation west of Texas.

"Kudzu doesn't grow as quickly in Oregon as it does in the Deep South," says Forney.
"But I think most of the Willamette Valley has the potential for this plant to exist and grow.
The last couple of years have proven that."
The original two sites were treated last summer with a systemic herbicide.
As anticipated, the spraying was effective but hasn't totally killed off the plant.
"There was some regrowth at the previous Portland site, but at this point, there is no visible vegetation, " says Forney.
"The Aurora site, which was quite a bit bigger than the one in Portland, does have some regrowth.
We will be treating the Aurora site, along with the new one in Portland, this fall."
Forney is not surprised that the earlier kudzu has not gone away.
"We thought we would have some regrowth and would need to go back to these sites and treat them for a number of years," he says, adding that the regrowth is small and probably a result of the herbicide not reaching all of the individual plants.
Given the close proximity of the two Portland sites, could there be a connection?
"Certainly," says Forney.
"It could have spread through movement of seed, cuttings, or debris.
It's hard to say where any of the plants originally came from, but it's hard to ignore that they are in the same general area."
It is not unlikely that other kudzu sites may exist in the Barbur-Terwilliger area of Southwest Portland.
ODA staff will continue to comb through the area and will always be interested in hearing from citizens who might also be on the lookout.
"It's kind of a double-edged sword," says Forney.
"We get a lot of publicity and interest in noxious weeds, but checking out the reports also adds to the workload."
Still, ODA officials appreciate the public assistance.
Potential sightings can be even more useful if citizens do a little homework first by visiting the Weed Control Program's web page at:
/plant/weed_control/kudzu.html
The website contains pictures of kudzu along with other useful information and should clearly help the public determine whether or not they have discovered the noxious weed.
Citizens can also contact the Weed Control Program at (503) 986-4621.
It has been another busy year for the program.
Earlier this summer, giant hogweed was discovered in Oregon for the first time, adding to the growing list of noxious weeds invading the state's environment.
"It is worthwhile to protect Oregon's natural resources," says Butler.
"We've certainly seen an increase in new invasive species in Oregon.
That makes it even more important to be diligent and stay ahead of the curve-- detect these noxious weeds early and deal with them before they become major problems."
Anyone who has lived or visited the Deep South knows that kudzu is something not to be desired in Oregon.
