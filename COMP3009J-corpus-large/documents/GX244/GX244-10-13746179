Alaska Division of Elections [rwbline.gif] DEFINITIONS AND HISTORICAL STATUS OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN ALASKA Updated November 18, 2003 [rwbline.gif]
To qualify for this status, a Limited Political Party petition is submitted to the Division of Elections and must be signed by 2,878 registered voters to qualify for the presidential election in 2004.
A Limited Political Party ceases to be recognized in the State of Alaska if its presidential candidate fails to receive at least three percent of the votes cast for President.
Recognized Political Party: AS 15.60.010(21) - A Recognized Political Party is an organized group of voters that represents a political program and either nominated a candidate for Governor who received at least three percent of the total votes cast for Governor at the preceding General Election or has registered voters equal to at least three percent of the votes cast for Governor at the preceding general election.
Until it qualifies as a political party under this definition, an independent political group may field candidates for statewide and districtwide offices only by filing nominating petitions as required by AS 15.25.140 - 15.25.205.
