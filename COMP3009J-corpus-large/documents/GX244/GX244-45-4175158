. .
It's no exaggeration.
The Christmas holiday season just wouldn't be the same without Oregon.
People across the country and around the world can thank Oregon agricultural producers and processors for the traditional colors, fragrances, and flavors of the season.
"Christmas would be pretty brown if it weren't for the Oregon green," says Cathi McLain, marketing services manager with the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
"And the taste of Christmas would be rather bland if we didn't have the flavors that come from Oregon."
With Oregon producing so many specialty crops, it should be no surprise that the state plays a major role in producing holiday-related items.
Christmas trees, holly, Christmas greenery, poinsettias, peppermint candy canes, and even that traditional holiday gift of food-- the fruit cake-- all owe a great deal to Oregon producers.
This is the time of year most of those producers are working overtime to supply the market.
"Oregon's climate is just short of paradise in terms of growing these kinds of products," says McLain.
"We don't have the volume, the major companies and the single crops like many other states.
But we do have just the right mix that makes these products grow better and be processed better than anyplace else."
It starts with the perhaps the greatest holiday icon of all-- the Christmas tree.
Oregon leads the nation in production of Christmas trees at nearly nine million trees harvested annually.
The value of production has continued to rise the past few years and now stands at nearly $120 million making Christmas trees Oregon's seventh ranked commodity.
Oregon trees are in high demand in virtually all U.S. states and numerous countries around the world.
Like the Christmas tree, Oregon-grown holly makes its way all over the U.S. and overseas.
Most of the nation's supply of holly comes from Oregon and Washington.
Sales figures are hard to come by, but most observers agree that the industry is significant in the Pacific Northwest.
Holly requires a cool, temperate climate as well as an adequate amount of rainfall.
Oregon can fill the order.
The traditional Christmas greenery is another industry in itself as Oregon-made wreaths, door swags, and garlands find their way into the homes of Americans nationwide.
Wreaths made in Oregon end up on doors throughout the U.S. from Florida to New York City to Los Angeles.
Another popular seasonal plant has roots firmly in Oregon.
Poinsettia production in Oregon has grown to more than 639,000 pots with a wholesale value of
$2.7 million.
Greenhouse growers have nurtured the red-leafed holiday plant since the summer.
Poinsettias are now showing up in retail outlets throughout the country.
Oregon isn't the only state that grows poinsettias, but it is a major producer and certainly grows enough of them to satisfy local demand.

Just as important as what you may see during the holidays is what you may taste.
The season would be rather bland without many of the traditional tasty treats Oregon helps produce.
"From the peppermint for candy canes, to glace' cherries for fruit cake to hazelnuts to various berries made into jams and jellies-- most everything that makes Christmas taste so special comes from Oregon," says McLain.
The main ingredient in the familiar red-and-white striped candy cane is peppermint.
Just like Christmas trees, Oregon is the nation's leading producer of peppermint, accounting for more than 36% of the U.S. production.
Candy makers across the country more than likely use Oregon mint to flavor their candy canes.
Fruit cakes often end up as the butt of holiday jokes, but somebody must like them.
More than ten million pound of fruit cakes are purchased in the U.S. each year and Oregon is the major producer of all of the candied fruits that go into them.
Oregon cherries are perhaps the highest quality that can be used in fruit cakes and local companies are major suppliers of fruit cake ingredients.
Holiday parties usually feature a nut bowl or two.
Chances are that bowl will contain hazelnuts.
Oregon grows more than 99% of the nation's hazelnuts, which also find their way as a major ingredient in fruit bars, candies, and other confections so often gobbled up during the holidays.
There are several types of berries that add flavor to the holidays.
Oregon is a major producer of cranberries and is the only producer of such delicious fruit as the marionberry and loganberry.
The result is often a collection of incredible tasting jams, jellies, and syrups that make their way into gift baskets.
Finally, Oregon is home to major holiday mail order companies that offer Oregon-grown and Oregon-packed food products to the rest of the country and around the world.
"Harry and David was the first and is probably the biggest of the mail order fruit companies," says McLain.
"But we have many other Oregon companies shipping fruits and processed products.
All of these companies are taking advantage of the wonderful products, fresh and processed, that come from Oregon."
So whether many people realize it or not, Oregon is well represented during the holidays.
If it wasn't for Oregon, Christmas would definitely have a different look and taste to it.
