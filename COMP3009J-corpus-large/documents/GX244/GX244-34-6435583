There is a lot of Oregon in Easter.
From Easter lilies to chocolate bunnies, Oregon is largely responsible for many of the things associated with the religious holiday.
Easter gives consumers nationwide another chance to find out about Oregon's penchant for high quality.
It's somewhat a secret, even to most Oregonians, that the Southern Oregon Coast is home to the traditional Easter lily.
Curry County and the bordering county of Del Norte, California are two of the nation's leading production areas for Easter lily bulbs.
Other Easter specialties-- namely those tasty items that end up in an Easter basket-- are also putting Oregon on the map this time of year.
"Easter, Valentine's Day and Christmas account for 70% of our business, and Easter is a third of all that," says Janele Smith, owner of Fenton and Lee, a Eugene-based company that produces hand crafted chocolate candies.
Consumers who purchase the more expensive Easter baskets filled with specialty confections and food products are likely to be getting a taste of Oregon.
The flavor of Oregon is enjoyed from sea to shining sea.
"About 60% of our Easter business comes from East Coast specialty markets," says Smith, whose chocolates are carried by such high-end outlets as Dean and Deluca in Manhattan and Washington D.C.
This year, Fenton and Lee is producing a three pound chocolate bunny and a one and a half pound chocolate egg filled with caramel silk creme.
Both are hand decorated with icing in the form of personalized messages.
Chocolate carrots-- pure chocolate in carrot shapes and wrapped in orange foil-- would normally retail for about 90 cents each.
Smith says by the time these Easter goodies make their way to the East Coast specialty markets, they are sold for $2.50 each.
It's not just chocolate that puts Oregon confectioners in good standing.
After all, no cocoa beans grow in Oregon as far as anyone knows.
It's what goes into the chocolate that enhances the state's reputation as a supplier of ingredients.
"We use Oregon hazelnuts and freeze dried fruits," says Smith.
To many candy lovers, Oregon grown strawberries, blueberries, and cranberries go well with chocolate.
Don't forget-- Oregon is a leading producer of mint as well.
"We are so lucky to have so many of these wonderful high quality products to work with," says Dick Fuhr, owner of the Candy Basket in Portland.
"Having locally grown ingredients is a plus.
I know a candy maker in Yuma, Arizona.
With what grows locally there, what is he going to produce? Chocolate covered cactus?"

Fuhr's company produces both a child's Easter basket and an adult Easter basket.
Kids receive a mixture of candies-- all made into the shape of Easter eggs-- from chocolate to jellybean.
Adult baskets are customized and will include the "rich and famous" candies such as hazelnut or Oregon mint truffles, marionberry cremes or rocky road in the form of an Easter egg.
"There is nothing we can't or at least won't try to make for someone," says Fuhr.
The Candy Basket markets primarily to seven western states.
Occasionally a customer pops up from unexpected places.
Recently, Fuhr received an order via the internet-- the Candy Basket has its own home page-- from a chocolate lover in Switzerland, of all places.
Apparently he wouldn't settle for just the locally made chocolate.
Candy is not the only food item that can be found in an Oregon Easter basket.
Baked goods also do well this time of year.
"We bake gingerbread cookies primarily, but we are also running shortbread for Easter," says Joy Denison, owner of the Joy of Cookies, a small, specialty baker in Southern Oregon.
"We have mom and dad bunny cookies with baby bunnies.
We also have a large, two ounce big bunny cookie with clothes in the form of icing."
The Joy of Cookies sells to high end retailers in Virginia, Georgia, New York, and Massachusetts.
There are other cookie companies in the east, but Denison says Oregon products have a reputation of high quality that brings back the customer.
"They like my custom designing," says Denison, whose husband hand makes all of the cookie cutters.
"Nobody else takes the time to decorate them like I do."
The traditional Easter basket is also beginning to offer non-sweets.
"We offer some products you wouldn't think would go into an Easter basket," says Laura Barton, trade manager with the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
"We have a company that makes wonderful high quality beef jerky packaged in a one ounce size that is a great gift idea for an Easter basket."
In fact, while all the candy companies stay busy before Easter, Gary R. West Meats of Jacksonville is also taking orders for individual packages of jerky to go into Easter baskets.
There are others producing unique items that can go into a basket.
"We are known as an entrepreneurial state and we license home kitchens," says Barton.
"So we have a lot small companies out there-- a couple hundred-- making specialty food products.
They have the reputation and some of our companies consistently win awards at many of the trade shows."
Most of these specialty products run the consumer a little higher than the mass produced candies and other food items.
But the relatively high price someone pays for Oregon specialty products is a reward for not only the consumer, but for those who turn the products out, adding value to Oregon's economy.
