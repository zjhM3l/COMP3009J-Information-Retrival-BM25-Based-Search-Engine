Speaker of the
S.C. House of Representatives
FROM: Luther P. Anderson
Dean of Agricultural Sciences
SUBJECT: House Resolution 3487 - Imported Fire Ant
The Imported Fire Ant continues to be a problem in South Carolina and given our current situation, it is difficult to deal with.
It is a problem that requires management using all the tools available but the ultimate solution is not on the immediate horizon.
The attached report reflects our thinking in the College of Agricultural Sciences and our recommendations on steps to take to put us in a position for long range efforts.
The budget request includes $160,000 for research and extension and an additional $70,000 for regulatory activities.
This team approach should be more effective and place us in position to come to you in 1987 with a projected plan for South Carolina.
Our role is to serve the people in the state and this request would place us in a better position to respond to the Imported Fire Ant problem.

Industry
SUBJECT: House Resolution 3487 - Imported Fire Ant
Clemson University has been involved with the Imported Fire Ant problem since its introduction into the State in the 1950's.
The decline of public support for fire ant research and education programs following the abandonment of eradication efforts (1970's) is the reason for the low level of activity today.
Eradication is no longer a feasible alternative due to limits of present technology and cost.
Until a technological breakthrough occurs, we must live with and manage the fire ant with the means available.
Clemson University recognizes the concern of the public over the fire ant problem and is prepared to expand research, extension and regulatory effort, but increased funding support will be required.
A short review of current research, extension and regulatory activity with recommendations follow:
RESEARCH: S.C.
Ag. Research and Hatch Project 1119 "Biology and Control of Imported Fire Ants" is the only project currently dedicated to the problem at Clemson.
The project funds O.1 SMY, one graduate assistant, and operating funds totaling $25,000.00.
Objectives include foraging and food habits of the fire ant, control efficacy of registered and experimental chemicals and biological control.
An expanded research effort would devote more time to biological control and more efficient control techniques with existing and experimental chemical technology.
Recommendation: Expand the research effort of S.C.
Ag. Research and Hatch Project 119 to 1.0 SMY (1 FTE) with support.
This will require a minimum of $100,000.00 in additional funding annually.
Funding support of the project must be long term because of the complexity of biological research.
The ultimate solution of the Imported Fire Ant problem will more likely be through biological or natural means rather than by conventional technology (insecticides, etc.).
EXTENSION EDUCATION: One specialist at Clemson has primary responsibility for public information while county agents provide some assistance by answering calls and by using the news media.
Extension education is the best way to quickly improve the public's ability to deal with the fire ant.
An experienced extension entomologist is needed and should be located in the Columbia area in order to be readily accessible to a majority of the infested areas of the State.
Extension's effort could then focus on training and demonstration to public groups, county agents, landowners, farmers, etc., on effective control strategy and methodology.
Refer to the attached Extension Insect Update for expanded discussion of current information on biology and control of the fire ant.
Recommendation: Fund an Extension Entomologist -- Assistant Professor (one FTE).
Cost $60,000.00 annually for salary and support.
REGULATORY ACTIVITIES: A thorough analysis of regulatory's involvement with fire ants over the years is presented in the attached report.
"The Imported Fire Ant in South Carolina."
Amdro Bait is being purchased at state prices and re-sold to the public.
Florida is also purchasing Amdro for resale to the public, but no educational approach on the part of the regulatory officials is being pursued.
These treatments were a cooperative effort with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
USDA shared in the cost on a 50-50 matching basis and had well over 1.2 million dollars in the treatment above.
During this period, environmentalists became concerned about the adverse effects of Mirex on and in the environment.
The result was that eradication efforts were halted, restrictions were placed on the types of habitat that could be treated, and eventually Mirex was cancelled altogether for fire ant control in 1977.
Since then other products have been introduced into the market for fire ant control and are very effective on an individual mound or small area treatment basis.
However, they are very costly, and therefore, prohibitive from use on large scale aerial treatments (involving 200-500 thousand acres or more) since at least two treatments would be necessary for any type of control.
Also, there is no guarantee that environmental issues would not surface again.
With present technology and cost of newer materials on the market, eradication is virtually impossible at this time.
Recommendations: The Department of Plant Industry requests $70,000 to assist with the Imported Fire Ant control problem in the State.
This funding would be utilized to hire and support two Entomologist III's whose primary function would be to survey and treat the isolated infestations that currently exist in Oconee, Anderson, Greenville and Greenwood Counties.
This would assist greatly in reducing the spread into these areas.
They would also assist in the certification of other agricultural products for shipment and movement to other states.
A portion of the funds would be utilized to purchase chemicals and supplies for control purposes.
2 Entomologist III's $42,000
Support 24,000
Chemicals and Supplies 4,000

Cooperative Extension Service Clemson University INSECT UPDATE Extension Entomology, Fisheries, and Wildlife Volume 3-86, Number 2, March 6, 1986 THE RED IMPORTED FIRE ANT (RIFA) IN SOUTH CAROLINA
HISTORY OF INFESTATION AND EXTENT OF SPREAD:
Fire ants may have infested the US as early as 1918.
Since their introduction at the port of Mobile, Alabama two distinct species have been identified.
The red form Solenopsis invicta Buren (RIFA) is the most wide-spread species currently occupying portions of Texas, and most of the coastal plain and piedmont of the Southeastern States to include SC and easternmost NC.
A black form Solenopsis richteri Forel, is found only in northern Mississippi.
Currently RIFA infests SC on a line from McCormick Co. north through Greenwood, Newberry, Fairfield and Lancaster counties.
Spot infestations exist in Oconee, Pickens, Anderson, and Greenville counties.
Best estimates are that RIFA has almost reached its northernmost limits buy may spread up the eastern coastal plan to the vicinity of Washington, D.C.
RIFA are spread by man (machinery, plants) and mating flights.
BASIC BIOLOGY OF RIFA.
Lets begin with a mature colony of RIFA containing 100-200 thousand ants.
The colony includes sterile female worker ants (minor and major workers), immature forms (eggs, larvae, pupa) virgin winged males and females, and one or more egg laying queens.
In a mature colony of RIFA, swarming of winged male and virgin queens occurs predominately during the spring and fall in S.C.
Swarming usually follows a rainy period preceded by warm dry weather.
New queens mate with males in the air at altitudes of several hundred feet and may drift for miles depending on wind conditions.
A new colony begins with one or more newly mated queens.
A small cell is constructed and a first brood of tiny "minim" workers is produced.
These small workers forage, feed, and care for the Queen(s).
The first minor workers appear in about 4 months and replace the "minims".
A visible colony (mound) is not noticeable usually during the first 4-6 months.
Larger major workers apear in the colony in about 7 months with a few winged males and females after 9-12 months.
Mounds can become quite large during the second year as the colony reaches maturity.
RIFA colonies may be found in all types of soil and even in buildings.
RIFA are general feeders but their primary food is insects.
ECONOMIC IMPACTS
Impact on People.
RIFA are "PRIMARILY" a people problem.
RIFA pose a health threat particularly to young children and older people from accidental contact.
Multiple stings from RIFA can produce a systemic anaphylactic reaction in some persons and a few deaths have been attributed to RIFA stings.
Scars and skin blemishes as a result of RIFA stings are of concern also.
People (in urban areas particularly) are concerned about the unsightly mounds in their yards, parks, golf courses, alongside highways, etc.
Larger urban areas (large estates, parks, golf courses, roadsides, etc.).
1.
Treat high risk areas (high human traffic) with quick kill products.
Follow-up as recommended to keep RIFA mounds suppressed in those areas.
INSPECTION AND SPOT TREATMENT REQUIRED ON MONTHLY BASIS TO MAXIMIZE CONTROL.
2..
Apply two bait applications (spring-fall) to suppress RIFA over entire area.
Fly-in RIFA queens forming new colonies will require annual maintenance treatment with baits
(at least one application per year in succeeding years).
Apply baits with small hand seeders or with vehicle mounted electric driven seeders.
Large Area Treatment (Several hundred to thousands of areas).
Aerial application best method.
Aircraft can distribute bait uniformly and at least cost.
Bulk purchase of baits reduces cost.
Two applications needed 1st year (Spring and Fall) followed by spring treatment 2nd year and each year thereafter.
To reduce infestation by RIFA into previously treated area a buffer zone treatment (1/4-1/2 mile strip) around area is desirable.
NOTE: PRO-DRONE is most suitable for large area treatment since it has less environmental drawbacks.
It is almost species specific for RIFA (does not affect other ant or insect species), degrades in 1-2 days in sunlight, and treatment is not restricted over water.
Eradication: This word is used widely in reference to RIFA.
Eradication was once thought possible but limits of present technology and cost make such an effort unlikely.
Until a technology breakthrough occurs we must live with and manage the RIFA.

THE IMPORTED FIRE ANT IN SOUTH CAROLINA H.B. Jackson, Head, Department of Plant Industry L.H. Senn, Director, Division of Regulatory 
Introduction
The imported fire ant is a pest affecting all people wherever it becomes established.
It is a pest of urban as well as rural areas.
Mounds can be seen and/or found just about everywhere, i.e. residential yards, cemeteries, schoolyards, campgrounds, golf courses, highway rights-of-way, pastures, etc.
In addition to being a public nuisance, it is a serious and dangerous menace to the health and welfare of the American people.
Attacks to humans are always painful and may be fatal to some people.
The agricultural segment of our state is also significantly affected as the fire ant still poses a problem by interfering with numerous farming practices.
History and Development of the Imported Fire Ant
The imported fire ant, a native of South America, entered this country through Mobile, Alabama about 1918.
Today, this pest is known to infest more than 202 million acres in ten southern states including Puerto Rico.
The imported fire ant was first discovered in South Carolina in Charleston and Orangeburg Counties in 1952.
It has since spread to an estimated 14,553,400 acres in 42 counties, which is practically the entire state
.
Only approximately 4.8 million acres in the state are considered noninfested.
Abbeville and Cherokee Counties are the only two counties in which fire ants have never been reported.
However, from the recent spread in McCormick County, it won't be long until fire ants infest Abbeville County.
An isolated infestation of approximately 100 mounds was found in Pickens County this fall, but immediate control seems to have alleviated this infestation.
Spartanburg County is still basically free of fire ants even though a single mound was found and treated around 1960.
Artificial spread, via nursery stock and pine straw, has been responsible for most of the small isolated infestations.
However, natural spread of the fire ant has been the primary means of spread and especially for the most recent population explosion this fall over the state.
Table 1 and Figure 1 show the infestation status in South Carolina as of March 1986.
History of Imported Fire Ant Treatments in South Carolina
Prior to 1969, treatments for control of the imported fire ant in South Carolina were nominal and were designed primarily to retard its spread.
Funding for this work was extremely limited and lacked the necessary continuity from one fiscal year to the next to obtain maximum effectiveness.
In 1967 to 1968, three aerial treatments of Mirex Bait were applied to 675,000 acres in Jasper, Beaufort and Hampton Counties as part of a research area of 1,200,000 acres extending into the State of Georgia around Savannah.
Cost of the treatments in South Carolina was borne by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), although costs generally are shared on a 50-50 matching basis.
Georgia shared in the cost of the treatments in their state.
No fire ants were found within the treated area in South Carolina for approximately two years.
In 1969, the South Carolina General Assembly asked the Plant Pest Regulatory Service (now Department of Plant Industry due to reorganization July 1, 1985) for a total eradication program.
Two plans were submitted, based on the availability of funds, which called for the work to begin on the coast in Charleston County and proceed inland beyond the last known infestation, which, on a line drawn horizontally across the state, was slightly above Columbia.
The shorter term of the two plans was adopted and $611,200 of state funds were appropriated to carry out the first phase of the program.
These funds were matched by the USDA.
The program was initiated in Charleston in the fall of 1969, under controversy from commercial fishing interests about the possible hazard of Mirex to marine organisms and, in particular, shrimp and crab.
Accordingly, the immediate coastal area was excluded from treatment.
Through the Fall of 1970, approximately 1,500,000 acres were treated twice with Mirex Bait.
The fire ant infestation in the treated area was reduced substantially, and remained relatively free for approximately four years before reinfestation.
Prior to the Fall treatment in 1970, a law suit was filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Stony Brook, New York and the Committee for Leaving the Environment of America Natural (CLEAN), of Mississippi, against the Secretary of the USDA to halt the fire ant program, as well as the use of Mirex.
The suit was heard in a U.S. District Court and, on April 14, 1971, the judge ruled in favor of the fire ant program.
Meanwhile, most of the $611,200 of state funds appropriated for this program for Fiscal Year 1970-71 ($500,000) were withdrawn by the South Carolina Budget and Control Board, effective December 1970.
In addition, on March 18, 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cancelled the registration of Mirex, a procedural action for the review of all data pertaining to Mirex to determine the potential adverse effects of the treatment to the environment.
Thus, emphasis shifted from eradication to control and the infested states were allotted a given number of acres for treatment in 1971.
South Carolina was allotted 225,000 acres which were treated in the Spring and Fall.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the Mirex review, a token appropriation of only $50,000 was requested for Fiscal Year 1972-73, and with this amount approximately 391,000 acres were treated in 1972.
For Fiscal Year 1973-74, an appropriation of $125,000 was received and 438,000 acres were treated in the Fall of 1973.
During Fiscal Year 1974-75, an appropriation of $175,000 was provided and a total of 483,200 acres were treated: 250,700 acres in Fall 1974, and 232,500 acres in Spring 1975.
From 1972 to 1975, the cost of application and the cost per pound of Mirex Bait doubled, resulting in less acres treated per dollar.
In order to comply with EPA restrictions, treatments from 1972 to 1975 were of a control type.
Only preferred habitats in areas of high ant populations were treated.
Marshlands, open bodies of water, impoundments, wildlife refuges, and heavily wooded areas were excluded from treatment.
On September 24, 1971, the Administrator of EPA appointed a committee of six scientists to consider and evaluate all data relative to the use and effect of Mirex on the environment to determine if its (Mirex) registration should continue or be suspended.
The committee, in its final report, recommended that "the registration of products containing Mirex should be continued with labeling restrictions to minimize environmental contamination."
The Administrator of EPA accepted this, but imposed tighter restrictions as stated in his order of June 30, 1972, to the effect that aerial application of Mirex Bait is prohibited in coastal counties.
In December 1973, another hearing was called by EPA to determine if the registration of Mirex Bait should be continued or suspended.
EPA, along with several other groups, asserted that there were detrimental environmental effects due to the use of Mirex.
During this period of continued debate, the USDA withdrew from the imported fire ant control program on June 30, 1975.
The USDA cited continuing restrictions on Mirex by EPA as the reason for withdrawal, stating that such restrictions increased program cost, allowed only temporary relief, and necessitated indefinite application of persistent pesticides to the environment.
The USDA and EPA finally agreed on terms for resuming the imported fire ant control program in October 1975.
Because of the guidelines and certain restrictions, a control, rather than eradication, program was pursued in South Carolina.
EPA guidelines prohibited aerial application of Mirex in coastal counties, or to large wooded areas, open water, and marshlands in non-coastal counties.
In the Fall of 1975, approximately 200,000 acres were treated aerially in Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties.
Again, this contract was funded and administered by the state with technical support provided by USDA.
In the Fall of 1977, 270,000 acres were treated aerially in Bamberg and Allendale Counties at a cost of $80,000 to the State.
In addition to the aerial control program, a cooperative program, involving the state, county, and Division of Regulatory and Public Service Programs, was established.
CETA funding was obtained for this ground control program in Orangeburg County.
Eight control aides were hired to apply Mirex in mound and limited broadcast treatments for imported fire ant control.
Areas treated were where the probability of human contact with the ants was the highest.
Treatment of these areas was coordinated with the aerial program to obtain maximum control.
Ground control programs, using jeep or truck mounted applicators, was also utilized in all areas of the state where the need existed and where sufficient manpower and monies were available.
Mirex bait was also supplied to county extension offices in infested counties for distribution to individuals on a request basis.
Mirex bait (50 pound bags) was sold to farmers at cost through the extension offices also.
Eventually, all formulations of Mirex bait were cancelled by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 1977.
All control type treatments in South Carolina were halted because there were no alternative materials.
The Mississippi Fire Ant Control Authority tried unsuccessfully to register "ferriamicide" with EPA for fire ant control.
This product still contained Mirex and therefore, was never registered.
Amdro, manufactured by American Cyanamid Company, was registered by EPA in 1980 for fire ant control on pastures and non-cropland.
The use was limited by its labeling, but approximately 20,000 acres of pasture land were treated in the Fall of 1980 in Orangeburg and Bamberg Counties.
The results were very erratic with poor control.
There were simply too many untreated areas such as borders of forested land, crop land and borders of ponds, etc., from which reinfestation occurred.
Other factors could have been involved, but the former contributed greatly to the situation.
The cost of Amdro at the time, was approximately three dollars per pound in truck load quantities.
Total cost was approaching four dollars per acre.
This, coupled with the test results, did not warrant or justify (in my opinion) the expenditure of state monies for a cooperative state-federal fire ant control program.
No large scale control treatments have been conducted in South Carolina since 1980.
Current Imported Fire Ant Program in South Carolina
Regulatory efforts as provided for under the fire ant quarantine are continuing.
Inspection and certification of regulated commodities such as nursery stock, turf grass, hay and pine straw are conducted for nurserymen, farmers, contractors, homeowners, etc., whereby the commodities can be moved or shipped to other noninfested states.
The affected business and individuals are advised to keep their environs free of fire ants to alleviate regulatory problems with other states and are doing a good job treating on an individual mound basis at their own expense.
Turf growers in infested areas must use the USDA approved certification treatment utilizing Dursban before shipments can be made to noninfested states.
Small isolated infestations such as were found this fall in Pickens County (Clemson), and others in Oconee County (Seneca), Greenville County (Greenville, Anderson County (Sandy Springs) and Greenwood County (Greenwood), are treated utilizing individual mound application.
Different material such as Amdro, Pro-Drone, Accudose aerosol injection, and Orthene 75 SP (soluble powder) have been used.
Other water mixture "pour-on" drenches could be used, but are more time consuming and labor intensive.
If the infestation is small enough (100 mounds or less) and found within the first year, our objective is to eradicate it.
Otherwise, the objective is to retard spread within the county and alleviate additional regulatory problems.
Activities of Other Infested States
Other states have had and conducted similar programs to South Carolina when Mirex Bait was being utilized.
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi treated on a much larger scale with considerable fire ant appropriations through the years, but currently the fire ant infestation is as great as it ever was.
Texas conducted an aerial treatment program using Amdro in the Spring of 1981.
Eighty-two percent control was achieved after eight weeks, 97% after 14 weeks, and 33% after 25 weeks.
Reinfestation occurred between the 14 and 25 week periods.
In 1983, Texas utilized Pro-Drone, the newest product available, on approximately 1-1.5 million acres.
The program was quite large as 12 single-engine airplanes and some 20-30 state and federal personnel were involved.
According to Texas regulatory officials, only about 55% control was achieved.
Currently, no other state is doing any large scale aerial treatment for control of fire ants.
Biologically and economically, such treatments cannot be justified.
Texas has gone to an educational and demonstration type program whereby individuals are informed about the biology of the ant, the various materials available for control, and the methods of application.
Amdro Bait is being purchased at state prices and re-sold to the public.
Florida is also purchasing Amdro for resale to the public, but no educational approach on the part of the regulatory officials is being pursued.
SUMMARY South Carolina has conducted many large scale aerial treatment programs in the past utilizing Mirex.
Cost per acre of treatment nearly doubled between 1972 and 1975 and was approaching a dollar per acre.
Then Mirex was cancelled for use in December 1977 by the EPA.
Amdro was tried in 1980 with very poor results.
The cost, approaching four dollars per acre, did not warrant or justify the expenditure of state monies for a cooperative state-federal control program.
Thus, control treatments were suspended.
However, efforts were made to keep abreast of research and control programs conducted by other states with the hope and idea of re-instituting treatments if results were promising.
Currently, we are still waiting for a material whose cost and efficacy data would justify the expenditure of funds.
USDA suspended efforts for basically the same reason, costs were rising and long-term control over large areas was virtually impossible.
Any additional action on the part of the Department of Plant Industry would require an increase in personnel and funding.
Both would depend upon the scope and magnitude of the planned action.

Re: House Resolution 3487-Fire Ants
Department Report
Dear Representative Schwartz:
The Department of Health and Environmental Control has limited vector control funds for the control of mosquitoes, rodents and other disease carrying vermin.
Since fire ants are not considered a carrier of a communicable disease, our activities associated with fire ant control have been nonexistent.
If and when we receive inquiries, we refer such requests to the Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service.
Control recommendations, if given, are taken from the 1985 Agricultural Chemical Handbook - South Carolina.
At no time has this Department had any mandate or seen any public health implication in fire ant control and, therefore, we have no expertise to offer regarding this troublesome state and national problem.
Sincerely, Robert S. Jackson, M.D. Commissioner

March 25, 1986 The Honorable Ramon Schwartz, Jr.
The State House Columbia, S.C. 29201
Dear Mr. Speaker:
The following report is presented to you in response to House Resolution 3487 dated February 26, 1986.
The Agriculture Department, as one of four State agencies, was to report on efforts to control or eradicate fire ants.
The Agriculture Department has received many expressions of concern and requests for assistance from farmers and other citizens about fire ants.
Those persons are referred to Clemson University, the agency designated for this responsibility.
Because of the limited success in treating fire ants with the present state of the art and other restraints, in July of 1985 I contacted all of the South Carolina Congressional Delegation urging continued support of research.
We certainly need more knowledge of the fire ant, chemical and/or biological controls or to find a safe predator.
We need a breakthrough in methodology before eradication will be possible; research could help provide this knowledge.
Practically all of the delegation gave affirmative responses.
The pesticide residue analyses of our laboratory are performed on human foods and animal feeds.
We have performed analyses for possible chemical residues as a by-product of fire ant control.
As you know, the statutory authority for control of insect pests and related educational activities is a Clemson University responsibility.
We will continue to work with the Clemson regulatory, research and educational personnel and hope that means can be found soon to control the fire ant population, for it is a very rapidly growing serious menace to all people of this State.
A member of my staff is in Chicago today meeting with the Interstate Pest Control Compact.
In view of the federal deficit and the attempt to bring the Federal Budget under control, I feel that the states involved will have to take a major step forward in funding research in order to contain or eradicate the imported fire ant.
Furthermore, I would suggest that the South Carolina Legislature take the lead in contacting the Legislatures of he other eight states (North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas) that are infested with the imported fire ant in order to begin a concerted cooperative effort among states for a "crash" program in research in how to control or eradicate the ferocious pest.

SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAYS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
March 17, 1986 Honorable Ramon Schwartz, Jr. House of Representatives District No. 68 509A Blatt Building Columbia, S.C. 29211
Dear Speaker Schwartz:
In accordance with House Resolution H. 3487 dated February 26, 1986, the following is submitted.
The Department of Highways and Public Transportation has an ongoing program to control Red Imported Fire Ants (RIFA) within its rights-of-way in the following priority areas: 1.
SCDHPT Property adjacent to service buildings that the public uses on a daily basis.
2.
Public rest areas and welcome centers maintained by SCDHPT.
3.
Rural Right-of-Way adjacent to recreation areas.
4.
Rural Interstate Interchanges adjacent to built up areas.
5.
Right-of-Way in high density urban areas in cooperation with adjacent land owners.
We are presently using AMDRO bait as the primary treatment product.
We also are experimenting with CESSCO and ORTHANE 75.
All of our treatment work is on a limited priority basis since we do not have the funds or the manpower to treat all of our vast amount of rights-of-way.
Should you have additional questions concerning this matter or if I can be of further service, please let me know.
Yours very truly, Walker P. Ragin Chief Commissioner
Received as information.

H. 3709 -- Rep. Harvin: A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1986, AS ANDREWS CHAPEL CHURCH DAY IN CLARENDON COUNTY IN COMMEMORATION OF THE TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHURCH.
Whereas, the Andrews Chapel Church in Clarendon County was organized in 1786 by Mrs. Lucy Stephenson Andrews in what was originally part of the Santee Circuit; and
Whereas, Andrews Chapel is on the lands granted to the Richbourg Family by the King of England in 1729 and deeded to the church in 1880 by Louis N. and Sally A. Richbourg; and
Whereas, Bishop Francis Asbury, one of the founding fathers of Methodism in America, was among the first of the circuit riders, having preached there on March 14, 1795; and
Whereas, the Reverend Mrs. Bessie Bellamy Parker, the first female ordained a Methodist minister in the State, served a pastorate at Andrews Chapel from 1959 to 1962; and
Whereas, Andrews Chapel Church is an integral part of the religious and spiritual fabric of South Carolina and serves as a reminder that our forebears were a people of abiding faith in the wonders and mysteries of the Heavenly Father who gave them the courage and determination to do His will on earth.
Now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring:
That the members of the General Assembly designate Tuesday, April 22, 1986, as Andrews Chapel Church Day in Clarendon County in commemoration of the two hundredth anniversary of the church.
