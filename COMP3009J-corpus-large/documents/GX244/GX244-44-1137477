In June 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council unveiled Chesapeake 2000, a new Bay agreement to guide Bay restoration efforts into the 21^st century.
The agreement contains more than 100 individual commitments ranging from restoring the blue crab fishery, to preserving 20 percent of the watershed's resource lands, to removing the Bay from the EPA's list of impaired waters.
The 2000 Bay Agreement, the game plan for the world's largest, most ambitious environmental restoration, is one praised by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation for its scope and vision.
The Foundation pointed out one of the strengths of the agreement - that it was developed not based on what was affordable in June of 2000, but what the Bay needed to be restored to health.
In 2001, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources undertook a fiscal analysis of fully implementing the agreement in Maryland for Fiscal Years (FY) 2003-2010.
The analysis was done to calculate the cost of achieving the 100+ commitments found in the Agreement and identify the largest areas of funding need.
Projected cost and income estimates were collected from State agency staff responsible for the programs charged with carrying out the Bay agreement.
Restoring the Chesapeake Bay, a significant and ambitious undertaking, is expensive.
The cost of success: the money that has been spent over the past twenty years and the funding needed in the next ten or twenty years is measured in the billions.
At any time, but especially now in a period of fiscal challenges and budget deficits, these are daunting numbers.
But the cost of ignoring the Bay's problems, of shortchanging Maryland's greatest and most valuable natural resource, is even greater.
The Bay is the engine that helps drive the State's economy.
Additionally, tens of thousands of Maryland sports enthusiasts, hunters, anglers, and recreational boaters depend on a clean, healthy, productive Bay for their enjoyment.
In 2002, the Chesapeake Bay Commission (CBC) undertook a similar cost assessment on a broader scale, collecting cost and income data from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
The Maryland data included in the CBC report is mostly based on the information collected in 2001 with some changes to reflect more recent information and the Commission's cost assumptions that were designed to provide consistency in cost estimates among the three states.
The January 2003 CBC report "The Cost of a Clean Bay - Assessing Funding Needs Throughout the Watershed" can be found on its web site at http://www.chesby.state.va.us/.
This document provides a detailed and comprehensive description of how the funding analysis was prepared and the results.
The report following this Executive Summary is Maryland's supporting cost and income estimates and underlying cost assumptions that are part of the Bay-wide cost analysis published by the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
The data are organized by the five major categories and 22 subcategories in the Bay Agreement.
The information was compiled at the commitment level then aggregated into one of the 22 subcategories.
The five major categories are: 1.
Living Resource Protection and Restoration 2.
Vital Habitat Protection and Restoration 3.
Water Quality Protection and Restoration 4.
Sound Land Use 5.
Stewardship and Community Engagement
The 22 subcategories of the Bay agreement fall within these major categories.
For example, the first major category, Living Resource Protection and Restoration, is comprised of five subcategories including Oysters, Exotic Species, Fish Passage, Multi-Species Management and Crabs.
Maryland's cost estimates and underlying cost assumptions are shown to the most specific level of detail available; some costs and assumptions are for individual programs, some for individual commitments and others are for groups of commitments.
All estimated costs and income projections are then aggregated at the subcategory level.
Below is a summary of the funding estimates found in the Commission's report.
Bay-wide Cost of A Clean Bay Total Projected Cost $18.7 billion Total Projected Income $ 5.9 billion Unfunded Gap $12.8 billion Maryland Cost of A Clean Bay Total Projected Cost $ 6.4 billion Total Projected Income $ 3.5 billion Unfunded Gap $ 2.9 billion The cost assessment is a tool that can be used by state policy makers and others charged with restoring the Bay.
It provides a basis for evaluating cost and spending projections, identifying funding shortfalls and developing a strategic plan to meet the funding challenges that lie ahead.
