Regional CQI Team Notes July 3, 2003 Present: Kathy K., Malinda , Don, Brian, Gary, Kathy H. 
I. Team Roles
Once again it was time for the team to look at changing team roles.
The Team decided to take a new approach to help ease the burden related to each roll.
It was decided to rotate facilitation and scribe duties every month.
The scribe duties will precede facilitation.
Malinda will begin facilitation in August and duties will rotate as follows:
August Malinda September Mike October Alex November Brian December Don January Gary February Kathy K. March Malinda
II.
Timing Grid / Reports
The updated schedule is provided at the bottom of these notes.
It is our intent to note on the grid when particular data becomes available such as comment cards or mystery shopper reports.
It was noted that the QAC report should be about the same as the Leadership report so preparing for one should cover both.
The emphasis for the next QAC report should be business customers.
To accomplish this we will review 2^nd quarter business comment card data at our next meeting.
Gary will ensure Bonnie gets all the numbers together (business and job seeker) and to Don in enough time for Don to send the numbers out for everyone to review prior to our next meeting ( 7/17/03 ).
III.
Data Display Update
CQI Team members had been previously asked to look into the effectiveness of our data displays.
Are the displays being effective? Team members have not been able to collect any information (anecdotal or otherwise) that would tell us our displays are effective.
It was suggested that a question related to the effectiveness of our data displays might be added to the fall exit survey we plan to conduct and/or addition Mystery Shops we expect to purchase.
IV.
Problem Resolution Grid (Continued Work)
The Team reviewed to grid for completeness with respect to solutions.
The Team determined that most of the Center or staff specific problems have been addressed, but other systematic problems may not have been identified.
The Team identified the following systematic problems embedded in the Resolution Grid:
1.
Job referrals.
This is a key process issue the team addressed before.
2.
Level of evaluation/screening on job orders.
Another key process issue where we are not likely meeting business needs.
3.
Staff are not consistently checking to see if customer needs are being met.
We have launched initiatives to address this known concern with limited effectiveness.
We recommend that when we purchase addition Mystery Shops this be evaluated in shops.
4.
Level of probing question is not consistently at a high level.
The Team decided to review this list at the July 17^th meeting and come up with recommendations to be included in the Leadership report.
The Team also recommends that all CUT's review the core services grid for gaps in service.
V.
Other
Gary updated everyone on the status of hiring a data/program analyst staff person.
The job description has been created and the WDC is in the interview process.
CQI Team members will be invited to attend a future meeting (TBD) with OQOB (Office of Quality Organizational Presentation) to discuss the Mystery Shopper Program in our area.
