Submit comments by September 19, 2003 to:
Patrick J. Mullen, Director Division of Marketing and Development New Jersey Department of Agriculture PO Box 330 Trenton, NJ 08625-0330
The agency proposal follows:
Summary
Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:14B-5.1(c), the Grades and Standards rules, N.J.A.C. 2:71, that were scheduled to expire on June 26, 2003 are now scheduled to expire on December 23, 2003.
These rules have been in effect, as amended, since adopted in 1969.
The last amendments to the rules were effective September 18, 2000.
The Department of Agriculture has reviewed these rules, and with the following exceptions, has found them to be necessary, reasonable and proper for the purposes for which they were promulgated.
A summary of the existing subchapters follows: Subchapter 1, N.J.A.C. 2:71-1.1 through 1.40, contains the rules relating to the marketing, processing, labeling and transporting of eggs.
These rules satisfy the need for an orderly marketing program for quality shell eggs and result in the economic protection of the State's egg industry.
The subchapter states that any eggs marketed to consumers, institutional consumers or retailers shall be edible and shall conform to the standards for consumer grades; that fees and charges for inspection and grading services by Department personnel shall be the same as those charged by the United States Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.); that the name and address of packer or distributor shall be prominently displayed on containers of eggs; that containers of loose eggs produced in New Jersey must be properly sealed; that there must be registration of labels or containers which bear the name New Jersey or Jersey.
The subchapter also defines a reused egg container; prescribes the proper sanitary conditions in cleaning and handling shell eggs from the packing room to the transporting vehicle; prescribes labeling requirements for New Jersey produced eggs; prescribes use of the New Jersey map symbol on egg packages and in advertising; and defines an egg container.
Subchapter 2, N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.1 through 2.32, sets forth the rules describing the standards and grades as applied to fruits and vegetables.
The Department of Agriculture, under a cooperative agreement with the U.S.D.A., has provided the fruit and vegetable industry with inspection and grading services since 1922 when the first United States Standards were promulgated.
The United States Standards are a measure of quality, for example: U.S. Fancy; and U.S. No. 1; and U.S. No. 2.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.1 provides that the United States Standards are used when grading all New Jersey fruits and vegetables with the exception of asparagus intended for canning or freezing which is graded pursuant to N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.8.
The New Jersey grades for canning or freezing are described and diameter classifications for spears are specified in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.9.
Words and terms used in Subchapter 2 are defined in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.10, followed by a clarification of terms used in this section in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.11.
Asparagus acceptable for New Jersey No. 1 grade is described in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.12.
Asparagus is the only vegetable graded using New Jersey Standards because scoring defects are clearly defined.
The procedure for receiving loads of asparagus after severe wind and rainstorms is stated in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.13.
The function and need for unrestricted sampling of asparagus for processing is summarized in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.16 and equipment and personnel required by applicants is discussed in N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.17.
This subchapter on inspection and grading of fruits and vegetables has in the past, and will continue to, enable farmers, packers, brokers and shippers to market loads of fresh product of uniform quality and provide an equitable basis for payment between buyer and seller.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.2 through 2.7 deal with the use of "Jersey Fresh" as the logo for the "Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program" and the "Jersey Fresh Quality Premium Grading Program" on containers of certain agricultural commodities.
These rules describe the application for license and the licensing procedure, the license period, charge for licensing, the commodities to be marketed under the "Jersey Fresh" logo, commodity grader, packing requirements, packer identification, definitions of grade standard terms and penalties for improper use.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-3.1, Standards for plant material, states that the State
Board of Agriculture adopts and promulgates as Official New Jersey Grades, the United States Standards for asparagus, Christmas trees and tomato plants.
This rule aids in the orderly marketing of these commodities.
Subchapter 4, Jersey Fresh Matched Funds Program, sets forth the application procedure and criteria for Jersey Fresh Matched Funds.
Subchapter 5, Marking Open and Closed Packages of Potatoes, originated with the need for an orderly marketing program for quality potatoes.
The rules related to marketing, grading, and labeling of potatoes for the economic protection of the State's potatoes for the economic protection of the State's potatoes marketed shall conform to the standard grades for potatoes and be labeled as to the specific grade.
The proposed amendments will increase the types of agricultural commodities capable of being marketed and enhance the marketability of commodities already marketed under the Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program and Premium Program.
The following commodities are now proposed as marketable under the Programs: carrots (topped), carrots (bunched), cranberries and turnips (bunched).
The Department is also proposing to delete the commodity "ice milk" as it is no longer produced.
Changes and/or clarifications are proposed to N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.5, Commodity grades, packing requirements, packer identification and containers, and to N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.6, Definitions, by the additional of definitions of "fairly uniform in color" and "fairly well colored" as necessary to facilitate the addition of these commodities.
In addition, proposed amendments to N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.28, 2.30 and 2.32 reflect the changes in fees charged for the inspection and grading of farm products in accordance with standards established and promulgated by the Department of Agriculture, in order to facilitate an adequate funding level for continued administration of the Commodity Inspection and Grading Programs.
The fees are increased as follows: the five -day week inspection for single commodity inspection from $700.00 to $840.00; the overtime rate from $26.25 to $31.50, for the same; the four hour minimum rate for Saturday and/or Sunday and legal State holidays from $105.00 to $126.00; the hourly rate for same in excess of 4 hours from $26.25 to $31.50.
At N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.28(a)2i and 3i, the point at which the excess fruit and vegetable (including potatoes) per package/hundredweight charge for five-day week, one commodity, if applicable, is increased from 4,118 to 4,941 packages/hundredweight.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.30(a)3i is amended to provide that, rather than no charge, the phytosanitary inspection certificate charge shall be accessed in accordance with N.J.A.C. 2:18-1.4.
Formerly, there was no fee imposed.
It is now $50.00 for each Federal or special phytosanitary inspection of a commercial shipment and $20.00 for each Federal or special phytosanitary inspection of a non-commercial or low value commercial shipment.
Fees for other governmental agencies shall be waived.
Under N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.32(a), the hourly inspection rate charges are increased as follows: from 8:00 A.M. through 5:00 P.M. from $25.50 to $31.00; from 6:00 P.M. through 7:00 A.M. from $38.25 to $46.50; for Saturdays, Sundays, or legal State holidays from $38.25 to $46.50.
Other proposed technical amendments recodify where necessary.
As the Department has provided a 60-day comment period on this notice of proposal, this notice is excepted from the rulemaking calendar requirement pursuant to N.J.A.C. 1:30-3.3(a)5.
Social Impact
The readoption as amended of N.J.A.C. 2:71 will affect the producers, packers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers of the commodities covered in this chapter.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-1.1 through1.40 will continue to protect the egg industry and the consumers it serves by high quality standards that are uniformly applied to all packers of eggs sold and/or produced in New Jersey by mandatory inspections conducted at the retail and wholesale marketing levels.
The results of these rules past, present and future guarantee that the New Jersey consumer receives high quality shell eggs in properly identified containers.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.1 through 2.32 will continue to protect the New Jersey fruit and vegetable industry and the consumers it serves in that inspection and grading of fruits and vegetables marked as to grade or standard assures the public of compliance with the grade indicated.
The service enables the farmer and packer to market a high quality product.
This in turn, benefits the consumer who would otherwise be unable to compare quality with price.
In addition, this chapter opens markets to producers, such as the expert market, which is not available without inspection.
Further, products packed under the 'Jersey Fresh" quality grading logo will enhance the promotion of uniformly packed high quality New Jersey farm products to the benefit of the packers and consumers.
Packers will gain new markets for their products, while consumers will have more quality products and an identifiable larger supply of quality products available.
The "Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program" has been well received by the growers, buyers and consumers.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-3.1,
in setting United States grades as the official grades for New Jersey asparagus, Christmas trees and tomato plants will continue to enhance the marketability of these products through the use of a standard that is well recognized and understood domestically as well as internationally.
N.J.A.C. 2:71-5.1 through 5.7 will continue to protect the potato industry and the consumers it serves by high quality standards which are uniformly applied to all packers of new Jersey produced potatoes by mandatory inspections conducted at the retail and wholesale marketing levels.
The proposed amendments recognize the fact that there is a need to expand the opportunity to a larger number of producers, buyers and packers to participate in the well-received "Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program" in order to give consumers the benefit of a larger supply of identifiable quality products, while giving packers and producers using the logo new markets for additional products and by enhancing the marketability of some existing commodities through more flexible compliance requirements.
The proposed amendments to certification fees will ensure an adequate funding level to assure that the produce industry and consumers will continue to receive the benefit of an effective Commodity Inspection and Grading Program and continue to assure the marketing of uniform quality fresh product and a equitable basis for payment.
Failure to adopt these rules will result in the Department's inability to administer fair and effective service and regulatory programs that benefit New Jersey consumers, producers (growers), packers and shippers
Economic Impact
These rules proposed for readoption as amended are driven by economics and beneficially affect New Jersey consumers, producers (growers), packers, wholesalers, and retailers of the covered commodities.
Producers (growers) will benefit by increased prices received through the sale of high- quality products, while consumers will have further ability to compare quality with price.
The cost of producing a superior quality product in the past and present time is borne both by the producer and consumer.
The producer or packer incurs extra costs in producing or purchasing New Jersey eggs and packing containers.
These costs are channeled to the consumer in the form of a higher price per dozen charged at the retail level.
Subchapter 2 has the greatest economic impact upon the farmers, packers, brokers, shippers, processors and receivers of fruits and vegetables.
These groups would be adversely affected if the inspection and grading program were discontinued.
Exports and imports would be drastically curtailed because of State and Federal regulations requiring inspection and certification; also sales to the military would be completely halted.
There would be no objective method to establish the true value of loads of fruits and vegetables or uniform quality commensurate with prevailing market prices.
urthermore, there would be no unbiased third party to assist in settling claims or disputes between shippers and receivers.
The applicant for the inspection and grading service is charged a minimal fee for the work performed.
The fee is a marketing cost that is passed through to the product consumer.
This fee is used to help the Department in the administration of the program.
Increases in salaries and overhead costs in the last several years necessitate the increased fees.
The Department of Agriculture must maintain the inspection program on a "break-even basis" if it is to continue to offer this program to the users.
There will be a slight adverse economic impact on the users of these voluntary inspection and grading services.
The increases are minimal in relation to the economic value of the product at present.
These charges have not been increased since at least 1999.
The economic impact on the producers (growers) licensed under the voluntary "Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program" is minimal.
The $30.00 annual license fee has been proven to be offset by increases in the price received by the producers through the sale of high quality products.
Any licensed packer using "logo" containers for products other than those covered by the rules or any unlicensed packer using "logo" packages for any product is subject to a penalty of not more than $50.00 for the first offense and not more than $100.00 for each subsequent offense.
The producer or packer incurs extra costs in producing or purchasing New Jersey potatoes and packaging containers.
These costs are channeled to the consumer in the form of a higher price per pound charged at the retail level.
The cost of producing a superior quality product in the past and present time is borne both by the producer and consumer.
Federal Standards Statement
As related to this chapter, the rulemaking requirements of the Director, Division of Marketing and Development, are dictated by N.J.S.A. 4:1-11.1, 4:3-11.12, 4:10-6 and 4:10-13, and are not subject to any Federal requirements, except as noted below regarding milk and ice cream.
However, the rules proposed for readoption incorporate by reference the Federal standards for grades of fruits, vegetables (7 C.F.R. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 51.300 through 51.3746,) and honey (7 C.F.R. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 52.1391 through 52.1403), and the regulations of United States Food and Drug Administration governing the manufacture and distribution if ice cream and milk (21 C.F.R. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 131.110 and 135.110).
The Federal standards for grades of fruits and vegetables were developed for the purpose of promoting uniformity in the pack and packaging of produce.
The grades are not Federal requirements but rather serve as a mechanism to allow buyers and sellers to deal over long distances by enabling them to know the quality of the produce being offered for sale without seeing it.
The rules proposed for readoption as amended do not require fruits, vegetables or honey to meet a Federal grade but do provide the information necessary for a grower to produce a uniform pack that will afford entrance into more marketing channels.
Participation in the Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program is voluntary.
While a Federal standards analysis is not required, the Department notes that the rules proposed for readoption exceed the Federal grades with respect to products bearing the Premium Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program label, in that such products must meet a more restrictive tolerance.
Since the Department regulates the voluntary marketing of agricultural commodities under the Premium Jersey Fresh Quality Grading program label, the Department has chosen to require Premium products to exceed Federal standards.
The United States Food and Drug Administration regulations set mandatory requirements for the manufacture and distribution of ice cream (21 C.F.R.Ã¯Â¿Â½135.110).
These rules proposed for readoption as amended meet but do not exceed the Federal requirements and the rules of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services that implement the Federal requirements, N.J.A.C. 8:21-7 and 10.
Therefore, a Federal analysis is not required.
Jobs Impact
It is not anticipated that the rules proposed for readoption as amended will result in the generation or loss of jobs.
However, it is anticipated that the rules proposed for readoption as amended will positively affect the New Jersey produce, poultry and egg industries including brokers, dealers, producers, growers and others associated with the agricultural industry, averting the permanent loss of jobs.
Agriculture Industry Impact
The Social and Economic Impact above describe the impact of the rules proposed for readoption as amended on the agriculture industry.
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
The rules proposed for readoption as amended have an impact on small businesses, as defined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, N.J.S.A. 52:14B-16 et seq., primarily farmers.
The rules and amendments impose compliance standards, as described in the Summary above, on those participating in these programs.
There are also reporting requirements, including registering samples of labels used in the shell egg program and annual reporting in the Jersey Fresh program.
The recordkeeping requirements include maintenance of accurate records in the shell egg program, proper invoicing in the Jersey Fresh Program and the marking of potato packages.
However, these rules are designed to ensure truth in packaging and an adherence to statements of quality.
This assures that products are delivered to consumers free from defects and risk of disease.
Therefore, it is the Department of Agriculture's position that although these rules proposed for readoption may be more costly for a small business to implement, they are necessary for the public health, welfare and safety.
Further, by the use of uniform grades and standards all products are judged against each other intrinsically and not just on advertising budget.
As to the voluntary portion of these rules proposed for readoption, specifically N.J.A.C. 2:71-2.1 through 2.32, Agricultural Commodities, while there is no requirement to market in conformance with these rules, to do so in the commercial market without these grades, which are universal in the product selling area for New Jersey commodities, would put the small business at a competitive disadvantage with all other states.
As the New Jersey rules are for all practical purposes the same as the Federal rules, which are not requirements but a mechanism to determine uniformity and quality, they add no cost or complexity to the operations.
In respect to products bearing the Premium Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program label, those products must meet a more restrictive tolerance.
Since the Department regulates the voluntary marketing of agricultural commodities under the Premium Jersey Fresh Quality Grading Program label the Department has chosen to require Premium products to exceed Federal Standards.
The use of accepted standards promotes the orderly marketing of similar goods in the generic sense and allows equally good produce from the small farm to compete with the products of larger operations.
Should a farmer choose to participate under the voluntary rules, the cost of participating should be offset by higher prices received for the produce.
There is no professional assistance required nor initial capital outlays to any business by these proposed rules or amendments.
Given the preponderance of small business farmers and the Programs purpose to promote uniformly packed, high quality products, the Department has provided no lesser or differing requirements or exceptions based on business size.
Smart Growth Impact
These proposed amendments implement economic development strategies outlined in the Department's Smart Growth Plan.
The proposed rules are consistent with the State's smart growth goals as they encourage the continued viability of the State's farmers.
Therefore, the Department anticipates that there will be a positive impact on the State's Development and redevelopment Plan.
Full text of the proposed readoption may be found in the new Jersey Administrative Code at N.J.A.C. 2:71.
