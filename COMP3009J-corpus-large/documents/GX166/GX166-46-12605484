Congressman nominated for award by Lakeshore Habitat for Humanity of Holland
GRAND RAPIDS - Recognizing his many years of working with various Habitat for Humanity organizations, Habitat for Humanity of Michigan Thursday awarded Congressman Pete Hoekstra with its Public Official of the Year Award for 2000.
Hoekstra was honored at Habitat for Humanity of Michigan's Awards Banquet 2000, which was held Thursday evening at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids.
Unfortunately, Hoekstra could not attend the banquet due to scheduled House votes in Washington on Thursday and inclement weather that backed up airline traffic all over the East Coast most of Thursday.
Hoekstra's wife, Diane, attended the event.
Hoekstra sent a videotaped speech accepting the award.
"It is a great honor for me to be recognized by Habitat for Humanity of Michigan as their Public Official of the Year for 2000 because Habitat for Humanity is one of my favorite organizations," said Hoekstra, R-Holland, in his speech.
"Since I was first elected to Congress in 1992, one of my guiding principles has been to help and encourage individuals and communities find ways to help themselves.
I believe that Habitat for Humanity, with its faith-based mission and the way that it helps people by building simple, decent, affordable, houses in partnership with those in need of adequate shelter, is an excellent example of that philosophy."
Dirk Holkeboer, executive director of Lakeshore Habitat for Humanity in Holland, said his organization nominated Hoekstra for the award because of the congressman's willingness to help his organization whenever he is asked.
"Representative Hoekstra has demonstrated in many ways that creating strong communities means getting involved," Holkeboer said.
"We are pleased that he has chosen Habitat for Humanity as where he walks his talk.
Our nomination is a small way of saying thank you to him for his support and encouragement of his efforts."
Hoekstra said he is proud of his projects with Lakeshore Habitat, including his sponsoring of the building of a home in 1998 in conjunction with the House That Congress Built program, working on a project with former HUD Secretary, Congressman and presidential and vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp in 1999, and producing a 2000 calendar for Lakeshore Habitat that featured the top 12 entries to his Congressional Arts Competition.
He also featured several West Michigan Habitat organizations during his annual district bike tour in 1995.
"All I can say about this award is `Thank You,'" Hoekstra said.
"My efforts are only a small representation of the many, many hours that are provided by the thousands of people who volunteer their time to the work that Habitat does.
In my mind, everyone associated with Habitat for Humanity deserves an award.
I am truly humbled by your recognition."
