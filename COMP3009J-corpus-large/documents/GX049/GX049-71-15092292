The President The White House Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President:
I am honored to transmit the 26th annual report of the United States National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), covering October 1, 1996 through September 30, 1997.
This report is submitted in accordance with Section 5(a)7 of the NCLIS Public Law 91-345 as amended.
The Commission is very much aware of the powerful role of public libraries in the National Information Infrastructure.
We are pleased to report that, according to the 1997 NCLIS/American Library Association national survey, 72.3% of U.S. public libraries are now connected to the Internet.
This is a dramatic increase from the 42.9% connection reported in 1996.
Connectivity decreases as the size of the population served decreases, but 66% of rural libraries are still connected.
Connectivity for libraries serving 25,000 and up is nearly complete.
The theme for the Commission's 1997 programs was the importance of library and information services in a networked, electronic environment.
At the request of the Public Printer, NCLIS is undertaking an Assessment of Standards for the Creation, Dissemination, and Permanent Accessibility of Electronic Government Information Products.
The results of that study will be reported in our 1997-1998 annual report.
Thank you for the honor to continue as Chairperson of the United States National Commission on Libraries and Information Science.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Hurley Simon NCLIS Chairperson _______________________________________________________________________

1 HIGHLIGHTS AND HISTORICAL NOTES
And the good news is. . .
72.3% of U.S. public libraries are connected to the Internet, up from 42.9% in 1996.
(And the bad news is. . . only 12.8% have provided access to some or all of their branches).
Connectivity decreases with the size of the population served, but 66% of rural libraries are still connected.
Connectivity for libraries serving 25,000 and up is nearly complete.
These results, confirming the powerful role of public libraries in the National Information Infrastructure, are from the 1997 quick-response mail survey of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) and the American Library Association (ALA).
As indicated above, a theme for NCLIS' 1997 programs was the importance of library and information services in a networked, electronic environment.
Other activities in this area are highlighted below.
* As part of its new responsibility for advising the director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services on general policies with respect to financial assistance related to library services, and for ensuring that IMLS policies and activities are coordinated with other activities of the federal government, NCLIS and the National Museum Services Board held their first joint meeting on May 8, 1997.
* At the request of Public Printer Michael DiMario, Government Printing Office, NCLIS is undertaking an Assessment of Standards for the Creation, Dissemination, and Permanent Accessibility of Electronic Government Information Products.
* The fifth annual Library and Information Services Policy Forum, sponsored by NCLIS and the National Center for Education Statistics, focused on LSTA, State Grant Program: Implications for Use of and Additions to National Library Data.
* Continued administration of State Department funds to support international library and archival activities.
The key statutory functions of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) can be summarized as follows:
1.
NCLIS discovers the needs of the people of the U.S. for library and information services.
2.
NCLIS translates those needs into recommended national policy identifying the needs of the people of the U.S. for library and information services.
3.
NCLIS advises the President, the Congress, state and local governments and others on implementation of national policy.
NCLIS is not a regulatory or operating agency.
To carry out the above functions, it conducts studies, surveys and analyses of the Nation's library and information needs, appraises the adequacies and deficiencies of the current library and information resources and research and development activities, conducts hearings, and issues publications.
These activities support the development of policy advice and recommendations to the President and the Congress.
The Commission has fourteen members appointed for five-year terms by the President and confirmed by the Senate, plus the Librarian of Congress and the Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services as ex officio members.
Selected highlights of NCLIS activities since it was established in 1970 follow:

3 ADVICE TO EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES
The Executive Branch
Library Services and Technology Act
With the passage of the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), P.L. 104-208, NCLIS added to its responsibilities the role of advising the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) on general policy related to financial assistance for library and information services.
Although fiscal 1997 funds were appropriated under the LSCA and the Higher Education Act authorities, plans, regulations and guidelines had to be developed for fiscal 1998 grant programs under the new LSTA authority.
The Commission is required to provide the IMLS Director with general policy advise related to LSTA financial assistance including those National Leadership Grants or Contracts in the following areas:
1.
Education and training of persons in library and information science, particularly in areas of new technology and other critical needs, including graduate fellowships, traineeships, institutes, or other programs.
2.
Research and demonstration projects related to the improvement of libraries, education in library and information science, enhancement of library services through effective and efficient use of new technologies, and dissemination of information derived from such projects.
3.
Preservation or digitization of library materials and resources giving priority to projects emphasizing coordination, avoidance of duplication, and access by researchers beyond the institution or library entity undertaking the project.
4.
Model programs demonstrating cooperative efforts between libraries and museums.
During the first meeting of NCLIS and the National Museum Services Board in May 1997, NCLIS pushed for flexibility in the new grants but also for recognition of the history of support for library education and training in the HEA IIB, repealed when LSTA was enacted.
The final guidelines for FY 1998, the first year of the National Leadership Grants, will be published in the fall of 1997, with applications and awards in 1998.
In keeping with its new charge, on December 11, 1996, the Commission participated in an "LSTA Issues Briefing Roundtable" with representatives from the American Library Association, the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies, and the Urban Libraries Council.
Chairperson Simon and Vice Chair Martha Gould served on a panel in a March 1997 forum for library and museum people advising the IMLS director of their needs and wishes for the new agency and the new LSTA.
Commissioners Frank Lucchino, Mary Furlong, Bobby Roberts and Joan Challinor attended the two-day forum as observers.
In addition to in-person meetings and written comments on the National Leadership Grants, NCLIS commented in writing on the draft strategic plan for the Institute for the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

4 LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES IN A NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT
Assessment of Standards for the Creation, Dissemination, and Permanent Accessibility of Electronic Government Information Products
In fiscal 1997 negotiations continued on the study, Assessment of Standards for the Creation, Dissemination, and Permanent Accessibility of Electronic Government Information Products, to be conducted by NCLIS pursuant to an interagency agreement with the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO).
In a first-phase effort for the study, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (of the National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences) developed an overall study framework which recommended that the assessment's overarching goal should be to evaluate the availability, reliability, and accessibility of existing or planned electronic federal government information products, whether disseminated through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) or directly through public access to agency electronic information services.
The study's main benefactor is the Superintendent of Documents at the GPO, who manages the FDLP.
In early August 1997 NCLIS hired Dr. Forest Woody Horton, management consultant in Washington, DC, to continue developing a statement of work to secure contractual assistance to collect basic data from federal agencies on a broad cross-section sample of government information products.
The purpose of the data collection is to identify and evaluate the most important problems and trends faced by the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) as a result of the increasing migration of government information products from paper and microform to electronic formats and mediums.
Once a vendor has been identified, Dr. Horton will monitor the plan of action.
The study will be completed in 1998, and a final report produced as a deliverable by the contractor will identify findings, conclusions and recommendations, upon which the government (both agencies and the GPO) might take further action.

National Survey of Public Libraries and the Internet
In March 1997 NCLIS, in partnership with the American Library Association, surveyed U.S. public library involvement with the Internet, the global inter-connected computer network, to gather information on public library network costs and infrastructure.
According to the principal survey investigators, Dr. John Carlo Bertot, Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland Baltimore County, and Dr. Charles R. McClure, Distinguished Professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, the survey found that while almost three-fourths of the Nation's public libraries are now connected to the Internet, less than one in seven has connected all or some of their branches.
In addition to information about library connectivity based on the population area served, this study also showed that libraries located in metropolitan areas had a higher rate of connectivity than those in rural areas (87% for central city, 83.5% for suburbs versus 66% for rural areas).
Further results showed that: * 100% of libraries serving one million+ are connected.
* 95.5% of libraries serving over 500,000 but less than one million are connected.
* 93.1% of libraries serving 100,000-499,999 use the Internet.
* 92.5% of libraries serving communities of 25,000-99,999 are connected.
* 79.2% of libraries serving populations of 5,000-24,999 have Internet connections.
* 56.3% of libraries serving fewer than 5,000 are connected.
Data for the survey was received from 2,000 public libraries (with a 71.3% response rate).
The sample was selected from the Universe File of public libraries, set up as part of the Library Statistics Program, a cooperative, 10-year effort of NCLIS and the National Center for Education Statistics.
Additional categories of data, including plans to connect, types and costs of connections, public access and types of services provided for the public, will be published by ALA in a final report to be released fall 1997.
In addition, NCLIS plans to publish this fall a brief, derivative report, based on policy issues and trends from the first NCLIS-sponsored study in 1994 to the new study.
Telecommunication Rates
Throughout the year, NCLIS Members and staff worked closely with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) staff on developing regulations for universal service discounts for schools and libraries.
In the comment submitted to FCC in December 1996, NCLIS stressed identifying high-cost and economically disadvantaged areas and noted the importance of universal service discounts that facilitate library users' access to advanced network services sufficient to individual communities' needs.
In addition, an article by Commissioner LeVar Burton published in USA Today, May 2-4, 1997, urged that schools and libraries need discount online charges.
In part, the article stated, ". . .
These discounts are desperately needed if our Nation's libraries and schools are to get on with the urgent business of providing the public with online connections.
It's up to the FCC to turn Congress's good intentions into reality.
Sixty percent of the jobs created by the year 2000 will require Americans to be computer literate.
Without significant discounts for schools and libraries, 21st century information technology will remain a science-fiction fantasy for millions of children and adults.
. . .
"
On May 7, 1997, the FCC decided on rules giving significant discounts on telecommunication services for the nation's libraries and schools.
The discounts range from 20% to 90%, with the deeper discounts for libraries and schools in rural, high-cost and low-income communities.
The discounts are expected to provide up to $2.25 billion annually beginning January 1, 1998.
Global Information Infrastructure (GII)
The Commission provided comments to the Interagency Working Group on Electronic Commerce on A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce.
The Framework is the Administration's starting point for developing strategies to accelerate the growth of global commerces across the Internet.
The Commission recommended that needs of students and citizens be addressed by involving schools and libraries in framework issues.
It also suggested a sixth framework principle: to address universal services.
Other pertinent activities in this area include staff attendance at sessions of the Conference on Fair Use and staff coordination of plans for a task force on output measures for electronic library services.
Staff also met with the Executive Branch Printing Study Team to discuss reinventing government printing management for the 21st century.
