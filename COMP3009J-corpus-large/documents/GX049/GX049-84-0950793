DESCRIPTION
[ Previous | Top | Next ]
HmmerAlign provides a Wisconsin Package interface to the hmmalign program of Dr. Sean Eddy's HMMER package.
It allows you to access most of hmmalign's parameters from the Wisconsin Package command line or from the its graphical interfaces.
HmmerAlign aligns one or more sequences to a profile HMM.
It can be used as a very efficient way to align a large number of sequences.
First align a small number of representative sequences with PileUp.
Then create a profile HMM from this small alignment with HmmerBuild.
(The profile does not need to be calibrated.)
HmmerAlign uses this profile HMM as a "seed" alignment, to which any number of additional sequences can be quickly aligned.
Aligning a large number of sequences this way is a lot more time efficient, than using PileUp to create the entire alignment.

Lowercase letters are used to represent inserted residues.
Periods represent gaps.
INPUT FILES
[ Previous | Top | Next ]
HmmerAlign takes a profile HMM as one of its inputs.
You can create a profile HMM from a sequence alignment with the HmmerBuild program.
You can also obtain a profile HMM of a known protein family from the Pfam database using HmmerFetch.
HmmerAlign's other input is a valid GCG sequence specification -- either a single sequence or a multiple file specification.
If the multiple file specification represents a sequence alignment (such as an MSF file), HmmerAlign ignores the existing alignment unless you use the -HEURISTIC
alignment parameter or you use the -MAPAlignment parameter with the aligned sequences from which the profile HMM was built.
You can specify multiple sequences in a number of ways: by using a list file, for example @project.list; by using an MSF or RSF file, for example project.msf{*}; or by using a sequence specification with an asterisk (*) wildcard, for example GenEMBL:*.
The function of HmmerAlign depends on whether your input sequence(s) are protein or nucleotide.
Programs determine the type of a sequence by the presence of either Type: N or Type: P on the last line of the text heading just above the sequence.
If your sequence(s) are not the correct type, turn to Appendix VI for information on how to change or set the type of a sequence.
RELATED PROGRAMS

HmmerAlign aligns one or more sequences to a profile HMM. HmmerPfam searches a database of profile HMMs with a sequence query in order to identify known domains within the sequence.
HmmerSearch uses a profile HMM as a query to search a sequence database for sequences similar to the original aligned sequences.
HmmerCalibrate calibrates a hidden Markov model so that database searches using it as a query will be more sensitive.

HmmerEmit randomly generates sequences that match a profile HMM. HmmerConvert converts between different profile HMM file formats and from profile HMM to GCG profile file format.
MEME finds conserved motifs in a group of unaligned sequences and saves these motifs as a set of profiles.
You can search a database of sequences with these profiles using the MotifSearch program.
RESTRICTIONS
[ Previous | Top | Next ]
The MSF file format can accomodate a maximum of 500 sequences.
If the final alignment will contain more than 500 sequences, use the -RSF
parameter to output the results in RSF format.
ALGORITHM
[ Previous | Top | Next ]
See the Profile HMM Analysis Essay for an introduction to profile hidden Markov models and the terminology associated with them.
HmmerAlign uses the Viterbi algorithm to align each sequence to the profile HMM.
This is a dynamic programming algorithm that determines which residues in the sequence correspond to match states in the model (consensus columns in the original alignment).
Residues in the sequence that do not correspond to match states in the model are displayed as insertions in the alignment.
If the sequence is missing a residue where the model specifies a match state, a gap character is put into the alignment.
The alignment is built recursively by finding optimal subalignments of each new sequence to the profile HMM until part of the sequence or the entire sequence is optimally aligned to the entire profile HMM.
If the profile HMM is set to allow local alignments, the final alignment can start at any match state in the model and stop at any subsequent match state.
For more information on how the Viterbi algorithm is used with profile HMMs, see section 5.4, "Searching with profile HMMs," in Chapter 5 of Biological Sequence Analysis by Richard Durbin, et al.
(Cambridge University Press, 1998).
By default, the input sequences are displayed aligned to each other, based on their alignments to the same profile HMM.
To display the input sequences aligned to the original alignment (from which the profile HMM was built), use the -MAPA
lignment parameter.
If you would like to align the input sequences to some other alignment (not the one that was used to build the profile HMM) using the profile HMM as a seed, use the -HEURISTICaligment parameter.

Opin.

PARAMETER REFERENCE
[ Previous | Top | Next ]
You can set the parameters listed below from the command line.
For more information, see "Using Program Parameters" in Chapter 3, Using Programs in the User's Guide.
Following some of the parameters described below is a short expression in parentheses.
These are the names of the corresponding parameters used in the native HMMER package.
Some of the GCG parameters are identical to the original HMMER parameters, others have been changed to fit GCG's conventions.
-BEGin=1
sets the beginning position for all sequences.
When beginning positions are specified for individual sequences in a list file, HmmerAlign ignores the -BEG
in parameter.
-END=100
sets the ending position for all sequences.
When ending positions are specified for individual sequences in a list file, HmmerAlign ignores the -END
parameter.
-MATch (-m)
includes in the alignment only those symbols that align to match states in the profile HMM (consensus positions in the original alignment).
Inserted symbols will not be shown.
Instead, one or more consecutive insert symbols are replaced with a single '*'.
-MAPAlignment=a.msf{*} (--mapali a.msf)
aligns the profile HMM onto an existing alignment, which must be the alignment from which the profile HMM was built.
The profile HMM is "mapped" onto this alignment, allowing you to view the model in the context of the original aligned sequences.
Because the map is stored with the profile HMM, this procedure is quite fast, and the results are consistent with the way the profile HMM was constructed.
-MAPBegin=1
sets the beginning position for all sequences in the alignment file.
When beginning positions are specified for individual sequences in a list file, HmmerAlign ignores the -MAPB
egin parameter.
-MAPEnd=100
sets the ending position for all sequences in the alignment file.
When ending positions are specified for individual sequences in a list file, HmmerAlign ignores the -MAPE
nd parameter.
-HEURISTICalignment=a.msf{*} (--withali a.msf)
with this option the program does not only align the input sequences to the profile HMM.
It also, using a heuristic (nonoptimal) dynamic programming procedure, compares the profile HMM to the fixed alignment specified with this parameter in order to find the best location for the merging of the two alignments.
Finally it displays the results as one alignment.
The aligned input sequences and the fixed alignment have both been compared to the profile HMM but not to each other.
This may be slow and is not guaranteed to produce results that are completely consistent with the way the profile HMM was constructed.
Unlike the -MAPA
lignment parameter, -HEURISTICalignment can be used for any alignment, not just the one from which the model was built.
-RSF
saves the output file in RSF format instead of the default MSF format.
This is necessary if the final alignment will contain more than the 500 sequence maximum imposed by the MSF format.
-NOMONitor
suppresses the display of the program's progress on the screen.
