"The matter of Jewish funds implicitly reveals Switzerland's relationship with its Jewish community".
Journal de GÃ¯Â¿Â½neve et Gazette de Lausanne(November 19, 1996).
Note: Repeatedly since 1944, Jewish organizations claimed that possessions stolen from Jewish individuals or communities must be used for Jewish rebuilding.
Where no one survived to make claim, the money must be given to Jewish organizations for aiding victims and renewing the Jewish culture.
For decades, Swiss Jews, as a small minority, were not heard; in the 1960s, some demands were met.
At this time, Switzerland is reconsidering all the orphan fund issues, determined that examining the past will promote democracy.

"Searching for documents on Nazi Gold".
The Record: News from the National Archives and Records Administration 3, no.5(May 1997): 5-6, 23-24.
Note: In 1944, the US initiated a "Safehaven Program", involving a number of federal agencies, to identify and stop the movement of Nazi assets out of Germany so that the Allies would be able to recover and repatriate them.
Records of these activities and those of reparation groups at the end of the war make up a tremendous store of information relating to Holocaust assets in the holdings of the National Archives at College Park.
Recent interest in these records has resulted in increased research activity at Archives II.

British policy towards enemy property during and after the Second World War.
History Notes No. 13.
London: Foreign 
144 pp. Note: This report concludes that the reunification of Germany in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact changed the face of Europe in a way that those responsible for administering enemy property policy during and after the Second World War could never have anticipated.
Great Britain's recognition of the independence of the Baltic States in 1991 reopened the question of British use of former Baltic Central Banks' gold reserves leading to the transfer in 1992-1993 to each Baltic State gold equal to that deposited with the Bank of England in 1940.

Castelmur, Linus von.
Schweizerisch-alliierte Finanzbeziehungen im 
Zurich: Chronos, 1992.
421 pp. (Revised version of author's PhD from the University of Basel, 1991).
Note: The treatment of the German assets in Switzerland was a central issue for the Swiss Foreign Ministry to resolve after the Second World War.
It was not only about important material interests, but also about the position of Switzerland within the newly formed system of international relations.
From the Allied viewpoint, Switzerland had compromised itself by its cooperation with the German National Socialism.
Thus the Allies demanded exptradition of the booty and all other German assets that had made their way to Switzerland.
The author reconstructs the negotiations from 1945 to 1952 showing how the Swiss Foreign Ministry overcame its isolation within the world community.

The report notes that it was clear during 1943 that German Reichsbank transfers might include gold from occupied countries; however, although the report confirms that the Reichsbank deliveries included victim gold, there is no evidence that the responsible Swiss National Bank parties had knowledge of this.

Note: In 1949, Polish-Swiss Compensation Agreement negotiations called for the restitution of money belonging to Polish citizens on Polish territory on September 1, 1939 who could not be contacted.
It was agreed that Switzerland would deposit the funds into the accounts of the National Bank of Poland.

London: HMSO, 1997.
Note: The Paris Reparation Act, signed in January 1946, regulated reparation payments and called for the restitution of stolen gold.
It set up the Tripartite Gold Commission to which all countries, victims of Nazi theft, could submit claims for restitution of stolen monetary gold.
Only half the gold claimed was found and returned because much German gold had been transferred to Switzerland.
Switzerland claimed it had obtained the gold legally, however, to help reconstruct Europe, Switzerland did make some payment on the claims.
The Dutch received less than 50% of their gold claim and they have never withdrawn this claim.

Eizenstat, Stuart E. Holocaust reverberation: the emerging story of Nazi gold.
Washington: State Department, 1998.
5 pp. (Address to the United Jewish Appeal National Young Leadership Conference, Washington, March 23, 1998).
Note: The author led an 11-agency federal effort to establish the facts about the policies and actions of the US in denying Nazi Germany the economic capacity to wage war; and our postwar efforts to recover the assets looted by Nazis during WWII in order to compensate looted countries and individual victims.
The report established that the German Reichsbank incorporated into its gold reserves looted monetary gold from governments of countries occupied by the Nazis; that much of the looted gold went on Swiss banks; that neutral countries facilitated the Nazi war efforts through gold exchange and supplies; that some victim gold was included in neutral bank gold; and that the Allies did not make an sufficient effort to recover looted assets from neutral countries.
Eizenstat told this group that Switzerland has recently led the international effort to face its past honestly, and suggested goals for sustaining the momentum and moving forward to secure justice for victims and heirs.

Forsyth, Frederick.
"Forsyth proved right".
Dagens Nyheter: DN (Sweden)(1996).
Note: In 1971, Forsyth, researching The Odessa File, was informed that the Nazis had exported a huge shipment of gold secretly to Switzerland in the last weeks of WWII as the result of an August 1944 meeting between German miliary and industrial parties and Swiss bankers.
The final shipment was to fund a new exiled Nazi party and, one day, a new Fourth Reich; it was planned to spirit top SS out of the Allies' hands and into "safe havens" abroad by setting up the ODESSA to fund the leadership abroad, to fund foreign leaders advocating antiSemitism.
Forsyth was shocked as he delved deeper into the events after 1945, to find that the Allies had not scratched the surface of retribution.
The Holocaust was not only a human crime, it was the biggest robbery in history: Jewish assets were confiscated, Jewish labor was exploited in slave labor camps.

"German restitution for National Socialist crimes".
In Nazi gold: the London Conference, 2-4 December 1997, 286-292.
London: HMSO, 1997.
Note: This paper describes the efforts the Federal Republic of Germany has made to compensate Nazi victims.
The very first efforts were restricted to property, not to personal damage but, in 1952, the Luxembourg Agreement between Germany and Israel recognized that Israel bore the tremendous financial burden of providing for many Nazi victims and provided for German aid in resettling Jews in Israel.
Over the years the number of persons eligible for compensation increased; after the fall of the Communist bloc, those victims could submit applications for restitution.

Switzerland, Swiss banks, and the Second World War: the story behind the story.
New York: American Jewish Committee, 1997.
42 pp. Note: This analysis of Switzerland's banking activities during WWII and what happened to Jewish assets in Swiss banks calls for Switzerland to help the remaining Holocaust survivors and to engage in "moral stock-taking" about its business and banking history.
The documents of "Operation Safehaven", a US military intelligence operation assigned to identify and track Nazi assets in neutral countires, indicate that besides holding dormant Jewish accounts, Switzerland had stored German assets and allowed Germany to exchange gold for currency thereby enabling the Reich's war effort.
Switzerland's behavior since WWII demonstrates that the Swiss felt no commitment to uncover victim assets on their own.

The probe also indicates that many other parties, besides the Swiss, and including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), were involved in laundering Nazi money during the war or hoarding stolen assets after the war.
What little remains of the estimated $7.8 billion U.S. dollars in gold confiscated by the Nazis may only come to $65 million, the amount held by the Tripartite Gold Commission, set up after the war to return stolen gold to national treasuries.

Yet because few countries in the world were not assisted during the war by Switzerland's humanitarian services or its diplomatic service, its neutral status was respected by both sides.
Even after the war, it was necessary for Switzerland to compromise with the Allies or risk being shut out of the reconstruction of Europe and the world.

If any victim gold found its way into the TGC pool it would have been in bars smelted by Germans before the Allied occupation, or as coins.

23 pp. Note: By 1939 Germany had defaulted on its loans and exhausted its credit; nearly all trade was on a barter basis and the nation's economic base was too weak to sustain a long war.
To solve this problem the Nazis seized gold in national treasuries when occupying territories and plundered the wealth of businesses and individuals, especially that of European Jews.
This report notes that Great Britain tracked German WWII gold movements, particularly those involving neutral powers, concluding that a relatively detailed picture of German gold dealing can be reconstructed from the records.

"Hitler's Swiss connection".
Philadelphia Inquirer(January 5, 1997).
Note: One month after Swiss banking officials and Jewish leaders announced an agreement to set up an independent commission, chaired by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker, to search for the whereabouts of funds deposited in Switzerland by Holocaust victims, a Swiss citizen named Francois Genoud committed suicide.
Author David Lee Preston suggests that Genoud's suicide may be linked to the new commission as well as to Senator D'Amato's investigations for the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and class action lawsuits against Swiss banks filed by Holocaust survivors and victims' heirs.
Genoud, a Nazi enthusiast and friend of Hitler's, worked with Swiss and German intelligence during WWII; he was then active in setting up the ODESSA network for the transfer of money from Germany and the evacuation of key Nazi leaders at the end of the war.
Postwar, Genoud used his wartime contacts to become an advisor to Arab causes and anti-Israel activities.

In The spoil of Europe: the Nazi technique in political and economic conquest, 89-147.
New York: W.W. Norton, 1941.
Note: In this early report on the plunder of occupied countries by Germany, the author tells of the financial and economic structure imposed on the conquered areas including the seizure of raw materials, finished products, machinery, and trains, as well as the imposition of a charge for "costs of occupation".
Reveille notes that all gold and foreign asset reserves of occupied countries are seized and he tells how the Nazis stripped the Jews of property and wealth.
The author's chapter entitled "The Golden Haul" tells in detail how the gold reserves were taken and how the Bank for International Settlements served Nazi purposes.

"Postwar Europe: the capriciousness of universal values".
Daedalus: Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 126, no.3(Summer 1997): 241-276.
Note: The Nazi gold controversy is hopefully the beginning of a new look into the national mythologies relating to the Holocaust.
The author asserts that the deeper dimension of the Nazi gold controversy is that it reminds us of the fact that the Holocaust was only the climax of a policy whereby a state set out to exclude a group of citizens as "enemies" of "real", ethnically defined citizens, then making much of the population accomplices by allowing them to profit from the elimination of the so-called enemy.
The policy was largely accepted as an unavoidable fact by other national states, and the Holocaust became a form of robbery combined with murder.

"The Holocaust as a business project".
DN: Dagens Nyheter (Sweden)(May 17, 1997).
Note:
During WWII, Switzerland served as a curtain for other countries by creating multinational gold depository for neutral and non-aligned national states - Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Turkey - to use in trading money with the Axis.
After the war, at a time when the Swiss were claiming that they had not received stolen Nazi gold, Swedish officials collaborated the Swiss statements by indicating that they, too, had trust in Emil Puhl, who led the day-to-day operations for the German Reichsbank, and who had assured the Swedes that no stolen gold had been transferred to the Swedish accounts.
According to the author, Puhl planned with the SS how victim gold and other valuables could be used for the war effort.

Steinberg, Jonathan.
The Deutsche Bank and its gold transactions during the Second World War.
Munich: Oscar Beck, 1998.
Note: The Historical Commission to Examine the History of Deutsche Bank in the Period of National Socialism was appointed by the Deutsche Bank in December 1997 because the Bank decided that it had to take up the issues which the debate on gold had aroused.
The bank had already established both an historical archive and an institute for study of the history of the bank.
A history of the bank had been published, but the availability of new Soviet archival sources made another closer study of the gold dealings of the largest German commerical bank under conditions of total war advisable.
Historians appointed included Avraham Barkai, Gerald D. Feldman, Lothar Gail, Harold James, and Jonathan Steinberg, the principal author of the report.
Their investigation showed that the Bank did trade in victim gold during WWII.
In his conclusion, Steinberg concluding that their guilt began in 1933 when they tolerated the outrages which ruined their colleagues noted that the Deutsche Bank directors "profited from the disappearance of Jewish colleagues and rivals and went on pretending that business could go as usual".

What can the non-Swiss learn from its idiosyncracies? Can so unusual a society continue when many of the conditions behind its development no longer exist? The author describes the uniqueness of Switzerland: its direct democracy, universal military service, its four national languages, its wealth, its lack of centralization of state and economy, and its lack of integration into the European Union.
After the publication of this edition, Jonathan Steinberg, appointed by the Deutsche Bank of Switzerland to The Historical Commission to Examine the History of Deutsche Bank in the Period of National Socialism, served as principal author of the report The Deutsche Bank and its gold transactions during the Second World War.

In Nazi gold: the London Conference, 2-4 December 1997, 323-344.
London: HMSO, 1997.
Note: In 1943, the German military ordered the transfer of the Bank of Italy's gold reserves to the North to keep it away from the Allied advance.
It was transferred in two shipments in September to Milan and then later to an armoured tunnel in Fortezza.
In 1944 the gold was signed over to the Germans and a shipment was made to Berlin in February.
A second shipment was sent to Switzerland to settle Swiss National Bank debts and then another shipment was sent to Berlin.
In 1945 all the Italian gold was moved from Berlin - some of it was sent to the Merkers salt mine.

Weinberg, Gerhard L. Testimony.
Washington: House of Representatives, 1998.
(Testimony by Gerhard L. Weinberg, before the House Banking 
Note: Noting that the Eizenstat report is in general very sound, Weinberg points out aspects which he believes need greater emphasis.
First, Switzerland knew that Germany had no funds because they had borrowed from the Swiss in order to make purchases during 1940-1942.
Not only did Switzerland have to know that any future deposits of gold and valuables were loot; in fact, the legal position of the Swiss was that looting was legal and the looter can convey legal title to another.
Even after the war, in 1949, the Swiss signed an agreement to Poland whereby the Polish looted the Swiss accounts of Holocaust victims.
Secondly, as late as April 1945, the Swiss signed a secret agreement with the German government which violated an agreement made with the Allies a month earlier; the agreement was made solely out of greed for money.
Finally, Weinberg believes that the Allied concern that the Swiss government, and the Red Cross, might renounce their role with prisoners of war held by Germany, kept the Allies from pressuring the Swiss government.

The need for such a research report became evident in 1997 when U.S. OMGUS records were found to show that more documentation of the Precious Metals Department of the German Reichsbank had survived the end of the war than was previously known and that these records contained information on victim gold transactions.
This research did not turn up this documentation; among the missing records were the 26 "Melmer" folders of acceptance/delivery receipts for victim gold that accompanied 76 shipments delivered to the Deutsche Reichsbank, records which had been evaluated by American authorities after the war.

Movements of Nazi Gold: uncovering the trail.
Policy studies no. 10.
Jerusalem: World Jewish Congress, 1997.
28 pp. Note: In today's dollars, the Nazi-looted gold amounts to more than $8.5 billion.
More than 2/3 of that sum came from the treasuries of occupied countries; the rest came from gold taken from individuals and businesses.
35% of the gold was found by the Allies in Germany and Austria; most of the rest of the gold was funneled by Germany through Switzerland to purchase strategic gold and services from foreign countries during WWII.
The author presents a flow model to provide a framework for consideration of all elements of gold movement and concludes that Switzerland has not returned all the looted gold stored there.
