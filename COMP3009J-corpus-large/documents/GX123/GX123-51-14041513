Aalders, Gerard and Cees Wiebes.
The art of cloaking ownership: the secret collaboration and protection of the German war industry by the neutrals: the case of Sweden.
Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press and the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, 1996.
v, 210 pp. Note: The authors deal with the activities of Swedish businessmen, representing "neutral" banks and corporations, who cooperated with their counterparts in Nazi-Germany; specifically, there is a focus on the Wallenberg family and their Stockholm Enskilda Bank.
Cloaking, or hiding the true Nazi business ownership from Allies is noted, as is the way neutral banks, including Enskilda, helped to dispose of assets looted from occupied territory or Jews.
2.
Aalders, Gerard and Cees Wiebes.
"Stockholms Enskilda Bank, German Bosch and IG Farben: a short history of cloaking".
Scandinavian Economic History Review 33, no.1(1985): 25-50.
Note: This article represents the authors' early research into the cloaking, or the hiding of Nazi business ownership from Allies, performed by neutral countries.

Aarons, Mark and John Loftus.
Unholy trinity: the Vatican, the Nazis, and the Swiss banks.
Revised ed. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1998.
xviii, 392 pp. Note: This book has caused considerable controversy since it first appeared in 1991 as Ratlines; based on British codebreaking of Swiss bank messages, it tells how western money and stolen Nazi money was laundered through Switzerland and then out through the Vatican Bank, the one bank that could not be audited, to South America and back to Germany.
The paradoxical role of the Dulles brothers as members of the US intelligence community with connections to German business leaders and the Vatican is detailed.
The authors, reporting on the Vatican's Nazi-smuggling network at the end of the war that sent fugitives mostly to Argentina where they were welcomed by the Perons, conclude that the smuggling venture was primarily for the financial interests of non-German investors, including the Vatican.

Alvarez, David.
"No immunity: signals intelligence and the European neutrals, 1939-1945".
Intelligence and National Security 12, no.2(April 1977): 22-43.
Note: U.S. surveillance of neutrals during World War II was minimal until 1942 when the Signal Intelligence Service significantly expanded its codebreaking capabilities.
In this article, the author discusses the surveillance of neutral countries including Switzerland; however, American intelligence concluded that Swiss communications were disappointing other than giving evidence that goods were transhipped to the Axis countries.
5.
Bauer, Yehuda.
Jews for sale? The negotiations between Nazis and Jews 1933-1945.
Paris: Liania Levi, 1996.
306 pp. Note: This book tells of the many attempts to negotiate with the Nazis for the release of Jews in exchange for money, goods, or political benefits.
Before the war, the Nazis were willing to permit total emigration of Jews from Germany.
During the war, Himmler tried to keep open options for a separate peace with Western powers by using first property and then Jewish lives as negotiating tools.

Los Angeles Times(June 17, 1998).
Note: Borer is critical of the Schom report on Nazi and pro-Nazi groups in Switzerland, 1930-1945, stating that it employs disturbing guilt-by-association tactics to make an untenable case.

Borkin, Joseph.
The crime and punishment of I.G. Farben.
New York: Barnes and Noble, 1997.
xi, 250 pp. Note: A number of German chemical companies joined together during World War I; in 1925 these companies merged into a single corporation known as I.G. Farben.
The corporation lined up with Hitler when he became chancellor, and although I.G.'s head Carl Bosch, a vocal anti-Nazi, pushed the industrial need for Jewish scientists before his death in 1940, I.G. led the industrial preparation for war.
During the war, I.G.'s industrial complex built at Auschwitz, to exploit the supply of death camp labor for the production of synthethic rubber and oil, was so enormous that the complex used as much electricity as the city of Berlin.
I.G. also made money from the sale of Zyklon B used in the gas chambers.

Borkin, Joseph and Charles A. Welsh.
Germany's master plan: the story of industrial offensive.
New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1943.

Some of these cartels had representatives in the Allied countries and were able to continue trading during the war.
11.
British policy towards enemy property during and after the Second World War.
History Notes No. 13.
London: Foreign 
144 pp. Note: This report concludes that the reunification of Germany in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact changed the face of Europe in a way that those responsible for administering enemy property policy during and after the Second World War could never have anticipated.
Great Britain's recognition of the independence of the Baltic States in 1991 reopened the question of British use of former Baltic Central Banks' gold reserves leading to the transfer in 1992-1993 to each Baltic State gold equal to that deposited with the Bank of England in 1940.
Individual victims seeking property they had held in the UK before the war can find in this report the policies and machinery for the seizure and release of property.

Henry, Marilyn.
Switzerland, Swiss banks, and the Second World War: the story behind the story.
New York: American Jewish Committee, 1997.
42 pp. Note: This analysis of Switzerland's banking activities during WWII and what happened to Jewish assets in Swiss banks calls for Switzerland to help the remaining Holocaust survivors and to engage in "moral stock-taking" about its business and banking history.
The documents of "Operation Safehaven", a US military intelligence operation assigned to identify and track Nazi assets in neutral countires, indicate that besides holding dormant Jewish accounts, Switzerland had stored German assets and allowed Germany to exchange gold for currency thereby enabling the Reich's war effort.
Switzerland's behavior since WWII demonstrates that the Swiss felt no commitment to uncover victim assets on their own.

Economic relations between Nazi Germany and Franco's Spain, 1936-1945.

Franco turned out to be unwilling to subordinate Spanish interests to either Hitler or the Allies; as the war continued, the Nazis became relatively reliant on Spain for critical raw materials.

Ruth, Arne.
"The Holocaust as a business project".
DN: Dagens Nyheter (Sweden)(May 17, 1997).
Note: During WWII, Switzerland served as a curtain for other countries by creating multinational gold depository for neutral and non-aligned national states - Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Turkey - to use in trading money with the Axis.
After the war, at a time when the Swiss were claiming that they had not received stolen Nazi gold, Swedish officials collaborated the Swiss statements by indicating that they, too, had trust in Emil Puhl, who led the day-to-day operations for the German Reichsbank, and who had assured the Swedes that no stolen gold had been transferred to the Swedish accounts.
According to the author, Puhl planned with the SS how victim gold and other valuables could be used for the war effort.

Hitler's secret ally, Switzerland.
Le Mesa, CA: Pertinent Publications, 1994.
Note: In addition to the availability of the Swiss banking system to the Nazi war effort, the author reports that Switzerland's production of machine tools and precision parts, including jeweled bearings, was devoted to Germany's needs during the war.
The Swiss also furnished electric power to the Third Reich, as well as the use of its key north-south railway system to support German troops in the Mediterranean area.

Ziegler, Jean.
The Swiss, the gold, and the dead: how Swiss bankers helped finance the Nazi war machine.
New York: Harcourt Brace, 1998.
xii, 336 pp Note: The author, a member of the Swiss parliament, expands on Swiss involvement in Nazi German war crimes by showing how top bankers laundered gold stolen from conquered nations' banks, as well as from Jewish homes, businesses, and even victims' teeth.
Ziegler argues that by exchanging this loot for foreign currency and giving Hitler loans and arms, Swiss citizens prolonged the war.
He documents the transfers of funds to South America to aid fleeing Nazis after the war, notes the turning away at the Swiss border of Jewish refugees, the imposition of unconstitutional taxes on Swiss Jews by their own government, and the misappropriation of bank funds from Jewish heirs unable to produce proof of death of family members who died in death camps.
