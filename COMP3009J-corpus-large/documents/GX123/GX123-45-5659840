Aalders, Gerard and Cees Wiebes.
The art of cloaking ownership: the secret collaboration and protection of the German war industry by the neutrals: the case of Sweden.
Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press and the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, 1996.
v, 210 pp. Note: The authors deal with the activities of Swedish businessmen, representing "neutral" banks and corporations, who cooperated with their counterparts in Nazi-Germany; specifically, there is a focus on the Wallenberg family and their Stockholm Enskilda Bank.
Cloaking, or hiding the true Nazi business ownership from Allies is noted, as is the way neutral banks, including Enskilda, helped to dispose of assets looted from occupied territory or Jews.

Aarons, Mark and John Loftus.
Unholy trinity: the Vatican, the Nazis, and the Swiss banks.
Revised ed. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1998.
xviii, 392 pp. Note: This book has caused considerable controversy since it first appeared in 1991 as Ratlines; based on British codebreaking of Swiss bank messages, it tells how western money and stolen Nazi money was laundered through Switzerland and then out through the Vatican Bank, the one bank that could not be audited, to South America and back to Germany.
The paradoxical role of the Dulles brothers as members of the US intelligence community with connections to German business leaders and the Vatican is detailed.
The authors, reporting on the Vatican's Nazi-smuggling network at the end of the war that sent fugitives mostly to Argentina where they were welcomed by the Perons, conclude that the smuggling venture was primarily for the financial interests of non-German investors, including the Vatican.

"The matter of Jewish funds implicitly reveals Switzerland's relationship with its Jewish community".
Journal de GÃ¯Â¿Â½neve et Gazette de Lausanne(November 19, 1996).
Note: Repeatedly since 1944, Jewish organizations claimed that possessions stolen from Jewish individuals or communities must be used for Jewish rebuilding.
Where no one survived to make claim, the money must be given to Jewish organizations for aiding victims and renewing the Jewish culture.
For decades, Swiss Jews, as a small minority, were not heard; in the 1960s, some demands were met.
At this time, Switzerland is reconsidering all the orphan fund issues, determined that examining the past will promote democracy.

Castelmur, Linus von.
Schweizerisch-alliierte Finanzbeziehungen im 
Zurich: Chronos, 1992.
421 pp. (Revised version of author's PhD from the University of Basel, 1991).
Note: The treatment of the German assets in Switzerland was a central issue for the Swiss Foreign Ministry to resolve after the Second World War.
It was not only about important material interests, but also about the position of Switzerland within the newly formed system of international relations.
From the Allied viewpoint, Switzerland had compromised itself by its cooperation with the German National Socialism.
Thus the Allies demanded exptradition of the booty and all other German assets that had made their way to Switzerland.
The author reconstructs the negotiations from 1945 to 1952 showing how the Swiss Foreign Ministry overcame its isolation within the world community.

""An opportunity for investment managers, if..."".
Journal de GÃ¯Â¿Â½neve et Gazette de Lausanne(November 19, 1996).
Note: Prof. Niklaus Blattner, believes that Swiss asset managers can play the Jewish funds affairs to their advantage "by proving their honesty".
He believes that the unclaimed Jewish funds issue is tarnishing the image of the Swiss banking community and that they must "highlight the fact that in Switzerland private property is guaranteed virually to eternity."
Noting that Switzerland acts as asset manager for 35% of the world's private financial assets placed with investment managers, he points out that asset management is the source of 67% of the country's net income.

Eizenstat, Stuart E. Holocaust reverberation: the emerging story of Nazi gold.
Washington: State Department, 1998.
5 pp. (Address to the United Jewish Appeal National Young Leadership Conference, Washington, March 23, 1998).
Note: The author led an 11-agency federal effort to establish the facts about the policies and actions of the US in denying Nazi Germany the economic capacity to wage war; and our postwar efforts to recover the assets looted by Nazis during WWII in order to compensate looted countries and individual victims.
The report established that the German Reichsbank incorporated into its gold reserves looted monetary gold from governments of countries occupied by the Nazis; that much of the looted gold went on Swiss banks; that neutral countries facilitated the Nazi war efforts through gold exchange and supplies; that some victim gold was included in neutral bank gold; and that the Allies did not make an sufficient effort to recover looted assets from neutral countries.
Eizenstat told this group that Switzerland has recently led the international effort to face its past honestly, and suggested goals for sustaining the momentum and moving forward to secure justice for victims and heirs.

Fehrenbach, T. R.
The Swiss banks.
New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966.
vi, 280 pp. Note: This book covers Swiss banking from the period right after WWI when the great flood of gold to Switzerland began.
World War I had bankrupted most European nations; Switzerland's money was backed by gold and still sound, whereas the other European currencies were worthless.
Switzerland became a financial haven; virtually every German corporation doing business abroad opened up Swiss bank accounts enabling them to get around Allied reparation demands and to create a solid financial basis for German industry.
The author goes on to tell of Switzerland's WWII banking schemes during and after WWII when the Swiss invested in Germany when other countries did not believe in the possibility of a German comeback.

Forsyth, Frederick.
"Forsyth proved right".
Dagens Nyheter: DN (Sweden)(1996).
Note: In 1971, Forsyth, researching The Odessa File, was informed that the Nazis had exported a huge shipment of gold secretly to Switzerland in the last weeks of WWII as the result of an August 1944 meeting between German miliary and industrial parties and Swiss bankers.
The final shipment was to fund a new exiled Nazi party and, one day, a new Fourth Reich; it was planned to spirit top SS out of the Allies' hands and into "safe havens" abroad by setting up the ODESSA to fund the leadership abroad, to fund foreign leaders advocating antiSemitism.
Forsyth was shocked as he delved deeper into the events after 1945, to find that the Allies had not scratched the surface of retribution.
The Holocaust was not only a human crime, it was the biggest robbery in history: Jewish assets were confiscated, Jewish labor was exploited in slave labor camps.

Switzerland, Swiss banks, and the Second World War: the story behind the story.
New York: American Jewish Committee, 1997.
42 pp. Note: This analysis of Switzerland's banking activities during WWII and what happened to Jewish assets in Swiss banks calls for Switzerland to help the remaining Holocaust survivors and to engage in "moral stock-taking" about its business and banking history.
The documents of "Operation Safehaven", a US military intelligence operation assigned to identify and track Nazi assets in neutral countires, indicate that besides holding dormant Jewish accounts, Switzerland had stored German assets and allowed Germany to exchange gold for currency thereby enabling the Reich's war effort.
Switzerland's behavior since WWII demonstrates that the Swiss felt no commitment to uncover victim assets on their own.

"Nazi Gold: the untold story".
Newsweek(November 4, 1996): 47-48.
Note: Newsweek's probe discloses that after 50 years of financial sifting, there is no huge stash of Nazi gold in Switzerland - it has been scattered worldwide.
The probe also indicates that many other parties, besides the Swiss, and including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), were involved in laundering Nazi money during the war or hoarding stolen assets after the war.
What little remains of the estimated $7.8 billion U.S. dollars in gold confiscated by the Nazis may only come to $65 million, the amount held by the Tripartite Gold Commission, set up after the war to return stolen gold to national treasuries.

Kinsman, Robert.
Your Swiss bank book: when, why, and how to profit with a secret Swiss bank account.
Homewood, IL: Dow Jones-Irwin, 1975.
viii, 283 pp. Note: In chapters three and eight, author Kinsman summarizes the early history of German-Swiss banking during the Nazi era.
In the early 1930s, because Nazis were aggravated by transfer of German capital to Switzerland, a law, carrying the penalty of capital punishment, was passed in Germany requiring all citizens to declare their foreign holdings.
Many Germans did not reveal the information about Swiss accounts and Gestapo agents, sent to Switzerland, used "diabolical and clever" methods, including bribes and deposits to suspected accounts names, to catch offending Germans.
The Swiss government reacted by passing a 1934 law which put banking secrecy under the offical protection of the penal code as an expansion of Swiss neutrality; this law, and the practice of numbering accounts protected many Germans banking there, are key to the belief that banking can be kept private in Switzerland.

Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group, 1997.
xi, 261 pp. Note: An account based on declassified documents of how the Swiss bankers collaborated with the Nazi war machine.
Swiss banks, inspite of their stated neutrality, accepted stolen gold from the Nazis who seized national gold reserves belonging to occupied countries and then charged them occupation payments and stole their art.
More valuables were stolen directly from the homes and luggage of Jews enroute to labor camps; finally, gold dental work was removed from the mouths of the dead.
Nazi assets were sent to Switzerland in the International Red Cross diplomatic pouch.
The role of the Bank for International Settlements is also described as being helpful to the Nazis.

Although, the author feels that Switzerland is being judged unfairly and without consideration of their situation as a small democratic country surrounded by fascist regimes during WWII, he details mistakes made, problem areas during and after the Nazi period, and important things to consider in the debate over Switzerland's activities.

Due diligence: a report on the Bank of Canada's handling of foreign gold during World War II.
Ottawa: Bank of Canada.
Gold History Project, November 1997.
66 pp. Note:
Report prepared for the Bank of Canada in response to a July 1997 allegation based on an anonymous late-war intelligence report that the bank of Canada had been party, by means of paper transfer, to a complex gold transfer involving six tons of gold shuffled first between Switzerland and Portugal in 1942 and later between Portugal and Sweden with Canada's central bank playing the role of intermediary.
The Bank of Canada called for a thorough investigation, with an independent analysis, by an outside historian, of the Bank's role in the transfer of gold during WWII.
The Bank tried to track the movement of every gold bar shipped in and out of the Bank over a twenty-year period, succeeding in tracing 90% of the bars.
In his analysis, Historian McDowall determined that there is no possibility that gold looted by Germany ever found its way into the Canadian gold stream and that officials at the Bank of Canada exhibited due diligence in handling transfer requests from Europe.

"Hitler's Swiss connection".
Philadelphia Inquirer(January 5, 1997).
Note: One month after Swiss banking officials and Jewish leaders announced an agreement to set up an independent commission, chaired by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker, to search for the whereabouts of funds deposited in Switzerland by Holocaust victims, a Swiss citizen named Francois Genoud committed suicide.
Author David Lee Preston suggests that Genoud's suicide may be linked to the new commission as well as to Senator D'Amato's investigations for the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and class action lawsuits against Swiss banks filed by Holocaust survivors and victims' heirs.
Genoud, a Nazi enthusiast and friend of Hitler's, worked with Swiss and German intelligence during WWII; he was then active in setting up the ODESSA network for the transfer of money from Germany and the evacuation of key Nazi leaders at the end of the war.
Postwar, Genoud used his wartime contacts to become an advisor to Arab causes and anti-Israel activities.

Austria: Institute for Contemporary History, University of Vienna, 1998.
3-page, plus appendices.
Note: The Postsparkassenamt or P.S.K (translated as Postal Savings Bank Office) asked Dr. Oliver Kathkolb to conduct specific research in relation to Nazi victims and the fate of their assets held with P.S.K. from 1938 and 1945.
The P.S.K., a state-guaranteed bank trusted by many small savers and businesses, was dissolved by decree of Hitler in 1938, incorporated into the Postsparkassenamt (Postal Savings Bank Office), with most of its assets transferred to the German Reich.
After the War, the P.S.K. finally became a separate public agency in 1969, again with State guarantees.
The present Board wants to face up to its responsibilites by doing everything possible to document the whereabouts of P.S.K. deposits of Jewish citizens.
This first interim report identifies more than 7000 personal and business accounts held by Jews who had to leave the country after March 1938 or were deported to the Nazi concentration camps.
These accounts were looted by the Nazis.
The P.S.K. is prepared to make a symbolic gesture of making revalued balances of these accounts up to US $200,000.
Further work will be concerned mainly with savings accounts and security deposits.

After the war, at a time when the Swiss were claiming that they had not received stolen Nazi gold, Swedish officials collaborated the Swiss statements by indicating that they, too, had trust in Emil Puhl, who led the day-to-day operations for the German Reichsbank, and who had assured the Swedes that no stolen gold had been transferred to the Swedish accounts.
According to the author, Puhl planned with the SS how victim gold and other valuables could be used for the war effort.

The Deutsche Bank and its gold transactions during the Second World War.
Munich: Oscar Beck, 1998.
Note: The Historical Commission to Examine the History of Deutsche Bank in the Period of National Socialism was appointed by the Deutsche Bank in December 1997 because the Bank decided that it had to take up the issues which the debate on gold had aroused.
The bank had already established both an historical archive and an institute for study of the history of the bank.
A history of the bank had been published, but the availability of new Soviet archival sources made another closer study of the gold dealings of the largest German commerical bank under conditions of total war advisable.
Historians appointed included Avraham Barkai, Gerald D. Feldman, Lothar Gail, Harold James, and Jonathan Steinberg, the principal author of the report.
Their investigation showed that the Bank did trade in victim gold during WWII.
In his conclusion, Steinberg concluding that their guilt began in 1933 when they tolerated the outrages which ruined their colleagues noted that the Deutsche Bank directors "profited from the disappearance of Jewish colleagues and rivals and went on pretending that business could go as usual".

What can the non-Swiss learn from its idiosyncracies? Can so unusual a society continue when many of the conditions behind its development no longer exist? The author describes the uniqueness of Switzerland: its direct democracy, universal military service, its four national languages, its wealth, its lack of centralization of state and economy, and its lack of integration into the European Union.
After the publication of this edition, Jonathan Steinberg, appointed by the Deutsche Bank of Switzerland to The Historical Commission to Examine the History of Deutsche Bank in the Period of National Socialism, served as principal author of the report The Deutsche Bank and its gold transactions during the Second World War.

Note: This research report focuses on the records of the Deutsche Reichsbank, in particular the records of the Precious Metals Department, the Foreign Exchange Department and the Securities Department after the collapse of the Reich in 1945 and after the liquidation of the Reichsbank in 1976.
The need for such a research report became evident in 1997 when U.S. OMGUS records were found to show that more documentation of the Precious Metals Department of the German Reichsbank had survived the end of the war than was previously known and that these records contained information on victim gold transactions.
This research did not turn up this documentation; among the missing records were the 26 "Melmer" folders of acceptance/delivery receipts for victim gold that accompanied 76 shipments delivered to the Deutsche Reichsbank, records which had been evaluated by American authorities after the war.

xii, 336 pp Note: The author, a member of the Swiss parliament, expands on Swiss involvement in Nazi German war crimes by showing how top bankers laundered gold stolen from conquered nations' banks, as well as from Jewish homes, businesses, and even victims' teeth.
Ziegler argues that by exchanging this loot for foreign currency and giving Hitler loans and arms, Swiss citizens prolonged the war.
He documents the transfers of funds to South America to aid fleeing Nazis after the war, notes the turning away at the Swiss border of Jewish refugees, the imposition of unconstitutional taxes on Swiss Jews by their own government, and the misappropriation of bank funds from Jewish heirs unable to produce proof of death of family members who died in death camps.
