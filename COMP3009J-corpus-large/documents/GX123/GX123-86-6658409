The objective of the proposed investigation is to empirically test the effects of various chromosomal structural differences, chromosome map length, and mating designs on gene transfer using the domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus and one of its wild relatives, H. petiolaris, as the experimental system.
AP: Low resolution genetic linkage maps currently being generated for these species will be used to determine the size and location of chromosomal differences between the taxa.
Upon completion of the genetic linkage maps, progeny from three different interspecific mating designs and a naturally occurring hybrid swarm will be surveyed for the mapped molecular markers and graphical genotypes will be generated for each individual.
The graphical genotypes will then be used to assess the effectiveness of different mating designs for disrupting parental linkage blocks and thus enhancing introgression.

The objective of the proposed investigation is to empirically test the effects of various chromosomal strutural differences, chromosome map length, and mating designs on gene transfer using the domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus and one of its wild relatives, H. petiolaris, as the experimental system.
AP: This will be accomplished by completing low resolution genomic maps currently being generated for both these species, as well as by generating a low resolution map, for an interspecific cross between these species.
Upon completion of the three linkage maps, progeny representing the end products of the three different mating designs, as well as individuals from a naturally occuring hybrid swarm will be surveyed for parental molecular markers and a graphical genotype will be generated for each individual.
The graphical genotypes will then be used to assess the effectiveness of different chromosomal structural arrangements for limiting gene flow and to test the efficiency of different mating designs for disrupting parental linkage blocks and thus enhancing introgression.
PR: 9301 TO 9312 Low resolution genetic linkage maps have been generated for the domesticated sunflower, H. annuus, and one of its wild relatives, H. petiolaris, based on segregation of 208 and 306 RAPD loci, respectively.
Although the genetic markers were distributed on the same number of linkage groups for each species, total map length varied dramatically, ranging from 1200 cM in H. annuus to over 1900 cM in H. petiolaris.
Analysis of gene order relationships revealed a minimum of five major chromosomal rearrangements differentiating the two species, including both inversions and translocations.

Identify a set of sunflower inbred lines which represent broad genetic diversity of cultivated sunflower.
AP: Conduct analyses of isozyme markers to determine the purity of the inbred sunflower lines in the initial collection.
Screen a limited set of random sunflower cDNA probes against various restriction enzyme digests of DNA from a collection of pure inbred cultivated sunflower lines which are thought to be genetically diverse.
Identify the inbred lines which show the greatest polymorphism.
Future experiments will expand the number of probestested in preparation for the development of a low density RFLP map of sunflower.
PR: 9301 TO 9312 cDNA clones originating from leaves of inbred line HA 89 continued to be screened for polymorphism against a set of 23 USDA released parental lines.
We used EcoR1, EcoRV and HindIII as the restriction enzymes.
In addition to the 206 cDNA clones studied in 1992, 200 more probes were screened in 1993.
Of the total 406 cDNA probes evaluated, frequencies of RFLPs up to 91% were observed among the 23 lines with a single enzyme digestion.
When all 3 enzymes were used, 94% of the cDNA clones detected polymorphisms.
We selected a subset of 3 fertility restoration (RHA) lines and 3 maintainer (HA) lines for intercrosses.
With this subset, 90% of the 406 probes still showed polymorphism.
The effectiveness of the restriction enzymes follows the order of EcoR1 
F1 plants of five crosses among the subset of six lines were grown in the greenhouse in the spring of 1993, and F2 plants were sampled in the summer of 1993 for linkage analysis.
These five populations still have the potential to map a minimum of 348 probes.
The high frequencies of RFLPs among these sunflower lines demonstrated the high degree of genetic diversity of USDA released lines and their usefulness in the development of an RFLP map in cultivated sunflower.
