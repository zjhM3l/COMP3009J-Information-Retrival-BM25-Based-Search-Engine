"No immunity: signals intelligence and the European neutrals, 1939-1945".
Intelligence and National Security 12, no.2(April 1977): 22-43.
Note: U.S. surveillance of neutrals during World War II was minimal until 1942 when the Signal Intelligence Service significantly expanded its codebreaking capabilities.
In this article, the author discusses the surveillance of neutral countries including Switzerland; however, American intelligence concluded that Swiss communications were disappointing other than giving evidence that goods were transhipped to the Axis countries.

"ICRC action during the Second World War".
International Review of the Red Cross no. 317(March 1, 1997): 156-177.

Of the 49 people noted in wartime OSS docuemnts, only 18 worked for the organization, and only three committed reprehensible acts: one in illicit currency dealings, two with espionage, apparently for personal gain.
This is an updated version of a report on the current state of investigations by the ICRC.

The Swiss corridor: espionage networks in Switzerland during World War II.
London: J.M. Dent 
Note: During WWI, Switzerland managed to retain its neutrality, although there was a great deal of money spent on defence.
During WWII, Switzerland was able to maintain its neutrality through a number of techniques including secret intelligence.
Rudolf Roessler, a German Ã¯Â¿Â½migrÃ¯Â¿Â½ journalist, began to write about the Third Reich shortly after his arrival in Switzerland in 1934.
Roessler was asked to help the Swiss intelligence service; throughout the war, he never met his Swiss contact in person but he provided the Swiss with accurate information about German activities.

"ICRC activities during the Second World War".
International Review of the Red Cross no. 314(September 1, 1996): 562-567.
Note: Researchers in the U.S. have found WWII OSS documents containing allegations about the Red Cross during that war.
The allegations were of two types: illicit dealings in victim funds or valuables and espionage and infiltration by agents of Nazi Grmany.
This is a preliminary ICRC note on the subject: research has shown that a former ICRC delegate Giuseppe Beretta was implicated by the Turkish police in a case of illicit dealings, although there is no proof that he misused the ICRC mail to transfer funds or valuables; there have also been charges of espionage against ICRC delegates, especially Jean-Robert Pagan who left the Red Cross in early 1942, was charged with espionage late in late 1943, and executed in December 1944.

"The inevitable compromises of Swiss neutrality to survive the war... and preserve solidarity".
Journal de GÃ¯Â¿Â½neve et Gazette de Lausanne(November 19, 1996).
Note: In this interview, historian Antoine Fleury claims that it is mythology to believe that a neutral country can avoid making concessions.
Yet because few countries in the world were not assisted during the war by Switzerland's humanitarian services or its diplomatic service, its neutral status was respected by both sides.
Even after the war, it was necessary for Switzerland to compromise with the Allies or risk being shut out of the reconstruction of Europe and the world.

Hitler's secret bankers: the myth of Swiss neutrality during the Holocaust.
Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group, 1997.
xi, 261 pp. Note: An account based on declassified documents of how the Swiss bankers collaborated with the Nazi war machine.
Swiss banks, inspite of their stated neutrality, accepted stolen gold from the Nazis who seized national gold reserves belonging to occupied countries and then charged them occupation payments and stole their art.
More valuables were stolen directly from the homes and luggage of Jews enroute to labor camps; finally, gold dental work was removed from the mouths of the dead.
Nazi assets were sent to Switzerland in the International Red Cross diplomatic pouch.
The role of the Bank for International Settlements is also described as being helpful to the Nazis.

"Dormant accounts, Nazi gold, and loot".
JML Swiss Investment Marketplace: Holocaust Assets.4-page website Note: Maissen, a historian at the University of Potsdam, Germany, notes six problem areas in the public debate criticizing Swiss WWII policy: dormant bank accounts; Nazi gold; loot; trade with Nazi Germany; policy toward Jewish refugees; and, issues of neutrality.
Although, the author feels that Switzerland is being judged unfairly and without consideration of their situation as a small democratic country surrounded by fascist regimes during WWII, he details mistakes made, problem areas during and after the Nazi period, and important things to consider in the debate over Switzerland's activities.

Ruth, Arne.
"The Holocaust as a business project".
DN: Dagens Nyheter (Sweden)(May 17, 1997).
Note: During WWII, Switzerland served as a curtain for other countries by creating multinational gold depository for neutral and non-aligned national states - Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Turkey - to use in trading money with the Axis.
After the war, at a time when the Swiss were claiming that they had not received stolen Nazi gold, Swedish officials collaborated the Swiss statements by indicating that they, too, had trust in Emil Puhl, who led the day-to-day operations for the German Reichsbank, and who had assured the Swedes that no stolen gold had been transferred to the Swedish accounts.
According to the author, Puhl planned with the SS how victim gold and other valuables could be used for the war effort.

Steinberg, Jonathan.
Why Switzerland? 2d ed. Munich: Cambridge University Press, 1996.
xvi, 300 pp. Note: Steinberg, European historian at the University of Cambridge, attempts to answer three related questions about Switzerland in this book: why has such an exception to European norms survived? What can the non-Swiss learn from its idiosyncrasies? Can so unusual a society continue when many of the conditions behind its development no longer exist? The author describes the uniqueness of Switzerland: its direct democracy, universal military service, its four national languages, its wealth, its lack of centralization of state and economy, and its lack of integration into the European Union.
After the publication of this edition, Jonathan Steinberg, appointed by the Deutsche Bank of Switzerland to The Historical Commission to Examine the History of Deutsche Bank in the Period of National Socialism, served as principal author of the report The Deutsche Bank and its gold transactions during the Second World War.
