Petroleum Extraction in Ventura County, California: An Industrial History
BACKGROUND: MMS requested researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara to conduct an historic analysis of the petroleum extraction industry in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties from 1950 to 2015.
The researchers developed separate, stand-alone reports on each of the three counties include an analysis of the oil industry's evolution and projected future, its relationships with the surrounding communities, and its role in a complex economy.
They also investigated the regulatory context in which oil does business, and to the kinds of innovations developed to operate in the Santa Barbara Channel's natural and social environment.
In addition to these reports, they produced an inventory of all firms operating in the tri-counties during these years, and which oil fields they operated (OCS Study MMS 98-0061).
This summary was developed by the researchers.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to provide an historical analysis of the evolution of the petroleum extraction industry in Ventura County, including its changing business structure, economic impacts, technological advances, local social contexts, and governmental effects.
We attempt to depict a comprehensive view of what an industry means as it operates in a given locale, documenting a wide variety of both direct and indirect consequences and relationships.
DESCRIPTION: Our methods are diverse, tailored to the specific research issue and available data.
We interviewed or consulted over 100 persons with relevant views or information drawn from a wide variety of business, government, and civic groups.
We scrutinized government statistics from state, federal, and local agencies.
We used multivariate regression analysis to determine economic effects; we examined tax documents to specify industry dollars contributed to the county tax base.
Through interviews, phone inquiries, and document searches, we derived estimates of the industry's local philanthropic contributions.
We reconstruct, using state of California archives, a record of company activities in terms of which firms operated in which fields at which time points.
We also provide information regarding oil firm adaptation and the role of environmental consulting companies as part of the industry.
We provide information regarding local support and opposition to the industry, including oil's history in many communities.
We indicate the nature of the industry's labor supply, including the wage levels of personnel.
We analyze the kind of regulations and local oversight faced by the industry and the way permitting activities, regulations, and controversies impacted local government operations.
We also discuss technological advances stimulated by local drilling and production.
Finally, we offer scenarios of potential future local operations.
SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum industry's long presence in Ventura County has had important impacts both on the industry and the region, but not always of the expected kind.
In economic terms, the effects have primarily been significant in terms of contributions to the county tax base (especially in certain earlier periods), as opposed to significantly stimulating growth in the private economy.
In terms of business structure, the Ventura County oil industry has consistently allowed room for small operators and independent producers, despite dominance by major companies.
In terms of social context, the industry has been minimally controversial, probably due to its long history in the county and popular recollections of the industry's economic benefits.
New migrants to Ventura County are increasingly environmentalist and decreasingly aware of oil's local history, thus changing the context under which oil producers operate.
Unlike Santa Barbara County, Ventura County's neighbor to the north, oil regulation here was relatively lenient until the 1980s.
Many oil projects operate under permits issued in the 1950s, which include few conditions.
The county's revision of oil permit conditions has coincided with a drop in new oil activity, meaning that while the county is now as stringent as other coastal areas in terms of oil oversight, few projects are subject to this scrutiny.
Any new projects proposed for Ventura County, including new offshore projects requiring onshore support (or onshore drilling apparatus), would be carefully scrutinized.
STUDY RESULTS:
The decline in volume of oil produced onshore in Ventura County was compensated by offshore development, at least through the early 1980s.
Based on our econometric analysis, it appears that although oil activity has been a steady part of the local economies over the period of our study, the region would have been equally as well off economically had there been no such activity.
We could not find, using our regression analyses, any statistical pattern of positive impacts of the industry's presence on the overall scale of economic activity.
In terms of property tax payments, the industry paid over half of the county's property taxes during the 1950s, but now contributes just over one percent, or approximately $6,000,000 dollars in 1997-8.
The industry structure was remarkable in the degree that opportunities for new entrants continued over time, rather than the tendency toward monopolization often characteristic of industrial maturation.
While major oil companies predominated until very recently, large independents and smaller operators have constantly been a significant part of the industry, keeping over 100 different producers in the fields of Ventura County across the years.
Turnover among producers (except, until recently, the major companies) has been a regular feature of the county's industry, with successive waves of operators finding opportunity in the declining fields that no longer seemed as promising to previous producers.
That is true of OCS activity, where a significant shift continues of major operators leaving the area, turning their investments over to smaller independents.
Some oil-related firms diversified beyond petroleum operations, including a significant sector of environmental consulting which is strong in Ventura County and the tri-county region.
Ventura County differs from other central coast oil extraction regions in its limited degree of organizing around oil as an environmental issue.
Some local residents and organizations have opposed or oil installations or worked for mitigations, but anti-oil measures have not been put before county voters (as they have successfully been in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties).
The particulars of drilling offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel, including regional resistance and characteristics of the physical environment have motivated some technological innovations, including pollution abatement systems and enhanced capacity to drill at great water depths.
State and federal regulations shape the context in which oil's labor force operates in the Channel region, and many offshore platform workers make Ventura County their home.
Current proposals for additional oil activities (and likely scenarios for the near-term) involve one or two slant-drilling initiatives.
Given the modest impacts of the industry's current production regime, it is doubtful that such operations will have important aggregate impacts on the county's economy, social make-up, or governmental structure (although site-specific impacts will be scrutinized).
