I never said otherwise.
All I pointed out is, that USAF reg's do say that it is ok for members, veterans and retirees to wear their medals, ribbons and badges on appropriate occassions and on appropriate types of clothing.
I do a lot of Scottish events throughout the year, and I wear my USAF (only) awards and badges on both my Highland Formal and Day articles of clothing.
Since these are appropriate articles of clothing and the events are appropriate events, there is no problem.
I have been known to wear my Highland Formal to CAP and USAF formal events, in place of my Mess Dress...
I recall seeeing a CAP bagpipe band marching in a photo in a CAP Annual Report to Congress.
They were wearing CAP blue shirts-USAF-style, with kilts.
Very snazzy! Anyone know what happened to that band? Are they still marching and piping? The USAF *does* have a tartan officially approved by the proper Scottish tartan organization.
CAP *does* have a military music Summer event...
