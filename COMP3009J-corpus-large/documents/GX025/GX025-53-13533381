The graphics options use scalable vector graphics technology (SVG) and require the use of an SVG viewer such as the Adobe SVG Viewer 3.0 (or above).
The graphics options are currently available for the following types of data: * Single-year bar graphs for a particular state/jurisdiction; * Multiple-year line chart for a particular state/jurisdiction; * A map of single-year cross-state comparisons (comparing one or more states to each other or the nation for a particular variable); * A map of multiple-year cross-state comparisons (comparing a variable between two or more states across years).
To see either the single-year bar graphs or the multiple-year line chart, click on "Show Graphic" in the right-hand side above the table.
(Click on "SVG Viewer Required" if you need more information about how to view these graphics.)

Once you have selected the "Show Graphic" option, you will see a "Graphics Options" box at the top of your screen that will allow you to dynamically generate new graphics based on the following: * Data Type (Average Scale Score or secondary statistic) * Year (if applicable) * Subgroup (if applicable) * Display Values (shows each statistic as part of the graph).
[Note: you can add/delete years or subgroups by selecting the "User Options" pull-down menu.]
Printing/Saving the SVG images
You can easily cut and paste any of the SVG images into software packages such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint or Excel.
To do this, right click on the SVG image and select "Copy SVG."
Then go to your desired application and select "Edit/Paste Special" and select "Bitmap" (or "Device-Independent Bitmap").
Continue on to learn how to generate a dynamic SVG map of the United States that compares results across jurisdictions.
