I also would like to thank the Organization of Latino American Students (OLAS) for their leadership in co-hosting this event.
I About a year ago, I addressed a group of students and faculty from the JFK School of Government at Harvard.
The title of that conference was: In Search of a New Puerto Rican Consensus: 50 Years of Commonwealth.
On that occasion, I discussed Puerto Ricos struggle to achieve democratic self-government throughout the 20th century and explained why the Commonwealths Constitution of 1952 was our greatest democratic achievement.
Commonwealth status allowed Puerto Ricans to achieve unprecedented economic development, to strengthen our democratic institutions, and to promote our unique cultural identity.
Many people today take those achievements for granted.
They seem to forget that before the establishment of Commonwealth, Puerto Rico was a depressed, poor, and undemocratic colony of the United States.
Puerto Rico was governed from Washington.
Insular governors were appointed by the President, and served at the Presidents will and many times at the will of Washington bureaucrats who did not understand or care about Puerto Rico, first under the Department of War (from 1900 to 1933) and then under the Department of the Interior (from 1933-1952).
The territorial regime was an economic disaster.
Indeed, Puerto Rico came to be known as the poorhouse of the Caribbean.
The per capita income was $121 a year, not much more than at the turn of the century.
Politically, the situation was equally inauspicious.
The colonial policy was premised on the racist view that Puerto Ricans were not mature enough to govern themselves, nor were they white enough to be incorporated as part of the United States.
Although Puerto Ricans became United States citizens by virtue of the Jones Act of 1917, their political rights remained very limited and their quality of life was not much better than the one they enjoyed at the turn of the century.
Puerto Ricans learned the hard way that neither democracy nor economic progress necessarily followed the U.S. flag in Puerto Rico.
That was the sad reality of Puerto Rico during the first 40 years under the American flag.
This began to change in 1940 when the Popular Democratic Party, led by Luis MuÃ¯Â¿Â½oz MarÃ¯Â¿Â½n, won the legislative elections.
In 1948, Luis MuÃ¯Â¿Â½oz MarÃ¯Â¿Â½n became the first elected governor in Puerto Ricos history.
Two years, later, in 1950, Congress adopted Public Law 600 to allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise the right to self-determination and draft their own Constitution.
The extraordinary nature of this process has been the source of much confusion as to the essence of Commonwealth.
On the one hand, unlike an ordinary federal law, or a traditional organic act, this law was a vehicle to establish a compact between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States.
Section 2 of the Act provided: This Act shall be submitted to the qualified voters of Puerto Rico for acceptance or rejection through an island-wide referendum to be held in accordance with the laws of Puerto Rico.
Upon approval of this Act by a majority of the voters participating in such a referendum, the Legislature of Puerto Rico is authorized to call a constitutional convention to draft a constitution for said island of Puerto Rico.
In other words, the effectiveness of Public Law 600 depended on the people of Puerto Ricos approval in the ballots.
Public Law 600, as approved by Congress, stated that, fully recognizing the principle of government by consent, this act is now adopted in the nature of a compact so that the people of Puerto Rico may organize a government pursuant to a constitution of their own adoption.
Upon approval of the terms of said Act and their own constitution by the people of Puerto Rico, Commonwealth was born.
Commonwealth status was the result of a compromise, which permitted Puerto Rico to enjoy a high degree of self-government compatible with the federal system.
Contemporary political theorists have recognized the benefits of autonomous arrangements, such as Commonwealth, to accommodate political, cultural and economic goals.
This kind of compact is sui generis in the history of the United States and maybe for that reason many have misunderstood it.
However, that does not make it less valid or less legitimate.
Indeed, in 1953, the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution 748 (VIII), concluding that the Commonwealth provided an acceptable measure of self-government for Puerto Rico and therefore Puerto Rico was taken out of the list of non-self governing territory.
Resolution 748 recognized that, and I quote, in the framework of their Constitution and of the compact agreed upon with the United States of America, the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have been invested with attributes of political sovereignty which clearly identify the status of self-government attained by the Puerto Rican people as that of an autonomous political entity.
From a political perspective, in 1952, Congress devolved the sovereignty to which the people of Puerto Rico were entitled in the first place, therefore ending the colonial regime.
In turn, the people of Puerto Rico freely agreed to a compact that entailed a voluntary delegation of powers to be exercised by the U.S. government.
Some people question whether such transfer of sovereignty is possible or whether it ever happened.
They tend to assess the process from a formalistic and rather narrow perspective.
A better reading of the process must include considerations of political theory, constitutional doctrine and international law.
Based on this holistic approach it is necessary to conclude that Puerto Rico is a sovereign body politic with the potential of broad autonomy in certain areas and under the federal jurisdiction on others.
The U.S. Congress had then and has now broad discretion under the Constitution and under international law to establish an autonomous Commonwealth, following the federal model of dual sovereignty, out of the reach of its plenary powers.
In other words, Congress can expand today Puerto Ricos sovereignty, but cannot diminish it or do away with it.
Beyond the complex legal issues, it is undeniable that Commonwealth has worked.
Using its fiscal autonomy and flexibility, Commonwealth combines economic measures and social programs to transform Puerto Rico into a modern and democratic society.
Our symbols, our language, our literary tradition, our folklore and high-culture, all resurged with strength and became a healthy basis for a powerful sense of Puerto Rican nationhood.
I speak of nationhood in a sociological sense.
In that sense, Puerto Rico is a nation.
Moreover, it was Commonwealth that gave true meaning to the U.S. citizenship of the Puerto Ricans.
Under Commonwealth, Puerto Ricans have experienced, at last, their U.S. citizenship as a vehicle to achieve democratic rights and to enjoy opportunities for progress.
For the majority of Puerto Ricans, their United States citizenship is seen in terms of shared democratic values and aspirations; not in terms of full vis a vis partial membership to the Union; they prefer autonomy rather than full integration.
II Commonwealth has served Puerto Rico well, and it has also been very beneficial for the United States.
Puerto Rico contributes to the common defense, and has played an important role in the development of U.S.-Latin-American relationships.
Our contribution to the U.S. economy is substantial.
Puerto Rico is today the # 4 per capita consumer of U.S. goods in the world.
In 1999, Puerto Rico alone purchased $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, which translates into over 270,000 jobs in the mainland.
The importance of Puerto Rico as a U.S. market must not be underestimated.
Notwithstanding the amazing accomplishments of Commonwealth, it was not meant to be an immutable model.
The world has changed since 1952 and the majority of Puerto Ricans would like to see Commonwealth status modified and improved, so it can better adjust to the modern world.
Today, there are roughly 3 competing future alternatives to our current status: Statehood, Enhanced Commonwealth and Independence.
Assuming that we can reach a procedural consensus, which we must do before we move forward, the best alternative available to Puerto Rico is the enhanced autonomic model or what has been called the enhanced Commonwealth.
What I mean is a perfected autonomy with additional tools, particularly economic tools, and enhanced democratic participation for the Puerto Rican people, compatible with the federal system.
I believe that this enhanced autonomic status is the best route not only for Puerto Rico, but for the United States as well.
The idea of enhanced Commonwealth may challenge your assumptions and understandings of traditional concepts of sovereignty, citizenship and federalism.
But the world has changed and these concepts are changing as well.
In theory, both statehooders and independentistas alike, have offered compelling arguments to support their status preferences.
Statehooders argue that they are second-class and disenfranchised American citizens, and that statehood is the natural course for Puerto Rico.
On the other side of the spectrum, the independentistas argue that Puerto Rico is a nation, and as such our destiny is to become an independent republic and a member of the international community of independent countries.
Both, as I said, present reasonable, but mutually exclusive discourses.
Let me briefly state the main obstacles to statehood and independence.
Statehood: 1.
The first reason why statehood is not a truly practicable alternative is that Puerto Ricans do not want it.
This is a major obstacle.
After over a hundred years of US-Puerto Rico relationship, statehood has never achieved a majority of the popular vote.
Commonwealth, as an autonomous model, was chosen by an overwhelming majority of the people in 1952, and it has been favored in every plebiscite since-(in 1967, 1993 and 1998).
So, statehood is a problem in terms of self-determination and democracy since the people of Puerto Rico do not want it.
2.
The second obstacle to statehood is that Puerto Rico will loose its unique tools for economic development, i.e. fiscal autonomy and economic flexibility because of the reach of the uniformity clause.
Statehood is not an economic model in itself.
The immediate economic consequences will be: unavailability of special tax incentives to attract industry and investment, imposition of the federal tax structure to our economy, drastic downsizing of local government and, therefore higher unemployment; an increase on welfare dependency; and other side effects.
Statehood does not produce new tools; therefore it will perpetuate welfare dependency.
3.
The third problem is that statehood is not compatible with the maintenance of a unique and separate nationality.
This is a problem for Puerto Rico and the United States, since the overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans, whether they admit it or not, think that their nationhood and cultural identity is not negotiable.
To that extent, statehood is also a self-determination issue for the United States.
4.
The fourth obstacle for statehood, at least in the short term, I believe is the legacy of corruption from the last administration.
This legacy has hurt us all, and has made being an advocate for Puerto Rico much more challenging.
The number of convictions and guilty pleas of persons, who served in leadership positions of the Statehood administration, unfortunately undermines the credibility of those who passionately believe in the statehood cause.
I do not believe the leadership of the statehood movement has yet come to grips with how much damage was done to their movement in Washington DC because of individuals in San Juan who, either knowingly participate or turn their backs, while others used public office for political and personal gain.
Independence 1.
Independence faces today an even greater challenge since only about 5% of the population favors it.
2.
Independence is not compatible with the preservation of U.S citizenship, and the permanence of a stable political bond with the United States, which is so important for Puerto Ricans.
3.
From an economic standpoint, independence it is likely to bring unnecessary unrest and lack of economic stability.
This will depend on the kind of independence that can be negotiated, but as of today, independence represents economic disaster for Puerto Rico.
You may say about the Commonwealth what Winston Churchill is credited to have said about democracy, this is: democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.
I favor Commonwealth not because it is perfect, or sacred, but because it still provides the best model available considering the political and economic realities of the United States and Puerto Rico.
From the Puerto Rican perspective, commonwealth is the only status that harmonizes the political, cultural and economic goals of the people.
Any status alternative for the future should be measured from 3 perspectives: economy, democracy, and nationhood/culture.
From these perspectives, Commonwealth, as a third way, represents the only alternative that truly can harmonize the seemingly conflicting aspirations of Puerto Ricans and as well as the interests of the United States.
As opposed to statehood, Commonwealth is the flexible model that can evolve and adapt.
As a third way for the future, Commonwealth must be enhanced to adapt to the new challenges and realities of the 21st century.
Indeed, the "founders" of the Commonwealth thought of it as an important, but preliminary step towards a fully autonomous and democratic status.
To truly meet the expectations of its founders, the Commonwealth must be enhanced and strengthened.
As Governor Sila CalderÃ¯Â¿Â½n recently said: Fifty years ago when we entered into the compact with Congress, it fared quite well when compared with the prevailing colonial arrangements then existing in the Caribbean.
Half a century later there are areas where that is no longer the case.
The enhanced Commonwealth is the route to follow.
III I will now touch on some of the problematic areas that need to be addressed in any enhanced Commonwealth proposal.
First Problem: The problem of generic consent.
This is a problem of democratic asymmetry in as much as many federals laws apply to Puerto Rico, without a formal mechanism of participation by the people.
Federal laws that are not essential to the Commonwealth compact should be applicable only if the people of Puerto Rico agree to their application.
For example, one may argue that Homeland Security laws are essential to the compact by virtue of the common defense tenet, but that Puerto Rico may be excluded from certain economic laws that do not respond to the Island reality.
Second Problem: Unwarranted limitations on Puerto Ricos international relations.
Since Puerto Ricans does not vote for the President and does not elect voting legislators for Congress, there is no legitimate reason to apply the same restrictions that states have in the area of foreign affairs.
As a matter of fact, Puerto Rico has an Olympic team, which recognizes the uniqueness of Commonwealth status.
Puerto Ricos international presence is a matter of political importance and necessary to promote Puerto Ricos economic and cultural ties with the world.
Third Problem: Dependency on federal funds.
The enhanced Commonwealth of the future must dedicate creative energy and explore new effective tools to reduce the levels of dependency of federal funds.
This is the only way to be truly autonomous, and to achieve true interdependency, instead of just dependency.
These are just some of the main areas of Commonwealth enhancement.
Note that these are not abstract or esoteric proposals.
These are reasonable, pragmatic and goal oriented proposals.
So, why dont we just go ahead and implement them? Good question.
IV The problem we have today is that the status issue has been held hostage by local partisan politics.
The exacerbated tribalism in Puerto Rican politics has impaired our ability as a people to advance and promote the necessary enhancement of the current status.
As I have said before, we need a procedural consensus among Puerto Rican leaders; a new consensus on how to steer a process of true self-determination in which the people of Puerto Rico can freely express their will.
Without that consensus, there is no foreseeable way out of the status deadlock.
In 2001, Governor Sila CalderÃ¯Â¿Â½n invited the 3 main parties and the leaders of Puerto Ricos civil society to join the Commission of Puerto Rican Unity and Consensus, a non-partisan commission to agree on the procedural mechanism that will best result in a self-determination process.
The purpose of the commission was to work in good faith toward a procedural consensus, instead of having each party and group pushing for their proposal and sabotaging the others.
The proposal was truly remarkable because for the first time in Puerto Ricos recent history the party in power set forth an inclusive process; a process that opens the doors of participation to all other parties as well as non-partisan sectors of the civil society.
It is a shame that the leadership of the New Progressive Party, the statehood party, has refused to participate.
They rejected this good faith offer to come to the table to talk, to have a dialogue, to express our differences, but to find common ground.
Unfortunately, this is not surprising! In 1997, this same party, when they were in power, pushed for a statehood bill in Washington, excluding the Commonwealth party from the negotiations and actually eliminating the enhanced Commonwealth alternative from the proposed ballot.
They invested millions of dollars in lobbyists and political contributions in order to convince Washington that all Puerto Ricans wanted was statehood.
The bill, they argued, was about self-determination, but in reality it was an undemocratic process that excluded the choice preferred by the majority of Puerto Ricans: the enhanced Commonwealth.
This same day, March 4, five years ago, the U.S. House of Representatives, after a divisive and heated debate, approved the statehood bill by only one vote.
That result was a clear defeat for the statehood movement who was expecting an overwhelming favorable vote that night.
Their effort, of course failed; the statehood bill never reached the Presidents desk.
The statehooders have not learned from recent history.
They are not willing to respect the democratic process when they cannot manipulate it and control it.
They have not learned that no matter how much money or power you have, without consensus among the main parties, nothing will be accomplished in Washington.
Today, I call upon the leadership of the statehood party to be brave.
I urge them, for once, to respect the democratic process and come to the table in good faith.
The Popular Democratic Party and its leader, Governor Sila CalderÃ¯Â¿Â½n, is giving you a last chance: accept it! But, if you shy away from this historic call, rest assured that after 2004, the Popular Democratic Party will steer a process of self-determination.
When the time comes, I will be the first to work with all my heart to complete the unfulfilled autonomous agenda of the generation that created and implemented Commonwealth.
There is a lot of work to do, in Puerto Rico and in Washington.
You may ask why would the U.S. be interested in enhancing Commonwealth status? The United States government should favor the enhancement of Commonwealth status, if for nothing else, for 2 reasons: (1) American commitment to democracy; and (2) the possibility of empowering Puerto Rico towards a reduction of economic dependency.
Today, as we face difficult challenges of terrorism, war, nuclear threats, religious hatred, you may ask, why is Puerto Rico important to the U.S.? Why is it relevant? I'll tell you why: Because the root of those problems is the fundamental issue of democracy and liberty.
The challenge to the U.S. is that if it cannot do justice and deal with Puerto Rico in an open, fair and creative way, how can they purport to be promoting and bringing freedom and democracy abroad? If we take President Bush at his word, Democracy is Gods gift to humanity.
The U.S. has a duty to promote a more perfect democratic status in Puerto Rico.
And, in my honest view, enhanced Commonwealth is the best way.
Sooner rather than later, the new generation of Puerto Ricans and U.S. leaders will have to face this tremendous responsibility.
This responsibility is to equip Puerto Rico with the democratic and economic tools necessary to face the challenges of the new century; to eliminate all vestiges of colonialism from the current U.S.-Puerto Rico relation; and to forge a new consensus on a future relationship.
It will not be easy, but we have no choice but to proudly bear this historic burden.
I agree with Jose TrÃ¯Â¿Â½as Monge, our preeminent constitutional scholar, that, and I quote: the United States clearly harbors nothing but good will toward Puerto Rico.
It is just a question of taking a hard look at the past about which there are quite a few things to regret, on both sides, and making the decision to forge a brave new beginning.
The message to my generation is this: Lets all start today, full of hope and enthusiasm, to forge that brave new beginning.
Thank you very much!
