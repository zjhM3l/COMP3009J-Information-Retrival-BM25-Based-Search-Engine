BEFORE: JUDGE ROBERT F. SKWARYK
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on November 23, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Donny's, Inc., License Number R-10468 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on October 7, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.

DONNY'S, INC.
CITATION NO. 98-2160
Based upon the admission(s) of Licensee and the summary of facts provided by the Bureau, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
1.
Licensee is a corporation located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and holds Restaurant Liquor License Number R-10468.
2.
On October 7, 1998, enforcement offices conducted an open inspection of the licensed premises and seized one poker machine and one video slot machine set up inside and operational.
3.
The poker machine contained a knock-off device by pressing a button on the rear and the video slot machine had a knock-off consisting of connecting boltheads on the side.
4.
On October 22, 1998, an enforcement officer examined the video poker and slot machines and found them to be gambling devices per se.
CONCLUSION OF LAW :
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
A video slot machine is by definition a gambling device per se.
Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that proof of a gambling payout made on a video poker machine is not necessary where the machine is determined to be a gambling device per se.
Cmwlth. v. Twelve Dodge City Video Poker Machines, 537 A.2d 812 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988) The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes "other sufficient cause" as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
