FINDING
The district's Gifted and Talented program does not adequately serve the district's students.
The district has fewer students in its Gifted and Talented program than the state average or its peer districts, does not have certified teachers administering its program, spends $347 less than the state average per student on instructional resources and has no established curriculum.
Texas Education Code requires each school district to adopt a process for identifying and serving Gifted and Talented students using criteria established by the SBOE, and establishing a program for those students at each grade level.
The LISD curriculum coordinator told the review team that the district only has gifted and talented students in second, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.
The district says it has other students who have been nominated, but have not yet been tested for the program.
Compared to the peer district average of 10.3 percent, LISD has the lowest percent, 4.8 percent, of students in its Gifted and Talented program.
LISD also trails the state average of 8.4 percent as shown in Exhibit 2-35.

According to the district, gifted and talented students are not pulled out of their regular classes.
They are taught with the regular students.
According to the TEA's Texas State Plan for Education of Gifted and Talented Students, gifted and talented students may be taught in the regular classroom.
However, if this is the program design that is used, the regular classroom teacher must have the 30 hours of professional development in Gifted and Talented education required in state law and an annual update of six hours of professional development in Gifted and Talented education.
According to TEA AEIS data, no teachers in LISD have the certification for Gifted and Talented classes.
The district must also consider whether the teacher has the time or resources to provide instruction for gifted and talented students at an appropriately challenging level.
The Gifted and Talented curriculum at LISD does not provide an array of learning opportunities for students who are advanced in any of the core content areas of language arts, mathematics, and social studies.
It does not include any options such as future problem solving; Odyssey of the Mind/Destination Imagination; MATHCOUNTS; University Interscholastic League (UIL) academic activities; academic decathlon; science, history, math or book clubs; summer or weekend seminars or classes.
According to a letter from one parent, the only activity for gifted and talented students last year was a field trip.
For 2001-02, LISD has begun offering after school Gifted and Talented classes for the identified population.
At least one science class has now been added, as well as several offerings in computer technology.
The district now has two teachers in the program and the schedule includes two days per week of Gifted and Talented instruction.
LISD has ordered additional curriculum materials for Gifted and Talented students and several field trips have been scheduled for them.
Crystal City Independent School District (CCISD) provides Gifted and Talented training for staff and parents and encourages all teachers to receive training in Gifted and Talented education.
CCISD improved the quality of instruction and the educational opportunities available for Gifted and Talented students.
Recommendation 23: Establish and administer a Gifted and Talented program that complies with state guidelines.
