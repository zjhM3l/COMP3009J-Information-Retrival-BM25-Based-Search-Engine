The officer examined the other two video slot machines and found them to be identical except for the knock-off which was caused by pressing a combination of buttons on the machines' play panel.
(N.T. 21-23)
CONCLUSION OF LAW :
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION :
At the hearing held on the matter, two enforcement officers testified in detail as to their visits to the licensed premises and the subsequent seizure of three video slot machines.
Licensee did not appear at the hearing although duly notified of the place and time thereof.
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
The three video slot machines were gambling devices per se.
The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes "other sufficient cause" as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
I find the testimony of the enforcement officers to be credible.
As such, the citation is sustained as charged.
PRIOR RECORD :
Licensee has been licensed since September 8, 1993, and has had one prior violation, to wit: Citation No. 97-2722.
Fine $450.00.

After due consideration of the circumstances giving rise to the citation, a fine of $800.00 will be imposed.
