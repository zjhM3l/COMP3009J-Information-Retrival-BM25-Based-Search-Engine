This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on November 18, 1999, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Fraternal Order of Eagles Aerie No. 1732, License Number C-254 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on May 21, June 30 and August 25, 1999, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on May 21, 1999 and was completed on September 17, 1999; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on March 9, 2000.
The notice of violation was received by Licensee on March 11, 2000.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on April 25, 2000 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT: 1.
Licensee holds Club Liquor License No.
C-254 in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.
(N.T. 4) 2.
On May 21, 1999 at 6:00 p.m., Enforcement Officer Titler entered the club and was challenged as to membership.
(N.T. 6-7) 3.
The officer told the barmaid he was a member of another Eagles and she served him a Coors Light beer.
(N.T. 7) 4.
During this visit, the officer observed two Cherry Master video slot machines set up inside and operational.
(N.T. 7-8) 5.
On June 30, 1999 at 7:30 p.m., the officer returned to the club and was again questioned as to membership by the bartender.
(N.T. 8) 6.
The officer was denied service of alcoholic beverages because he did not have a club membership card.
(N.T. 8) 7.
During this visit, the officer observed the two Cherry Master video slot machines set up inside and operational.
(N.T. 8) 8.
On August 25, 1999 at 6:40 p.m., enforcement officers entered the club and found a barmaid rendering service of alcoholic beverages to three patrons.
(N.T. 8-9) 9.
The officers identified themselves to the barmaid and inspected the two Cherry Master video slot machines which were set up inside and operational.
(N.T. 9) 10.
The Cherry Master video slot machines accepted U.S. currency at five cents per credit.
(N.T. 9) 11.
The officers played the machine by pressing buttons on the control panel which caused the nine block grid containing various fruits, bars, bells, and numbers icons to roll.
(N.T. 9-10) 12.
After a short period of time, the icons stopped rolling and depending on their placement in the nine block grid, certain combinations would award credit.
(N.T. 10) 13.
The video slot machines involved no skill to play.
(N.T. 10) 14.
An officer found a knock-off device on the first video slot machine activated by hitting the big double take button which set into a blue display screen.
(N.T. 10-11) 15.
The bartender showed him the knock-off combination of buttons pressing by the big double and take button, one at a time, then pressing the big double take button, and when the machine went back to the regular screen the credits were gone.
(N.T. 11) 16.
The second video slot machines knock-off device was activated by pressing down the big double and take buttons one time, and releasing them, and then the credits were erased to zero without the display screen going to blue.
(N.T. 11-12) 17.
The officer seized the two video slot machines and removed them from the club.
(N.T. 12-13) 18.
On September 7, 1999 at 11:15 a.m., Officer Titler examined the two video slot machines and found that they played in the same fashion as played at the club, a power interrupt circuit, knock-off circuitry and internal video accounting circuitry for the number of coins paid in and the number of credits knocked off.
(N.T 14-16)
CONCLUSION OF LAW:
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the hearing held on the matter, the enforcement officer testified in detail as to his visit to the licensed premises and the seizing of two video slot machines.
He examined the machines and found they were gambling devices per se.
Licensee did not appear at the hearing although duly notified of the place and time.
I find the testimony of the officer to be credible and that the two video slot machines seized from the club were gambling devices per se.
As such, the citation is sustained as charged.
