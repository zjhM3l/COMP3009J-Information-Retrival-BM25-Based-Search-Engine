[2001-R-0177-2.gif] February 22, 2001 2001-R-0177 ASSISTED LIVING, RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES, AND CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES By: Helga Niesz, Principal Analyst You asked for a comparison of assisted living facilities, residential care facilities, and continuing care retirement communities.
SUMMARY
Varies depending on contract.
Can provide independent living, assisted living or nursing home care as needed.
The major differences are in the extent and type of additional services and how they are structured and paid for.
Assisted living is primarily for people age 55 or older who do not need full nursing home services, but require some health care, nursing, or assistance with activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, bathing, toileting, or transferring from a bed to a chair.
Although people informally refer to an "assisted living facility," Connecticut law does not use the term (but other states do).
Instead, the state regulates "assisted living services."
In Connecticut, only a state-licensed assisted living services agency (ALSA) can provide assisted living services.
And the ALSA can only provide these services at a "managed residential community" (MRC), which is not licensed as such but must meet the definition of an MRC.
Assisted living services can be provided in a number of different settings, such as apartments, continuing care retirement communities, or other structured settings as long as the facility itself provides the basic services to qualify as an MRC.
Generally, people must pay privately for these services except for certain new income-limited limited projects for lower-income seniors.
Residential care homes provide a single or double furnished room and shared common areas such as a lounge or recreation area.
They provide residents with three meals a day in a common dining area and some limited personal services.
Residential care homes have no legal age requirement.
They set their own policies and can also include people with physical or mental disabilities.
There are also no income limits for residents (although many receive some type of public assistance).
A CCRC is a facility that provides elderly people with a lifetime "continuum of care," although there is a no legal age requirement.
Residents must usually pay a one-time entry fee, which can easily be more than $100,000, and continuing monthly payments, often ranging between $1,000 and $3,000.
Thus, people must have considerable private resources to live in a CCRC.
They usually obtain the entry price by selling their houses.
At first, the senior lives in an independent apartment and later, when he becomes frailer, can receive assisted living services there or move into an assisted living unit.
CCRCs often have small nursing homes on their premises or have a contract with a nearby nursing home for residents who ultimately need 24-hour care.
They also provide some common meals and have other common spaces for leisure and recreation programs, provide housekeeping, laundry services, and transportation.
Table 1 below compares the three types of facilities in more detail.

Regulation
Licensing
Department of Public Health (DPH) licenses agency that provides services (ALSA).
Facility where services are provided is not licensed, but must qualify as an MRC (CGS Ã¯Â¿Â½ 19a-490(l), Conn.
Agencies Reg. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 19-13-D105).
Licensed by DPH (Conn.
Agencies Reg. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 19-13-D6).
Not licensed, but must register with Department of Social Services and meet certain financial requirements before construction can start.
If it includes assisted living, either the facility or the outside agency providing the services must have an ALSA license.
If it includes a nursing home, the nursing home part must be licensed by DPH (CGS Ã¯Â¿Â½ 17b-520 etc.)
Physical Facility Regulation
No specific regulation or inspection of physical facilities for MRC. ALSA administration is extensively regulated.
DPH extensively regulates the physical requirements for the buildings and some requirements for the services that have to be offered.
It inspects the homes periodically.

Must meet state and town building codes.
Consumer Protection
ALSA must have a written clients' bill of rights and responsibilities and provide and explain it to each client at the start of services.
Must have a resident's bill of rights.
The State Long-term Care Ombudsman handles complaints from these residents.
State law and DSS extensively regulates financial and other disclosures to consumers before they sign a contract and specifies what the contract must contain.

Entry Qualifications
Age and Health
Residents must have chronic and stable conditions and need help with activities of daily living.
ALSA must have written criteria for furnishing services.

No income limits.
Contracts usually require people to pay lump sum entry fee and show that they have enough money to continue paying monthly fee.
Payment Source
All those currently in operation are private pay.
But 1998 legislation authorized five pilot programs for people whose incomes are low enough to qualify for the Medicaid or state-assisted portion of the Connecticut Home Care Program (CHCP).
2000 legislation also allowed assisted living in two federally assisted senior housing projects and in all 24 state-assisted income-limited senior congregate housing programs (one Norwich pilot has operated for several years).
Can be private pay, but many low-income residents receive help from the federal Supplemental Security Income Program, the State Supplement Program, or state-administered or town general assistance.
All are private pay.
Neither Medicaid nor state funding pays for people in CCRCs in Connecticut.
Rate Setting Authority
Private pay rates are not regulated.
DSS will set them for people qualifying for assisted living services in congregate housing or the pilots under the CHCP.
The Department of Social Services sets rates it will pay for public assistance recipients who live in residential care homes.
It does not regulate private pay rates.
Rates are not regulated.
