back Reitree in the Spotlight February 2003 Home Birdfeeding Tips forward Wildlife Disease Roundup By Vicky Osborn Many different diseases, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites can affect fish and wildlife populations in Idaho.
While native pathogens can erupt and cause significant mortality, the introduction of new, exotic diseases are a greater concern.
The new diseases, such as Chronic Wasting Disease, bring with them many unknowns.
Are they communicable to humans? Can they be transmitted to livestock? How do they spread from animal to animal? Can they jump from species to species? Are they fatal?
Thousands of dollars, often scarce resource dollars, are being spent trying to answer these questions, as well as manage the spread of these exotic diseases.
The introduction of new diseases is only likely to multiply in the future because of the global movement of people and animals.
A century ago, Idaho's wildlife was exposed to the exotic diseases of brucellosis and pasteurella.
To this day, these diseases continue to pose a risk to wildlife and many questions about the diseases remain unanswered.

Two new diseases knocking at Idaho's border could develop similar histories.
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is only found in North America and infects deer and elk.
It first appeared in Colorado in 1967 and seemed contained to a small geographic area.
But recently it's cropped up in other states and provinces.
West Nile virus (WNV) has its origins in Africa and the Middle East.
It appeared in New York City for the first time in 1999 and has already been found in birds, people or horses in 44 states.
In four years time, more than 200 people have died from being infected with WN. Scientists believe the virus could be even more devastating to wildlife, especially wild bird populations.

Chronic Wasting Disease Is On the Move
In 1967, mule deer at a wildlife research facility in Colorado started showing peculiar symptoms of excessive drooling, nervousness, blank expression, teeth grinding, loss of appetite and progressive weight loss.
Eleven years after researchers first recorded these mysterious symptoms, the illness was determined to be a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and named Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD.)
Today, these words strike fear in the heart of wildlife managers.
Chronic Wasting Disease is a nervous system disease of the cervid family, which includes deer, elk and moose.
It belongs to a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encepholopathy.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or 'mad cow disease'), Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and scrapie are also TSE diseases.
How the disease is transmitted from one deer or elk to another is not well understood.
mule deer
The first case of CWD in the wild was confirmed in 1981 in southeastern Wyoming.
During the next two decades the disease seemed confined to a small geographic area of Colorado and Wyoming.
But in the past five years, testing of dead or hunter-harvested deer and elk shows CWD is now being found in other places.
Infected deer and elk were found in new areas of Colorado.
Then cases started popping up in wild and farmed deer and elk in South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Montana, the Canadian Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and most recently Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Utah.
What is known about the risks of CWD While CWD is a distinct disease only affecting deer and elk, it shares certain characteristics with other TSE's like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) found in cattle, Cruetzfeldt-Jakob-Disease in humans, or scrapie in sheep.
The culprit is an abnormal protein or prion that converts normal prions to abnormal-folded prions.
This alters the formation of brain tissue and slowly causes the death of brain cells.
All TSE diseases are fatal.
Recent research indicates that CWD can be passed from one cervid to another, but like most TSE diseases it isn't known to jump the biological barrier from one species to another.
However, the outbreak of 'mad cow disease' in England in the 1980's raised new questions.
Mad cow disease in the food chain By tracing the path of 'mad cow disease,' it's now believed that BSE had its beginnings in the feed given to cattle.
Scrapie, a spongiform encephalopathy found in sheep, has been known for three hundred years.
It is centralized in the spinal column, brain, and other parts of animals that are not typically eaten by people.
It was common practice to grind sheep meat and bone together and add it to cattle feed as a protein supplement.
Chances are scrapie-infected body parts were added to cattle feed in the areas of 'mad cow' outbreak.
The cattle ate this infected meal and contracted the disease.
The outbreak of BSE or 'mad cow disease' in England was followed by an increase of a TSE like illness in people.
Scientists found characteristics unique to the prion in BSE also showing up in the new TSE illness.
They now suspect that people who became ill with the new variant CJD (nvCJD) did so by eating BSE tainted meats.
BSE is known to centralize in the spinal column and brain of cattle.
When these parts are cut through in the butchering process, BSE infected tissues can contaminate the meat.
Since the outbreak of BSE, certain cuts of meat like T-bone steaks are banned from sale in many European countries.
Can CWD jump the species barrier? Because of England's experience with BSE, people are concerned about CWD jumping the biological barrier through the food chain.
So far, the answer is no.
Colorado and Wyoming are currently 5 years into a 10-year study on CWD and livestock.
Cattle have been exposed to CWD in three different experiments.
Cattle were placed in pens with CWD infected deer and none contracted the illness.
Cattle were fed diseased brain tissue from infected deer and nothing happened.
The only cattle researchers were able to infect with CWD had CWD tissue injected directly into their brains.
In this case, 3 of the 13 cattle came down with neurological signs of the disease.
lymph system of deer
Similar experiments were conducted by placing sheep and goats in close quarters with CWD infected deer.
So far, there is no evidence of CWD transmission to these domestic herds.
What many hunters want to know is if they are at risk of getting CWD from eating meat from infected deer or elk?
There is no scientific evidence that humans are at risk if they eat meat from CWD infected deer or elk.
Research indicates that prions, which cause the disease, do not accumulate in the muscle tissue of infected deer or elk.
The same research shows CWD accumulates only in certain parts of infected animals - the brain, eyes, spinal cord, lymph nodes, tonsils, pancreas and spleen.
As a safeguard, hunters are advised against eating these parts.
It is also suggested that hunters bone out the meat and eat only muscle tissue from deer and elk harvested in CWD infected areas.
What hunters should know about handling wild game.
What is being done about the spread of CWD.
Because of the risk to wildlife populations and state recreation economies, individual states are attempting to curtail the disease where it is found and prevent it from spreading to new parts of the country.
Many states are testing hunter killed deer and elk to monitor for CWD in wild deer and elk. Colorado has tested 12,500 deer and elk for CWD from 1996 to 2001.
But in 2002, the state increased the number of animals tested to 26,500.
So far, 260 have tested positive for CWD.
Where the disease is prominent in the wild populations, wildlife managers are taking drastic steps to reduce the number of animals in the area.
In Wisconsin, state authorities enlisted hunters to kill 25,000 deer and elk in a targeted three-county area during the 2002 hunting season.
In Colorado, two-thousand deer were killed in one area, in a similar effort to reduce the density of the population.
States like Pennsylvania and Washington, where the disease hasn't been found, are banning the importation of all live deer and elk from any region where CWD has been identified.
Plus hunters returning from hunts out of state, can only bring boned out meat back to their state.
Idaho is still CWD-free.
In 2002, Idaho Fish and Game conducted surveillance for CWD using hunter killed deer and elk and collected over 675 samples.
No sign of CWD was found in the animals tested so far.
To limit the state's exposure to the disease, new rules prohibit the importation of captive mule or white-tailed deer into Idaho.
However, domestic cervid ranchers can still import farmed raised elk from areas with no known CWD and from farms with a verified CWD serveillance program.
A national concern? In September, 2001, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared a national Chronic Wasting Disease emergency.
One of its initiatives was to make $12.5 million available to buy out elk ranches known to be infected with CWD, clearing the way to kill quarantined captive herds.
Colorado focused on purchasing captive elk facilities in the endemic area of northeastern Colorado where the disease was first discovered.
A total of 16 herds (1,300 elk) in this area were destroyed.
Testing showed that only 3 of the herds tested positive for the disease.
While the Department of Agriculture's approach focuses primarily on the game farm industry, it also provides funding for surveillance of wild cervids in most states with a national sampling program.
As Chronic Wasting Disease doesn't respect political or geographic boundaries, it may take a national effort to keep CWD from spreading further across the continent.

West Nile Virus
If West Nile virus shows up in Idaho this spring, it won't surprise health or wildlife officials.
The virus has literally flown across the country since it was first identified in New York in 1999.
It is believed that the fall and spring migration of millions of birds through affected states in 1999, 2000, 2001, was the likely source for WNV appearing in southern and western states.
By the end of 2002, forty-four states confirmed the presence of WNV in birds, horses or people.
While the virus is carried by birds, it is spread by mosquitoes.
Mosquitoes pick up the virus when they feed on an infected bird.
After 10-14 days, the mosquito can spread the virus when it bites other birds, animals and people.
Monitoring for West Nile virus
mosquito
People and West Nile virus People can react to a bite from an infected mosquito in several ways.
Most people will not develop any symptoms.
Approximately 20 percent of people infected with the West Nile virus may develop a mild illness, fever, headache, body aches, skin rash and swollen glands.
Less than one percent of those infected will develop a serious illness, such as encephalitis.
West Nile encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain and can be fatal in a small number of cases.
The Center for Disease Control recommends people with severe and unusual headaches and who live in an area where West Nile virus has been identified to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
As of the end of 2002, more than 4000 cases were reported of people with WVN. 263 of these people died.
Most of the deceased were elderly who are most vulnerable to the disease.
Protecting Yourself and Your Family
Wildlife and West Nile virus As the disease spreads across the country, it may have a more dramatic affect on wildlife than humans, especially wild bird populations.
Government agencies are just beginning to focus on the potential impacts of WNV on wildlife.
Scientists met in February 2003 to map out research strategies to follow the consequences of this newly discovered disease to North America on the continent's native wildlife.
They are worried the virus could devastate flocks of threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and other wildlife.
So far, West Nile virus has been detected in 150 species of birds, ranging from chickadees to bald eagles.
But it is the corvid family of crows, ravens, jays and magpies, which seem to be the most vulnerable.
In fact, dead corvids, especially crows, are a first indication that West Nile virus is in an area.
The virus is also killing many raptors, especially hawks and owls.
In addition to birds, 15 mammals and 1 amphibian have been found positive for WNV.
Scientists are finding that while birds and animals get sick from the virus, most of them survive the illness.
The mammals infected include dogs, cats, llamas, alpacas, mountain goats, sheep, reindeer, rabbits, bats, mules, donkeys and horses.
Horses and West Nile virus West Nile virus is particularly lethal to horses.
More than 14,000 horses have been reported as having WNV since it was first discovered and of these nearly 35 - 40% have died.
The most common sign of West Nile virus in horses is weakness, usually in the hindquarters.
Weakness may be indicated by a widened stance, stumbling, leaning on one side and toe dragging.
In extreme cases paralysis may follow.
Some infected horses may show a fever, depression and fearfulness.
In October 2002, a horse in Canyon County tested positive for the virus.
But veterinarians say it's hard to say the horse became infected in Idaho.
It had recently traveled to several states that were battling the virus.
The incubation period for WNV ranges from three to 15 days in horses, and yet the horse had been in Idaho 30 days prior to showing signs of the illness.
The horse survived the disease and no other cases have been reported since.
Horses can be vaccinated against West Nile virus.
A vaccine for horses was recently licensed, but its effectiveness is unknown.
Regardless, it is strongly recommended for anybody who owns a horse to have it vaccinated.
It takes approximately five weeks for the vaccination to offer protection against the disease.
As the virus moves into western states, scientists expect wild horses and burros to be at high risk to WNV.
Protecting Your Horses
Hunters and West Nile virus As the virus continues to spread into wildlife populations, many hunters are asking if it's safe to handle or eat wild game.
There is no evidence that West Nile virus can be spread from person to person or from animals to people.
However when it comes to handling wild game, Idaho Fish and Game always recommends hunters should take a few basic precautions: * Never harvest or eat wild game animals that appear sick.
* Wear latex or plastic gloves when field dressing and processing game.
* Clean meat carefully and cool the carcass as quickly as possible after killing.
* Use clean equipment for butchering and carefully clean the equipment before and after working with carcasses.
* Always cook game meat thoroughly before eating.
The biggest threat to hunters is mosquitoes and hunters should protect themselves, like any other person recreating in the outdoors.
When it gets to Idaho, it's here to stay Once West Nile virus comes to an area, it becomes part of the ecosystem.
It will return every spring.
The challenge then is to learn how to live with it.
People getting sick from West Nile virus is rare, even in areas where the virus is well established.
Yet, it's important to reduce your chances of becoming ill by protecting yourself from mosquito bites.
Some simple precautions include: * Apply insect repellent on exposed skin when you go outdoors.
* Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and long pants when outdoors.
* Spray thin clothing with insect repellent.
* Consider staying indoors between dusk and dawn, which is peak mosquito biting time.
The main role people have in the continuing cycle of West Nile virus is by allowing standing water to collect around their home and livestock facilities.
Standing water is where mostquitoes lay their eggs.
The most important contribution people can make in protecting themselves and their community is to get rid of standing water on their property.
Also, alert health authorities to potential mosquito breeding sites, such as storm sewers, ditches and abandoned properties with standing water.
Concern about getting the virus from infected animals is unwarranted.
Although people and some animals may get sick when they are infected by the virus, they can't pass it on to others directly, or even indirectly through mosquitoes.
It is thought that these dead-end hosts usually do not develop enough virus in the bloodstream to infect mosquitoes.

Monitoring for West Nile virus
State agencies are on alert for signs of West Nile virus.
When the virus first appears in an area, people may discover an unusual number of dead birds, particularly crows.
Idaho Fish and Game and the Department of Health and Welfare have set a system to respond if and when this happens.
If you discover dead crows, ravens, jays, magpies, owls, hawks and other raptors, notify your local Idaho Fish and Game or District Health office.
They will need to know the kind of bird you found and how long it has been dead.
If possible, collect samples of the dead birds, but follow the steps below: 1.
Only collect birds that have been dead for less than 24 hours.
2.
Wear gloves to pick the bird up.
If you don't have gloves, use a plastic bag.
3.
Double bag the bird in plastic bags.
4.
Store in a cool place.
5.
Contact local Fish and Game or District Health office.
Fish and Game Offices
District Health offices: * Region 1 (Couer d'Alene) 667-9513 * Region 2 (Lewiston/Moscow) 799-3100 * Region 3 (Nampa, Caldwell, Emmett) 455-5442 * Region 4 (Boise, McCall, Mountain Home) 327-8622 * Region 5 (Twin Falls) 734-5900 x236 * Region 6 (Pocatello) 239-5231 * Region 7 (Idaho Falls) 522-0310
Dead birds are sent to the Wildlife Health Lab in Caldwell and tested for the West Nile virus.
Information collected on dead bird sightings are used to track the occurrence of West Nile virus.
Each state collects and reports this information to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
CDC work with the U.S Geological Survey to maintain up-to-date maps detailing the the distribution and spread of the virus.
These can be seen at: http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html __________________________________________________________________
Protecting Yourself And Your Family From West Nile Virus
People are only at risk for becoming infected with West Nile virus when it is circulating in nature.
In northern states, this is during the summer months, but in southern states transmission can occur year-round.
People most at risk of developing West Nile encephalitis are those 50 years of age and older.
mosquito
Avoid mosquito bites The best thing people can do to protect themselves is to avoid mosquito bites.
Next time you head outdoors think about following these steps: * Apply insect repellent containing DEET.
The more DEET a repellent contains, the longer it will protect you from mosquito bites.
However, DEET concentrations higher than 50% do not increase the length of protection.
* Be careful in applying insect repellent to children.
Don't put repellent on their hands and avoid their mouths and eyes.
It's best to use products with 10% DEET or less for children between the ages of 2 and 12.
* Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves, long pants and socks while outdoors.
* Spray clothing with repellents containing DEET or permethrin because mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing.
* Consider staying indoors between dusk and dawn, which is peak mosquito biting time.
Avoid going where mosquitoes are plentiful.
* Fix or install window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of buildings.
For more information on safe use of insect repellants, visit http://www.cdc.gov/westnile
For more information on DEET and other pesticides, visit http://www.epa.gov/pesticides or http://npic.orst.edu
Avoid breeding mosquitoes Avoid helping mosquitoes breed and multiply in your home by draining standing water where they could lay their eggs.
Routinely empty water from flower pots, pet bowls, clogged rain gutters, swimming pool covers, discarded tires, buckets, barrels, cans and other items that collect water.
If you have a bird bath, empty, clean and replace water at least every three days.
Wading pools and plastic swimming pools should be chlorinated or cleaned and water replaced at least every three days.
Water can sometimes collect in the most unlikely places and even a little bit of stagnant water can be a home to mosquitoes.
Also, alert local health authorities to potential mosquito breeding sites in your area, such as storm sewers, ditches and abandoned properties with standing water.

Protecting Your Horses
West Nile virus is a serious threat to horses.
Fortunately owners can be proactive by vaccinating their horses and reducing standing water around a horse's environment.
The vaccine is relatively new and its effectiveness is unproven.
However, horse vaccines for other encephalitis viruses have proven themselves for many years.
The veterinary community strongly recommends horse owners to vaccinate their horses against the West Nile virus.
The vaccine requires two doses and takes approximately five weeks to offer protection from the disease.
Once vaccinated, the animals should only require a booster shot next spring for protection during the next mosquito season.
Mosquitoes feed at dusk and dawn.
One easy prevention strategy is to have horses inside at these times.
This is especially important from mid-August until the first killing frost, the period when horses are most likely to be bitten and infected.
In addition, horse owners can protect their animals by applying approved insect repellents to the animals and by controlling mosquito breeding areas.
Mosquitoes require standing water to reproduce.
By eliminating, reducing or treating standing water on your property, you will help prevent the mosquito populations from growing.
Areas to consider are: * Water troughs and buckets.
Scrub troughs to remove algae and replace water at least every three days.
* Clogged gutters and drains.
Keep gutters and drains clean; use Mosquito DunksÂ® or equivalent product if standing water cannot be eliminated.
(Mosquito DunksÂ® are small pellets containing Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) and will kill mosquito larvae for about 30 days.)
* Wash stalls and collection drains under wash stalls.
Use Mosquito DunksÂ® in collection drains if water collects and stands for more than three days.
* Any natural water including ponds, brooks and streams.
Call your county mosquito agency for an assessment.
* Drainage ditches on the farm or storm drains surrounding the farm.
Use Mosquito DunksÂ® or equivalent product in ditches on the farm and call your county mosquito agency regarding storm drains.
* Standing puddles on ground or in tarps.
Try to prevent water from accumulating in puddles.
If this is not possible, eliminate water by sweeping it out or removing it if it stands longer than three days.
