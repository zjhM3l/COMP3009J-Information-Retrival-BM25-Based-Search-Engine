DISCUSSION:
Upon thorough review of the testimony and evidence presented, this court is of the opinion that the Bureau has established the violations as charged in counts one and two by a clear preponderance of the evidence.
Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Leggens, 542 A.2d 653 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988); Omicron Enterprises, 449 A.2d 857 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1982).
PENALTY:
Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] prescribes a penalty of license suspension or revocation or a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00 or both for violations of the types found in this case.
Relative to count one, this court is of the opinion that Licensees possession and operation of electronic poker machines, slot machines, or similar devices used for gambling purposes on its licensed premises constitutes a relatively severe gambling offense warranting more than a minimal penalty.
As to count two, this court is of the opinion that the nature of this violation is a significant one, in that those individuals who reside or conduct their businesses within the community have the right to proceed with their personal and/or business affairs without the intrusion of such noise pollution.
In mitigation the record discloses that this citation represents Licensees first violations.
For the foregoing reasons, the following penalties shall be imposed: Count one - $500.00.
Count two - $150.00.
