Rockport/Fulton Natural History
* Geology and Hydrology * Native Vegetation * Fauna __________________________________________________________________
Geology and Hydrology: Geological and hydrological factors play an important role in determining biological diversity along the central Texas coast.
The Rockport/Fulton area is situated on Live Oak Peninsula, which is composed of Beaumont Formation material overlain by the sands of the Ingleside Strandplain.
Beaumont Formation materials are considered to be contemporaneous with sea level high-stands estimated to approximately 80,000 to 130,000 years ago.
Native Vegetation: The deep, hummocky sands of the Ingleside Strandplain (deposited upon Beaumont materials during the latter part of the Pleistocene era) support dense mottes and strips of species such as live oak, redbay, coastal laurel oak, American beautyberry, and yaupon.
The Rockport/Fulton area reflects this particular habitat.
Associated grassland habitats support grass species such as little bluestem, brownseed passpalum, big bluestem, and Indiangrass.
Habitats associated with area bays include fresh, brackish, and salt marshes, as well as wind tidal flats.
Fauna: Faunal species common to the Rockport/Fulton area are reflective of the variety of natural habitats available.
A large number of butterfly, moth, bee, wasp, and fly species are found in association with the live oak mottes and higher elevations of Live Oak Peninsula, as are various species of grasshoppers, katydids, cicadas, crickets, and ants.
The sandy Ingleside strandplain and Live Oak Ridge soils present in the area provides preferred nesting and foraging habitat for these insect species, as well as others.
A number of arachnid species are also common, as is the ubiquitous mosquito.
These species sustain themselves through consumption of vegetation, pollon, predation, and so forth; and in their turn provide a portion of the sustenance base for a large number of reptilian, amphibian, and mammalian species.
Reptiles common to the habitats in the vicinity of the Rockport/Fulton area includes several freshwater turtle species such red-eared sliders, yellow mud turtles, Mississippi mud turtles, the common snapping turtle, and the Guadalupe spiny softshell turtle.
Fluvio-riverine and shallow bay influences provide suitable habitat for these species, ranging from sluggish or still water, to rapidly moving streams or rivers.
Food sources include aquatic insects, tadpoles, algae, worms, fish, and so forth.
One turtle species, the Texas diamondback terrapin, can be found in the brackish-to salt flats and shallows of bays located along the coastal area.
Terrestrial turtle species found in grassy terrain in the area include ornate box turtles, while three toed box turtles prefer the dense thickets found in the wooded oak mottes common to the Rockport/Fulton area.
Lizard species found in these wooded zones include green anoles, ground sinks, Texas spiny lizards, and northern fence lizards.
Prairie racerunners and slender glass lizards are also present.
These species feed primarily on insects, flies and spiders, and are in turn predated upon by snakes, birds, and larger animals.
Alligators are common along the coast, choosing to frequent waterholes and other sources of standing or sluggishly moving water.
Alligators will consume carrion as well as preying upon a variety of animals and fish.
These creatures are capable of traveling long distances in search of adequate food and water sources; and will even venture into area bays on occasion, although they generally prefer to avoid saltwater.
Nonpoisonous snake species found in wetter areas along rivers and streams include Gulf Coast ribbon snakes, diamondback water snakes, and speckled king snakes.
Texas rat snakes and western coach whips prefer grassy areas.
These and several other nonpoisonous snakes present in the area feed variously upon insects, amphibians, crustaceans, fish, lizards, rodents, bird and reptile eggs, other snakes, etc.
Poisonous snakes found in the coastal bend include broad-banded copperheads, western cottonmouth water moccasins, western diamondback rattlesnakes, western massasaugas, and Texas coral snakes.
Copperheads and moccasins prefer moist wooded or wet areas, whereas diamondback rattles and massasaugas prefer the denser ground cover provided by grasslands.
Prey species include lizards, other snakes, frogs, fish, crayfish, birds, rodents, rabbits, etc.
Nonpoisonous and poisonous snakes alike are in turn preyed upon by whooping cranes, great blue herons and other wading birds, raccoons, feral hogs, javelinas, raptors, alligators, coyotes, and other species.
Amphibious species found in the Rockport/Fulton area favor moist or wet habitats, and are most active during warm, wet weather.
Green treefrogs, squirrel treefrogs, southern leopard frogs, and bullfrogs are common.
Most frog species feed primarily upon insects, although bullfrogs will also consume crayfish, fish, tadpoles, smaller frogs, small snakes and turtles, and small mammals such as mice and shrews.
The various frog species are in turn consumed by snakes, birds, alligators, raccoons, feral hogs, and other species.
Common toad species include eastern and great plains narrow-mouthed toads, Gulf Coast toads, Texas toads, and others.
Toads feed upon insects, and are in turn consumed by raccoons, birds, snakes, and other predators.
Salamander and newt species found in the Texas Coastal Bend include eastern tiger salamanders, western lesser sirens, southern black-spotted newts, and eastern red-spotted newts.
The later three species are essentially aquatic, feeding primarily upon worms, insects, small crustaceans, molluscs, amphibian eggs, and larvae.
Tiger salamanders, in contrast, prefer life beneath surface litter or in burrows easily dug in the sandy soils of the coast, feeding upon earthworms, large insects, small mice, and amphibian species they encounter.
A large number of migratory bird species appear along the central Texas coast during spring and fall migrations.
Spring migrations occur from March through May, while fall migrations begin in late August and extend through mid-October.
The Rockport/Fulton area is considered a birders paradise, due to its placement on the Central Flyway.
Approximately 90% of avian species traveling the Central Flyway congregate in the Texas coastal bend for the duration of winter, with the remaining 10% venturing further to the south into Central and South America.
Winter visitors to the area include waterfowl species such as whooping cranes, sandhill cranes, Canadian and snow geese, teal, pintail, redheads, ruddy ducks, gadwalls, and many others.
Preferred habitat for these species variously includes lakes, marshes, ponds, estuaries, bays, flooded fields, grasslands, and croplands.
Preferred foods for many species includes waste crops such as sorghum, corn, rice, soybeans, or native vegetation such as saltgrass, seashore paspalum, and marshhay cordgrass which are all available in Rockport/Fulton and the surrounding area.
Bankside, floating, and submerged vegetation such as widgeon grass, shoalgrass, seeds, and algae are also consumed.
Clams, crustaceans, mullet, anchovies, and other marine life forms also provide sustenence for many waterfowl species.
The Texas Coastal Bend hosts a number of year round waterfwl species, in addition to the migrants listed above.
White and brown pelicans, double-created and olivaceous cormorants, mottled ducks, black skimmers, white and white-faced ibis, and roseate spoonbills frequent estuaries, bays marshes, lakes, and rivers in the area, as do great blue, little blue, tricolored, and black-crowned night herons.
Great, snowy and reddish egrets are present, as are a variety of shorebirds such as black-bellied plovers, killdeer, greater and lesser yellowlegs, willets, spotted sandpipers, long-billed curlews, laughing gulls, caspian terns, and others.
These species feed variously upon snails and other mollusks, crustaceans, small fish and insects, frogs, and upon aquatic vegetation, grasses and grain.
Resident and migratory raptors are also present in large numbers along the central Texas coast.
Migratory species include ospreys, northern harriers, sharp-shinned hawks, red-shouldered hawks, kestrels, merlins, peregrine falcons, and broad winged hawks.
The various species prefer different habitat types, such as riparian forests and oak woodlands, beaches and estuaries, or savanna areas in the coastal bend.
Some species, such as the ospreys, feed primarily on fish, while others predate upon small mammals, birds, frogs and toads, snakes, lizards, and insects.
Resident raptors such as white-tailed and red-tailed hawks, caracaras, great horned owls, black vultures, and turkey vultures are present in varying habitats, and prey upon rodents, snakes, insects, and birds, or avail themselves of carrion.
Perhaps the most popular birds present in the Texas Coastal Bend are the hummingbirds and songbirds.
Hummers devote approximately 90% of their feeding time obtaining flower nectar, with the remainder devoted to catching small insects on the wing.
The most common hummingbird species in the Rockport/Fulton area are the ruby-throated and buff-bellied hummingbirds, which are present in the area from April through October.
Songbirds common to the area either year round or during spring and autumn migrations include various species of woodpeckers, chickadees and titmice, thrashers, flycatchers, swallows, meadowlarks, wrens, vireos, warblers, sparrows, and others.
These species commonly feed upon seeds, fruits, and insects, either singly or in greater or lesser combinations of all three.
Small mammals common to the Rockport/Fulton area include bat species such as Brazilian free-tails, eastern pipistrelles, and evening bats.
Other small mammal species include gray, fox, and ground squirrels, various mouse and rat species, opossums, armadillos, shews, cottontails, and pocket gophers; all of whom prefer either the easily dug sandy soils, or the oak mottes and detris found in association with the Beaumont Formation and Ingleside Strandplain.
Food resources for these species range variously from grasses, forbs, seeds, nuts, insects and other invertebrates, buds, masts, fruits, amphibians, bark, roots, and eggs, to occasional small mice or bird nestlings.
The small mammalian species listed above provide in large part primary food resources for medium to larger sized mammals found in the more rural areas of Rockport/Fulton and the Texas coastal bend.
These species include skunks, racoons, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, ringtails, weasels, and badgers.
Larger herbivores present in the area include collared peccaries and white tailed deer.
Species conspicuously absent in recent times (due in large part to human impact) include cougars and red wolves, which historically predated heavily upon the larger herbivores.
