(3) License applicants may be required to furnish to the Commission a set(s) of fingerprints and a recent photograph and may be required to be refingerprinted or rephotographed periodically as determined by the Commission.

License applicants for owner, trainer or jockey will only need to be fingerprinted upon first application, or if there is a break of three years or more in license continuity.

(1) Applicants for licensing, except owners, must be a minimum of 14 years of age, but no one under the age of 16 may be licensed as a pony person or exercise person.
(2) A licensee must be a minimum of 14 years of age to handle a horse in the paddock.
D. CONSENT TO INVESTIGATION: The filing of an application for license shall authorize the Commission to investigate criminal and employment records, to engage in interviews to determine applicant's character and qualifications, and to verify information provided by the applicant.
E. CONSENT TO SEARCH AND SEIZURE: By acceptance of a license, a licensee consents to search and inspection by the Commission or its agents and to the seizure of any prohibited medication, drugs, paraphernalia or devices in accordance with state and federal law.
F. APPROVAL OR RECOMMENDATIONS BY STEWARDS: The Commission may designate categories of licenses, which shall require stewards' prior approval or recommendation.
Prior approval will include Exercise Riders, Pony Riders, and Apprentice Jockeys.

M. DURATION OF LICENSE:
