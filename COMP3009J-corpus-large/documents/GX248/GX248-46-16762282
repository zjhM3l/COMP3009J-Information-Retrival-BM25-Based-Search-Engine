Maj. Gen. David B. Poythress
My fellow Georgians:
It is with pleasure that I present this report to the General Assembly and the citizens of Georgia, which highlights the accomplishments and challenges of your Georgia Department of Defense and Georgia National Guard.
I was honored to receive the appointment by the Governor to be Georgia's 35th Adjutant General in July, and to take command of the 12,000 men and women of the Georgia Army and Air National Guard and State Defense Force.
Since that time, the men and women of the Georgia National Guard have faced many opportunities at home and abroad to display their training, professionalism and commitment.
More than 1,800 Georgia National Guardsmen were called to state active duty for Hurricane Floyd which threatened coastal Georgia and initiated the largest mass evacuation in the state's history.
On the continents of Europe, South America, and Asia, Georgia Guardsmen have performed valuable missions contributing directly to America's national security.
In 1999, Georgia Guardsmen were sent to Kosovo and to Saudi Arabia under the Presidential Selective Call Up.
More than 500 Georgia Army Guard engineers spent three weeks in the Dominican Republic rebuilding schools ravaged by Hurricane Georges.
In Tunisia and in the Republic of Georgia, our Guardsmen conducted valuable training with local defense forces.
A fully trained and equipped weapons of mass destruction team with the capability of responding rapidly to incidents of domestic terrorism is now operational in Georgia.
National Guard personnel and assets are at the forefront of the state's war on drugs seizing more than $88 million in illegal narcotics from Georgia's streets in 1999.
Georgia's Youth Challenge Academy continues to turn young lives around boasting of more than 2,000 graduates from this highly acclaimed program.
Significant opportunities and challenges will continue to emerge for the men and women who wear the uniform of the Georgia National Guard.
Beginning in March 2000, Air Guardsmen of the 116th Bomb Wing and 165th Airlift Wing will participate in the Air Expeditionary Force, a concept that places Air National Guard personnel and equipment on alert status for a period of 90 days.
And in 2001, some 1,500 members of Georgia's 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard are expected to deploy for a 270-day rotation in the Balkans to participate in the peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.
The 12,000 Georgia National Guardsmen, the volunteers of the Georgia State Defense Force and the more than 400 Georgia Department of Defense civilian personnel represent Georgians at their best.
Anywhere at anytime, when the needs of the nation, state, or our local communities call, your Georgia Department of Defense and Georgia National Guard will be there.
Sincerely,
[generalsig.jpg] DAVID B. POYTHRESS Major General, GA ANG The Adjutant General

Georgia Army National Guard
Commander: Brig. Gen. Michael L. Seely Command Sergeant Major: Command Sgt. Maj. John Lane
The Georgia Army National Guard is comprised of more than 9,000 citizen- soldiers drilling in units located in some 70 hometown armories across the state.
Georgia's Army Guard is the thirteenth largest in the nation and is made up of combat, combat support and combat service support units.
Over 60 percent of Georgia Army National Guard forces are high priority units and would be among the first to deploy during a national crisis.
In addition to the three major commands outlined below, the Georgia Army National Guard includes Army Guard headquarters and State Area Command (STARC) both located at the Oglethorpe Army, adjacent to Ft. Gillem in Ellenwood.
The Georgia Army National Guard also operates the Regional Training Institute in Macon, which is home to various soldier, noncommissioned officer, and officer courses, and the state Officer Candidate School program; and the National Guard Training Center at Ft. Stewart which provides housing, equipment, maintenance facilities and training sites for units from Georgia and other southeastern states.
48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized)
Strength: 3,900 Headquarters: Macon Commander: Brig. Gen. Robin Hughes Major Units:
o 1st Battalion, 108th Armor o 1st Battalion, 118th Field Artillery o 1st Battalion, 121st Infantry o 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry o 148th Forward Support Battalion o 648th Engineer Battalion
The year 1999 saw several major developments involving the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized):
u In June, the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) made history when it became part of the newly re-flagged 24th Infantry Division.
The event was commemorated by formal activation ceremonies at Fort Riley, Kansas.
The 24th Infantry Division is the U.S. Army's first integrated active duty/National Guard division, and Georgia's 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) is one of three National Guard brigades to become part of the new unit.
Earlier in 1999, the Department of the Army announced the creation of two active component/National Guard integrated divisions - the 24th Infantry Division, Fort Riley, Kansas and the 7th Infantry Division Fort Carson, Colorado.
These division headquarters are commanded by active component major generals and each is comprised of three Army National Guard enhanced brigades, which are the principal reserve component ground combat maneuver forces of the United States Army.
u Elements of the 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry responded within hours to the threat of Hurricane Floyd in September, providing a task force headquarters and more than 200 soldiers.
The Albany-based unit supported local emergency management and law enforcement officials in Chatham and Coffee counties.
u In October, Pentagon officials confirmed that elements of the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) are scheduled to deploy to southeast Europe to participate in the peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.
The Georgia units will be mobilized under a Presidential Selective Reserve Call Up and are expected to serve nine months on active duty beginning early in 2001.
Details of the call-up are still being confirmed, but the deployment is expected to affect between 1,000 and 1,500 Georgia National Guard members across the state.
While other National Guard units have participated in the Bosnia operations in the past, the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) will be among the first National Guard combat units of this size and capability to take over such a large and significant portion of this mission.
78th Troop Command
Strength: 3,000 Headquarters: Decatur Commander: Col. Terrell T. Reddick Major Units:
o 265th Engineer Group o 878th Engineer Battalion o 110th Corps Support Battalion o 151st Medical Battalion (Evac) o 221st Military Intelligence Battalion o 122nd Rear Operations Center
Headquartered in Decatur, the 78th Troop Command is made up of more than 3,000 men and women drilling in more than 25 hometown armories.
In November, command of the unit transferred from Brigadier General Michael L. Seely to Colonel Terrell T. Reddick.
General Seely left the unit to become Assistant Adjutant General and Commander of the Georgia Army National Guard.
Other significant activities during 1999 included:
u The 110th Corps Support Battalion participated in operation "Golden Cargo 99," a massive transportation operation that included transporting more than 4,500 tons of Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) pods from the Savanna Army Ammunition Depot in northern Illinois to the Lone Star Ammunition Plant in eastern Texas.
The 903-mile mission involved moving more than 231truckloads of the ammunition, made up of more than 11,000 MLRS rockets.
The Columbus-based unit was the task force headquarters for the four-week exercise that involved more than 600 personnel from seven National Guard units, including elements from Wisconsin, Missouri and Ohio.
Units of the Georgia National Guard that participated also included:
o The 1177th Transportation Company from Barnesville and LaGrange. o The 1148th Transportation Company from Thomasville. o The 1230th Transportation Company from Bainbridge.
u The 878th Engineer Combat Heavy Battalion participated in "Operation Caribbean Castle-99" in the Dominican Republic.
Involving more than 500 Georgia engineers, the overseas deployment was made up of three, separate 15-day rotations that spanned May and June.
National Guard units participating included engineer companies from Augusta, Lyons, Swainsboro and Sandersville, along with the battalion headquarters from Augusta.
The battalion constructed three schools desperately needed in the wake of Hurricane Georges that swept the island nation in 1998.
u Some 150 members of the Kennesaw-based 277th Maintenance Company conducted a three-week deployment to Germany, augmenting vehicle repair and maintenance operations.
The unit was based at the U.S. Army Equipment Maintenance Center at Kaiserslautern.
Vehicles from throughout Europe, including the war-torn Balkan region, were cycled through the center for major maintenance, repair and rebuilding.
u In March, 16 members of the 202nd Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit conducted a two-week deployment to Panama.
The unit cleared small arms and artillery ranges of unexploded ammunition and scrap metal in preparation for the return of the Panama Canal Zone to the Panamanian government.
u Members of the 178th Military Police Company also deployed to Panama to support the closing of the Panama Canal Zone.
The Monroe-based unit was the last U.S. reserve component unit to rotate through the country before the transfer.
u Nine members of the Newnan-based Company H, 121st Infantry Long Range Surveillance Company (LRSC) deployed to the Republic of Georgia as part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program.
The soldiers participated with military forces of the republic in a variety of infantry training operations including search and rescue, escape and evasion, rappelling, and small infantry tactics.
This was the third trip for LRSC soldiers to the Republic of Georgia.
u In November, soldiers of Company H, 121st Infantry (LRSC) deployed to the African nation of Tunisia for a two-weeks.
Thirty members of the unit participated in Operation Atlas Drop.
u The 221st Military Intelligence Battalion made history in June when Lieutenant Colonel Maria L. Britt assumed command of the 400-member unit.
Colonel Britt, a 17-year veteran of the National Guard and a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, became the Georgia Army National Guard's first female battalion commander.

Georgia Air National Guard
Commander: Brig. Gen. Walter Corish Senior Enlisted Advisor: Command Master Sgt.
Frank Murray
The second leg of Georgia's Department of Defense triad is the Georgia Air National Guard that numbers more than 3,200 airmen located in nine units throughout Georgia.
Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF)
Greater demands for multiple deployments, rapid crisis response, and on-going operations have a major impact on the Air National Guard in Georgia.
The trend of deploying more often and for longer periods places greater stress on all Air Guardsmen.
The Air Force recently implemented the Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept which seeks to balance the workload on our Guardsmen by widening the resource pool and the number of units that deploy.
The AEF will help sustain Air Force assets and retain quality people while deploying timely and relevant forces to meet the demands of our national strategy.
Under the AEF concept, Guardsmen will now have a predictable schedule of 90-day deployments every 15 months, thus helping them manage their on-going training requirements and enjoy a better quality of family life.
Both the 116th Bomb Wing and the 165th Airlift Wing begin their 90-day eligibility March 1, 2000.
116th Bomb Wing Headquarters: Robins Air Force Base Commander: Col. Tom Lynn Aircraft: B-1B Lancer bombers The Georgia Air National Guard has two flying wings.
The largest is the 116th Bomb Wing located at Robins Air Force Base.
The unit numbers more than 1,100 Air Guardsmen and is one of only two Air National Guard units in the nation to fly the B-1B bomber.
u In May 1999, the 116th Bomb Wing was awarded its tenth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award making it the only Air Force unit, either active or reserve, to be awarded this prestigious award on ten different occasions.
u The Robins AFB-based bomb wing deployed to the Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) in Savannah during April for an Operational Readiness Exercise (ORE) involving more than 630 Guardsmen and six B-1B aircraft.
u More than 200 Air Guardsmen and five B-1Bs deployed to Nellis AFB, Nevada, for Operation Desert Peach in support of the USAF Fighter Weapons School.
u The 116th Bomb Wing participated in a test of the new Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept in August through September placing six B-1Bs on alert status for immediate deployment if required.
165th Airlift Wing Headquarters: Savannah Intl.
Airport Commander: Col. Steven Westgate Aircraft: C-130H Hercules
Savannah's 165th Airlift Wing, located at the Savannah International Airport, represents the global reach of Georgia's Air National Guard.
The unit flies the C-130H Hercules aircraft and provides reliable, responsive, combat-ready air transport of troops and supplies worldwide.
u The 165th Airlift Wing flew airlift missions in support of U.S. interests throughout Central and South America from Puerto Rico following the close of the Coronet Oak mission in Panama.
u C-130 crews of the 165th Airlift Wing took part in the world's largest air show, the Royal International Air Tattoo, near London, in July.
u Twenty security personnel from the 165th Airlift Wing deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Southern Watch.

Joint and State Operations
The Department of Defense is involved in a variety of non-traditional mis- sions which capitalize on the unique capabilities and assets of both the Georgia Army and Air National Guard.
These missions are under the direction of the Joint Operations Directorate headquartered at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
Joint and state operations include the Counterdrug Task Force, the weapons of mass destruction RAID unit, the Youth Challenge Academy, domestic action projects and the State Partnership Program.
The Joint Operations Directorate is also responsible for planning and coordinating military support to civil authorities including assistance to state and local emergency management and law enforcement officials.
Counterdrug Task Force
The Counterdrug Task Force is made up of 60 highly trained Georgia Guardsmen who assist state and local law enforcement agencies in carrying out the "war on drugs" in Georgia.
During 1999, the Counterdrug Task Force supported 458 missions, that resulted in seizures of illegal narcotics with a street value of more than $88.7 million.
A second component of the Counterdrug Task Force is the Drug Demand Reduction program which offers educational programs to schools and civic organizations on drug awareness.
During 1999, this program was presented to more than 120 audiences reaching an estimated 60,000 students statewide.
Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection team
Georgia is one of only ten states assigned a weapons of mass destruction team whose responsibility is to respond to potential terrorist incidents.
The 4th Military Support Detachment (MSD), which is known as a "Rapid Assessment and Interdiction Detection (RAID)" unit, is located at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
Comprised of 22 full-time National Guard members, the unit began early 1999 with a goal to become fully operational by January 1, 2000.
The 4th MSD (RAID) is equipped with chemical, biological and radiological protective and monitoring equipment, along with advanced satellite communications and computer systems.
When requested by emergency officials, the unit can rapidly respond to any nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological incident occurring within a five state region.
Youth Challenge Academy
Georgia's Youth Challenge Academy (YCA) is one of fifteen similar programs across the nation sponsored by the National Guard and ranks at the top in the number of students successfully graduating and receiving their General Education Development (GED) certificates and high school diplomas.
The Georgia Department of Defense started the Youth Challenge program in 1993 to help high school dropouts acquire the basic academic, life and employment skills to succeed.
As of 1999, 19 YCA classes have graduated from the 22-week residential program at Fort Stewart.
To date more than 2,200 Georgia youth have successfully completed the program.
State Partnership Program
The State Partnership Program is designed to promote relationships between each of the 50 United States and developing nations of the former Eastern Bloc.
As part of this unique and effective program, the Georgia Department of Defense has partnered with the Republic of Georgia, which is situated on the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia.
Over the past five years, the two "Georgias" have developed a close and productive alliance.
During 1999, members of Newnan's Company H, 121st Infantry, (LRSC) journeyed to the Republic of Georgia to train alongside their counterparts in search and rescue techniques, and mountain operations in the rugged Caucuses Mountains.
At the same time, National Guard officers from the Republic of Georgia visited the U.S. to participate in command post exercises with staff officers from the Macon-based 48th Infantry Brigade( Mechanized).
In the fall of 1999, Major General David B. Poythress, The Adjutant General, led a contingent of senior Georgia DoD leaders to the Republic of Georgia to meet with senior government and military leaders in the capital city of Tiblisi.
Hurricane Floyd
The Georgia Department of Defense and National Guard is always prepared to assist state and local emergency management and law enforcement officials in times of need.
In September 1999, more than 800 Georgia National Guard troops were called to state active duty during Hurricane Floyd.
Soldiers and airmen assisted in the massive evacuation of thousands of Georgians from-and their return to-the coastal regions of the state.
National Guardsmen also provided security and communications support to state and local authorities.
In addition to the response to Hurricane Floyd, Georgia Army National Guard helicopters assisted in battling forest fires that ravaged south Georgia and north Florida during the summer of 1999, and National Guard units in Savannah provided logistical support during the flooding in Chatham County in late June.

Georgia State Defense Force
[sdf1.jpg]
Commander: Brig. Gen. Joel Seymour
Senior Enlisted: Command Master Sgt.
Peter Bardoul
The Georgia State Defense Force is an all-volunteer organization that forms the third leg of the Georgia Department of Defense.
In the long-standing heritage of the colonial "Minuteman," these volunteers serve only at the direction of state officials.
This uniformed, disciplined and trained force, numbering more than 300, can be mobilized rapidly to provide immediate, short-term aid and support to local communities.
It is also available to support Georgia National Guard forces deployed on state missions and to provide assistance to the families of federalized National Guard units.
During 1999, State Defense Force volunteers participated in a number of activities.
In September, GSDF members provided assistance both in the Georgia Emergency Operations Center and to residents along the coast as Hurricane Floyd bore down on the state.
GSDF volunteers also provided visitor assistance, traffic control and first aid support for Macon's Cherry Blossom Festival and for the Callaway Gardens Balloon Fest.
In other activities, the Georgia State Defense Force reached out to the homeless during Veteran's Stand-down activities in both Atlanta and Macon where more than 430 individuals were provided medical care, clothing, sleeping bags and food.
In LaGrange, GSDF volunteers also provided assistance to Special Olympics competitions.
