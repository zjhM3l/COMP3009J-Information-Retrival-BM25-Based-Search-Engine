ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on June 26, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Shorty's, Inc., License Number R-10086 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation contains three counts.
Count one of the citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 13.102(a) of the Liquor Control Board Regulations [40 Pa.
Code Â§13.102(a)], in that on May 4, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, discounted the price of alcoholic beverages for a period or periods other than a consecutive period of time not to exceed two hours in a business day.
Count two of the citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 102 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§1-102], in that the licensed premises was not a bona fide restaurant on May 5, 1998, in that Licensee, by its servants, agents, or employes, maintained no food items and only 18 chairs at 7 tables; which is insufficient as required by law to accommodate at least 30 persons at one time.
Count three of the citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. 4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on May 5, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on November 14, 1997 and was completed on May 12, 1998; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on May 22, 1998.
The notice of violation was received by Licensee on May 27, 1998.
Evidentiary hearings were held on this matter on October 27, 1998 and January 19, 1999 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:

(N.T., 10/27/98 at 10-11)
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW :
Count one - Sustained as charged.
Count two - Sustained only as to insufficient chairs and tables.
Count three - Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the two hearings held on the matter, the two enforcement officers testified in detail as to their
open inspection of the licensed premises.
Licensee appeared at the January 19, 1999 hearing and testified that he was unaware of the Happy Hour restrictions, that he has sufficient microwaveable food including sandwiches, burritos and pizzas; however, his cleaning lady took the food out of the refrigerator and placed it in a beer cooler without his knowledge which he found later.
He denied that the $249.00 in U.S. currency was gambling proceeds but money used as change due to a series of robberies at the licensed premises.
As to Count one, Section 13.102(a) provides, in part, as follows:
a.
General.
Retail licensees may discount the price of alcoholic beverages for a consecutive period of time not to exceed 2 hours in a business day, but may not engage in discount pricing practices between 12 midnight and the legal closing hour.
Retail licensees may not engage in the following discount pricing practices unless specifically excepted in subsection (b):...
As to Count two, Section 102 of the Liquor Code defines restaurant as follows: "Restaurant" shall mean a reputable place operated by responsible persons of goodreputation and habitually and principally used for the purpose of providing food for the public, the place to have an area within a building of not less than four hundred square feet, equipped with tables and chairs accommodating at least thirty persons at one time.
As to Count three, Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
A video slot machine is by definition a gambling device per se.
The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes "other sufficient cause" as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
As such, Counts one and three are sustained as charged; Count two is sustained only as to insufficient tables and chairs.
PRIOR RECORD :
Licensee has been licensed since August 17, 1989, and has had no prior violations.
PENALTY :
Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] prescribes a penalty of license suspension or revocation or a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00 or both for violations of the types found in this case.
After due consideration of the circumstances giving rise to the citation, the following penalty will be imposed:
Count one - $50.00 fine;
Count two - $150.00 fine and one day suspension and continuing until Licensee submits a certification that it has sufficient seating at tables and chairs to accommodate 30 persons.
Count three - $450.00 fine.
