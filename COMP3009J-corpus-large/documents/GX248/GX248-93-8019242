Gambling Expansion Will Hurt Pennsylvania Families An Op-Ed by Pennsylvania Auditor General Robert P. Casey, Jr.

spacer Within the next few days, Pennsylvania legislators will consider several proposals to bring slot machines, riverboat casinos, and video poker into the Commonwealth.
spacer But before enacting any such proposal, our legislators and Governor Ridge must first answer this question for taxpayers: Will the expansion of gambling enhance the lives of Pennsylvania families?
spacer I firmly believe the answer is no.
spacer Time and again, the people of Pennsylvania have also answered this question with a resounding NO because they fear the effects that slot machines and casinos will have on their families and their communities.
spacer In every game there are winners and losers.
In this game, the winners are well-connected insiders and wealthy out-of-state casino owners.
The losers are the families across Pennsylvania dreaming of a brighter future for their children, but already struggling to make ends meet, to educate their children, and to pay for child care.
spacer Proponents of gambling expansion claim that the added revenue will improve our schools, raise money for sports stadiums, and spur economic development.
But these empty promises are not worth sacrificing the well being of our families.
spacer The data from states that have expanded gambling is bone chilling.
spacer If casinos come to Pennsylvania, older citizens may be hit the hardest.
According to counselors at a private, nonprofit agency for compulsive gamblers, gambling is more financially devastating than alcohol and drug abuse combined.
Furthermore, the suicide rate for those who gamble is 200-percent higher than the U.S. average.
The average wage earner in Pennsylvania makes about $26,000 a year.
But the average debt of compulsive gamblers who called a New Jersey-based gambler helpline in 1997 (1-800-GAMBLER) was more than $35,000.
The average caller said they spent about eight hours in the casino every time they visited.
spacer The dream of jobs and prosperity from riverboat casinos on the Susquehanna River and slot machines at Penn National must be weighed against the harsh realities of gambling for our families.
A hundred dollars gambled on a roulette wheel is a hundred dollars not spent at a family-sustaining business.
A hundred dollars lost at a black jack table is a hundred dollars not spent to put food on the dinner table.
A hundred dollars dropped in the slot machine is a hundred dollars not spent for childcare.
A hundred dollars wasted on ten-to-one odds is a hundred dollars not available for a child's medical check-up.
spacer Pennsylvania's elected officials have a responsibility to make laws that strengthen families.
The upcoming push for riverboat casinos, video poker and slots at racetracks fails to meet that goal.
spacer Other states have gone for the lure of easy money, only to be caught in a web of despair: suicides, divorces, addictions, bankruptcies, broken lives.
Make no mistake about it; there are real costs, in addition to the human costs, associated with gambling.
Taxpayers will end up paying a lot more in social services, police and law enforcement, and infrastructure to build a gambling empire that rivals Atlantic City.
spacer When I was elected Auditor General, I promised to be an independent watchdog for taxpayers and an advocate for working families, the young in school and older Pennsylvanians.
For the past two years, I have spoken out on a number of issues that affect families, from improving the quality of long-term nursing home care to expanding the children's health insurance program to strengthening state laws that protect our children.
spacer This week I joined with members of the General Assembly from both parties, the Pennsylvania Family Institute, and other concerned taxpayers to oppose expanded gambling because of the serious, adverse impact it will have on children and families.
The special interest money is against us, but the people are on our side.
We hope you will join our efforts to stand up to the casino owners and the lobbyists and protect the well being of Pennsylvania families.
