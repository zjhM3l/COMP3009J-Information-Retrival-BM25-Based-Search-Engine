EPISD requires that all core curriculum teachers of gifted and talented students meet the state minimum required 30 hours of in-service training and the required six hours of annual training.
Teachers can obtain this level of training through Region 20, district in-service training, Texas Association of Gifted and Talented state conferences and other special out-of-district services.
FINDING
In the fall of 1999-2000, beginning with the ninth grade class, EPISD implemented the Eagle Academy of Curriculum Opportunities for Science and Math Oriented Students (COSMOS) at Eagle Pass High School.
The Eagle Academy COSMOS program is a college prep program with a focus on health and science.
Students enroll in Pre-AP and AP courses for their core course requirements.
Electives are chosen from Science, Health Science Technology courses, computer courses and Scientific Research.
Students completing the Eagle Academy COSMOS program meet the requirements for the Recommended Graduation Plan of the State of Texas.
EPISD is located in Maverick County near the Texas-Mexico border.
This area is known as the Winter Garden Region and is designated as a medically under served area with a health professional shortage.
Prior to the COSMOS program there was no program in this area to identify, orient and motivate high school students to pursue professional health careers.
According to reports from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC), the number of Hispanic applicants from Texas to medical schools is very small.
Students in the fourth year of the program complete an internship at Fort Duncan Medical Facility in Eagle Pass.
EPISD partners with University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio (UTHSCA).
Networking with health care professions enables students to receive guidance in selecting and pursuing a health career.
COMMENDATION
EPISD has implemented a program focusing on health careers to address the shortage of health professionals in the area.
