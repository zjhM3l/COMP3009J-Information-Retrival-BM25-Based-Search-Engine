Teens play games such as Chess, Checkers, Clue, Chinese Checkers, Uno, card games, dice games, dominoes, Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk.
Winners receive candy as prizes.
At the end of the program, the entire group receives candy.
Rotate the players and/or have at least one game everyone plays together such as bingo, charades, or Pictionary.
Teens seem to stay in their clicks with board games, so games that include everyone are important to create a sense of community.
Preparation
Buy popular board games and/or ask teens to bring their favorites.
Promotion
Create a flyer advertising the date and time of your programs and include a catchy phrase such as "Don't be Bored.
Play Board Games on Wednesdays from 1-3 p.m. at the ____________ Library Branch!"
Variation
Focus on one type of game like chess and have a tournament.
Or, play a different game each week.
For example play chess one week and checkers or dominoes the next.
Checker games are easy to create.
Buy different types of candy for the playing pieces, for example, peppermint patties and small peanut butter cups.
Draw a board game on poster board.
Teens who win a series of games get to keep the candy.
