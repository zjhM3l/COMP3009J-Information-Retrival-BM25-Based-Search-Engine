ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on May 21, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Home Association of V.F.W. of Freeport No. 6648, License Number C-4873 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on March 25, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on January 30, 1998 and was completed on April 17, 1998; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on April 24, 1998.
The notice of violation was received by Licensee on April 28, 1998.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on October 13, 1998 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
1.
Licensee holds Club Liquor License Number C-4873 in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.
(N.T., 4)
2.
On March 25, 1998 at 5:45 p.m., an enforcement officer conducted an open inspection of the licensed premises and found two Cherry Master video slot machines set up inside and operational.
3.
The officer placed a dollar into each machine and received 20 credits.
(N.T., 9)
4.
The officer found a button located on the right rear of the machine which when pressed caused the 20 credits to erase from the display screen.
(N.T., 9-10)
5.
The two video slot machines were seized and placed into evidence.
(N.T., 10)
6.
On April 16, 1998, an enforcement officer inspected the video slot machines and found that both machines accepted U.S. currency at 5 cents per credit, had a double-up feature with a maximum bet of 64 credits and a short playing time of three to five seconds.
(N.T., 12)
7.
The video slot machines consisted of a screen with a nine block grid of bars', bells' and fruits' icons which rotated per play.
(N.T., 12)
8.
The machine awarded credits based on the combination of the bars', bells', fruits' icons at the end of the play.
(N.T., 12)
9.
Both of the machines had a power interrupt switch, a knock-off device for erasing credits and video accounting which was activated by an internal switch or by connecting two wires inside of the machine.
(N.T., 12-13)
CONCLUSION OF LAW :
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the hearing held on the matter, the enforcement officer testified in detail as to his examination of the two video slot machines seized from the licensed premises.
The officer did not receive any gambling payoff from the bartender.
(N.T., 15)
Licensee's witness, the president of the Home Association, testified that he had no personal knowledge of gambling payoffs being made by the bartender and that the club uses them as well as bingos to raise funds to keep the place afloat.
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
A video slot machine is by definition a gambling device per se.
The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes "other sufficient cause" as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
I find the testimony of the officer to be credible and the video slot machines were gambling devices per se.
As such, the citation is sustained as charged.
