Conversion From Another Jurisdiction's Commercial Driver License
(1) The Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division of the Department of Transportation (DMV) will require an applicant for a commercial driver license in this state who currently holds a CDL issued by another jurisdiction to:
(a) Take and pass the Class C knowledge test and a vision screening; and
(b) Take and pass the pre-trip inspection, drive test and knowledge test required, if the person applies for a higher class license.
(2) DMV may waive the drive tests or knowledge tests, except the Class C knowledge test and the hazardous materials endorsement knowledge test, if the applicant applies for a license equal to the CDL the applicant has been issued by another jurisdiction and the CDL has not been expired for more than one year.
(3) DMV may require any applicant to take a knowledge or drive test prior to issuing a CDL.
(4) When a person has surrendered his or her Oregon CDL to obtain a CDL from another jurisdiction, DMV may replace or renew the Oregon CDL without requiring a drive test or knowledge test if:
(a) The applicant has moved back to Oregon and can provide proof of residence address in Oregon; and
(b) The Oregon CDL is not currently expired, or if expired, has not been expired for more than one year.
Rather than issue a replacement CDL, DMV will renew the Oregon CDL if it is due to expire within the next 13 months.
(5) DMV will not renew an Oregon CDL unless the applicant meets the requirements of OAR 735-062-0090 and 735-074-0290.
(6) DMV will submit an inquiry through the Commercial Driver License Information System (CDLIS) and the National Driver Register (NDR)/ Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) before issuing, replacing or renewing an Oregon CDL.
DMV will not issue, replace or renew an Oregon CDL if the inquiry shows:
(a) The applicant has a current and valid CDL, issued by another jurisdiction unless the CDL is surrendered to DMV or the applicant certifies it has been lost or destroyed;
(b) The applicant's driving privileges are suspended, revoked or canceled in another jurisdiction; or
(c) The applicant is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle in another jurisdiction.
(7) The driving record of the applicant from another jurisdiction will become a part of the Oregon driving record as provided in OAR 735-060-0017.
(8) A person whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, or canceled in another jurisdiction or who has been disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle in another jurisdiction, must be eligible for valid driving privileges in the other jurisdiction before an Oregon CDL may be issued.
When the person is eligible for valid driving privileges in the other jurisdiction, he or she may ask that DMV check CDLIS and NDR/PDPS to verify the eligibility.
