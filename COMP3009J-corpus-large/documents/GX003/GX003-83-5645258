February 12, 1999 (30 CFR Parts 707 and 874) 64 FR 7470 Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program; Enhancing AML Reclamation ACTION: Final rule.
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is amending its rules concerning the financing of Abandoned Mine Land reclamation (AML) projects that involve the incidental extraction of coal.
Projections of receipts to the AML fund through the year 2004, when the authority to collect fees will expire, strongly indicate that there will be insufficient money to address all problems currently listed in the Abandoned Mine Land Inventory System.
Given these limited AML reclamation resources, OSM is establishing an innovative way for AML agencies, working with contractors, to maximize available funds to increase AML reclamation.
The first revision amends the definition of "government-financed construction" to allow less than 50 percent government funding when the construction is an approved AML project under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or "the Act").
The second revision adds a new section which requires specific consultations and concurrences with the Title V regulatory authority for AML construction projects receiving less than 50 percent government financing.
These consultations and concurrences are intended to ensure the appropriateness of the project being undertaken as a Title IV AML project and not under the Title V regulatory program.

January 6, 1999 64 FR 925 Notice of Availability of the Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact for the Construction of the Diamond Fork Campground; Utah County, Utah ACTION: Notice of availability of the decision notice and finding of no significant impact.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement in 1984 and a Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement in 1990 for the Diamond Fork System recommending, among other things, construction of recreation facilities in Diamond Fork Canyon to mitigate for camping facilities impacted by the construction of the Central Utah Project and to provide recreational opportunities for growing populations along the Wasatch Front.
The Spanish Fork Ranger District of the Uinta National Forest and the Mitigation Commission released an Environmental Assessment dated February 23, 1997.
It describes environmental effects of a proposal to redesign and upgrade the existing Diamond and Palmyra campgrounds in an effort to complete these recommendations.
Based on public and agency input, the Spanish Fork Ranger District and the Mitigation Commission released a revised EA dated September 28, 1998, to incorporate a new alternative that responded to concerns raised.
The new proposal rehabilitates the existing Diamond and Palmyra campgrounds, yet reduces the capacity by approximately 33 percent.
Individual campsites and loops within the 100-year flood plain will be moved to a higher terrace to protect riparian vegetation and facilitate future stream restoration efforts.
Group-site facilities will be closed and reconstructed in a more suitable location that will be analyzed under a separate action.
Sections of the campground impacting wild turkey roosting habitat will be closed and reclaimed.
These changes represent a significant change from the previous proposal where the campground capacity would have been increased by approximately 46 percent.
This change reduces impacts on riparian vegetation and minimizes potential impacts on future stream restoration efforts, which were the two primary concerns raised by agencies and the public during initial release of the EA. Six alternatives were considered and analyzed in the September 28, 1998 EA.
The Spanish Fork Ranger District and the Mitigation Commission selected Alternative G, the Proposed Action, for implementation.
