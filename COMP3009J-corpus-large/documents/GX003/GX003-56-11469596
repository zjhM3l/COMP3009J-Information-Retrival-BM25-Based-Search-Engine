Half-Staffing the U.S. Flag
The official flag of the United States is to be flown at half-staff at REE locations on the following occasions: * Upon the death of certain persons as identified in Exhibit 1.
* At the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture.
Computation of periods for half-staffing:
When the number of days is specified: * The day of death counts as the first day, even if the flags were not placed at half-staff that day because death occurred after the normal time to lower the flags for the day or notification was received too late to half-staff on that day.
* The flags must be flown each day for the specified days, even if they would not normally be flown on some of the days.
This policy is applicable only if operating personnel normally scheduled to work are available to perform this function.
On the death and on the following day:
If notification of death is received before the normal time to lower the flags for the day, the flags will be lowered to half-staff on that day and flown at half-staff on the following day.
* If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the flags are flown at half-staff only on the day following death.
* If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on the following day.
However, if notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the flags are flown at half- staff only on the following day.
From the day of death until interment:
If notification of death is received before the time the flags are normally lowered for the day, the flags must be lowered to half staff on that day.
The flags will also be flown at half-staff on each succeeding day, including the day of interment.
* If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the flags must be flown at half-staff beginning the following day and on each succeeding day through the day of interment.
* If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on each succeeding day, including the day of internment.
If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, above instructions for the "day of death and the following day," under "Computation of periods for half-staffing," apply.
Coincident occasions to half-staff:
If during a period when the flags are already at half-staff, notification of another death is received, the half-staff period will run concurrently, not consecutively.
