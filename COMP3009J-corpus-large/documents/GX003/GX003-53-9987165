Mike Fisher: Attorney General of Pennsylvania - Working toward a safer Pennsylvania Return to Main Page Anthrax Hoaxes Won't Be Tolerated Attorney General Mike Fisher is promising swift prosecution for those involved in anthrax hoaxes or other public false alarms.
The cautionary words come following a wave of incidents that have swept across Pennsylvania and the rest of the country.
Fisher says there's not only a need for public awareness about anthrax, but also the need for public calm.
He adds that there are now efforts to increase penalties for bogus bio-terror incidents and other hoaxes.
"I know I can speak for all law enforcement, that at this time of tragedy in American history, we have absolutely no tolerance for anybody who would perpetuate any kind of hoax or fraud on the people of Pennsylvania.
Anybody who would dare, for whatever reason, to phone in a phony bomb scare or phony anthrax threat, or would send a package with some kind of non-toxic white powder in an attempt to scare another person, should understand that we have no tolerance for that."
Attorney General Mike Fisher says work is also underway to make existing penalties even tougher.
"Not only do we have laws on the books, but I can tell you that the Pennsylvania General Assembly is moving forward, and will be moving forward quickly, to make those violations felonies."
Attorney General Fisher has another warning about these false alarms.
"We ask for patience and we ask the people of Pennsylvania go on living their lives.
But, we also ask anybody who might have any criminal intent - please, don't further disturb the American people - because if you do, you're going to be prosecuted, and the full weight of the law is going to be put behind out efforts to do that."
Attorney General Mike Fisher says Pennsylvanians should be prepared, but not panic.
"People shouldn't overreact.
We do not want people to all of the sudden not go to their mailbox, not open their mail or throw away their mail.
But people should be cautious.
If you see something out of the ordinary leave that package lie exactly where it is and call 9-1-1.
If you are a commercial establishment or government agency with a high volume of mail you have probably already taken steps to make sure that the people who are opening mail use gloves or face masks, but again - if they see something unusual they should set that package aside, call 9-1-1 and get someone to come and look at it."
Attorney General Mike Fisher adds that it is important to continue with your normal activities.
"I think the most important thing is to not overreact.
The people of Pennsylvania, and the people across American, should go on living their lives.
Do whatever you would normally do, but do it better and be a little more cautious."
