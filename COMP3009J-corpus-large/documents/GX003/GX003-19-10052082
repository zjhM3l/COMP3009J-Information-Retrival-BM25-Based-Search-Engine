Questions Regarding the Status of Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC) Investigation into Electricity Markets in California and the West
May 24, 2002
The Honorable Patrick Wood, III Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20426
Dear Chairman Wood:
We are writing to request that you provide the Committee on Energy and Commerce with specific information regarding the status of Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC) investigation into electricity markets in California and the West.
The FERC began its investigation of Western bulk power markets in July 2000.
Since then, in a series of subsequent investigations, findings and orders, the FERC has taken numerous steps and made numerous recommendations attempting to address electricity supply shortages and price volatility in California and the region.
Throughout this time, as you may recall, this Committee has carefully followed the FERCs activities, along with Californias attempts to correct its flawed electricity restructuring policies, and the West-wide energy crisis in general.
Beginning with a field hearing in San Diego in September 11, 2000, the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality (at that time Energy and Power) conducted numerous hearings to investigate the electric supply and pricing problems occurring in California, culminating in a legislative process and a written admonition by this Committee for the FERC to take all necessary steps to ensure that wholesale power prices are just and reasonable.
In the 107^th Congress, the Committee developed an extensive hearing record on the California energy crisis.
On February 15, 2001, the Subcommittee held a hearing entitled Electricity Markets: Lessons Learned From California, in which we heard testimony from California utility regulators, utilities, market participants, and market analysts.
On March 20 and 22, 2001, the Subcommittee held two days of hearings entitled Electricity Markets: California.
In addition to further examining the causes of the electricity supply problems experienced by California, witnesses were asked to comment on what California has done and could do to address the problem, and similarly what FERC has done and could do to address the situation.
These recommendations resulted in a legislative proposal, The Electric Emergency Act of 2001, two days of legislative hearings in May 2001, and a successful Subcommittee markup.
While the bill was never enacted into law, many of the proposals were subsequently adopted by both Federal agencies and the State of California.
The FERC testified at three of the Subcommittees hearings on the energy crisis in California and the West.
Throughout these hearings, the Subcommittee heard numerous allegations and denials of wholesale electricity price manipulation, and numerous allegations and denials of failure of the State and Federal regulatory structures governing electricity markets and expansion of electric power infrastructure.
In a letter dated June 12, 2001, Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton, along with 13 other House members, expressed strong concern about the threat of price spikes and blackouts that summer, and strongly advised the FERC to take further actions to mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California.
Specifically, the letter called on FERC to create a West-wide price mitigation plan to ensure that all rates for wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable and, if rates were not just and reasonable, to require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law.
Soon thereafter, the FERC expanded its innovative plan for market monitoring and mitigation in California, and opened a formal investigation into real-time wholesale power sales throughout the West.
On February 13, 2002, the FERC initiated yet another fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices.
As part of that investigation, the FERC recently released several documents in its possession describing the questionable trading practices of Enron Corporation.
We are deeply troubled about market manipulation as described in the memos.
We ask the FERC to carefully review the impacts upon consumers of practices that created artificial congestion, increased benchmark prices, or exaggerated revenues and trading quantities through mutual round-trip transactions.
In light of these recent disclosures, we request that the FERC provide answers to the following questions no later than Friday, June 7, 2002.
1.
Since the FERC issued its December 15, 2000 Order, what specific steps has the FERC taken to investigate wholesale power sales in California and the West? 2.
Summarize the FERCs findings to date resulting from these investigations, including the principal causes of electric power price volatility over the past two years in California and Western Markets and any other contributing factors.
3.
What is the FERCs view of the legality of the practices described in the Enron memos? 4.
Did the trading practices described in the Enron memos violate specific rules of the California Independent System Operator? 5.
When did the FERC become aware of the Enron memoranda? 6.
Was the FERC previously aware of such trading practices by (a) Enron Corporation; or (b) other power sellers (including entities not directly subject to the FERCs jurisdiction)? 7.
What specific steps it the FERC taking to investigate similar trading practices by other power sellers (including non-jurisdictional entities)? 8.
Summarize the preliminary findings of the FERC regarding the February 23, 2002 fact-finding investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices.
9.
Does the existence of such trading practices as described in the Enron memos change the earlier conclusions of the FERC regarding the principle causes and contributing factors of high wholesale power prices in California and the West? 10.
Has the FERC undertaken any analysis of the impact of such trading practices on consumer electricity prices? If so, please provide the Committee with your findings, along with the data and information used in the analysis.
11.
(Describe the FERCs legal authority to investigate and, if appropriate, regulate such trading practices.
Include a description of the FERCs authority with respect to entities not directly subject to the FERCs jurisdiction.
12.
Assess whether the FERCs current legal authority is adequate to address any harms to the public interest related to such trading practices (including with respect to non-jurisdictional entities).
13.
Recently, a California State Senate committee investigating the electricity crisis released the transcript of a conversation on July 3, 2001, between an employee of the California Independent System Operator (CA ISO) and a trader for Enron Corporation.
In that conversation, the CA ISO employee requests that the Enron trader place a bid to buy excess standby power at a specific price, reveals bidding information only available to the CA ISO, and attempts to artificially raise the price for excess standby power in the hour-ahead market.
Please describe the specific steps the FERC has taken to investigate this incident.
Does the FERC have information regarding other incidents in which the CA ISO has attempted to manipulate power prices? Please describe the status of any FERC investigations of the CA ISO and summarize any findings to date resulting from such investigations.
Please provide written responses and all pertinent documents no later than the close of business June 14, 2002.
If you have any questions, please contact Jason Bentley, Committee Counsel, at (202) 226-2424.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
W.J.
