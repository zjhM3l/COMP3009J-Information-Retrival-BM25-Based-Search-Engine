Republican Party
If you have ever wanted to lower taxes so you can keep more of what you earn, you should vote Republican.
If you have ever thought that career criminals should be taken off our streets and locked away forever, you should vote Republican.
If you have ever thought that we must put an end to illegal immigration once and for all, you should vote Republican.
The California Republican Party will fight for: * Tougher penalties for career criminals.
We will fight the liberals who killed the ''Three Strikes and You're Out" law.
* An end to runaway illegal immigration.
Help the Republican Party fight to stop the enormous burden illegal immigration puts on California's economy, schools, and hospitals.
* A balanced federal budget.
It's high-time the bloated federal government lived within its means.
American families have to balance their budgets--why shouldn't the government? * A middle-class tax cut.
Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn.
The Republican Party is committed to cutting taxes for America's middle class.
* A truly colorblind society by working to end special preferences and quotas based upon race.
All Americans must be judged on personal merit--not upon arbitrary quotas.

Natural Law Party
The Natural Law Party is America's fastest growing political party--on target to make history as the first third party ever to run 1,000 candidates on the ballot in all 50 states.
The Natural Law Party stands for prevention-oriented government, conflict-free politics, and proven solutions designed to bring national life into harmony with natural law, including:
* Cutting taxes deeply and responsibly through cost-effective solutions to America's problems, rather than by eliminating essential services * Natural health care programs to prevent disease, promote health, and cut health care costs by 50% * Proven educational initiatives and curriculum innovations that develop the inner creative genius of the student and boost educational outcomes * Effective, field-tested crime prevention and rehabilitation programs that significantly reduce crime, recidivism, and the pervasive stress and tension plaguing society * Sustainable agriculture practices to increase crop yields and boost profitability without hazardous chemical fertilizers and pesticides * Renewable energy production and energy conservation to reduce pollution and create national energy self-sufficiency * Reducing government waste and special-interest control of politics
The application of these proven solutions will save America hundreds of billions of dollars, thus allowing the Natural Law Party to balance the budget and lower taxes simultaneously.

Reform Party
The Reform Party is the newest national political party whose birth was started in California in September of 1995.
In just 18 days, the Reform Party qualified for the ballot, registering over 120,000 members statewide, the fastest qualification effort in California history!
The Reform Party is the new political party for the 21st century.
We believe that every vote counts and seek to include all citizens in the political process.
Supporters of the Reform Party are voters who no longer believe either political party is representing their concerns and that the parties are too indebted to narrow interests to change the course of politics today.
Restoring America's confidence in her government, which is at an all time low, is our highest priority.
The Reform Party stands for:
* Setting the highest ethical standards for the White House and Congress * Balancing the federal budget as a top priority * Meaningful campaign finance reform * Term limits on Members of Congress * Creating a new, fair, paperless tax system that pays our nation's bills * Developing plans to deal with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security * Restricting abuses of foreign and domestic lobbying

American Independent Party
The American Independent Party, California affiliate of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, supports:
* Improved quality of public education as well as encouragement of private and home school alternatives; * Control of crime; stiff penalties for repeat offenders, with capital punishment where appropriate; putting criminals behind bars, rather than taking away the citizens' right to own firearms; * Protection of American jobs from the unfair foreign competition of the NAFTA and GATT/WTO agreements; * Control of immigration, legal and illegal, and denial of all tax funded benefits to illegal aliens; * A balanced budget now, along with tax relief to encourage private enterprise job creation; * Laws to protect the sanctity of human life, including the life of the unborn; * A debt free money system, and a non-interventionist foreign policy.
We oppose proposed revisions in the California Constitution which would limit your right to vote, impair the people's right of initiative, frustrate voter-adopted term limits, make it easier for government to tax and spend, and create non-responsive, bureaucrat dominated regional governments.
We oppose government speculation with Social Security trust funds, and affirmative action programs which substitute racial favoritism for ability.
Support these principles by voting American Independent.
End ''politics as usual."

Green Party
The Green Party is a new party that has arisen in response to the need for a new political vision free of the failed ideologies of both the right and the left.
The Green Party promotes an ecological vision which understands that all life on our planet is interconnected; that cooperation is more essential to our well-being than competition; and that all people are connected to and dependent upon one another and upon the natural systems of our world.
Politics must come to reflect this understanding, and political structures and processes must be based upon it if humanity is to continue to develop and prosper.
The Green Party was founded upon ten key values: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Social Justice, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Feminism, Respect for Diversity, Personal and Global Responsibility and Sustainable Future Focus.
