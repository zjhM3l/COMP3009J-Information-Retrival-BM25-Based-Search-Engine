Independence Day Celebration, Community Support.
The city of Jefferson hosted their 4th of July celebration June 29, 2002.
The local CAP squadron was onsite and had a booth at this event.
The booth consisted of video tapes of the fine CAP program, recruiting material, and the squadron sold cotton candy in an effort to raise much needed funds for the unit.
This is a great opportunity for the unit and the unit actually made a small profit from this event.
More importantly, the squadron was able to bring up the awareness of the unit in the community and meet some very interesting people.
The evening was topped off with a fireworks demonstration.
A special thanks to Mrs. Talleksen and Mrs. Reed and the rest of the squadron members who participated.
This event would not have been a success without the contributions of everyone.
A VERY special thanks to Mark Hunter and his family for the use of the cotton candy machine and supplies.
The following are pictures from this event.
