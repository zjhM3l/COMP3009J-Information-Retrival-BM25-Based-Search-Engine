Beating the Blood Sugar Blues Author: Joy Darlington
Five million Americans have diabetes and don't even know it.
Could you be one of them?
Olha O'Quinn was a 25-year-old graduate student in nutrition learning how to diagnose and treat various ailments when she failed to recognize a serious, chronic disease in herself.
She had all the textbook symptoms: She was thirsty all the time, constantly craved sodas and sweets, made frequent trips to the bathroom to urinate, had recurring bouts of vaginitis and felt tired most of the time.
She even had two major risk factors, being overweight and having a family history of the disease (her father had the condition).
It took a trip to the gynecologist and a blood test to discover that the culprit behind her symptoms was diabetes.
O'Quinn was stunned.
She's also a typical case, which is why diabetes is often called the silent killer.

While 11 million Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, experts estimate that an additional 5 million are diabetic and don't even know it, says Gerald Bernstein, M.D., director of the Diabetes Management Program at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City and past president of the American Diabetes Association.
"Victims often feel fine, so they don't bother seeing a doctor," he explains.
That's unfortunate, because every year 200,000 people die from complications caused by diabetes, making it the sixth leading cause of death by disease in the United States.
People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to suffer stroke or develop cardiovascular disease than those without diabetes, and they have a 13 times greater risk of advanced kidney failure.
Over time, diabetes can also lead to blindness, nerve damage, chronic infections, impotence and the need to amputate a foot or hand due to impaired circulation.
And yet researchers and doctors who treat the disease agree that there are simple steps everyone can take to treat diabetes--and often avoid the disease in the first place.
ANATOMY OF A KILLER
Diabetes is a disease of the metabolism: Something goes wrong with the way the body processes food.
When a healthy person eats carbohydrates (like bread, potatoes or cookies), they get broken down into sugar and sent into the bloodstream.
Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, then acts as a delivery system, moving the sugar from your blood into your cells, where it is burned for fuel.
When diabetes strikes, the pancreas either stops making insulin (type I diabetes, see "Is Your Child at Risk?" p. 70) or the body cells become insulin-resistant and "refuse delivery" of all or most of the sugar (type II).
Either way, sugar builds up in the blood, the body doesn't get enough fuel, and complications result.
Olha O'Quinn was diagnosed with type II diabetes, the more common form of the disease, which affects 90 percent of patients.
It usually strikes after age 40 (though O'Quinn was only 25 when she was diagnosed) and "is precipitated by a combination of obesity, lack of exercise and a genetic factor," says Catharine Tuck, M.D., associate director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia Presbyterian.
Center in New York.
The worst news is that type II diabetes is on the rise.
"There's been a sharp increase in the number of cases in recent years," says Bernstein.
"In fact, it's rising to epidemic proportions, and we expect the number to double in 10 years."
A review of the risk factors and a quick look at the American population tells us why.
1) Obesity: Americans (adults and children) are getting fatter.
2) Lack of exercise: We're living increasingly sedentary lives.
3) Age: As baby boomers get older, the number of Americans over 40--statistically at greater risk--increases.
4) Genetics: Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans and Native Americans have a higher incidence of the disease (12 to 15 percent, 10.8 percent and 30 percent respectively, compared with 5 to 6 percent among Caucasians), and these segments of the population are growing.
Fortunately, as dire as diabetes is, "it is not a death sentence," says Richard S. Rivlin, M.D., chief of the nutrition division at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
"You can live with it.
The keys to managing it are a healthful diet, regular exercise and stress management."
What's more, you can use these same tools to reduce your risk of developing the disease in the first place.
EAT RIGHT, STAY HEALTHY

The impact of diet on diabetes was made crystal clear in a recent study of Pima Indians in Arizona and Mexico.
As Native Americans, these people had a statistically higher risk of diabetes than most other ethnic groups.
Yet researchers discovered that the Mexican Pima Indians, who lived without so-called modern conveniences and ate a traditional, low-fat diet, had a much lower rate of the disease (6.5 percent) than the Arizona Pima Indians, who enjoyed modern conveniences, ate fatty, processed foods and had an alarming 38.2 percent diabetes rate.
In other words, says Bernstein, "Having the gene is not the whole story.
It's putting on those extra pounds that trigger it."
As a result, experts recommend a diet that contains no more than 25 percent of calories from fat, 10 to 15 percent from protein and the rest from carbohydrates--especially complex carbs (grains and vegetables) instead of simple carbs (fruit and sugary sweets).
And if you're not already vegan, it's a good idea to lean in that direction, cutting back on butter (use olive and other plant oils instead), eggs, cheese and other dairy products, since they contain animal fats and "bad" LDL cholesterol.
These guidelines become even more important and more specific if you or someone you care about actually develops the disease.
In most cases, you'll want to seek the aid of a nutritionist.
Such a person will likely set a carbohydrate goal and a meal plan to achieve it; teach you how to count carbohydrates (the newest way to help control blood sugar levels); recommend that you avoid highly concentrated sweets, like honey and sugar; advise you to keep a daily diary of the food you eat; and help you learn to read food labels.
But that doesn't mean meals will be boring or that you'll have no choices.
Many people believe that diabetics can't have dinner with their family or eat out at a restaurant, but that simply isn't true.
A healthful, home-cooked meal is good for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes.
And common sense can get a diabetic through most restaurant meals--simply avoid ordering the fatty or fried megameal capped off with pie a la mode.
People with diabetes can even have sweets.
For example, if you're allowed a snack with 30 grams of carbohydrates, you may have a choice of one piece of angel food cake, two-thirds of a cup of rice or one cup of applesauce.
They all have the same effect on your blood sugar, and it's your decision where you "spend" those 30 grams.
(For more ideas, see "Diabetic and Delicious," p. 52.)
You even have a choice when it comes to your overall nutrition plan.
After O'Quinn met with a dietician, she was put on a low-fat diet that was so strict and tasteless she couldn't stay on it.
As a budding nutritionist herself, she decided to construct her own diet plan that would control her diabetes without making her miserable.
Of course, going off on your own doesn't work for most people.
The point is, if you're diabetic or at high risk of developing the disease and need to get your eating habits in order, you should shop around for a nutritionist who's sympathetic to your lifestyle and can tailor a menu plan that meets your needs.
There's also a crop of new books with advice and recipes for diabetics on the market.
SHAKE YOUR BOOTY

Exercise is another key factor in preventing and treating diabetes.
When O'Quinn was diagnosed, she recalls being "in shock."
"Suddenly I realized that I would have to live with this disease for the rest of my life," she says.
"My doctor mentioned insulin shots, and I pleaded with her not to make me take them.
I promised I would get my blood sugar down.
I would diet, I would exercise, and I'd do it for the rest of my life."
O'Quinn kept her word.
Not only did she change her eating habits, she started taking long walks up and down the hilly campus of her school and ice skating before her early morning classes.
In turn, explains Tuck, this helped make her cells less resistant to insulin so she was able to use more of the sugar in her blood for fuel.
In fact, insulin resistance drops by almost 2 percent for every 200 calories burned through exercise (equivalent to about an hour of walking), according to a recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Richard Weill, M.A., a certified diabetes educator and exercise physiologist in New York City, starts most beginners--diabetic or not--on the same regimen: a combination of aerobics, weight-resistance exercises, yoga and stretching for 30 minutes, three times a week.
But if people are suffering from cardiovascular or other problems, are out of shape or don't want to work out for that long, he offers guidelines based on data gathered by Audrey Manley, M.D., Acting U.S. Surgeon General in 1996: Ten minutes of moderate activity three times a day on most, if not all, days.
To accomplish this, he suggests simple changes to your daily routine, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking at the far end of the lot and walking the rest of way.
"Once you get started, you can progress from there," says Weill.
It's important to work with professionals, especially when your health is impaired.
Get started by working with a physical therapist, trainer or certified yoga teacher.
HOW STRESS MAKES YOU SICK
In many cases, diet and exercise are all that's needed to control type II diabetes.
In fact, with these simple lifestyle changes alone O'Quinn was able to bring her blood sugar level down from 300 to below 160 (a normal reading is 70 to 110).
But as stress at school began to rise, so did her blood sugar.
Stress sets off an alarm in your body, regardless of whether or not you have diabetes, explains Joseph Loizzo, M.D., a psychiatrist and director of Columbia-Presbyterian's Meditation and Healing Center.
When disaster threatens, your body instinctively prepares to "fight or flee"--even if the threat is abstract, like midterm exams or the deadline for a research paper.
Nevertheless, biology takes over and adrenaline, steroids and other stress-related hormones beg
When the stress is chronic, the physiological effects can increase your risk for diabetes or cause serious trouble if you already have it.
To make things worse, many people turn to sweets in the face of stress.
When academic pressures left her frazzled, O'Quinn would polish off a box of doughnuts at a single sitting--not a good idea for anyone, let alone someone with diabetes.
Fortunately, there are healthy alternatives to O'Quinn's Krispy Kreme therapy.
* BIOFEEDBACK.
This technique teaches you to consciously change what is going on physiologically using biological signals (or feedback) from your own body.
When you're tense, for instance, blood flow to your extremities slows and your hands turn cold..
By placing temperature sensors on the tips of your fingers, you can actually monitor how relaxed you really are by looking at the temperature readings.
In the beginning, says O'Quinn, "I would think I was relaxed, but the machine would tell me otherwise.
It took a while, but by watching those readings, I eventually learned how to slow my body down and relax at will."
* CREATIVE VISUALIZATION.
Using this technique, you learn to imagine yourself relaxed and calm while engaged in a stressful activity.
"For example, if you fall apart when you have to drive on the highway, we train you to imagine yourself speeding along the freeway and enjoying it.
Eventually that translates into reality," says Margaret Baim, M.S., codirector of the Medical Symptom Reduction Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Center in Boston.
* MEDITATIVE TECHNIQUES.
"First you learn to pay attention to what's going on in your mind and body while you're going about your life.
Then you learn to stop the biological response that raises blood sugar levels," says Loizzo, who teaches self-healing methods from Indian and Tibetan traditions.
One way to accomplish this is by becoming mindful of your breath.
"You observe your breathing under conditions of stress and bring it back from a labored breath to a quieter, more restful one," he explains.
"This in turn helps lower your heart rate and blood pressure, and sends a message to your body: `Stop pumping out hormones; we're in a relaxed mode.'"
DIABETES AND DEPRESSION
Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of diabetes is its connection to depression.
"Diabetes is a chronic disease, and we know that people with chronic diseases tend to become more depressed than the rest of the population," says Alan Jacobson, M.D., a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass.
And when you're depressed, you're more likely to stop eating healthfully and forget about exercise, which causes your blood sugar levels to soar.
But that's not the whole story.
Researchers suspect there may also be a biological connection between diabetes and depression.
But is the diabetes causing the depression--or is the depression causing the diabetes? "We're not sure," says Tuck.
But what is clear is that "the patients I see who are having trouble controlling their blood sugar levels are generally suffering from depression as well.
When we get those sugar levels down, the depression lifts and the patient begins to feel better," she adds.
So if you're diabetic, it's important to realize that depression in diabetics can sometimes be eliminated simply by sticking to your diet or stepping up exercise.
Toward that end, Jacobson often treats patients with psychotherapy, medication or a combination of both.
"I try to help them see through the problems that are keeping them from complying with their diet-exercise-medication regimen," he says.
In some cases the solution may be as simple as setting more realistic goals.
For example, it's impossible for most people to achieve model-thinness, so why torture yourself trying.
Instead, aim for losing a few pounds.
"If you're 50 pounds overweight," notes Bernstein, "you can greatly improve your blood sugar level simply by dropping 10 pounds."
In addition, a support system can be one of the greatest aids in helping diabetics stay motivated.
The American Diabetes Association ([800] DIABETES) can provide addresses of support groups in most areas, and the Joslin Center in the Boston area ([800]
A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE
[Graphic omitted]It's been nearly 20 years since O'Quinn, now 44, was first diagnosed with diabetes, and today because of her effort she's in great health.
Her blood sugar level is down, she exercises regularly, and last year she gave birth to her first child.
She's in good company.
Millions of Americans with diabetes live happy, productive lives.
The secret: healthful eating habits, regular exercise and a sound approach to managing stress.
In otherwords, a healthful lifestyle that can benefit just about anyone--including you.

RELATED ARTICLE: Type I Diabetes: Is Your Child at Risk?
Unlike type II diabetes, type tends to begin during childhood, most often between the ages of 6 and 12 years, with a second peak age group being 17 to 20.
What causes it?
Type I diabetes occurs when the immune system malfunctions and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.
Experts believe the root cause is genetic, but it may be activated by an environmental factor, like a viral infection.
How common is it?
One in every 700 to 800 school-age children develops type I diabetes, making it one of the top chronic childhood diseases.
What are the symptoms?
Signs include excessive urination, constant thirst and weight loss.
There may also be abdominal pain that's mistaken for appendicitis.
If it's not diagnosed, the child may become seriously ill and even fall into a coma.
How is it treated?
Children with type I diabetes produce little or no insulin, so they must get it from shots.
A healthful diet is also key to successfully treating the disease, as are regular checkups to watch out for potential vision, nerve and cardiovascular problems.
Can kids get type II diabetes as well?
A decade ago, experts would have answered no.
But in recent years more and more children have been diagnosed with type II diabetes as a result of what doctors are calling "The McDonald's Syndrome"--an abundance of fatty foods combined with too little activity.
The good news: "If we can prevent childhood obesity," says Holly Schachner, M.D., a pediatric endocrinologist at Naomie Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City, "we think we can prevent type II diabetes in kids."

When you're diabetic, you get poked a lot.
Monitoring blood sugar levels means regularly pricking a finger with a lancet, putting a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting it into a machine that reads the blood sugar level.
And if you need insulin shots, you get pretty handy with a hypodermic needle.
Fortunately, researchers are working on "ouchless" methods to get the same jobs done.
With a little luck, the following products will be on the market in the next year or so.
[Graphic omitted]* A watchlike device that uses a tiny electrical current to extract blood through the skin is in the works at Cygnus Inc., in Redwood City, Calif.
"All you feel is a mild tingle that soon goes away," says Russell Potts, vice president of research.
* An implantable blood sugar monitor is being developed by Mini-Med Inc., of Sylmar, Calif.
It entails having your doctor implant a special sensor just below the skin of the abdomen.
A wire runs from the sensor to a small computer that provides readings and can be clipped to a belt loop or pocket.
* A new device collects data on blood sugar levels by shining a beam of near-infrared light through an earlobe, a fingertip or even the tongue.
Chemists Mark Arnold, Ph.D., at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, and Gary Small, Ph.D., at Ohio University in Athens, hope to have it approved for clinical trials soon.
* A quick and painless way to get in your "shot"--a tubelike inhaler that allows you to breathe in a dose of powdered insulin--is being developed by Pfizer Inc., New York City.
