Chapter 113.
PROCUREMENT DIVISION
Subchapter A. PURCHASING
1 TAC Â§113.11
The Texas Building and Procurement Commission adopts an amendment to Â§113.11, concerning Delegated Purchases.
Section 113.11 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the April 11, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 3005).
The text will not be republished.
The amended rule will change the requirement to reflect that of three (3) bids that must be taken, two (2) must come from HUB vendors.
The amendments to T.A.C. will increase involvement of a wider variety of HUB vendors in the state procurement process.
One comment was received.
Comment: Commentator took exception to the statement, "Women are the most utilized of all HUB vendors" and suggests postponement of adoption of this amendment for two years until evaluation of the newly created "high risk" classifications can determine some historical utilization figures.
Response: The TBPC finding is based on information gathered from several sources and is thought to be an accurate reflection of participation rate of the various HUB groups.
It is thought that changing the rule as proposed will not adversely affect any HUB group, but will allow state agencies the flexibility to better meet the goals and requirements of the HUB program.
The amendment to Â§113.11 is adopted under the authority of the Texas Government code, Title 10, Subtitle D, Chapter 2155, Â§2155,132, which provides the Texas building and Procurement commission with the authority to promulgate rules necessary to implement the sections related to delegated purchases.
The following code is affected by these rules: Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D, Chapter 2155.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.
