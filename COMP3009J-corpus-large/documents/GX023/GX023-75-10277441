Topic #1 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: OP-SF Net Editor 
As well as information about future events, we aim to publish accounts of all recent meetings devoted to orthogonal polynomials and related areas.
But we nee d volunteers to write such reports.
This is a call for people to write about the forthcoming "Special Functions 2000" meeting in Tempe, Arizona and the SIAM Annual meeting in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, in July.
Please contact me if you would like to write something about these or other meetings.
I am looking for a replacement editor starting in January 2001.
If someone interested, please let me know.
It would be best to have a transition period when the old and new editors could work together.
It is possible also to share the job between two people.

Topic #3 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: Tom Koornwinder 
Preliminary announcement International Conference on "NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS" dedicated to CLAUDE BREZINSKI on the occasion of his 60th birthday Marrakesh, Morocco October 1-5, 2001
We intend to organize an international conference in October 2001 to celebrate the 60th birthday of Claude Brezinski and, at the same time, the 10th anniversary of the journal Numerical Algorithms that he founded in 1991 and where contributed papers will be published.
The themes of the conference will cover all aspects of Numerical Analysis, in particular those which are related to numerical algorithms.
The goal of this conference is to bring together experts from these areas.
The numerical analysis community is warmly invited to attend so that we have a valuable scientific meeting and celebrate Claude's 60th birthday at the banquet.
Participants will be accommodated in a 4-star hotel, comparable to the best European or American hotels, at a special reduced price.
In Marrakesh, the weather is very nice in October and the town can be easily reached by plane from Casablanca (one hour).
Casablanca has direct connections to major European cities and to New York and Montreal.
A web site containing all the informations about this conference can be found at
http://www-lma.univ-littoral.fr/~na2001

Topic #5 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: William M. Robertson 
I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to several recent papers and two older papers on Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis and its application to gravity and magnetism, which appeared in journals which OP-SF colleagues may not be usually reading.
Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis involves functions which are orthogonal over a spherical cap (a circular region on the sphere), namely the Associated Legendre Functions of NON-integer degree but integer order, multiplied by the usual cosine and sine multiple-angle functions.
These papers are (in reverse chronological order):

Topic #6 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: Nikolai Nikolaev 
Could somebody please tell me where can I read more about the Fourier expansion with NON-multiple frequencies, like:
f(t) = Sum[ A*sin(wt)+B*cos(wt) ] where: w = 2*pi/T+k
which is different from the case with multiple frequencies w = ( 2*pi*k) / T use d to describe periodic signals.
Thank you very much for the attention!

Topic #7 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: Daniel Lozier 
The Officers of our Activity Group have submitted the following statement to Jim Crowley and Gil Strang (SIAM executive director and president, respectively).
The executive Director intends to share this information with the new Editor-in-Chief of SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis.
STATEMENT BY THE OFFICERS OF SIAM SIAG-OPSF ON THE SCOPE OF SIMA
D. Lozier, Chair W. Van Assche, Vice-Chair C. Dunkl, Secretary F. Marcellan, Program Director
The SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis (SIMA) was traditionally one of the better journals for publishing papers dealing with special functions.
Until volume 19 (number 6, 1988), the scope of the journal was:
"Contains research articles on those parts of mathematical analysis that grow from and are applicable to engineering, the natural sciences, and numerical analysis.
Topics include partial differential equations, functional analysis, bifurcation theory, dynamical systems, differential geometry, asymptotic analysis, harmonic analysis, integral transforms, and special functions."
In this list, the topics "asymptotic analysis, harmonic analysis, integral transforms, and special functions" indeed deal with aspects which are of interest to the SIAM Activity Group on Orthogonal Polynomials and Special Functions, which was founded in 1990.
It can be said that special functions are to mathematics the way mathematics is to the natural sciences; they are key tools.
Consider important appearances in recent research areas: completely integrable quantum models, algebraic combinatorics, number theory, asymptotics, group representations, Fourier transforms, tomography, quantum groups, DeBranges proof of the Bieberbach conjecture, etc.
In fact, the importance of special functions is demonstrated conclusively in the past 25 years of data from the Science Citation Index for Abramowitz 
Not only has the absolute number of citations of Abramowitz and Stegun been increasing steadily, its rate of growth exceeds the growth rate for the Index as a whole.
Unfortunately, starting from volume 20 (number 1, 1989), the scope of SIMA was changed and the topics mentioned earlier disappeared from the scope.
Now the papers in the journal fall into two broad categories, the first being those that analyze interesting problems associated with realistic models for natural phenomena.
The second category includes those papers which contribute in a substantial way to the general, analytical information and techniques which are likely to bear upon such models.
Thus the journal no longer reflects as strongly as before the interest of our SIAG.
Furthermore, no one on the present editorial board represents the research topics of interest to our SIAG.
This was certainly different in the past, when F.W.J. Olver, R. Askey, G. Andrews and others were on the editorial board.
Volume 25 (number 2, 1994) was an important special issue dedicated to Askey and Olver that contained several important papers which proved to be relevant to our SIAG.
It is a pity that since then only few papers dealing with special functions were published in SIMA.
Our activity group strongly urges that the scope of the SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis again include such topics as special functions and rigorous asymptotics, and put more emphasis on mathematical analysis than on applied mathematics.
After all, SIAM also publishes the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics for which the scope has a large intersection with the present scope of SIMA.
The editorial board should have some members capable of judging papers on orthogonal polynomials and special functions.
The SIAG is willing to advise in this matter.
Topic #8 ------------ OP-SF NET 7.3 ------------- May 15, 2000 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: OP-SF NET Editor 
The following preprints related to the field of orthogonal polynomials and special functions were recently posted or cross-listed to one of the subcategories of the xxx archives.

math.CA/0004053 Title: The Askey-Wilson function transform Author: Erik Koelink, Jasper V. Stokman Categories: CA Classical Analysis (QA Quantum Algebra; RT Representation Theory)
Math Subject Class: 33D45, 44A20, 33D80, 44A60 Comments: LaTeX2e file.
19 pages Abstract: In this paper we present an explicit (rank one) function transform which contains several Jacobi-type function transforms and Hankel-type transforms as degenerate cases.
The kernel of the transform, which is given explicitly in terms of basic hypergeometric series, thus generalizes the Jacobi function as well as the Bessel function.
The kernel is named the Askey-Wilson function, since it provides an analytical continuation of the Askey-Wilson polynomial in its degree.
In this paper we establish the $L^2$-theory of the Askey-Wilson function transform, and we explicitly determine its inversion formula.

It generalizes a formula which was stated by Dingle, first prove d by Paris, and recently reconsidered by Olver.

math.CO/0005008 Title: On the Asymptotics of Takeuchi Numbers Author: Thomas Prellberg Categories: CO Combinatorics (CA Classical Analysis) Math Subject Class: 05A16 Comments: latex file with 13 pages, 2 postscript figures included Abstract: I present an asymptotic formula for the Takeuchi numbers $T_n$.
In particular, I give compelling numerical evidence and present a heuristic argument showing that $$T_n\sim C_T B_n\exp{1\over2}{W(n)}^2$$as $n$ tends t o infinity, where $B_n$ are the Bell numbers, W(n) is Lambert's $W$ function, and $C_T=2.239...$ is a constant.
Moreover, I show that the method presented here can be generalized to derive conjectures for related problems.

hep-th/0004153 Title: Central Binomial Sums, Multiple Clausen Values and Zeta Values Authors: J. M. Borwein, D. J. Broadhurst, J. Kamnitzer Categories: (CA Classical Analysis) Report number: OUT--4102--88, CECM 99:137 Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX, with use of amsmath and amssymb packages, to appear i n Journal of Experimental Mathematics Abstract: We find and prove relationships between Riemann zeta values and central binomial sums.
We also investigate alternating binomial sums (also called ApÃ©ry sums).
The study of non-alternating sums leads to an investigation of different types of sums which we call multiple Clausen values.
The study of alternating sums leads to a tower of experimental results involving polylogarithms in the golden ratio.
In the non-alternating case, there is a strong connection to polylogarithms of the sixth root of unity, encountered in the 3-loop Feynman diagrams of {\tt hep-th/9803091} an d subsequently in hep-ph/9910223, hep-ph/9910224, cond-mat/9911452 and hep-th/0004010.

math.CA/0003148 Title: Second-order linear differential equations with two irregular singular points of rank three: the characteristic exponent Author: Wolfgang Buehring Categories: CA Classical Analysis Math Subject Class: 34A20; 34A25; 34A30 Comments: 33 pages Abstract: For a second-order linear differential equation with two irregular singular points of rank three, multiple Laplace-type contour integral solutions are considered.
An explicit formula in terms of the Stokes multipliers is derived for the characteristic exponent of the multiplicative solutions.
The Stokes multipliers are represented by converging series with terms for which limit formulas as well as more detailed asymptotic expansion s are available.
Here certain new, recursively known coefficients enter, which are closely related to but different from the coefficients of the formal solutions at one of the irregular singular points of the differential equation.
The coefficients of the formal solutions then appear as finite sums over subsets of the new coefficients.
As a by-product, the leading exponential terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the late coefficients of th e formal solutions are given, and this is a concrete example of the structural results obtained by Immink in a more general setting.
The formulas displayed in this paper are not of merely theoretical interest, but they also are complete in the sense that they could be (and have been) implemented for computing accurate numerical values of the characteristic exponent, although the computational load is not small and increases with the rank of the singular point under consideration.

math.CV/0003175 Title: On zeros of polynomials orthogonal over a convex domain Authors: V. V. Andrievskii, I. E. Pritsker, R. S. Varga Categories: CV Complex Variables (CA Classical Analysis) Math Subject Class: 30C10, 30C15, 30C85, 41A10 Comments: 24 pages; to appear in Constr.
Approx Abstract: We establish a discrepancy theorem for signed measures, with a given positive part, which are supported on an arbitrary convex curve.
As a main application, we obtain a result concerning the distribution of zeros of polynomials orthogonal on a convex domain.

math-ph/0003005 Title: Discrete phase integral method for five-term recursion relations Author: Anupam Garg Categories: MP Mathematical Physics (CA Classical Analysis) Comments: Revtex; 7 ps figures Abstract: A formalism is developed to study certain five-term recursion relations by discrete phase integral (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) methods.
Such recursion relations arise naturally in the study of the Schrodinger equation for certain spin Hamiltonians.
The conditions for the validity of the phase integral approximation are derived.
It is shown that in contrast t o the three-term problem, it is now possible to get a turning points "under th e barrier", i.e., in the classically forbidden region, as well as inside the classically allowed region.
Further, no qualitatively new types of turning points arise in recursion relations with still higher numbers of terms.
The phase integral approximation breaks down at the new turning points, requirin g new connection formulas, which are derived.

math.CO/9907183 Title: On Multi-color partitions and the generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities
Authors: Naihuan Jing, Kailash Misra, Carla Savage Categories: CO Combinatorics (QA Quantum Algebra) Comments: Latex2e, corrected version Abstract: Basil Gordon, in the sixties, and George Andrews, in the seventies , generalized the Rogers-Ramanujan identities to higher moduli.
These identities arise in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.
One of these areas is representation theory of the infinite dimensional Lie algebra, where various known interpretations of these identities have led to interesting applications.
Motivated by their connections with Lie algebra representation theory, we give a new interpretation of the product side of generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities in terms of multi-color partitions.

Enlarged version, with new remarks, misprints corrected, and an Appendix added Abstract: We obtain the specialization of monomial symmetric functions on th e alphabet (a-b)/(1-q).
This gives a remarkable algebraic identity, and four new developments for the Macdonald polynomial associated with a row.
The proofs are given in the framework of $\lambda$-ring theory.

math.CO/0004012 Title: Schur's old determinant proves a brand-new theorem of Garrett-Ismail-Stanton Author: Helmut Prodinger Categories: CO Combinatorics Math Subject Class: 05A30 Abstract: Garrett, Ismail, and Stanton gave a general formula that contains the Rogers-Ramanujan identities as special cases.
We show how easy this is when using a determinant that Schur introduced in 1917.

math-ph/0004028 Title: On the use of Mellin transform to a class of q-difference-differential equations Author: Choon-Lin Ho (Tamkang University, Taiwan) Categories: MP Mathematical Physics (QA Quantum Algebra) Journal reference: Phys.
Lett. 268A (2000) 217 Comments: 13 pages, LaTex, no figures Abstract: We explore the possibility of using the method of classical integral transforms to solve a class of $q$-difference-differential equations.
The Laplace and the Mellin transform of $q$-derivatives are derived.
The results show that the Mellin transform of the $q$-derivative resembles most closely the corresponding expression in classical analysis, and it could therefore be useful in solving certain $q$-difference equations .
