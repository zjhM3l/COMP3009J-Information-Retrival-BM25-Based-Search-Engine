Title: An Integrated Pest Management Facilitator for the North Central Region
Project Director: Susan T. Ratcliffe, Ph.D. Department of Crop Sciences University of Illinois AW-101 Turner Hall 1102 S. Goodwin Avenue Urbana, IL 61801 Telephone: (217) 333-9656 Fax: (217) 333-5245 Email: sratclif@uiuc.edu
Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/05 Award: $50,000 Project Summary: The North Central Region NCR-201 is the regional committee that guides and coordinates Integrated Pest Management research and extension activities among the twelve land-grant universities in the North Central region.
This is a complex task that includes communications with the many faculty and staff within the region and with federal partners, reporting on accomplishments and impacts, and the development and maintenance of a database that includes stakeholder needs, IPM experts, calls for project proposals, and reports on federally funded projects.
The committee has chosen to assign many of the tasks to an IPM Facilitator.
This facilitation of organizational and public relations activities, and the reporting of progress and impact is critical for the region to facilitate the IPM research and extension activities, and to maintain communication between the region and our federal partners.
This position has proven to be very valuable to the Northeast region in the two years that it has been in place, and the NC IPM Coordinators have decided to allocate some of their regional research funds to support this important position.

Title: Improving Western Corn Rootworm Management in Rotated Corn Project Director: Joseph L. Spencer, Ph.D.
University of Illinois 607 E. Peabody Champaign, IL 61820 Telephone: (217) 244-6851 Fax: (217) 265-5110 Email: spencer1@uiuc.edu
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $79,460
Project Summary: The goal of this research is to assess the potential for wheat, or wheat double-cropped with soybean to reduce western corn rootworm injury to corn rotated with these crops by comparing movement and physiological characteristics of insects that enter crops rotated with corn.
The eastern Corn Belt faces an expanding threat from a western corn rootworm population that circumvents crop rotation by leaving cornfields to lay eggs in the crops rotated with corn.
The loss of crop rotation has forced growers to return to soil insecticides to protect corn roots.
Circumvention of crop rotation is a problem of insect behavior; by focusing on the movement and characteristics of insects entering rotated crops like soybean and wheat, we seek to evaluate wheat as an alternative rotated crop, learn how rotated crops influence beetle activity, and improve pest management by exploiting crop and insect characteristics that reduce egg-laying outside of corn.
To achieve our goal, we have three objectives: 1) Measure WCR movement between corn and rotated crops using a novel insect marking technique, 2) Measure the characteristics of adult WCR moving between corn and roated crops, and 3) Relate WCR abundance in rotated fields to numbers of eggs deposited in the soil of each field and root injury ratings in corn the following year.

Title: Seed Bank Dynamics in Alternative Vegetable Cropping Systems
Project Director: Stephen C. Weller, Ph.D. Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture Purdue University 1165 Horticulture West Lafayette, IN 47907-1165 Telephone: (765) 494-1333 Fax: (765) 494-0391 Email: weller@hort.purdue.edu
Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/06 Award: $100,000
Project Summary: Annual weeds are the most costly and difficult pest problems for vegetable growers to manage in the North Central region.
Current weed management systems rely on the extensive use of tillage and annual herbicide applications that contribute to soil erosion and pollute the environment.
The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the effect of threshold and no-seed management practices on how many weed seeds are returned to the soil each fall; 2) examine the effect of soil management systems on seed predation and weed seed survival in the soil; and 3) develop weed management systems for tomatoes that effectively reduce weed occurrence and the seed soil seed bank population.
A tomato-soybean crop rotation representative of North Central U.S. vegetable production will be used as a model system in these studies.
Three soil management systems (conventional tillage, stale seedbed, and rye cover crop mulch) and two weed management intensities (economic threshold and no weed seed production) will be used.
Seed banks, weed populations, and crop productivity will be determined each year in Indiana and Illinois.
Two locations will allow us to extrapolate our findings over more environments and to a wider audience of farmers.
The rationale is that information from this study will be used to design more efficient and sustainable weed management systems for vegetable production in the North Central U.S., reduce the chemical inputs and result in an improved economic return to growers.
In addition, improved weed management systems will lower the negative environmental effects of vegetable production and result in a better product for the consumer.

Title: Implementing Practical and Cost-Effective Approaches to Site-Specific Weed Management Project Director: Johanna A. Dille, Ph.D. Department of Agronomy Kansas State University 3701 Throckmorton Plant Science Center Manhattan, KS 66506-5501 Telephone: (785) 532-7240 Fax: (785) 532-6094 Email: dieleman@ksu.edu
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $105,373 Project Summary: Most agronomists, growers, and researchers recognize that spatial variability exists in their fields.
This variability has been measured and site-specific weed management applications have been simulated, but few have been tested in the field.
We wish to take our understanding of spatial variability and develop a practical, cost-effective approach to implementing a site-specific and integrated weed management (ISSWM) plan.
The overall goal of this project is to develop a generic algorithm that a grower or crop advisor can use to develop an ISSWM plan for their farm site.
A series of on-farm and on-station sites will be our base for developing the generic algorithm that will outline what basic field data are required and how it will be mathematically or logically manipulated to generate a series of weed control application maps.
The objectives are to 1) describe variability in site property and weed population data across a number of field sites, 2) evaluate herbicide availability and activity, weed control efficacy, crop yield, and expected net returns as a result of imposing a) different preemergence herbicide rates (0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1X) applied as strips, and b) a range of postemergence weed control options (broadcast, weed patch map- or sensor-based) super-imposed on the preemergence herbicide strips, 3) generate a generic algorithm, and 4) incorporate this information into a weed management decision support tool.
Research outcomes include procedures to generate the algorithm and extension outcomes include demonstration sites throughout Kansas and the algorithm for educational purposes in order to generate ISSWM strategies.

Title: Predicting the Durability of Host Resistance and Hessian Fly Virulence
Project Director: Gerald E. Wilde, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Kansas State University 123 W. Waters Hall Manhattan, KS 66506 Telephone: (785) 532-4729 Fax: (785) 532-6232 Email: gwilde@oznet.ksu.edu
Project Start Date: 06/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/14/05 Award: $99,541 Project Summary: Hessian fly causes 5-10% annual yield loss of wheat.
Host resistance is the only effective way to control this pest.
However, the longevity of a host resistance strategy is jeopardized because the Hessian fly constantly produces new biotypes.
Those new biotypes can overcome the resistance of specific resistance genes after their deployment.
To safeguard future success, it is imperative that a method be established for breeders to identify new, durable resistance genes, and a method to determine when a previously used resistance gene can be re-released back to the field.
The objective of this research is to establish these two methods by measuring the cost (so called fitness penalty) for new Hessian fly biotypes to gain the ability to live on the otherwise resistance cultivars.
Fitness penalty will be measured using a set of parameters including weight loss, death rate, developmental rate, and reproductive rate.
Successful completion of the proposed research should provide tools for breeders to identify new, durable resistance genes and for extension entomologists and farmers to design rotation strategies.

Title: Pesticide Reduction in the Face of Japanese Beetle Invasion: Testing a Local IPM Strategy in the Context of Regional Invasion
Project Director: Rufus Isaacs, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Michigan State University East Lansing, MI 48824 Telephone: (517) 355-6619 Fax: (517) 353-5598 Email: isaacsr@msu.edu
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $60,520 Project Summary: The goals of this research project is to develop and implement effective strategies to maintain IPM programs in the face of invasion by Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica.
The geographic range of this pest is currently expanding within the northcentral region, causing IPM practices to be abandoned and greater insecticide application rates.
While this response is understandable to maintain crop value in the short term, it is not sustainable, and alternative management programs for the new pest are required to regain the achievements of the original IPM programs.
Growers of affected crops, most notably blueberry, grape, and raspberry, apply insecticides to control adult beetles, particularly near harvest to meet exacting quality standards.
However, constraints from FQPA enactment, and the need to improve food and farm safety demand that reduced-insecticide strategies are developed and implemented.
Recent research on multiple approaches to Japanese beetle control in perennial crops provides a strategy that will be integrated into the original IPM programs, to regain progress toward minimizing the use of insecticides.
In this project, our objectives will be to 1) measure rates of dispersal of Japanese beetle under field conditions to determine the implications of beetle immigration and emigration for its management, 2) Test the effectiveness of Local IPM programs for reducing populations of Japanese beetle and other key pests, 3) Predict future range expansion of Japanese beetle at local and regional scales.
Overall, we aim to provide early warning of future infestations, and strategies for at-risk crops to respond to current infestations.

Title: Reducing Risk to Accelerate Adoption of Sweet Corn IPM
Project Director: Terrance M. Hurley, Ph.D. Department of Applied Economics University of Minnesota Room 249C Classroom-Office Building 1994 Buford Avenue St. Paul, MN 55108-6040 Telephone: (612) 625-0216 Fax: (612) 625-6245 Email: thurley@apec.umn.edu
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $67,312 Project Summary: Before growers are willing to adopt Integrated Pest Management (IPM) it is necessary to demonstrate the benefits of IPM in terms of profitability and risk.
However, even with positive results from field experiments, adoption remains low.
One explanation for low adoption is the perceived risk of IPM failure.
One way to mitigate this risk is by offering insurance that protects against IPM failure.
Another explanation is that contractual arrangements between growers and processors discourage IPM adoption because growers are responsible for some aspects of pest management, while the processors are responsible for others.
If this is the case, redesigning these contracts can improve IPM adoption.
The purpose of this project is to (i) evaluate the profitability and risk of using IPM to control corn earworm (Heliothis zea) and European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) for processed and fresh market sweet corn in the North Central Region of the U.S.; (ii) explore the potential for using best management practice (BMP) insurance to encourage IPM adoption for fresh market sweet corn by developing an insurance product that protects growers from IPM failure; and (iii) determine how the contractual arrangements between sweet corn growers and processors can be improved to promote rather than hinder IPM adoption.
Improving IPM adoption through IPM insurance and better production contract incentives will benefit the public and environment by reducing insecticide use.
It will also benefit sweet corn producers by increasing profitability and reducing production risk.

Ohio Title: Using Phenology Forecasting to Reduce Weed Management Inputs
Project Director: John Cardina, Ph.D. Department of Horticulture and Crop Science The Ohio State University, OARDC 1680 Madison Avenue Wooster, OH 44691 Telephone: (330) 263-3644 Fax: (330) 263-3887 Email: cardina.2@osu.edu
Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/06 Award: $104,980 Project Summary: Pesticide use could be reduced if farmers knew the exact time that pests are most susceptible to control measures.
Our goal is to help farmers reduce herbicide use by providing web-based information telling when to scout for weeds, and when to apply specific controls.
We will test our system under two worst case senarios; purslane in onions, and common grounsel in strawberries.
We will use products labeled for organic farming to control these weeds, which are among the most troublesome species throughout the mid-west.
In previous work, we developed an accurate method to predict when the weeds are just starting to come out of the ground, when half of them have appeared, and when almost all of them have emerged.
The next step is to use this system to determine the precise time when weeds are most vulnerable and controls can be most effective.
Results of this research will allow fruit and vegetable farmers to reduce rates of pesticides, make fewer applications, and use more non-chemical management practices that only work when applied at the right time.
The result will be lower production costs, safer food, and a cleaner environment.

Title: Lamium purpureum and Heterodera glycines: Interactions and Implications for IPM
Project Director: S. Kent Harrison, Ph.D. Department of Horticulture 
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $92,452 Project Summary: Lamium purpureum (purple deadnettle, PDN) is the most prevalent winter annual weed in Ohio no-tillage crop fields and a strong alternate host of Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode, SCN).
The goal of the research is to determine the impact of PDN on SCN population dynamics and develop integrated pest management methods that 1) prevent SCN reproduction on PDN, and 2) simultaneously enhance decline of SCN and PDN populations in infested soils.
An initial study funded by NCR-IPM in 2001 showed that after one year, SCN reproduction (Pf/Pi) in PDN-infested field plots was 49 to 83% greater than in weed-free soybean plots.
Renewal of the 2001 proposal will extend the duration of the present study and its objectives to determine the effects of PDN population density and removal time on SCN population dynamics over time, and the interaction of PDN emergence time and soil temperature on SCN reporduction.
An additional objective in the current proposal is to determine the suppressive effect of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), a winter annual cover crop, on PDN establishment and SCN reproduction.
Information gained from this study will refine and increase the effectiveness of current IPM programs for SCN and its winter annual weed hosts.
This study is also designed to provide basic scientific information and explore novel IPM methods for simultaneously reducing SCN and PDN populations.

Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/05 Award: $62,279 Project Summary: In recent years, North Central soybean producers have faced increased threats to crop yield and quality associated with viruses vectored by two emerging insect pests, the bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata) and the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura).
Virus infections in soybean are associated with economic loss due to reduced yield, seed coat mottling and "green stem syndrome".
Our long-term goal is to develop economically viable, environmentally sustainable, integrated pest management strategies to control these soybean virus diseases.

Title: Integrating Behavioral Control with Reduced Area Treatment Approach for Managing Colorado Potato Beetle and Other Insect Pests of Potato Project Director: Andrei Alyokhin, Ph.D. Department of Biological Sciences University of Maine 5722 Deering Hall Orono, ME 04469 Telephone: (207) 581-2977 Fax: (207) 581-2969 Email: andrei.alyokhin@umit.maine.edu
Project Start Date: 06/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 05/31/06 Award: $140,000 Project Summary: Insect pest management remains an important challenge in commercial potato production, with Colorado potato beetle being the most important defoliator in the Northeast.
Currently, growers rely on insecticides for protecting their crops, but both economic and environmental considerations favor reduction of chemical use.
Replacing uniform insecticide applications with the treatment of selected areas of the field is one possible way to decrease the amount of insecticides required for successful pest control.
This will also delay development of insecticide resistance by creating refugia for susceptible individuals.
Kairomones based on the volatiles produced by potato plants can be used for attracting beetles to insecticide-treated areas within a potato field, thus enhancing the efficiency of the reduced area treatment approach.
We propose to develop economically feasible "attracticide" blends combining Colorado potato beetle plant attractants with low-risk insecticides, determine possible effects of these attracticides on non-target arthropods, such as potato pests other than the Colorado potato beetle and beneficial natural enemies, and evaluate efficiency and economic feasibility of reduced area treatment approach combined with attracticide blends.

Title: Threshold-based Cover Cropping Strategies for Weed Management Project Director: Eric R. Gallandt, Ph.D.

Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/06 Award: $174,989 Project Summary: To manage weeds with reduced reliance on, or without herbicides, cropping systems require intervals during which rapid and significant reductions in the germinable portion of the weed seed bank occur or, if already small, seed banks should be managed to maintain a low equilibrium population density.
Integrating tillage system and cover cropping practices, this project aims to develop management strategies that will lower the equilibrium density of the weed seed bank.
This systems approach promises an effective means for managing weed seed banks while maintaining or improving soil health.
Field experiments and case studies of innovative growers in Maine and Pennsylvania will address the following three objectives: 1) Evaluate the impact of increasing cover cropping system intensity on weed seed bank dynamics; 2) Determine the effect of varying germinable seed bank densities on the efficacy of weed control and yield loss in a subsequent test crop; and 3) Assemble innovative cover cropping systems concepts or techniques into case studies and conduct on-farm research that demonstrates key pest and soil management benefits.
Several lines of evidence indicate that cover cropping and green manuring strategies may play an important role in managing weed seed banks while maintaining or improving soil health.
Following incorporation, green manure crops release their chemical constituents into the soil, often killing seedlings of small-seeded species, an effect evident by subsequent reductions in weed establishment.
Likewise, as a surface mulch, cover crop residues may also aid in the management weeds while reducing soil and water loss.

Title: Refinement and Delivery of Bio-Based Approaches to Reducing Insecticide Against Two Key Apple Pests Project Director: Ronald J. Prokopy, Ph.D. Department of Entomology University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA 01003 Telephone: (413) 545-1057 Fax: (413) 545-2115 Email: prokopy@ent.umass.edu
Project Start Date: 06/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/14/06 Award: $150,000 Project Summary: Plum curculio and apple maggot are key pests of apples in the Northeast.
Bio-based approaches to management may reduce insecticide sprays against these pests.
The objectives encompass efforts in both research (year 1) and extension (years 2 and 3).
For year 1, the objectives aim at refining and finalizing a simple and effective approach to monitoring plum curculio (an odor-baited trap tree approach) and a simple and effective approach to direct behavioral control of apple maggot (deployment of odor-baited spheres).
For years 2 and 3, the aim is to validate and demonstrate in 16 commercial orchards in 7 states (CT, MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VT) the economic and environmental value of a trap tree approach to monitoring plum curculio and a sphere-deployment approach to controlling apple maggot.
For both pests, the aim is to deliver information to all apple growers in the 7 cooperating states on advantages of these new approaches compared with existing approaches to management.

Title: Efficacy of Queen Replacement for Varroa IPM Project Director: Nancy M. Ostiguy, Ph.D. Department of Entomology The Pennsylvania State University 501 Ag Sciences 
Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/05 Award: $142,255 Project Summary: The number of managed and feral honey bee colonies has declined due to the varroa mite, an external parasite of the bee.
Growers and others who rely on bees for pollination or honey have noticed this loss.
The current method for varroa control is the application of pesticides to which mites are resistance.
Lethal and sublethal bee effects may result from these pesticides and they have been detected in honey and beeswax.
Integrated pest management provides an opportunity to control varroa without contaminating hive products or harming the honey bee plus resistance development can be slowed.
The grower and beekeeper will both benefit from healthier bee colonies and the public will benefit from reduced environmental and human health risks provided by alternatives to pesticides.
This project has two objectives: 1) test the efficacy of delaying queen release or caging queens to reduce varroa levels in honey bee colonies and 2) test the efficacy of delaying queen release or queen caging with screen bottom boards to reduce varroa levels in honey bee colonies.
Delaying the release of or caging of a queen temporarily stops bee brood production; this has the potential to reduce the number of mites as brood is necessary for mite reproduction.
Screen bottom boards can decrease the number of mites in a colony because mites are prevented from reattaching on a bee if a screen separates them from the bees.
Both these tactics should lower mite levels in a colony such that pesticide application is unnecessary.

Southern Region Alabama Title: Management of Cucumber Mosaic Virus and Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus in Pepper and Tomato Using Biological Preparations and Reflective Mulch Project Director: John F. Murphy, Ph.D. Department of Entomology 
Project Start Date: 08/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 08/14/05 Award: $68,156 Project Summary: Throughout the United States, and in the southeastern U.S. in particular, the number of small vegetable farmers is decreasing annually.
Contributing factors to this decrease include epidemics of Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).
We have worked for years on aspects of using plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) for enhancing yield and reducing disease damage on pepper and tomato.
Despite the effort and support directed at PGPR-mediated protection against virus diseases, little is known about its efficacy in the field using natural virus-vector spread into the crop.
All data, with the exception of a single study involved artificial inoculation of plants with virus.
Since PGPR strains used in our studies are now available as commercial products, the need for critical evaluation is even greater.
PGPR-mediated protection has great potential in an integrated pest management system, especially when considering its potential for inducing resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens.
Knowing if this potential includes viruses is a critical need.
The objectives of this project are: 1) To critically evaluate the level of protection against CMV and TSWV afforded pepper and tomato plants treated with each of two biopreparations relative to a control treatment; 2) To evaluate reflective and nonreflective plastic mulches in conjunction with the biopreparation treatments for their level of protection afforded pepper and tomato plants against infection by CMV and TSWV. 3) To determine the stage of growth and development of pepper plants at which point infection by CMV results in minimal losses in yield.
Assuming success, use of biopreparations and reflective mulch to significantly reduce losses by plant viruses will be easily implemented by growers and widely applicable to other transplanted crops throughout the United States.
Success with the biopreparations will allow us to address our ultimate goal of integration of biopreparations with cultivation practices that will allow replacement of plastic tarp with live mulch systems in preparation for Federally mandated elimination of fumigants.

Title: Multi-State Training for County Agents Utilizing Handheld Computers and Geospatial Technology for Pest Management Decisions Project Director: Hendrik W. van Riessen, Ph.D. Department of Agronomy 
Project Start Date: 07/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/04 Award: $44,907 Project Summary: Geospatial technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Georeferenced Information System (GIS), and remote sensing provide new opportunities for agricultural producers to more efficiently utilize nutrients and pesticides; for example lightbars, which use GPS, allow producers to apply pesticides more accurately by eliminating application overlap and skips.
Although farmers are beginning to adopt this technology, most county agents have received little or no training in the use of these technologies.
In addition the handheld computer is rapidly becoming the 'brain' center for all these new technologies.
These reasonably priced handheld computers also make it possible for agents to effectively carry a library of reference material with them to the field.
Accessories for the handheld computer such as GPS units, make it possible for the agent to pinpoint and map weed and pest infestations.
They can also accurately calculate field acreage and collect georeferenced soil samples.
We propose to provide a multi-state training program for county agents in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.
Agents will receive instruction on the applications of geospatial technologies and handheld computers to pest management.
A select group of the agents will receive a handheld computer equipped with a GPS antenna and appropriate software.
These agents will initiate appropriate projects in their counties.

Arkansas Title: Incorporating Beneficial Insects in Treatment Decisions for Cotton Aphid Project Director: Timothy J. Kring, Ph.D. Department of Entomology University of Arkansas AGRI 321 Fayetteville, AR 72701 Telephone: (479) 575-3186 Fax: (479) 575-3348 Email: tkring@uark.edu
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $51,699 Project Summary: The cotton aphid is a common pest of cotton across the mid-south, and is typically the target of 2 early-season applications of insecticides.
Research funded by a previous USDA grant focused on the development of an experimental threshold to increase reliance on beneficial insects in pest management.
These natural enemies were used in the decision-making process for applying insecticides to control the cotton aphid during the early season.
This research was conducted in cotton on experiment station property and resulted in the development of a threshold we feel is ready for evaluation and refinement in commercial cotton fields.
This work demonstrated that by using estimates of lady beetle density (adults and larvae), insecticide applications could be delayed or eliminated without yield consequences.
In 1999 and 2000, insecticide applications were reduced in half (from 2 to 1) and eliminated entirely in 2001.
This project will take the next step and implement this experimental threshold on commercial cotton farms.
This cooperative effort by research and extension entomologists, with direct involvement of cotton growers and their consultants, will minimally increase sampling time but will reduce insecticide inputs without yield loss or crop delay.
Reduction of these inputs provides direct economic benefits to the cotton producer ($8-14/acre) as well as to the environment by further reduction of insecticides.

Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $39,191 Project Summary: Flies are major pests around poultry facilities because they migrate into the community and become nuisances to neighbors, as well as impacting human and animal health.
Source reduction, by altering the habitat from which flies develop, is the preferred means of suppressing these insects.
This study looks at active, intensive composting to rapidly modify poultry waste so that it becomes unsuitable for larval development.
By incorporating additional carbon sources and regularly aerating the compost to enhance biodegradation, this thermophilic biological process produces valuable soil nutrients while reducing habitat availability.
The objectives are to determine if in-house composting is feasible, if it does, indeed, reduce fly production, and to define parameters for effective management to optimize nutrient recycling and pest management.
Producers will obtain a value-added product to enhance soil fertility while reducing cleanout frequency, thus minimizing labor and economic inputs.
This will result in financial gains for poultry producers, along with reduced animal and worker health risks.
Simultaneously, surrounding communities will experience reductions in fly pressure and associated annoyance.

Title: Development and Evaluation of Integrated Disease Management Tactics for Armillaria Root Rot of Peach Project Director: Harald Scherm, Ph.D. Department of Plant Pathology University of Georgia Plant Sciences Building Athens, GA 30602 Telephone: (706) 542-1258 Fax: (706) 542-1262 Email: scherm@uga.edu Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $99,245 Project Summary: The viability of the peach industry in the southern states is threatened by Armillaria root rot, caused by several species of the soil-borne fungus Armillaria.
In many orchards, the disease is a major contributor to premature tree death.
For example, in South Carolina from 1980 to 1992, it is estimated to have caused up to $5-6 million in direct losses annually.
In addition, persistence of the pathogen in the soil on infested root pieces prevents the establishment of productive orchards in previously infested sites, thereby causing additional loss of income.
Current management options for Armillaria root rot are extremely limited, and there is no "silver bullet" that achieves acceptable control when applied as a single tactic.
Yet, there is considerable potential for satisfactory suppression when multiple tactics are combined.
The main goal of this project is, therefore, to evaluate pre-, at-, and post-plant management tactics, alone and in combination, against Armillaria root rot of peach.
Since optimal deployment of these tactics requires knowledge of the causal agent of the disease on the species level, a complementary objective is the development of rapid molecular methods for accurately identifying species of Armillaria in southern peach orchards.

Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/04 Award: $20,000 Project Summary: A national IPM program was developed in 1984 and funded by Special Research Grants awarded on a competive basis on research priorities identified in the four State Agricultural Experiment Station Regions.
Since the beginning of the program there have been more than 149 projects funded in the Southern Region that have involved more than 205 scientists at 13 State Experiment and Extension Stations.
The scientists involved with IPM research have conducted their studies and reported results as annual and terminal reports through the CRIS system, as papers in scientific journals, as research reports at scientific meetings and occasionally through the popular press.
However, because of the diversity of the studies, the multi-disciplinary background of the scientists, the various publication outlets for the results, and the delay between completion of research and publication, there needs to be a continuing effort to evaluate the impact of the total program on IPM in the Southern Region and to publicize the results and the economic benefits.
To assure that the best IPM science is considered and funded each year a request for proposals is prepared and forwarded to each State in the Region and is recorded on the Web for general access.
Proposals are received and a peer panel is selected to review, discuss and rate the proposals.
The highest rated proposals are then selected for funding.

Louisiana Title: Development of an Integrated Control Program for Stable Flies Project Director: Lane Foil, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Louisiana State University 402 Life Sciences Baton Rouge, LA 70803 Telephone: (225) 578-1825 Fax: (225) 578-1643 Email: lfoil@agctr.lsu.edu
Project Start Date: 09/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 08/31/05 Award: $76,135 Project Summary: Insects, ticks, and mites cost the U.S. livestock producer in excess of $3 billion annually.
The second most important pest is the stable fly.
The stable fly has emerged as a tremendous pest of pastured cattle, and there are no effective control measures available for either larvae or adults.
For pastured cattle, residues from round bales are trodden upon by cattle, and mixed with dung and urine; this mixture may constitute the greatest single stable fly breeding medium.
Recently, we have conducted preliminary experiments that indicate that nematode Steinernema feltiae may be an effective biological control agent for stable fly larvae in the habitat described above.
For adult control, we will develop attractant-toxicant targets.
Although the treatment of cattle with sprays is not effective for the control of stable flies on cattle, it is the only method currently available and recommended.
We have initiated studies on stable flies that indicate that the use of treated targets will be a viable strategy for adult stable fly control.
Using electrified targets, we have obtained data that indicate that one of our current targets could have a potential to eliminate over 10,000 adult stable flies per day.
The information generated by the successful achievement of the goals of this IPM proposal could be used by the members of a regional project on management of stable flies on cattle to quickly transfer the technology to livestock producers for use in reducing the economic impact of stable flies.

North Carolina Title: Improved Scouting and Decision Making Tools for Weed Management in Field Crops Project Director: Gail G. Wilkerson, Ph.D.
Crop Science Department North Carolina State University Box 7620 Raleigh, NC 27695-7620 Telephone: (919) 515-5816 Fax: (919) 515-5855 Email: gail_wilkerson@ncsu.edu
Project Start Date: 07/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/14/05 Award: $110,884 Project Summary: Making weed management decisions that are environmentally and economically sound is a complex task.
Most fields are infested with many different weed species, which vary greatly in their ability to cause crop losses and harvest difficulties and in their susceptibility to various herbicides.
Use of an inappropriate herbicide or the wrong rate can result in ineffective weed control, yield loss, and unnecessary chemicals being released into the environment.
Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed three decision aids to assist weed managers in determining if there are enough weeds in a particular field to justify treatment, and, if so, the appropriate herbicides and rates to apply: HADSS for desktop computers, Pocket HERB for handheld computers that can be used to give recommendations in the field, and WebHADSS that is accessible to anyone with an Internet connection and a Web browser.
In this project these decision aids will be modified to better meet the needs of extension agents, growers, and consultants.
Changes will include allowing more flexibility in the way weed population information is entered, presenting yield loss estimates graphically, and linking the programs to a commercially-available scouting program.
Field trials will be conducted to compare several different scouting methods.
The objective is to identify a scouting method that is quick and easy to implement that also results in good decision-making.
This project should directly and immediately affect weed management in ten states within the Southern Region because of ongoing cooperative efforts with weed scientists in these states.

Project Start Date: 08/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 08/14/05 Award: $75,179 Project Summary: The Indianmeal moth is a serious pest of stored, dry food products.
Chemical pesticides for controlling moths are unavailable due to legislation and/or concerns over environmental and human safety.
Alternatives to chemical pesticides include insect attractants from monitoring and controlling the pests.
This project will investigate an attractant for trapping and controlling Indianmeal moth females.

Title: Evaluating Sampling and Management Strategies for Wheat Insect Pests and the Introduction 
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $15,600 Project Summary: Winter wheat is the most important crop grown in Oklahoma, representing more than 6 million acres and $350 million in gross receipts annually.
In Oklahoma, winter wheat is grown as a forage crop for cattle, for grain, or for dual purpose (grazing and grain).
Because it is used in such a versatile way, it is planted over a wide time span in the fall, and thus is subject to various insect pests, including grasshoppers, wireworms, hessian fly, army cutworms, fall armyworm, true armyworm, bird cherry oat aphid, and the greenbug.
Cereal aphids (greenbug and bird cherry oat aphid) are the most important pests of winter wheat because they directly injure wheat and they transmit the barley yellow dwarf virus.
The objective of this effort is to develop and deliver, through OSU's county-based extension system, an educational program to potential end users on the benefits and use of: a) the Glance n' Go program, b) the Greenbug Expert System, and c) samling methods for other arthropod pests of winter wheat.
Impact will be measured through an existing assessment tool that has already been developed by the Wheat IPM Working Group at Oklahoma State University.

South Carolina Title: Management Strategies for the Stink Bug/Plant Bug Complex in Low-Insecticide-Input Cotton Production Systems
Project Director: Sam Turnipseed, Ph.D.
Edisto Research 
Project Start Date: 07/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/14/05 Award: $40,249 Project Summary: Stink bugs and plant bugs are rapidly becoming the most important pest group on developing cotton bolls.
This is due to insecticide reductions against the bollworm/budworm complex in B.t. cotton and the boll weevil where the Boll Weevil Eradication Program has been completed.
These applications gave coincidental control of the "sucking bug" (stink bugs/plant bugs) complex.
In 2003, Bollgard II varieties have been released and they should not require any applications against "worm" pests such as bollworm, loopers and armyworms.
Thus sucking bugs will become even more important because B.t. cotton does not affect them.
Our research will help avoid unnecessary applications for and crop loss from sucking bugs by providing effective treatment thresholds that are applicable across the cotton belt.

Chapman Drive Knoxville, TN 37996-4531 Telephone: (865) 974-7266 Fax: (865) 974-4514 Email: mbuscher@utk.edu
Project Start Date: 07/01/01 Expected Completion Date: 06/30/05 Award: $29,922 Project Summary: On-farm storage capacity in Tennessee and Kentucky exceeds off-farm commercial storage by over 125 million bushels (TDA 2000 and KDA 2000).
Traditionally, these on-farm storage systems have been chemically dependent with a high reliance on both direct application of pesticides (grain protectants) and the use of grain fumigants when insect populations reach such high populations that they can be detected by untrained managers.
In order to maintain the quality of on-farm stored grain, producers must develop effective grain storage management strategies dependent on their location, facility, type of grain and harvest time.
The objectives of this project are: 1) Demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing IPM strategies in preventing grain quality losses from on-farm stored wheat in Tennessee and Kentucky.
2) Develop a multidiscipline, multistate educational effort to train producers, grain storage elevator managers and extension agents how to effectively implement stored IPM practices to prevent quality losses in on-farm stored wheat.
3) Evaluate the impact of the demonstration/educational effort on the adoption of stored grain IPM strategies by Tennessee and Kentucky wheat producers.

Project Start Date: 07/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/14/05 Award: $89,313 Project Summary: This research seeks control of both soilborne plant pathogens and insects pests of fresh market tomato and greenhouse nursery crops through the use of biological control agents as seed treatments.
Soilborne pathogens are frequent problems in tomato production systems and require the use of fungicide sprays or drenches for their control.
Frequent insecticide sprays are also needed to control tomato insect pests.
These same soilborne plant pathogens and insect pests are also common problems for bedding plant producers.
Improved IPM and pest control strategies are desperately needed which can reliably reduce the need for chemical sprays.
Microbial control of plant pathogens and insect pests is one strategy for reducing our reliance on chemical pesticides.
Beauveria bassiana is a fungal pathogen of insects, and its spores are marketed in spray form for biological control of insect pests.
Our preliminary data suggests that, when applied to seed, some isolates of Beauveria can also control the important soilborne plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.
Through a series of growth chamber, greenhouse, and field experiments we will (1) evaluate the effectiveness of seed-applied Beauveria to protect tomato transplants and bedding plants from Rhizoctonia , (2) determine the effectiveness of seed-applied Beauveria to control insect pests of tomato and common bedding plants, (3) determine the effects of Beauveria on plant heat tolerance, (4) examine interactions of seed-applied Beauveria with other biological agents, and (5) examine chemical changes that occur in plants due to the presence of Beauveria.

Texas Title: IPM Cost-Benefit Analysis Tool for Schools Project Director: Michael E. Merchant, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Texas A
However, uncertainty about the short- and long-term costs of IPM are among the most important constraints to adoption of IPM technology by schools with limited budgets.
There is currently little objective information for decision makers on the projected costs associated with switching from conventional, pesticide-based pest control to integrated pest management.
Data obtained in this research will be analyzed and used to develop a spreadsheet-based decision tool for school facility managers.
The tool will allow managers to examine their range of options, the costs of various management actions, and the potential economic and safety benefits of their decisions.

Virginia Title: Development of Improved Monitoring Techniques and Decision Tools for the Dogwood Borer, Synanthedon scitula Harris, in Southern Apple Orchards Project Director: J. Christopher Bergh, Ph.D. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University AHS-AREC 595 Laurel Grove Road Winchester, VA 22602 Telephone: (540) 869-2560 ext. 32 Fax: (540) 869-0862 Email: cbergh@vt.edu Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $80,425 Project Summary: The dogwood borer is a serious pest of many ornamental trees and is increasingly important, but poorly understood, in apple orchards in eastern North America.
Larvae of this moth feed beneath the bark, causing damage that renders ornamental trees unmarketable and reduces the vigor and productivity of apple trees.
Sustained infestation over several years can kill trees, causing significant economic losses.
A reliable and effective monitoring system is crucial to optimizing management strategies and developing alternative, non-chemical tactics for many pests, including dogwood borer.
Sex attractant lures used with traps to monitor dogwood borer are marketed by several companies.
However, their effectiveness varies widely and their ability to accurately reflect the extent of infestations or the emergence and flight of this pest remains questionable, due largely to the fact that the dogwood borer sex pheromone has not been identified.
This proposal seeks to refine the pheromone-based monitoring system for dogwood borer.
Specific objectives include identification of dogwood borer sex pheromone, validation of improved attractiveness of traps baited with its pheromone, comparison of trap styles for monitoring and development of the relationships between trap captures, infestation levels and flight activity in eastern apple orchards.
Improvement of the dogwood borer monitoring system and the development of decision tools based on monitoring will enable producers of apple and ornamental trees to implement control practices in accordance with need.
This should result in increased profitability and reduced pesticide use.
This information will also enable expanded research on non-chemical management alternatives for dogwood borer.

Title: Economic and Environmental Assessment of an Integrated Pest Management Program for German Cockroach Control in Public Housing Project Director: Dini M. Miller, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Institution 216 Price Hall Blacksburg, VA 24061-0319 Telephone: (540) 231-4918 Fax: (540) 231-9131 Email: dinim@vt.edu Project Start Date: 09/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 09/14/05 Award: $58,466 Project Summary: Poor sanitary conditions contribute to a continual problem with German Cockroaches in public low-income housing.
Populations of 20,000 cockroaches in a single apartment unit are not uncommon.
They contaminate food and surfaces with their body parts, cast skins, and fecal material.
Many inhabitants of public housing are elderly people or children who are sensitive to bronchial contaminants, yet live with very large populations of cockroaches.
Inhalation of cockroach allergens has been identified as a major cause of asthma in inner city children.
Pesticide sprays, either as a preventative or a remedial treatment, are the primary method of German cockroach control despite the widespread documentation of German Cockroach resistance to all three of the major chemical classes of spray insecticide.
The main reason for the persistence of monthly insecticide sprays is that the application is relatively inexpensive.
Although spray applications may be inexpensive in monetary costs, the environmental or health costs can be significant.
The overall purpose of this study is to determine the long-term monetary costs and efficacy of an IPM program for German cockroach control in public housing.
Using a contingent valuation approach employed elsewhere in an agricultural setting, the study will assess the impact of IPM on human health risks posed by the monthly pesticide applications in public housing, and estimate the value society places on reducing those risks.
The value of reducing the risks combined with cockroach infestation data will be used to project potential impacts of policy changes to encourage IPM in public housing in Virginia and the Southern region.

California Title: IPM-Based Tools to Enhance Master Gardener and Horticultural Advisor Outreach to Community Groups Project Director: Mary Louise Flint, Ph.D.
Statewide IPM Program, IPM Education 
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $39,369 Project Summary: We propose to develop a series of four interactive IPM presentation packages that UC Master Gardeners and UC Horticultural Advisors can use to promote environmentally sound pest management practices to the gardening public.
These presentation packages will be used in conjunction with a statewide education and outreach project that is being developed for UC Master Gardeners on IPM and water quality issues.
Topics may include pesticides and water quality, non-chemical weed management, managing lawns without pesticides, ant management, managing aphids and whiteflies, and yellowjacket control.
Presentation materials will include a CD-ROM for each topic with a 12 15 minute narrated and animated presentation and interactive quiz sequences that Master Gardeners and Horticultural Advisors can use to stimulate discussion and enhance learning.
We will also produce supplementary teaching materials such as lesson plans, learning objectives, handouts, posters or props for each module.
Through the statewide education and outreach program, a core group of Master Gardeners will already be working with community groups throughout California to educate them about environmentally sound ways to manage pests.
Because Master Gardeners reach thousands of individual residents each year, it is important to equip them with tools that will help them better extend information that is both accurate and useful.
We believe that the presentation packages will provide Master Gardeners with information that can easily be extended to residential audiences and will make the outreach program more effective.
As a result, we would expect that thousands of California residents would be reached with the IPM message.

Colorado Title: Seed Transmission and Ecology of Xanthomonas campestris on Onion Project Director: Howard F. Schwartz, Ph.D. Department of Bioagricultural Sciences 
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 10/30/05 Award: $53,176 Project Summary: Xanthomonas leaf blight, caused by Xanthomonas campestris, is one of the most damaging emerging bacterial diseases of onion in the western United States, and its impact on onion production in the western region is increasing.
Annual yield losses of onion from Xanthomonas leaf blight exceeded 17% in southern Colorado, but entire crop failures have occurred in other production areas.
No sustainable integrated pest management strategies have been developed and growers rely upon copper-based bactericides amended with fungicides (such as maneb) to suppress disease, routinely applying over 10 sprays per season.
A more complete understanding of X. campestris survival, dissemination, and epidemiology in relation to seed contamination and host resistance is necessary to develop effective and durable integrated pest management (IPM) strategies that will reduce crop losses and reliance upon pesticides.
The current body of knowledge is devoid of any studies on the importance of seed contamination and no commercially available resistance or tolerant cultivars have been identified for the western region.
Our proposed studies will: 1) monitor and quantify the effects of various levels of seed contamination on epiphytic X. campestris populations, initial disease appearance and subsequent disease incidence and severity; 2) screen commercially acceptable onion cultivars and germ plasm for the western production region for resistance and/or tolerance to Xanthomonas leaf blight; and 3) disseminate and demonstrate results of these studies and IPM management strategies by annual cultivar trials, an extension bulleting, electronic formats, industry/trade publications and annual grower meetings.

Title: Integrated Management of Centaurea maculosa (Spotted Knapweed) in the Western United States While Utilizing its Allelochemical Properties as an Ecologically Benign Herbicide Project Director: Jorge M. Vivanco, Ph.D. Department of Horticulture Colorado State University Fort Collins, CO 80523-1173 Telephone: (970) 491-7170 Fax: (970) 491-7745 Email: jvivanco@lamar.colostate.edu
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $ 157,208 Project Summary: Spotted knapweed is one of the most invasive weeds in the western United States, particularly in pastures and rangelands.
One of the components that contributes to it's invasiveness is a naturally produced, phytotoxic chemical (allelochemical) called (-)- catechin.
This compound is secreted through the roots into the rhizosphere, displacing native plant communities in its wake.
Secretion of (-)-catechin is increased when C. maculosa is challenged with physiological and biological stresses.
This indicates that even once C. maculosa has been eliminated from an area, secreted (-)-catechin may have an effect on the ability to successfully revegetate that site.
Furthermore, certain methods used to control C. maculosa may further inhibit revegetation efforts due to the increased levels of (-)-catechin deposited into the soil.
We are proposing to study the effects of various weed management methods on (-)-catechin secretion, while identifying native plants that are less susceptible to the allelochemical.
Finally, we are also interested in exploring the potential of (-)-catechin as a broad spectrum, ecologically benign herbicide which can be employed as a tool for integrated weed management in cropping systems.
The proposed project will take approximately two years to complete and will incorporate both laboratory and field experiments, combining expertise in the fields of plant biochemistry, weed science, and restoration ecology.

Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/06 Award: $56,510 Project Summary: This project is designed to reduce alfalfa losses due to activities of ground squirrels.
County Extension agents have identified crop damage incurred by ground squirrels as a major economic loss in Montana.
Ground squirrels may reduce annual alfalfa yields by 35-46%.
It is estimated that over 5 million dollars in alfalfa production is lost to ground squirrels each year in Montana.
In this project we will: 1.
Identify the economic impact of alfalfa loss due to ground squirrels.
2.
Develop an integrated plan to best control ground squirrels, thereby minimizing these losses.
3.
Educate producers on most cost effective means of control, including correct timing and application procedures.
Extension education programs to demonstrate integrated control of ground squirrels will benefit agricultural producers in Montana and neighboring states.
Varying degrees of control can be achieved by manipulating timing and application of control treatments to ground squirrel populations.
Information comparing costs/benefits of various techniques is lacking, especially in recent literature.
As part of this project we will conduct a survey of agriculture producers throughout the state to obtain an estimate of damages caused by ground squirrels.
In-field measures of losses will be implemented.
A simple method for producers to assess damage will also be developed.
We will make a comparison of costs/benefits of various control methods.
Control methods will include zinc phosphide coated baits, anti-coagulant baits, fumigants and trapping treatments.
Analysis of control methods will focus on timing, economics and efficiency of the treatments for Richardsons and Columbian ground squirrels throughout the state.
Results and recommendations of the project will be disseminated through Extension publications, workshops and a web page on the Extension website.
Presentations will be made at agricultural meetings and at regional wildlife damage control meetings.
The objectives of this project are: 1.
Demonstrate the effectiveness of various fencing methods to repel deer and elk from haystacks.
2.
Demonstrate the effectiveness of various fencing methods to repel deer and elk from alfalfa fields or high value pastures.
3.
Develop a simple procedure for producers to determine cost/benefits of the techniques; net wire fence, electric fence, modified existing fence.
4.
Disseminate the results of the project through extension publications, research publication, internet, producer meetings, field days and workshops.

Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $109,164 Project Summary: Curly top virus transmitted by the beet leafhopper causes devastating losses to New Mexico chile peppers.
Since the disease is unpredictable, chile producers cannot plan preventative management measures.
This research project will develop a predictive model of curly top disease of chile based on environmental parameters, providing the advance warning necessary to implement productive management options.
The leafhopper vector breeds and increases its population on weeds, acquiring the virus from weeds prior to moving into chile.
The most severe disease years in New Mexico are preceded by measurable fall rains which theoretically influences disease by increasing the numbers of winter annual weeds, such as London rocket, which is a host of the leafhopper and virus.
Leafhoppers could move into chile, as adults, from senescing London rocket in the spring.
Growth chamber studies will be used to monitor the growth parameters of London rocket.
Using field trials, we will measure the life cycle of London rocket that germinates in August, late October, or late December and determine its ability to serve as an overwintering host for the beet leafhopper.
We will test whether the date of London rocket emergence is correlated with curly top disease in the weed.
Leafhopper development is dependant on temperature; therefore, initial leafhopper flights can be predicted using accumulated degree-days.
The model of curly top disease in chile in New Mexico will use precipitation to predict disease intensity due to presence of London rocket and temperature to determine initial leafhopper flights.

Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $98,828 Project Summary: A world-wide-web site is being developed to allow farmers to make better decisions about management of pests in several crops and regions in the Pacific Northwest.
This system uses both public and grower-supported weather stations plus computer-based approaches to better estimate pest and disease risk in crops and orchards, including locations in between weather stations.
This approach will reduce the cost of obtaining site-specific weather data and pest modeling information, and help growers to reduce costly sprays that may be harmful to humans and the environment.
Local weather, which drives pest development and disease risk, often varies with elevation, slope, aspect, and other factors.
This project will allow, in areas having a small network of weather stations, the ability to estimate weather at all locations so that even those with unusual climates can be served.
This system has potential for expansion to help for virtually all crops and growing regions, and is initially being developed for the Hood River and Medford Oregon tree fruit growing regions.

Title: Refining Iron-Enhanced Biological Control of Fire Blight Project Director: Virginia Opal Stockwell, Ph.D. Department of Botany and Plant Pathology Oregon State University 2082 Cordley Hall Corvallis, OR 97331-2902 Telephone: (541) 738-4061 Fax: (541) 738-4025 Email: stockwev@bcc.orst.edu
Project Start Date: 09/15/03 Expected Completion Date: 09/14/05 Award: $99,240
Project Summary: Fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora is the most serious bacterial disease of apples and pears grown in the western US.
Antibiotics (streptomycin and oxytetracycline) are applied routinely during bloom to control fire blight, but streptomycin- resistance has decreased effectiveness of chemical control methods.
Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506 is a biological control bacterium registered for fire blight management.
The harmless biocontrol bacterium A506 excludes the pathogen from infection sites on pear and apple flowers.
Variation in control of fire blight by A506, however, has hindered its wider use by commercial growers.
We discovered that iron can trigger A506 to produce a compound that kills the fire blight pathogen.
In field trials, we found that spraying an iron chelate (FeEDDHA) on flowers provided iron to A506; and in some trials, significantly increased disease control.
Thus, the potential exists to improve biocontrol of fire blight by adding iron to A506.
The proposed research will obtain answers to questions raised by growers about how to best implement iron-enhanced biocontrol of fire blight with A506.
For example, we will determine when growers should spray iron with A506 to maximize its activity.
Similarly, the array of iron chelates used in agriculture varies both in cost and in chemical activity.
We will evaluate several forms of iron for their capacity to safely enhance biocontrol activity of A506.
We also will study how to best integrate this biocontrol regime with conventional (antibiotic) control methods.
We will pay particular focus on the compatibility of iron-enhanced biological control with the antibiotic oxytetracycline, which is used throughout the western US for fire blight suppression.

Title: Electronic Delivery of IPM Information and Decision Support Tools for Field Use Project Director: Raymond D. William, Ph.D. Department of Horticulture Oregon State University 4017 Ag Life Sciences Bldg.
Corvallis, OR 97331-7304 Telephone: (541) 737-5441 Fax: (541) 737-3479 Email: williamr@science.oregonstate.edu
Project Start Date: 08/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 07/31/05 Award: $29,526 Project Summary: Pest management decisions require integration of complex data and information that changes dynamically throughout the season and from year to year.
Electronic decision aids dramatically improve pest management decisions, but require portable palm-top technologies and improved results by factors of ten rather than simply delivering written information.
Electronic delivery also can aid planning and archiving over years with automatic reporting functions.
Project goals include the following objectives: 1.
Design and deliver state of the art navigational and decision support tools designed to click on the pest followed by automatic lists of options, environmental cautions, and reminders of long-term consequences of practices selected or sequenced.
Planning and archiving features over several years enhances selection of pest management options, pest resistance, and automatic reporting.
2.
Involve stakeholders in assessing and evaluating these features of educational delivery via web technologies to improve IPM decisions in agriculture.
Following development of electronic decision supports, pest managers will evaluate the tools using a dozen lap- and palm-top computers.
An evaluation specialist will assist in the design, analysis, and interpretation of data and comments.
Users of the PNW Pest Management Guides will help assess the utility of the decision support tools in making complex decisions for the future.
A key question that users will answer is to what extent will pest management and decision-making be improved using electronic decision tools? __________________________________________________________________
Washington Title: Integrating Biological Control in the Management of Solanaceous Weeds Project Director: Douglas B. Walsh, Ph.D. Department of Entomology Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center 24106 N. Bunn Road Prosser, WA 99350-8694 Telephone: (509) 786-9287 Fax: (509) 786-9370 Email: dwalsh@wsu.edu
Project Start Date: 09/01/03 Expected Completion Date: 08/31/05 Award: $79,392 Project Summary: Volunteer potato and similar Solanaceous weeds such as nightshade are difficult to control in crops planted after potato in the Pacific Northwest.
These weeds are hosts for insect pests such as the Colorado potato beetle and diseases such as early and late blight.
Our goal is to examine the effectiveness of combining biological control by the beetle with conventional chemical, cultural, and mechanical controls to suppress volunteer potato and nightshade in annual row crops.
Typically, volunteer potato control is accomplished with early-season herbicide and cultivation, which could be enhanced with late-season suppression by beetle feeding.
Objectives are to 1) determine how the size of the weed, amount of herbicide, and amount of beetle feeding together can affect the control of weed populations, 2) determine how an integrated program involving biological, chemical, and cultural control of weeds might affect crop yield, and 3) determine the abundance and extent of Solanaceous species and abundance of Colorado potato beetles on these weeds.
Laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies will be conducted to develop integrated weed management systems in several crops, including carrots, onions, sweet corn, and wheat.
This is a novel interface of weed science, entomology, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
The results from this work will have direct value to affected growers in the Pacific Northwest by improving the effectiveness of IPM programs and changing attitudes towards pests and IPM.
Also, this research will provide additional general knowledge on how multiple stressors affect the reproductive potential of weeds.
