Career Summary
Peter Cheeseman is a senior research scientist, whose specialization is in Artificial Intelligence, and Bayesian Inference Methods.
He received his B.S. degree in Physics and Mathematics with honors from Melbourne University (Australia) in 1971, his M.Phil. in Applied Mathematics from Waikato University (New Zealand) in 1973, and his Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Monash University (Australia) in 1979.
His Ph.D thesis title was "A Problem Solving System with Learning".
Dr. Cheeseman was a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia from 1978 to 1981.
From 1981 to 1985, Peter performed research at SRI International in the areas of production planning, probabilistic methods for combining information, induction of probabilistic rules from data, development of a representation and procedure for spatial uncertainty estimation, and development of an information theoretic version of Bayesian estimation and its applications.
In 1985 Peter began research at NASA Ames Research Center in the Artificial Intelligence Research Branch.
He now manages a small group (4-6 people) who apply Bayesian inference methods to data analysis problems.
This research has concentrated on the development of a practical general purpose automatic classification system, whose implementations are: AutoClass III; AutoClass X; and AutoClass C.
In addition, research into probabilistic methods for solving combinatorial search problems has yielded new insights on when problems are hard and how to solve them.
A newer project involves combining information from multiple images of planetary surfaces to form a surface model at higher resolution that any particular image.
