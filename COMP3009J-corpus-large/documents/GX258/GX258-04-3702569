NATIONAL SUMMARY: NATIONAL SUMMARY: AGENCY RESPONSES AGENCY RESPONSES (Identifying environmental pressures and gathering the comprehensive data for the National Assessments (the discussions in the previous sections) were mandated by the USCRTF National Action Plan.
USCRTF agencies and their partners have worked together to make the National Action Plan a reality (USCRTF 2000).
In less than two years, significant progress has been made on the two fundamental themes and action items (USCRTF 2002).
The two themes and action items identified by the USCRTF are discussed in the remainder of this section.
Theme 1: Understand Coral Reef Ecosystems Â­
reef management and conservation.
This included monitoring, education, and designation of marine protected areas.
Additionally, in FY00 NOAA provided $7.8 million, and in FY01 $27 million to agencies with coral reef management responsibilities for other initiatives for conserving coral reef ecosystems.
In FY02, a total of $34 million will be available from NOAA to continue coral reef initiatives on U.S. coral reef ecosystems and to initiate related efforts for reefs off the Pacific Freely Associated States.
Understanding coral reef systems is necessary to 1) discern the conservation measures needed and 2) evaluate potential impacts of actions on the condition of the coral reef ecosystems.
This includes comprehensive mapping, assessment, and monitoring of coral reef health (Fig. 102); supporting strategic research on regional threats to coral reef health and the underlying ecological processes upon which they depend; and incorporating the human dimension into conservation and management strategies.
Theme 2: Quickly Reduce the Adverse Impacts of Human Activities Â­ Reducing impacts

AGENCY RESPONSES
The USCRTF National Action Plan committed to delineating and digitally mapping all U.S. shallow coral reefs by 2009 using airborne and satellite photography.
Mapping and habitat characterization of selected deep reef and bank areas has also begun using multi-beam sonar, submersibles, and remotely-operated vehicles.
This information will support more effective fish and coastal zone management, disaster mitigation, research, and restoration efforts.
Detailed and spatially accurate digital benthic habitat maps can be used to design monitoring programs, organize data, and conduct assessments.
Digital data and the associated maps delineate major habitat types Â­ seagrass, coral reefs, and mangroves Â­ and can provide a framework for tracking changes in those habitats (Monaco et al. 2001).
Other measurements of the ecosystem that correlate with habitat change116 can be layered onto these maps and perhaps ultimately used to help predict habitat change.
Completed maps and related information (discussed in the following subsections) are available on a NOAA web site (Coral Reef Mapping and Monitoring 2002).

areas off the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico including the newly-designated Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Areas.
These are important habitats for commercial reef fishes and contain some deep reefs that may rival those in the FGBNMS.
In 2001, NOAA also conducted habitat characterization of deep Oculina coral reefs off the eastern coast of Florida using submersibles and multibeam sonar.
Results showed significant habitat damage to protected banks from illegal trawling.
The characterization of marine habitats of Puerto Rico and USVI has been completed, and benthic habitat maps are now available (Coral Reef Mapping and Monitoring 2002).
This was a collaborative project117 using visual interpretation of aerial photographs (Fig. 104).
NOAA's National Geodetic Survey acquired aerial photographs for the near-shore waters in 1999.
Working in conjunction with the State of Florida, similar maps are available as a benthic habitat atlas of the Florida Keys (FKNMS Benthic Map 2002).
Since this is just for the Keys, about 50% of Florida's coral reef ecosystem still needs to be mapped.
Pacific Shallow-Water Mapping Initiatives Â­
Assess and Monitor Reef Health The USCRTF's National Action Plan (2000) called for an integrated nationwide coral reef monitoring system that could provide regular assessments of reef health as well as initiate new monitoring to fill gaps.
This will provide the essential information managers need to respond to changing environmental conditions, to assess the effectiveness of management strategies, and identify the need for additional protective measures.
Since then, NOAA initiated and is leading a coordinated effort to determine the condition of coral reefs, the causes of coral reef decline, and the impacts of environmental pressures on coral reef ecosystems.
A National Program to Assess and Monitor Coral Reef Ecosystems Â­ In FY99, 50 coral reef
NOAA is leading an investigation to map the distribution of coral reefs and other benthic habitats throughout the U.S. Pacific islands.

With the USEPA and NOAA, the FKNMS Water Quality Protection Program monitoring continues in the Florida Keys.
Specific monitoring of ecosystem process and functional changes that result from the implementation of fully protected marine reserves is also underway.
Florida Â­ In the Florida Keys, fish and benthic
habitat assessments and monitoring were conducted and an integrated molecular biomarker system was used to assess ecosystem health.
Four cruises performed baseline surveys of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve to determine the influence of Reserve status on fish communities, the food web, and habitat structure and function (FKNMS 2002).
Puerto Rico Â­ Puerto Rico established a Commonwealth-wide network of monitoring sites where sessile-benthic organisms, reef fish, motile invertebrates, and water quality were surveyed (Fig. 106).
They also conducted a baseline characterization of bio-optical properties, surveyed three coral reef locations to gain baseline information, and assessed the effects of establishing a no-take zone at the Luis PeÃ±a Natural Reserve on Culebra Island.
Additionally, a baseline characterization of the fish and motile and sessile benthic invertebrates inhabiting coral reef and sea grass habitats was conducted at 15 sites on Vieques Island.

This comprehensive survey inventoried a total of 439 ongoing programs and projects assessing and monitoring coral reef ecosystems.
The information gathered by this survey is now available in a GIS and metadata database (Coral Reef Mapping and Monitoring 2002, Fig. 108).
Survey results indicate that significant geographical disparities exist in the quantity and quality of monitoring projects conducted around the United States and its associated territories (Asch and Figure 108.

Conduct Strategic Research The USCRTF National Action Plan called for additional research to better understand coral reef ecosystems and help determine what can be done to protect and restore them.
In FY00-01, the USCRTF agencies sponsored research on disease, bleaching, coral growth, and other aspects.
This increased understanding of coral reef health, degradation, and recovery.
National and international research accomplishments include the following.

NATIONAL SUMMARY NATIONAL SUMMARY
National Center for Caribbean Coral Reef Research (NCORE) Â­ Established by the USEPA
as a Federal Demonstration Project in 1999, NCORE still receives supplemental funding from NOAA, NSF, and other public and private sources.
Located at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Miami, NCORE integrates and refines physical and biological models to predict the consequences of either a given disturbance or a change in management strategy on the ecology of a coral reef and on reef-dependent people (NCORE 2002).

Understand Social and Economic Factors Â­ The Human Dimension Coral reef management has traditionally focused on the biophysical aspects of coral reefs.
Since reefs are coming under increasing pressure from human activities, better understanding the human dimension must play an important role in management programs.
To ensure long-term success, programs must also involve the local community and create cooperative management.
Human activities and their resulting impacts are woven into the social, cultural, and economic fabric of regional coastal communities.
This is particularly important among many of the U.S. Islands, where traditional management of coral reef resources, including subsistence fishing, have been an integral part of local government (Fig. 115).
The human dimension has become a significant component of USCRTF coral reef conservation activities.
In FY00, NOAA shifted its priorities toward a more interdisciplinary approach, and began to diversify its focus, sponsor human Â·
The FKNMS initiated a program in 1998 to monitor the economics of commercial fishermen displaced from fully protected zones (FKNMS 2002, Fig. 117).
It also tracks trends in recreational tourism and its relationship to the local economy.
Baseline estimates (1995-1996) were developed on `protected area use' and a 5-year update was recently completed.
Part of the report compares satisfaction of reef users and rates the many reef attributes.
Expand and Strengthen Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) The USCRTF National Action Plan considers MPAs and areas with no-take provisions a key tool for protecting coral reef ecosystems and assuring
80 80
the sustainable use of reef resources.
Used nationally and internationally, MPAs conserve biodiversity, protect endangered species, reduce user conflicts, and enhance commercial and recreational activities (Salm et al. 2000).
Enforcement determines the effectiveness of this (or any) conservation measure.
Strengthen Current MPAs Â­ Much has been
done over the past few years by USCRTF agencies to strengthen MPAs, but most have been incremental and relatively unheralded.
The following are examples of what some of the island governments have undertaken since 1999.
Â· The USVI Government initiated the development of a Marine Park Management Plan for a proposed marine protected area along the eastern end of St. Croix.
Collaborating institutions are currently working on a socioeconomic assessment and resource description as well as a management plan for the USVI.
Hawai`i has begun to inventory and assess its MPA system and is designing a new structure for designation and management.
It is increasing the size of the Pupukea MPA on O`ahu and creating a no-take zone within this MPA. Guam is enforcing the waters within its five no-take coral reef reserves that protect about 20% of the island's shallow-water reefs (Fig. 118).

To address concerns about the removal of Hawaiian reef fish for the aquarium trade, Hawaii's DLNR funded the West Hawaiian Aquarium Project, at the University of Hawaii at Hilo and at other institutions (W. Walsh pers. comm.).
Those results showed significant population declines in areas where fish had been collected.
For example, at sites with regular collecting Achilles tang had been reduced by 63%, longnose butterfly fish by 54%, and yellow tang by 47% (Fig. 120), according to B. Tissot (pers. comm.) of Washington State

Coastal activities such as dredging for navigation or marinas, construction of shoreline protection structures, beach renourishment, sand mining, pipeline and cable installation, and destructive land-use practices125 decrease water quality around reefs.
Increased tourism has increased pressure on coral reef resources, either through direct impacts on the reefs or indirectly through increased levels of coastal development, sewage discharge, and vessel traffic.
As the number of people using and transiting coral reefs increases, so does the frequency of vessel groundings on reefs.
A number of actions have been taken by the USCRTF to reduce these impacts.

Additionally, USFWS funded a reef restoration project to address the 1993 grounding and breakup of a 250 mT longline fishing vessel at Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.
Since 1993, the USFWS and the American Samoan Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources have periodically monitored the site (Green et al. 1998).
The USFWS initiated a cleanup in 1999 and completed removal of shipwreck debris from the ocean reef flat and most debris from the slopes in 1999-2000 (Fig. 128).
Over 100 mT has been removed, but about 40 mT remains in the lagoon.
Surveys in 2002 show cleanup actions have resulted in some reef recovery, but substantial impacts remain (J. Burgett and J. Maragos pers. comm.)
There is a good chance additional funds from the USCG will be available for the USFWS to finish the cleanup in 2002-2003.
