Food service orders are about steady.
Sales of bulk butter, f.o.b.

Bulk butter for spot sales is selling in a range of flat Â­ 2 cents per pound over various pricing basis.
WEST Prices weakened slightly last week at the cash CME market.

Milk production is declining seasonally and high fat product output is increasing for holiday type items.
Weekly CME butter stocks declined by 7.4 million pounds last week.
This is the largest weekly decline since November of 2000.

CENTRAL In active trading, the cash price at the CME declined slightly at mid week.

Milk production is steady in most of the Middle Atlantic and Northeastern states.
Colder weather is more of a factor in the Northeast.
The threat of snow in parts of New England has some farmers starting to put their cows in for the winter and the adjustment period for the cows typically impacts milk output in a negative manner.
This is relatively early for cows to "be barned."
Contacts continue to comment on milk prices, poor quality hay and crops, and the possible/probable loss of producers during the winter.
Florida's imports eased lower this week, but milk needs are about steady.
Handlers normally carry milk into each week, but plant maintenance/renovations caused them to use their carry over volumes and this eased the need for outside milk.
Also, milk production is starting to increase in the Southeast.
Throughout the region, bottled milk sales range from steady to slightly improved where retail features are in effect.
Surplus milk supplies are a little heavier this week and most manufacturing plants did have more milk to process.

Class I interest is about steady with the usual preparations for the traditional stronger first of the month pickup in sales.
Production of sour cream, dips, eggnog, and cream cheese is seasonally active.
Manufacturing milk interest is steady to lighter due to the industry expectation of sharply lower milk prices in November as well as slower cheese sales because of recent price declines.
Manufacturing milk prices were mostly lower, particularly on the low end of the range where a producer lost a large cheese account and needed to get rid of some milk quickly.

Demand is good from butter makers as print orders are being place for holiday features.
Other seasonal cream-based products are increasing in production and taking more cream.
Western multiples varied from 109 to 128, FOB. Good conditions prevail in the PACIFIC NORTHWEST for continued strong milk production.

VOLUME 69, REPORT 44
NDM, BUTTERMILK 
NONFAT DRY MILK - CENTRAL AND EAST CENTRAL: Prices are unchanged on a firm market.
NDM low heat production is generally higher.
While some plants are diverting milk away from NDM facilities, others are taking in excess milk for drying.
Supplies are tight and limited to the contractual trade interest.
Some plants are buying product from the West to satisfy contracts.
Spot interest is also being satisfied with West coast NDM.
High heat spot movement and production are light.
Inventories are in balance with stocks steadily clearing into contracts for holiday baking needs.
Supplies of condensed skim are tight for the good cheese producer interest.
EAST: Prices and the market tone are unchanged.
Production levels remain light.
A few operations did have some extra milk this week and did dry some additional volumes.
This new output is already committed for sale.
Elsewhere, powder output is light.
Few producers have powder on hand to meet spot demand.
Demand is fairly good and supplies are often short.
Some producers didn't have enough powder to supply their plant-specific customers and reportedly bought back CCC-owned NDM they produced to meet these needs.
There are additional reports that some traders are trying to buy NDM from the CCC because they cannot get any spot loads from regular sources.
Also, some contacts feel that prices may go up in the next week or two and want to buy back before that happens.
Condensed skim sales are steady to occasionally slower, particularly into cheese plants.
F.O.B. CENTRAL/EAST: Includes EXTRA GRADE and GRADE A
DRY BUTTERMILK - CENTRAL Prices are unchanged and nominal on a steady to firm market.
Although production is increasing at some locations, supplies remain tight.

Drying schedules are mostly steady, reflecting mostly level milk supplies.
Stocks are generally in check with some producers in tighter positions than others.
During the week of October 21-25, CCC purchased 974,280 pounds of low heat NDM from the West.
Trade sources report that sales from the CCC back to the trade continue, but volume numbers have not been released.

VOLUME 69, REPORT 44
WHEY, CASEIN 
DRY WHEY - CENTRAL Prices are unchanged to lower on a steady to weak market.
Production remains steady to higher as plants continue to divert milk away from the butter/powder mix and into cheese vats.
Some plants report that inventories are in balance and are trading at standard premiums.
However, at other locations, supplies are heavy and discounts are reported into brokerage facilities at the lower end of the range.
Current prices are reportedly too high for some export markets.
Some buyers in the Asian and Canadian markets are seeking product from the EU instead of the US as EU prices are more attractive.
Off grade whey from the East is competitive with the Central Extra Grade market for the good feed interest.
Condensed whey is available at some locations for the light to fair demand.
F.O.B.
CENTRAL: .2200 - .2575 MOSTLY: .2375 - .2475
WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE - CENTRAL AND WEST Prices are higher on a firm market.
Supplies remain tight.
Trading is light, which may deter price movement in future weeks.
Production is steady.
Demand is best from feed markets.
Some feed buyers that were adverse to WPC 80% use, are now sampling the product as a substitute to WPC 34%.
Canadian WPC 34% is competitive with US WPC 34% for domestic edible and feed markets.
High protein product from New Zealand and the EU is also readily available as a substitute to WPC 34% for the light to fair feed interest.
Brokers are reselling WPC 34% at prices above the range.
Condensed WPC is clearing steadily into feed and WPC/lactose facilities with supplies sometimes short of buyer interest.
F.O.B.
EXTRA GRADE 34% PROTEIN: .4600 - .5100 MOSTLY: .4750 - .4950
LACTOSE - CENTRAL AND WEST Prices are unchanged on a steady to firm market.
Some contract negotiations are commencing for 2003.
Buyers are hesitant to commit, especially in Asian markets.
Because some Asian buyers are currently being shorted loads due to shipping and production delays, an increased interest in securing supplies for 2003 is noted.
However, because port strike issues are not guaranteed to be resolved in the new year, buyers are also seeking alternative sources if possible.
New Zealand interest in US lactose is reportedly good.
Production is mostly steady.
Inventories are mixed.
Some locations are short of supplies while others are carrying excess stocks to clear.
Inquiries from domestic edible and feed markets are increasing.
Feed buyers are seeking a low cost alternative to higher priced whey and permeate markets.
Off grade supplies are more readily available than the week prior at prices below the range.
Including spot sales and up to 3 month contracts.
Mesh size 30 - 100.
DRY WHEY - NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST Prices are steady and Eastern prices remain nominal.
Few spot sales are being reported, but some contacts do note that a few more loads are being offered at the producer level.
Production levels are steady to lighter as some cheese makers are cutting back on output due to milk availability, the price of cheese, and growing inventory.
Producers and traders report that it has been a relatively quiet week.
Some sales from an Eastern plant have been noted below the bottom of the range, but this product apparently does not have the desired approvals that some buyers require.
Spot buyers seem to have pulled back into a wait and see posture.
Many feel that prices have peaked for this particular cycle.

DRY WHEY Â­ WEST Western whey powder prices continue to increase.
While the port shipping issues continue to disrupt shipping schedules, whey stocks are not building to any great extent.
At least manufacturers are not concerned enough to offer the market lower to keep stocks in better balance.
Production schedules are declining on a seasonal basis due to less milk and some shifting of production patterns.
Some contacts are concerned about the possibility of the strike/lock out resuming at the end of the year.
They consider the timing of that possibility to be a real concern.
NONHYGROSCOPIC: .1750 - .2500 MOSTLY: .1950 - .2100
CASEIN Â­ NATIONAL Casein markets and prices are unsettled.
Some contacts continue to report supplies to be tighter than desired for this time of the season while others indicate that stocks are in good balance.
Prices are also reflective of these various market opinions.
Many domestic buyers and importers are curious on what the results of the first round of production of casein/casinates from government owned powder will reveal.
Most still feel that this program will not gain much momentum, especially with the uncertainty of a consistent supply of NDM at a favorable price and the disposition of the acid whey.
SPOT SALES AND UP TO 3 MONTH CONTRACTS.

RENNET: ACID: 1.8500 - 2.1000 1.6500 - 1.9500
ANIMAL FEED WHEY - CENTRAL Prices are unchanged to higher.
Milk replacer supplies are generally tight for the good interest.
Some buyers are looking to the Eastern market for supplies that are more readily available.
Increasing price resistance is deterring some price increases in the roller ground market.
Roller ground production is steady and inventories are generally in balance.
Delactose movement is good into the edible market for the holiday process cheese interest.
Feed interest is fair and mostly contractual with nominal trading reported slightly higher.
The September 2002 U.S. pig crop at 8.37 million head, was 1% below the previous year.
Sows farrowing during this period totaled 943 thousand head, 2% below last year.
September calf slaughter totaled 88,800 head, up 13% from September 2001.
NOTE: The delactose report will be discontinued in 2003 unless the industry requests continuation of the price series.
This initiation is due to lackluster spot trading and reporting during the 2002 year and in an effort to affirm an interest in the current delactose report.

EVAPORATED MILK - NATIONAL Prices and the market tone are steady.
Production levels remain mixed.
Some plants have a steady supply of milk.
Others, however, have to buy milk on the spot market and often find asking prices/premiums prohibitive.
Some producers see milk prices taking an "up tick" for October and may ease their output to see if prices will decline from October's projected price.
Buyers continue to pull loads for Thanksgiving needs, but by now, most large chain operations have their volumes in their stores or distribution channels.
Plant stocks continue to be drawn down along seasonal patterns.
