DISD's Handbook for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students states that "program enrollment is expected to be 12 percent or more of each school's population."
Staff responsible for the G/T program indicated that the courts established the percentage at some time during the district's desegregation lawsuit.
Correspondence from attorneys representing DISD in its ongoing desegregation litigation, however, indicates that the 12 percent requirement was self-imposed.
The letter indicates that, during 1994-95, the then-newly created Honors Development Department conducted a study of G/T enrollments in district schools and concluded that "ethnicity ideally should match school population, plus or minus 10 percent, and ideally should be between 12 percent and 18 percent of school population."
The correspondence also indicates that "this test or goal or expectation was never even approved by the Court, much less was it mandated by the Court."
In January 2001, the TEA associate commissioner for Quality, Compliance, and Accountability Reviews mailed a letter to all superintendents in the state outlining the agency's process for selecting districts to receive on-site district effectiveness and compliance (DEC) monitoring visits during the 2001-02 school year.
The letter discussed TEA's program analysis system (PAS), and the 76 data elements and 12 program areas covered in the system.
One of the data elements is the percent of a district's enrollment identified as G/T.
PAS assigns points to the various data elements; in the case of G/T enrollment, districts can earn from 0 points for less than 8 percent enrollment to 4 points for 15 percent or more enrolled.
The higher the point total, the higher the probability of receiving a DEC visit.
Although a high score on one data element will not generate a visit, the implication for DISD's G/T program is that its current levels of G/T enrollment are too high.
DISD as well as the courts are concerned about the re-segregation of G/T classes.
In its evaluation of the 1999-2000 program, the division of Evaluation, Accountability and Information Systems pointed out that Anglos are less overrepresented and Hispanics less underrepresented in the program than four years ago.
The evaluation report states that "restricting the population to those students who scored at or above the 80^th percentile eliminated the White 'advantage' in elementary TAG enrollment," which makes a case for using lower-than-expected achievement criteria to establish eligibility for the program.
A 1996 report, Gifted and Talented Program Review, discussed the desirability of using identification procedures in addition to standardized measures to identify G/T students in underrepresented populations.
The report stated that "traditional paper/pen identification procedures are not sensitive enough" to identify the children of high general intelligence and aptitude present in all populations.
In discussing issues relating to "programming and services at all levels," the report stated that "unevenness in the identification of students was a focus of much concern from stakeholders."
Specific concerns mentioned included the following: * The wide range of ability and achievement and the large numbers of students identified on school records makes it very challenging to meet all participants' needs.
The report stated that most DISD schools served between 12 to 20 percent of the school population in G/T programs, a larger percentage than in many districts, with G/T participation of up to 100 percent noted on some campus records.
* In some cases, DISD's identification procedures did not follow TEA guidelines.
The report found that district policies appeared to be consistent with law but that "implementation inconsistencies" existed.
* The perception existed that the district and/or some of its schools were overly concerned with ratios and might have overreported services to satisfy court-ordered initiatives.
* Concern was expressed over the district's failure to coordinate the general education core curriculum with the curriculum for G/T students.
Recommendation 40:
Develop procedures to correctly and equitably identify gifted and talented students in all racial and ethnic groups.

FINDING
To date, DISD has not acted on any recommendations made in a 1996 Gifted and Talented Program Review.
The 1996 review was intended "to review the entire scope of the district's programming for the talented and gifted from kindergarten to grade 12."
The report contained 19 "short-term" and 10 "long-term" recommendations.
The short-term recommendations involved "adjustments and improvements that could be made almost immediately with minimal implications for the budget."
Examples included enlisting the strongest central administrative staff feasible with current available funds to guide long-range improvement plans, placing a G/T specialist on each cluster service team and improving communication on G/T issues among central office administration, school faculties and parents.
Long-term recommendations included "actions which will take extensive planning and widespread involvement of stakeholders."
Examples included the development of clear definitions of the program's purpose, populations to be served, terminology and services; a program to reach the area's growing Hispanic population, especially recent immigrants and those with limited English proficiency; and programming for sub-populations of gifted students, such as underachieving gifted students and gifted students in at-risk situations.
Recommendation 41:
Respond to the principal recommendations of the 1996 report Gifted and Talented Program Review.

Section 29.123 requires the State Board of Education (SBOE) to "develop and periodically update a state plan of the education of gifted and talented students" to be used for accountability purposes "to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented."
The SBOE plan, adopted in 1996, provides direction for the refinement of existing services and for the creation of additional curricular options for gifted students.
DISD has offered a program for students identified as gifted and talented since the early 1990s.
The current program includes three components: the Talented and Gifted (TAG) Program for grades 1-8, advanced academic courses for grades 7-12 and an elective course in middle school, the interdisciplinary seminar, designed to meet the needs of gifted and talented students.
The TAG program is interdisciplinary and is taken in middle school as an elective.
It is available in all district schools serving grades K-8 and at four magnet schools, Polk Vanguard, Spence Academy, Travis Vanguard 
Advanced academic coursework at the middle school level includes Pre-Honors (PH) courses in language arts and math and in high school as Pre-Advanced Placement (Pre-AP) or Advanced Placement (AP) courses.
PH courses are available to all qualified students in grades 7-8, Pre-AP courses to students in grades 9-11 and AP courses to students in grades 11-12.
Magnet school enrollment is determined by additional criteria related to racial/ethnic ratios and other constraints established by the court in the various desegregation orders concerning DISD.
Enrollment in the program has remained relatively constant since 1997-1998.
The number of students served and the average percent of the student population in the program at the elementary, middle and high school levels are summarized in Exhibit 2-47.

Between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years, DISD funds budgeted for instructional operating expenses rose by 7.1 percent for all programs, from about $908.8 million to $973.3 million.
During the same period, funds budgeted for the gifted and talented (G/T) program rose by 14.3 percent, from $10.6 million to $12.1 million.
During the same period, total enrollment in the district increased by just 0.7 percent and enrollment in the G/T program fell by 2.1 percent.
The increase in budgeted instructional operating expenditures for each student enrolled in the G/T program was 17 percent (Exhibit 2-48).

*Differences between Exhibit 2-47 and Exhibit 2-48 in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 enrollment are due to enrollment counts being taken at different times of the year.
FINDING
DISD offers a number of options to its staff to meet the training requirements related to gifted and talented education.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students provides a basis for program accountability for G/T services.
It outlines five areas of program performance, student assessment, program design, curriculum and instruction, professional development and family-community involvement, and provides three levels of performance measures-acceptable, recognized and exemplary-to guide districts in program development.
The "acceptable" performance measure includes those actions included either in state law or rule.
Under the area "professional development," the state plan requires that teachers who provide G/T instruction and services: * Have a minimum of 30 clock hours of training in the nature and needs of gifted/talented students, assessing student needs, and curriculum and instruction for gifted students; and * Receive a minimum of six hours each year of training in gifted education.
It also requires that administrators and counselors who make program decisions have a minimum of six hours of professional development on the nature and needs of and program options for gifted/talented students.
During fall 2000, DISD provided its staff members with training on six different topics, on two separate occasions each, to help them complete the state-required 30 clock hours of basic training or six hours of update training (Exhibit 2-49).

COMMENDATION
DISD provides training opportunities to teachers, counselors and administrators involved in the gifted and talented program to help them meet state training requirements.
FINDING
DISD and the Texas Instruments Foundation (TIF) cooperatively fund the district's Advanced Placement Initiative Program (APIP) in an effort to increase the number of AP courses offered, teachers trained and students enrolled.
Administered by Advanced Placement Strategies, Inc.
(APS), the program is a continuation of one previously funded through the O'Donnell Foundation.
It provides monetary incentives to students, teachers and campuses for improved AP test performance and works with schools in forming vertical teams to support AP instruction.
Ten DISD high schools and 11 middle schools are included in the program for the 2000-01 school year.
Under the current five-year contract (September 1, 2000 to August 31, 2005), TIF is providing the following monetary incentives: * Teachers.
$150 for each AP exam score of 3, 4 or 5 earned by students appearing on the teacher's AP class roster for subjects for which the teacher was approved for funding.
* Teachers.
$500 stipend if the number of students passing in any subsequent year is greater than in any year since 1999-2000.
* Students.
$100 for each AP exam score of 3, 4 or 5 earned in any subject taught by a teacher approved for funding.
* Principals.
$1,500 if all responsibilities, as determined by APS, are carried out.
* AP Coordinators.
$500 stipend if all responsibilities as determined by APS are carried out.
Nomination, screening and selection criteria are summarized in Exhibit 2-50.

COMMENDATION
DISD works with businesses and organizations to provide opportunities to increase the number of Advanced Placement courses offered, teachers trained and students enrolled.
FINDING
The share of DISD students identified as gifted and talented significantly exceeds the share of its population that most research indicates is gifted in one or more areas.
DISD's high G/T enrollment appears to be due not to the percentage used to ensure appropriate racial/ethnic ratios in the program, but to the student identification procedures being used.
In 1999-2000, 32,052 students were enrolled in DISD G/T programs.
In all, 17 percent of elementary students, 32 percent of middle school students and 30 percent of high school students were identified as G/T (Exhibit 2-47).
As shown in Exhibit 2-51, DISD's percentage of total student enrollment served in G/T programs was higher than all the peer districts, nearly double the Region 10 percentage, and more than double the state percentage.
The percentage of teaching staff allocated to G/T programs, by contrast, was second-lowest among the peer districts and lower than the Region 10 and state averages.
The percent of budgeted instructional expenditures dedicated to G/T programs was higher than four of the peer districts and the state average but about the same as the Region 10 average.
