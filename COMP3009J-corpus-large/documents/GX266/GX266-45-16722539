APPENDIX C GOOD COMPOUNDING PRACTICES (a) A pharmacist may compound drugs in limited quantities before receiving a valid prescription drug order if the pharmacist has a historical basis of valid prescription drug orders generated solely within an established relationship between the pharmacist, a patient, and a prescribing practitioner for the amount of drugs compounded.
Compounding drugs in an amount above that for which there is a historical basis is considered manufacturing.
Compounding includes the preparation (1) according to a prescription drug order of drugs or devices that are not commercially available; (2) of commercially available products from bulk when the prescribing practitioner has prescribed the compounded product on a per prescription basis and the patient has been made aware that the compounded product will be prepared by the pharmacist.
When a compounded product is to be substituted for a commercially available product, both the patient and the prescribing practitioner must authorize the use of the compounded product.
The pharmacist shall document these authorizations on the prescription drug order or in the computerized patient medication record.
The prescribing practitioner's authorization is in addition to signing to permit substitution on a prescription drug order or advising verbally that substitution is permitted.
The reconstitution of commercially available products according to the manufacturer's guidelines is permissible without notice to the prescribing practitioner.
A pharmacist may not offer compounded drug products to prescribing practitioners, pharmacists, or pharmacies for resale except in the course of professional practice for a prescribing practitioner to administer to an individual patient.
The distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded products without a relationship between the pharmacist and the prescribing practitioner and patient is considered manufacturing.
A pharmacist may receive, store, and use drug substances for compounding prescriptions that meet official compendia requirements.
A pharmacist shall use the pharmacist's professional judgment to receive, store, and use drug substances for compounding prescriptions not found in official compendia.

The procedures must be followed in the execution of the drug compounding procedure.
A pharmacist shall accurately weigh, measure, or subdivide as appropriate the components for drug product compounding.
The compounding pharmacist shall check these operations at each stage of the compounding process to ensure that each weight or measure is correct as stated in the written compounding procedures.
If a component is transferred from the original container to another container, the new container must be identified with the component name and the weight or measure.
To assure the reasonable uniformity and integrity of compounded drug products, written procedures must be established and followed that describe the tests or examinations to be conducted on the product compounded.
The control procedures must be established to monitor the output and to validate the performance of those compounding processes that include the following when appropriate: (1) capsule weight variation; (2) adequacy of mixing to assure uniformity and homogeneity; (3) clarity, completeness, or pH of solutions; A pharmacy engaging in compounding shall establish and follow appropriate written procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of compounded drug products purporting to be sterile.
The procedures must include validation of any sterilization process.
For the purpose of compounding in quantities larger than required for immediate dispensing by a prescriber or for future dispensing upon prescription, a pharmacy shall maintain records that include (1) the date of preparation; (2) the lot number - the lot numbers may be the manufacturer's lot numbers or new numbers assigned by the pharmacy.
If a lot number is assigned by the pharmacy, the pharmacy shall record the original manufacturer's lot numbers and expiration dates, if known.
If the original manufacturer's lot numbers and expiration dates are not known, the pharmacy shall record the source and acquisition date of the components; (3) the expiration date of the finished product - this date may not exceed 180 days or the shortest expiration date of any component in the finished product unless a longer date is supported by stability studies in the same type of packaging as furnished to the prescriber or to be stored in until dispensing.
