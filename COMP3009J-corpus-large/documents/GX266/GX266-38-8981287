A Message from N.C.
I n s u ran ce Commis s i on er Jim Long Dear Consumer: The North Carolina Department of Insurance is proud to present the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide.
This guide has been compiled by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to assist prospective residents in their search for a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) in North Carolina.
CCRCs are unique to the area of long-term care in that they provide a continuum of care to older adults under a contract for the life of an individual, or for a period longer than one year.
Continuing care laws in North Carolina are designed to give you, the consumer, full disclosure concerning a community prior to the execution of a contract for continuing care.
These laws exist for your benefit.
I urge you to read the disclosure statement and the contract provided to you by a continuing care provider, and to ask questions if you are unsure of any of the provisions contained within them.
If necessary, seek professional advice from an attorney and/or accountant.
If you have any questions, please contact the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section of the North Carolina Department of Insurance at (919) 733-5633, extension 249 or 268.
Sincerely, Jim Long Commissioner C OVER STORY For the first time, the North Carolina Department of Insurance held a Cover Art Contest for the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide.
Contestants were restricted to residents of continuing care retirement communities licensed and regulated by the North Carolina Department of Insurance.
Each entry was requested to exemplify, in some manner, life at a continuing care retirement community.
Artwork had to be of the contestants own creation, and could not be copied or duplicated from previously published artwork.
Photography was not allowed.
Each entry also had to be accompanied by a short description describing how the artwork related to the contest theme.
The winning entry was selected based on artistic quality, tastefulness, reproducibility, and depiction of theme.
Winning Entry: Artist: Kitty O'Meallie (also known as Kitty Johnson) Title of Work: "...So Blessed..."
Type of Medium: Pencil and Pastel Community: Glenaire Artist's Description: She's 101, predictable pains.

"Don't call us a Nursing Home", they say, "We are truly BLESSED!" In addition to Ms. O'Meallie (Johnson), The North Carolina Department of Insurance would also like to thank each of the following individuals who participated in the Cover Art Contest: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

SHIIP stands for Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program.
SHIIP is a consumer information division of the North Carolina Department of Insurance that helps Medicare beneficiaries and their families with Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance questions.
How does SHIIP work? SHIIP provides education and assistance to North Carolinians in three ways: ! by operating a Toll Free consumer information phone line, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. ! by training volunteer senior citizens to counsel other seniors within their community about Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance, and ! by offering educational materials for consumer's use and speaking to civic, community, church and other groups about Medicare and other senior health issues.
When was SHIIP started? The program was founded in 1986 by Insurance Commissioner, Jim Long, in direct response to the growing concerns about health insurance for the more than 800,000 senior citizens in North Carolina.
More than 70 different insurance companies sell Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice, long-term care insurance and other medical insurance products to seniors in North Carolina.
Because there are so many companies, and because the Medicare system is so complex, Commissioner Long says he felt there needed to be an objective information service for senior consumers, so he founded SHIIP.
How do North Carolinians contact SHIIP? You can contact SHIIP by dialing the Toll Free consumer line, 1-800-443-9354 or by visiting the website at www.ncshiip.com.
There are also trained SHIIP volunteer counselors in all 100 counties of North Carolina who are coordinated through an existing human service agency such as the Council on Aging or the Cooperative Extension in each county.
If your problem is too complex to handle over the phone, you will need to contact your local SHIIP coordinator for a one-on-one appointment with a SHIIP volunteer.
Can I get more information on SHIIP? Yes! Call SHIIP at 1-800-443-9354 and ask for more details on the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program and how it can help you.
