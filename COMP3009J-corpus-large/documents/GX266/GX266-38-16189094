Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection Positions on Issues Affecting the Wisconsin Dairy Industry Introduction Dairying is the cornerstone of W isconsin agriculture and the state's most recognizable industry.
Wisconsin dairying transmits nationally and internationally an image of a wholesome and quality lifestyle.
W isconsin cheese denotes something special simply by its origin.
The state's natural resource base is conducive to the economic husbandry of dairy cattle.
The intensity of the industry has traditionally provided for competitive marketing and readily available, high-quality and abundant producer services.
For most of the 20th century, W isconsin commanded the premier position in total milk production, dairy cattle and farm numbers.
However, in the past decade, W isconsin's position has declined.
This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors: changing demographics, federal farm policies that favored other regions, lack of new investment, and risk reluctance.
Other geographical areas, primarily the West, have outdistanced W isconsin competitively by producing milk at a lower per unit cost on the average, although it is recognized that W isconsin's top producers can compete with producers in any other major dairying region.
Reversing this trend toward reduced market share and lower cow and farm numbers is critical to the overall economic and social viability of the entire state, and particularly its rural communities.
W hile a lot of effort has gone into promoting the state's "high-tech" sector, there's a growing realization that keeping the dairy industry viable is just as important for the long-term health of the state.
W isconsin's dairy industry generates nearly $20 billion a year for the state's economy, with $5.5 billion of that income coming from 128,000 dairy-related jobs.
DATCP cannot directly impact producer pay prices in a significant way.
However, it can assist other units of government and the private sector in creating a favorable climate for industry growth under diverse management systems.
DATCP is positioning itself to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advocate federal farm policies favorable to W isconsin producers, processors and marketers; Advocate modernization and expansion efforts that are economically sound, environmentally prudent and competitively advantageous; and Maintain programs of quality certification that enhance the value of the industry's investment with minimal business interference.
The following narrative establishes the positions DATCP believes its resources can be utilized to serve the intelligent best interest of W isconsin citizens in this important economic area.
The Wisconsin Dairy Landscape Dairy farm numbers in W isconsin continue to fall at a fairly constant rate.
Since temporarily stabilizing in the early 1980s, the number of herds in the state has fallen at an average annual rate of almost 1,400 per year -- 3.8 farms per day exited dairying between 1984 and 2002.
However, along with the trend toward fewer farms has come a trend toward larger herd sizes.
Cows per farm, which averaged just over 40 in the early 1980s, exceeded 70 in 2002.
In addition, the rate of increase in herd size has recently gone up.
The average annual increase has been over 3 cows per year since 1998.
This compares to just 1 cow per year for the years 1965 through 1997.

Milk per cow has gained an annual average 224 pounds since 1965, or about 1.8 percent per year.
However, the gain in milk per cow has been more than offset by a loss in cow numbers.
After more than 10 years of stable cow numbers in the 1970s and 1980s, cow numbers have fallen off by more than 38,000 per year since 1991! The result has been a flattening of W isconsin milk production.
Total milk peaked at 25 billion pounds in 1988, and has varied between 22 and 24 billion pounds since.
In the meantime, the state's share of U.S. milk production has fallen from 17 percent to 13 percent.

Herds in the 1-29 cow, 30-49 cow and 50-99 cow categories fell by 2,000; 3,700; and 1900; respectively, between 1997 and 2002.
There was no change in the number of herds with 100-199 cows, and the number of herds with more than 200 cows increased from 500 to 900.
This change in herd size distribution has created a related change in the percent of the state's milk supply coming from herds of different size.
Currently, herds of 1-99 cows, 100-200 cows, and 200+ cows each supply roughly one-third of Wisconsin milk marketed.
The percent of milk coming from herds in the 200-499 cow range more than doubled between 1997 and 2002, and the percent from herds of 500 cows or more increased three-fold.
Based on a producer survey in 2002, the W isconsin Agricultural Statistics Service (W ASS) projected that the changes in herd sizes observed since 1997 will continue, leading to fewer than 14,000 W isconsin herds in 2007.
Farms with fewer than 100 cows are projected to fall by 4,220.
But W ASS expects 620 more farms with 100 cows or more.
The total number of cows in the state is expected to increase by more than 150,000, resulting in total milk production of more than 26 billion pounds.
The following tables indicate the trends in herd size and distribution.

The W isconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection dairy plant list for 2001 counted 364 dairy plants in the state making a wide variety of products.
Dairy plants are widely-scattered throughout W isconsin.
The principal use of W isconsin milk is for cheese, which utilizes 80-90 percent of the state's milk.
Other major manufactured dairy products include butter, cottage cheese, and whey products.
Only about 6-8 percent of W isconsin milk is used for fluid milk products.
In 2002, W isconsin produced 2.2 billion pounds of natural cheese, with 26 percent of total U.S cheese production.
American and Mozzarella cheese accounted for over 2/3 of production.
But at least 50 identifiable cheese varieties are produced commercially in the state.
Specialty cheese production (defined generally as distinct "value-added" varieties with annual production volumes of less than 40 million pounds) is growing rapidly.
An estimated 250 million pounds of specialty cheese varieties were manufactured in the state in 2002, about 12 percent of total cheese production.
This is up from 4 percent in 1993.
Half of W isconsin's cheese factories produce one or more specialty varieties.
W isconsin also produces over 1 billion pounds of process cheese products annually, about half of U.S. production.
The number of cheese plants in W isconsin fell by about 60 percent between 1980 and 2002.
By variety, the largest decline was in cheddar cheese plants.
The number of plants making Mozzarella and other Italian cheese varieties remained relatively constant and plants making "other" varieties (mainly specialty cheeses) actually increased in number.
The consolidation in cheese making was accompanied by a substantial increase in average plant scale.
Average volume per plant nearly tripled in cheddar factories and grew by more than 4 times in Mozzarella factories.
Wisconsin Mozzarella production in 2002 was 748 million pounds, exceeding Cheddar production (686 million pounds) for the second year in a row.
Cheddar production was down nearly 18 percent from 1980, while Mozzarella was up more than 250 percent.
Demand for Mozzarella and other Italian cheeses has outpaced demand for cheddar cheese, and W isconsin cheese plants have altered production in response to these market signals.
Wisconsin is very close to being overtaken by California as the nation's top cheese state.
In 2002, Mozzarella production in the Golden State came close to exceeding Wisconsin production (697 million lbs. versus Wisconsin's 748 million).
California cheese production has been growing at a rapid clip since the mid-1990s, as several new cheese plants came on line.
In contrast, there has been little investment or reinvestment in W isconsin plants.

Fostering this development can instill new vitality into W isconsin agriculture, including dairy, and add to agriculture's total economic base.
In addition, encouragement of renewable energy production, especially electricity from methane digesters and wind can help add both economic and environmental value to W isconsin's dairy and agricultural systems.
Further development of the specialty cheese industry in W isconsin, which has grown by 6 percent annually in the last decade and now comprises 12 percent of all W isconsin cheese production, needs improvement.
Farmstead and artisan dairies (that consist of on-farm processing, micro cheese making under custom arrangements and the use of mixed species milks) are rapid growing.
If done with award winning standards, they represent the niche and value added areas that will keep W isconsin recognized as the innovative America's Dairyland.
DATCP Position: DATCP encourages diversification into industries compatible with dairying which can bring new vitality to Wisconsin agriculture, adding to the state's economic base.
DATCP supports development of alternative energy production which can add economic and environmental value to the industry.
In addition, DATCP supports the further development of Wisconsin's specialty cheese industry.
Federal Issues Federal Milk Marketing Orders Higher of Class I mover: Beginning in the early 1960s, the base ("mover") of Class I milk prices in all federal milk marketing orders was tied directly to the value of milk used for manufactured dairy products -- butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese.
The specific mover evolved over time, but a common principle was retained: Class I milk prices should reflect changing supply and demand conditions for milk used for manufacturing purposes.
As part of a set of federal order amendments effective January 2000, the Class I price mover became the "higher of" an advanced Class III skim milk price (milk used to make cheese) or advanced Class IV skim milk price (milk used to make butter and nonfat dry milk).
Adoption of this mover has partially decoupled Class I prices from supply and demand conditions.
Less than 10 percent of federal order milk is used for Class IV and about 45 percent for Class III.
But because of high butter prices relative to cheese prices (which lowers the Class III skim milk price) and a high support price for nonfat dry milk, Class IV has been the mover most of time -- 28 of the 36 months between January 2000 and December 2002 (The change in Class IV and Class III prices effective April 2003 changed this situation.
Please see page 11 for a discussion on Class III and Class IV for additional detail).
In effect, Class I prices have become tied to the government support price for nonfat dry milk, which most certainly does not reflect supply and demand condition for milk used for manufacturing.
The result has been that markets with relatively high Class I utilization are partially insulated from low milk prices.
Price signals to reduce milk production are restricted to cheese producing states like W isconsin and Minnesota.
This unfairly distributes the burden of adjusting supply to temporary milk surpluses and delays price recovery for all dairy farmers.
Recent actions to lower the support price on nonfat dry milk and raise the support price for butter (butter/powder tilts) have narrowed the differences between the Class III and Class IV prices and reduced the probability of the advanced Class III price consistently being the mover of Class I prices.
Still, the Class IV price was the mover in nine months of 2002, and averaged $0.42 higher than Class III.
This difference significantly benefits dairy producers in relatively high Class I markets and penalizes those in cheese producing states.
DATCP position: The "higher of mover" should be replaced with a weighted average of the advanced Class III and advanced Class IV price.
Weights should be proportional to the total quantity of federal order milk used for Class III and Class IV.
National pooling: Over the decade of the 1960s, federal orders east of the Rocky Mountains were amended to adopt a consistent set of Class I differentials that increased with markets' distance from Wisconsin and Minnesota.
The intent was to assure an adequate supply of Class I milk by simultaneously encouraging production of Grade A milk in local markets and partially compensating handlers in deficit markets for any needed movement of Grade A milk from the large reserve supply area of the Upper Midwest.
By the late 1980s, regional milk production patterns had changed and the Upper Midwest was no longer the only major reserve area for Grade A milk supplies.
In addition, modern transportation and packaging allowed for bulk milk and fluid milk products to economically move much greater distances.
Class I differentials based on distance from the Upper Midwest could no longer be justified.
Indeed, Class I differentials higher than necessary to attract adequate supplies of Class I milk were encouraging unneeded Grade A milk production, which in turn, depressed cheese prices and milk prices paid to Midwest dairy producers.
Upper Midwest dairy interests have been pursuing modernization of the Class I differential structure since 1990.
But administrative, legal and legislative efforts have yielded only modest changes.
Federal order reform effective January 2000 resulted in some flattening of Class I differentials, but differentials still range from $1.60 in the Upper Midwest order to $3.15 in the Northeast order and as high as $4.30 in the Florida order.
The only significant benefit to the Upper Midwest from the federal order reform was more liberal pooling.
W ith only minimal milk shipping requirements, dairy plants could associate, or "pool" a portion of their dairy producers' milk with any one of the 11 federal orders.
The combination of using the "higher of" mover and higher Class I differentials provided an incentive for Upper Midwest milk handlers to pool milk under distant orders, particularly the Mideast and Central Orders.
By pooling in these federal order markets having both higher Class I differentials and Class I utilizations, Upper Midwest handlers receive a greater revenue pool draw from the markets.
These additional revenues allowed Upper Midwest dairy producers to more equitably share in the higher valued Class I markets.
However, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has recently ruled against the more liberal pooling standards in decisions from several federal order hearings.
Higher performance standards for pooling have been implemented in the Central Order and similar actions are expected in other orders.
These higher performance standards make it difficult for Midwest dairy cooperatives to pool milk on other orders and, as a result, dairy producers are not able to more equitably share in the higher valued Class I markets.
DATCP position: Because of the inability to change Class I differentials to reflect a modern dairy industry, DATCP strongly supports the initial provisions contained in the 2000 federal order reform on pooling.
We believe that the intent of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 was for dairy producers to equitably share in the revenues of federal orders, and that the burden of surplus milk (milk in excess of Class I needs and a reasonable reserve) should also be shared equitably.
We further believe that national pooling of all federal order receipts represents the most equitable means of sharing the benefits and burdens of providing an adequate supply of fluid milk.
Class III and Class IV prices: The federal order reforms implemented in 2000 created four uniform classes of milk across all orders and adopted product price formulas for calculating class prices.
Prices for all classes of milk are tied to monthly or 2-week average prices for butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk, and dry whey.
The product price formulas adopted for Class III and Class IV (which are the foundation for Class I and Class II) contained manufacturing allowances and assumed yield factors that were controversial.
Accordingly, Congress mandated USDA to hold hearings and make related adjustments to the formulas.
Hearings were held in May 2000, and after several delays and an injunction, USDA issued a final decision on new formulas that are to become effective for milk priced in April 2003.
The formula changes will increase Class III prices about 20 to 30 cents per hundredweight, reduce Class IV prices about 10 to 15 cents per hundredweight, and leave Class I and Class II prices essentially the same.
There will be little if any effect on producer prices in the Upper Midwest.
Since manufacturing plants in the Midwest pay producers prices above the established minimum Class III and Class IV prices, there is no impact on the cost of raw milk to the plants.
But since the selling price of cheese is not affected, the increase in the minimum Class III price reduces the flexibility of plants to pay an individual producer additional premiums for milk quality, milk composition, volume of milk or other characteristics.
While the new Class III and Class IV pricing formulas are not a major issue in the Midwest, there is concern about having two separate manufacturing classes.
W ith fixed make allowances at levels that yield profits to reasonably efficient plants, there is limited incentive for manufacturing plants to allocate milk to highest and best use.
DATCP position: DATCP supports the new Class III and Class IV formulas implemented on April 1, 2003.
However, DATCP recommends merging Class III and Class IV into one manufacturing class.
This would increase the incentive for plants to allocate milk to the highest and best use.
It would also eliminate the concern over the "higher of" the advanced Class III or Class IV price as the mover of Class I. Dairy Policy Milk Income Loss Contract Payments: The 2002 Farm Bill makes direct payments (Milk Income Loss Contract payments) to all U.S. dairy producers based on the Boston Class I milk price relative to $16.94 per hundredweight.
If the Boston Class I price is less than $16.94, the payments are 45 percent of the difference.
Payments are monthly from December 2001 through September 2005 on the first 2.4 million pounds of annual milk marketed (October 1-September 30).
About 85 percent of W isconsin's dairy producers fall under the 2.4 million pound cap.
The Milk Income Loss Contract payments (MILC) have provided most W isconsin dairy producers with much-needed relief from severely depressed farm level milk prices all of 2002 and now into 2003.
But despite these benefits, the MILC program poses some issues as a longterm dairy policy.
MILC may actually delay a recovery in farm level milk prices by maintaining cow numbers and milk production that would otherwise have exited in the short run.
W ith the 2.4 million pound annual cap, herds with more than 130 cows, many of which are recently expanded operations carrying relatively high debt, receive limited benefit from MILC.
Moreover, a stronger safety net than relying only on the relatively low $9.90 per hundredweight support price is preferred over direct payments by most dairy producers.
Until the safety net for dairy producers is strengthened, there is support for extending the MILC beyond September 30, 2005.
DATCP position: DATCP supports the development of long-term dairy policy that provides an effective income safety net and is equitable to all dairy producers.
Until an acceptable alternative is developed and implemented, the Midwest strongly supports an extension of the payments beyond September 30, 2005.
Dairy price support program: The current support price for manufacturing use milk is $9.80 per hundredweight (for milk with a 3.5 percent butterfat test).
USDA implements the support program by standing ready to purchase butter, nonfat dry milk and cheddar cheese at prices that allow manufacturers to pay the support price for milk.
The purchase program is failing to maintain a floor price of $9.80 per hundredweight for manufacturing use milk during periods of surplus.
The Class III price was below support for 7 months during 2000.
In November of 2000, the Class III price was $8.57 per hundredweight, $1.23 below support.
The Class III price was below support for 3 months in 2002 and for the first two months of 2003.
The Class III price has been below support primarily because cheese prices have fallen well below their respective CCC purchase prices.
During 2000, 40-pound cheddar block and barrel prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were under their CCC purchase prices in 8 months and 6 months, respectively.
The gap was as much as 9.6 cents per pound.
In 2002, CME prices were below support in 4 months for blocks and in 3 months for barrels.
In midFebruary 2003, CME 40-pound blocks dropped to $0.9925 per pound, nearly 14 cents below support.
W hile NASS survey cheese prices -- not CME prices -- are used to calculate the Class III price, NASS prices average only one or two cents above CME prices.
Reasons most often cited for cheese prices falling below support are a lack of federal graders to grade cheese for sale to the CCC and extra costs of selling to the CCC because of nonstandard packaging and delays in receiving government payments.
There is an added concern that with the fixed manufacturing allowances used in the component pricing formulas for the Class III price, there is no strong incentive for a cheese plant to sell to the CCC plants receive the same margin whether they sell to commercial traders or the CCC. DATCP position: Since the CME is viewed as a market of last resort, its use to establish market clearing prices for cheese is questionable.
If the CME continues to be the price-setting vehicle for most cheese sales, then the CCC should stand ready to purchase cheese at support prices either directly or through brokers on the CME.
In the longer term, DATCP would support the exploration of possible change in the current price support program from a CCC purchase program to a direct payment program to dairy farmers.
The direct payment would be the difference between the existing $9.80 per hundredweight support price, or another support level, and the announced Class III price.
This would make the dairy price support program more consistent with the support program for grains and oilseeds.
Dairy Compacts: There is disturbing interest to re-establish the New England Dairy Compact and to expand compacts to other states.
The renewed interest in dairy compacts is being fueled in part by concerns over the MILC payments.
W ith farm level milk prices much lower than anticipated when the MILC program was approved by Congress in May 2002, per hundredweight payments and budget exposure have been very high.
The projected budget for the life on the MILC payments was $1.3 billion.
Since implementation, over $2.0 billion has been spent with current projections between $4.0 and $5.0 billion for the life for the program.
This large budget outlay makes the possibility of extending the MILC payments beyond the expiration date of September 30, 2005, very questionable.
Compacts establish a relatively high floor price for Class I milk thereby de-coupling the Class I market from market forces during periods of lower milk prices.
This encourages milk production among producers located within the compact states.
The additional milk production is utilized in manufactured dairy products, driving down the price of cheese, butter and other manufactured dairy products.
Consequently, dairy compacts are particularly harmful to manufacturing milk use states like W isconsin.
W ith more than 80 percent of the milk supply used for cheese that competes for distribution on a national market, little gain would be had from Midwest states forming a dairy compact.
DATCP position: Dairy compacts are harmful to Wisconsin dairy producers because they decouple the Class I market in compact states from market forces and encourage unneeded milk production in those states.
This leads to increased production of cheese and other dairy products, lowering dairy product prices and farm level milk prices to Wisconsin dairy producers.
Therefore, DATCP strongly opposes the re-authorization of the New England dairy compact and the expansion of compacts to other states.
Dairy imports Liberalization of world trade in dairy products is a two-edged sword.
Reduced border protection under the 1994 World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement has benefited Upper Midwest dairy farmers somewhat through increased exports of whey products and specialty cheeses.
NAFTA has eliminated tariffs on all dairy products (except nonfat dry milk) exported to Mexico, further enlarging foreign markets for U.S. dairy products.
At the same time, the W TO agreement required the U.S. to expand market access for cheese, which has lead to major increases in U.S. cheese imports.
The U.S. was the world's largest importer of cheese in 2002.
The 500 million pounds imported represented 5.7 percent of domestic cheese use.
The WTO also had the unexpected effect of expanding imports of MPC and other forms of dry milk protein that were not covered by tariff-rate quotas negotiated by the U.S. MPC imports displaced an estimated 427 million pounds of nonfat dry milk in 2002, nonfat dry milk that ended up in government warehouses and added considerably to the cost of the dairy price support program.
Expanded commercial exports of U.S. dairy products are hampered by vast quantities of subsidized exports dumped on world markets, mainly by the EU but also by other countries.
Seventy percent of the EU's 1 billion pounds of cheese exports in 2002 were subsidized.
W hile the U.S. subsidizes some exports through the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), limits on subsidized exports assigned to the EU under the WTO are 4 times the DEIP limit for nonfat dry milk, 13 times for butter, and 107 times for cheese.
Clearly, the playing field is not level.
New W TO negotiations are occurring now.
The official document on agricultural trade calls for a doubling of current market access for dairy products.
This would allow foreign suppliers 10 percent of the U.S. cheese market.
W ithout major cut-backs in export subsidies -- something the EU appears unwilling to allow -- this volume would quickly be filled by subsidized exports that would displace domestic cheese production.
DATCP position: DATCP believes Wisconsin can compete effectively in world markets and we welcome free trade as long as it is fair trade.
DATCP strongly opposes high export subsidy limits for the EU if we are being asked to open our borders to foreign suppliers of dairy products.
Further, the Dairy Price Support Program cannot operate if the U.S. becomes the dumping ground for subsidized exports.
Products purchased by the CCC -- and close substitutes like MPC -- must have effective tariff-rate quotas.
Further, DATCP supports negotiating terms of dairy trade only through WTO and multilateral forms, not through individual country bilateral agreements such as those being considered for Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand.
Standards of Identity and Product Labeling FDA has established standards of identity for cheese and other manufactured dairy products.
These standards pertain to ingredients used in the products and procedure for making the product.
The composition of cheeses with an FDA standard of identity must conform to minimum butterfat, protein and other- solids-not-fat percentages.
Further, only certain cheese making technologies are allowed.
For example, FDA has given only limited approval to using ultra-filtered milk in cheese making.
Milk protein concentrates (MPCs) may not be used in these standardized cheeses, but they can be used to make non-standardized cheeses.
These FDA standards are important in maintaining the integrity of standardized cheeses.
A related issue is the labeling of manufactured dairy products.
For the protection of both dairy product manufacturers and consumers, there should be no confusion in the market place as to whether or not a dairy product possesses an FDA standard of identity.
For non-standardized dairy products, consumers should have the opportunity to see listed on the package label those ingredients that are not permitted in standardized products DATCP position: FDA standards of identity for manufactured dairy products should be strictly enforced.
However, as new technology is developed that improves the efficiency of manufacturing a given dairy product without altering quality, the FDA standard should be carefully reviewed and changed, if appropriate.
Non-standardized dairy products should be labeled as such and list ingredients not permitted in standardized products.
The country of origin should be listed on all imported dairy products sold to consumers.
Regulatory Issues Land Use and Siting A threat to the retention and modernization of dairying in W isconsin is the expanded use of agricultural lands for non-farm purposes.
In the last half century, over one-third of W isconsin's agricultural lands have been converted to urban development and roadways.
Among the nation's most threatened areas of farmland loss are the Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison corridor and W isconsin counties adjacent to Minnesota's Twin Cities.
Currently, there is a myriad of federal, state and local farmland preservation programs designed to segregate lands for use in the modernization and incremental expansion of production dairying.
It is also recognized there exists numerous regulatory mandates administered by various state and local governmental authorities that make for differing legal interpretations and an uneven response to stakeholder requests.
DATCP's responsibility is to assist dairy farmers in economically enhancing their enterprise regardless of the husbandry model they invoke, so long as the natural resource base is preserved and/or enhanced.
The W isconsin economy will be well-served by having more cows profitably producing more milk.
The state's natural resource base is conducive to such an objective.
Many states are currently experiencing gridlock between dairy farmers and other interests that are restricting the use of long-established and acceptable dairy farm practices, and discouraging modernization and incremental expansion.
DATCP believes W isconsin can grow its dairy industry while retaining its appealing topography.
DATCP position: DATCP is the state's lead agency in representing agricultural interests and advancing accepted science-based economic and social policies that create opportunity for its stakeholders.
DATCP supports the expansion of the Wisconsin Ag Stewardship Initiative and the Discovery Farms initiative.
To represent its constituency, the agency will engage personnel and advance programs to educate, organize and assist potential investors of financial and human capital.
DATCP will be a source of science-based knowledge and regulating protocols that promote modernization and incremental expansion while holding the natural resource base harmless.
Further, the department will work with national, state and local agencies, and private organizations that hold responsibility for the purchase of development rights, easements, stewardship and other conservation initiatives to ensure production dairying can operate without major conflict.
Dairy Food Quality and Safety Ensuring the quality and safety of W isconsin-produced and marketed dairy products is a paramount responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
In accepting this responsibility, the department provides education and consultation on issues of quality and quantity, and enforces regulations through the dairy production and marketing chain.
Annually, the food safety division administers about 35,000 inspections of dairy producers, transportation expeditors, processors and retailers.
The food safety division strives to maintain and enhance the image that W isconsin produced and marketed dairy products are of high quality and readily accepted in national and international trade.
An increasing portion of the food safety program is supported through industry-assessed program revenues.
W hen new science adaptation and logistical changes can be made to improve program efficiencies and/or enhance service, they are considered through consultation.
DATCP position: Maintain a nationally and internationally respected food safety and security program that adds value through the dairy food chain.
To dispatch its duties, the division must maintain a critical mass of competent and highly trained personnel and have monies available to utilize state-of-the-art monitoring equipment.
Agricultural Producer Security DATCP administers W isconsin's agricultural producer security program to protect agricultural producers from catastrophic financial defaults by dairy, grain and vegetable contractors.
This program secures over $4 billion in payments to producers each year.
The program reduces financial risks, and thus promotes producer, business and investor confidence.
It also promotes sound business practices that can help keep W isconsin agribusiness viable.
It is designed to accomplish these goals at a reasonable cost, in a fair and minimally intrusive manner.
DATCP once held over $170 million in security from individual dairy, grain and vegetable contractors.
Contractors who failed to meet minimum financial standards (even by one penny) were required to file security, while others filed no security at all (and hence were not secured if they defaulted).
Large security demands sometimes precipitated financial defaults.
Individual security filings tied up hundreds of millions of dollars in working capital that could have been used to modernize these key industries.
In 2002, DATCP implemented major new "indemnity fund" legislation to replace the old "all or nothing" security program.
Under the new program, most contractors contribute to the indemnity fund (contributions are based on size, financial condition and risk behavior).
The fund operates like an insurance program with affordable premiums adjusted to risk.
By "pooling" the risk in this manner, the new program promises better security for producers at a lower cost to contractors.
DATCP has already returned approximately $70 million in security to individual businesses, and will return about $90 million more when the new program is fully implemented.
That frees millions of dollars in working capital to industries that are struggling to upgrade and meet competition from outside the state, and it is coming at a critical time.
The affected industries and farm groups strongly support the new program.
But additional legislation is needed to get it fully implemented.
The indemnity fund can cover most normal defaults, but the current law also requires DATCP to obtain a "backup" bond to cover very large defaults that exceed the fund capacity.
DATCP has not been able to acquire a backup bond, because of current disarray in the insurance industry (related to September 11, the Enron and WorldCom collapses, stock market declines and other factors).
DATCP position: DATCP has prepared legislation to authorize an alternative form of backup security--namely a "line of credit" (repayable from the indemnity fund) that DATCP could draw upon to cover a major default.
This legislation will be a high priority for agricultural groups.
When DATCP acquires backup security for the fund, it will be able to release an additional $90 million in security to individual contractors (who are also contributing to the fund).
Animal Health DATCP's primary animal health responsibility is to monitor and, if found present, eradicate diseases that threaten human health and the viability of the livestock industry.
Diseases of greatest concern to the dairy industry are foot and mouth, tuberculosis, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (BSE), Johne's and brucellosis.
Keeping the dairy industry free of these diseases not only protects producer on-farm investment, but allows for free flowing interstate and international commerce.
The animal health division advances its mission by establishing animal health standards and procedures; maintaining surveillance of the industry as it relates to health and trade issues; and invokes the force of law in the control and eradication of identified problems.
It is imperative that the division have seamless working relationships with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of USDA and the W isconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, a unit of the University of W isconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine.
It is anticipated that the division will be requested to take an active role in programming that addresses biosecurity and homeland security.
Livestock food marketers via consumers are becoming more concerned about the ability to trace the food supply from producer to the end purchaser.
The animal health division, singularly and in cooperation with the industry, must increase its capacity to trace the origin of animals producing meat and milk entering the human food chain.
DATCP position: DATCP is committed to modernizing and expanding the dairy industry through increased cow numbers and greater profitability per unit.
An important component in achieving this objective is a healthy dairy herd.
The expansion of the industry and the additional duties associated with bio-terrorism and homeland security dictates that the division be given the qualified personnel and support necessary to discharge its duties.
State and Local Government Assistance Retaining and building on the dairy industry's important role in the W isconsin economy depends on reinvestment at both the producer and plant level.
After 15 years of declining national market share in milk and cheese, there are significant threats to the state's entire dairy infrastructure.
W ithout modernization and reinvestment, W isconsin's industry could lose "critical mass" and enter a rapid downward spiral.
This presents high stakes questions to W isconsin: How important is the dairy industry to the state overall? Is the state willing to proactively shape its future? Other states are working to grow their dairy industries, and growth will go elsewhere if W isconsin is passive.
In recent years W isconsin has enjoyed significant modernization at the farm level.
Early planning grants through the Dairy 2020 program have helped focus on modernization plans.
Nearly 1 billion pounds of milk supply has been added via the funded projects and dairy farmers have invested significant capital in those projects.
Dairy processors in W isconsin remain short of producer milk.
Processors are obtaining supplemental supplies of milk and milk components from other sources in order to operate plants at fuller capacity.
The Milk Volume Program, launched in 2002 by the Department of Commerce, was designed to add milk cows and milk production in W isconsin.
Still, W isconsin is not adequately positioned to take advantage of growing national markets.
The following state and local efforts would help create an improved climate and stimulus for dairy reinvestment and growth.
Health Care The high cost and low accessibility of health insurance is a large and growing problem for small businesses generally, but especially for farm families because of the high risk of the occupation.
Many farm families are spending between $750 and $1000 per month for limited health insurance coverage.
According to UW 's Program on Agricultural Technology Studies, 20 percent of dairy farm families are completely uninsured and another 25% have at least one uninsured family member.
Four out of five dairy farm families have no preventative care coverage.
DATCP position: Any action by the state to lower health care costs and improve access will release family farm resources for other purposes, including reinvestment in farming.
Among the needed actions are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Improve access to Badger Care by removing depreciation as an income component in the eligibility requirements.
Create mechanisms for expanding insurance pools to spread out the risks of insuring farmers.
Promote regional and community collaboration to expand access to health care, especially preventative care, in rural areas (example: cooperative health care demonstration projects in rural areas).
Rural Finance Authority There should be a single financing authority at the state level to address a range of credit and development needs for agriculture, including dairy.
Current financing programs are housed at WHEDA and the Department of Commerce, which makes it difficult to coordinate and focus on changing agricultural credit needs.
A dedicated authority will help farmers and lenders crossutilize state and federal financing programs.
The authority should have flexibility to change programs in response to changing needs.
The design elements of the new authority should include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Direct lending for farm purchasing and farm improvements targeted to early-stage and limitedequity borrowers.
Guarantees for operating loans and equity gaps.
Guarantees for new environmental management technologies such as manure digesters.
Guarantees for value-adding enterprises.
Ability to deploy federal funding opportunities, including grants and loans, for agricultural development.
Ability to aggregate equity capital for longer-term equity investments in family farm businesses to help farmers meet profitability and lifestyle needs.
DATCP position: There should be a single financing authority at the state level to address a range of capital and developmental needs for dairy and agriculture, with design elements as listed above.
Investment Incentives Tax credits can be an effective economic development tool to stimulate and support investment and reinvestment within an industry.
These credits can take the form of credits to an individual's income taxes for eligible investments, either directly or in conjunction with an enterprise zone.
A properly structured investment tax credit, whether direct or tied to a development zone, should result in a net tax gain for the state over the life of the investment.
Local use of tax incremental finance could also provide property tax revenue over the life of the improvement that exceeds the tax reduction.
Additional tax receipts should also be gained from the increased farm income associated with investment.
For example, Steve Deller, Professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics, estimates that a $1 increase in farm income results in an additional $1.50 of earnings in non-farm households, which should trigger increased tax returns to state and local governments.
Such investment tax credits can stimulate investment in dairy equipment and facilities that boost milk production and improve farm profitability.
DATCP position: There should be tax credits and TIF financing made available to stimulate investment and reinvestment within the dairy industry, and in the long run, provide increased net tax revenues to state and local governments.
Business Evaluation Grants There should be expanded authorities and resources for assisting farmers to improve profitability as well as modernization.
Grants to fund diagnostic teams in Minnesota have helped dairy farms improve profitability, within the context of their current operation, and to assist with modernization projects.
Using grants to stimulate more innovation within current farms as well as for modernization would provide necessary reinforcement of reinvestment and financing incentives.
Utilizing consultants and other technical resources to fulfill plans and farm family business objectives is often an underutilized vehicle in economic development.
DATCP position: There should be expanded authorities and resources for assisting farmers to modernize and improve profitability.
Youth and Young Farmer Apprenticeships Wisconsin needs a more comprehensive effort and program tailored to meet the career development of prospective and new farm entrants.
A public-private partnership could provide access to learning experiences and mentors that would help young farmers evolve their businesses.
A partnership between DATCP, USDA-FSA, SBA-SCORE, UW Extension, and farm organizations could train and sponsor volunteers to help provide information and support to young farmers, and could help develop and expand apprenticeship opportunities.
DATCP position: A public-private partnership should be developed to ensure that farmers have access throughout their lives to learning experiences and mentors, that can help them improve or grow their businesses.
Public-Private Partnerships Budget constraints and DATCP's responsibility for the management of numerous mandated programs make it imperative for the agency to coordinate its programming with the private sector and other units of government.
In dairy, cooperatives partnering with other cooperatives and/or proprietary interests, has had a direct impact on industry efficiency at the processing and marketing level.
The end result has been greater viability for the cooperative business and its producer investors.
Wisconsin dairying is also impacted by the activities of government agencies like the W isconsin departments of Commerce and Natural Resources, the University of W isconsin and W isconsin Technical College Systems, the Farm Service Agency, and the Natural Resource Conservation Service.
DATCP recognizes the importance of maximizing the use of the financial and human resources available through the development of well-coordinated mutually beneficial alliances.
DATCP position: DATCP will support and encourage cooperative-to-cooperative and cooperative to proprietary partnerships that provide the opportunity to grow the industry.
Further, the agency will place heavy emphasis on partnering with other units of government that extend services to dairying.
