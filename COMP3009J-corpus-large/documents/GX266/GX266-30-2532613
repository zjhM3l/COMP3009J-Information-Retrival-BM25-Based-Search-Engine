December 2002 PTPB Commuter Bill Richardson Announces Plan to Promote a Balanced Transportation System for New Mexico On October 14, 2002, New Mexico Governor-elect Bill Richardson spoke at the Randall Davey Audubon Complex in Santa Fe.
During this speech, he presented some of his plans to address transportation issues in New Mexico.
The remarks are excerpted below.
"I want to talk to you about public transportation and the role I believe it could play in our lives.
There is no question that New Mexico is challenged geographically, and some use that as an excuse to say public transportation won't work here.
Yet we are one of only four states in the nation that does not invest any state revenues into public transit.
"New Mexico needs a balanced approach to transportation, one that embraces buses and bikes as well as roads and highways.
"First, we need Park-and-Ride transit systems for three major routes in New Mexico.
New Mexico is unique in that we have major employment centers with welldeveloped commuter routes.
There are three that immediately come to mind.
First, Santa Fe and EspaÃ¯Â¿Â½ola to Los Alamos.
Second, Albuquerque and Rio Rancho to Santa Fe.
And, finally, El Paso and Las Cruces to White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo.
Thousands of New Mexicans drive these routes every day-- mostly alone in their cars--to and from a central location where they work.
"Today, I'd like to focus on one of these corridors-- as an example of what we should be considering statewide.
Just last week the State began reconstruction of a 12-mile section of U.S. Highway 84/285 between Santa Fe and Pojoaque.
Over 40,000 vehicles--including 2,500 Los Alamos Lab employees--use this stretch of road every day.
Experts say traffic volume will increase to 80,000 by 2015.
"
Z-Trans is Expanding! Z-Trans, a division of Zia Therapy Center, Inc., began providing public transportation in Alamogordo in November of 2001.
As Governor, I know how to work with Congress, and we will immediately investigate the matching funds that might still be available from the federal government.
"We should be researching commuter systems in the other two corridors as well--in Central and Southern New Mexico.
And I will ask the [New Mexico State Highway and Transportation] Department immediately to provide accurate and updated feasibility studies that will help us move these projects forward.
"Second, I will support enabling legislation for Regional Transit Authorities so communities can build effective transit systems and access federal funds.
New Mexico's current complex transportation system demands improved coordination and regional cooperation.
New Mexico must develop both intermodal and multimodal transportation systems that are sensitive to community needs.
That is why I support enabling legislation to form Regional Transit Authorities.
"The development of Regional Transit Authorities will allow the state to maximize potential state and local funding and gain greater access to federal transportation dollars.
Through these regional authorities, we will provide improved mobility, economic opportunity, and environmental quality."And third, I believe that New Mexico deserves an assessment of our future transportation plans to ensure NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION U.S. POSTAGE PAID ALBUQUERQUE, NM PERMIT NO. 39 that they are balanced and diverse.
We are facing some serious challenges during the next four years.
Eight years ago we had $0 in highway debt.
Today it's well over $1 billion.
Quite frankly, as the Albuquerque Journal pointed out recently, "the highway credit card is maxed out."
Transportation funds will be tighter than ever, and that means we have to be clear about our priorities and put the maintenance and upgrading of existing roads as the first place we spend scarce resources.
"We need a state transportation department that focuses on a multimodal system, not just highways.
I will promote new kinds of technology to make our cars more efficient.
We have promising fuel cell technology being developed here in New Mexico at our own national labs and state universities.
I have also proposed a gross receipts tax credit and exemption from registration fees for people who purchase hybrid cars.
I've said we need to leverage federal funds to build more natural gas and fuel cell service stations on Interstates 25 and 40 and promote New Mexico as part of the National Clean Corridor Program.
"As we work with local communities to fund road and highway projects, we need to encourage bike trails, pedestrian paths, and construction techniques that help save water and protect our environment.
And we need to have more collaboration at the grassroots level to make sure that we preserve the cultural and historic landscapes in which the roads are built.
"This takes more work, more time, and more listening, but it's worth it in the end.
What you're hearing from me today is that we need a change of philosophy when it comes to moving people around and through our great state.
We know that we can't just build our way out of congestion.
We need to consider all the transportation alternatives that are available to us.
There's so much more that we can do.
We can get more creative and set our goals so much higher.
That's the kind of approach you'll find under my administration, and I know that New Mexico will be better for it."

4 Getting from Here to There By DeAnza Valencia and Andrea Broaddus For the sake of our own health and the health of the environment, we all ought get involved in pressing for alternatives to traditional car-oriented transportation systems.
Each year, citizens pay about $120 billion in federal, state, and local taxes to build and maintain the nation's streets, roads, highways, sidewalks, and bus, train, and bicycle facilities.
Where does the money go, and how do those investments work to serve our communities? For example, New Mexico has done little more with its federal money than bond itself into debt to build new roads; ignoring its future financial needs to maintain and repair current roads; and giving slight attention or investment to public transit, light rail, bikeways, and other transportation alternatives.
These questions are central to the national debate now in progress over the reauthorization of a major transportation law, TEA-21, set to expire in 2003.
Historically dominated by the drive to complete interstate highways and please local politicians with road projects in their districts, transportation policy must now, by law, include the voices of an increasingly concerned public.
Two top players in the national debate over transportation investments--U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) and Democratic N.M.
Rep. Tom Udall--will be in Albuquerque on Saturday.
They will participate in a transportation issues forum at 10:00 a.m. at the University of New Mexico Continuing Education Center.
The forum is sponsored by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, 1000 Friends of New Mexico, the Alliance for Transportation Research Institute at UNM and The Great American Station Foundation.
We encourage you to attend, learn more, and voice your views.
Blumenauer is the congressional leader and spokesman for the Livable Communities movement, which helps ensure that communities are safe, healthy, and economically secure through policies that encourage smart growth, environmental responsibility, economic vitality, and more diverse transportation and housing choices.
There are increasing signs in the media that public opinion on transportation is shifting as the burden of our car-oriented system takes its toll on individuals and families, including in unforeseen ways.
Obesity, for example, is reaching epidemic proportions, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and by our organization, the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which found the problem more pronounced in metropolitan areas where people walk less.
Likewise, asthma is now the leading chronic illness among youths, with kids who breathe smoggy, polluted air the more likely victims, according to a study done at the University of Southern California.
Our unbalanced transportation system also puts a disproportional burden on low-income families.
Households in the lowest income bracket spend 39 percent of their income on transportation, most of it on automobiles.
The necessity of car ownership makes it harder for working families to afford a home.
A study by STPP and the Center for Neighborhood Technology found that households in places with few travel choices can spend $1,200 to $6,000 more per year on transportation than comparable households in places with more opportunities to take transit, use bikes, or walk.
In several national public opinion polls, between sixty and eighty percent of Americans favored investments that expand transportation alternatives.
For instance, a poll by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 2001 showed that 60 percent of Americans favor building transit, bikeways, and sidewalks.
People are also voting with their feet.
Transit ridership has increased steadily since 1996, and at a faster rate than driving.
More people are riding transit systems today than at any time since the 1940's.
Investing in transportation choice is extremely popular.
Last year, hundreds of citizens worked to create a statement of principles for what transportation should do for communities
.
It is called the New Transportation Charter.
The four core principles outlined in the New Transportation Charter should serve as the priority goals and outcomes for the $200 billion in federal investments that will be made under TEA-3: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Signing on to the Alliance for a New Transportation Charter at www.antc.net.
Get involved with your local transportation reform group.
Write to your member of Congress about TEA-3.
And remember, as a user of the transportation system, you are an expert.
Your needs matter.

STPP is a national coalition working for transportation policies and investments that protect neighborhoods, increase access to goods and services, promote social equity, preserve the environment, strengthen the economy and improve quality of life.
It has offices in Albuquerque, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, California.
Reprinted from The Albuquerque Tribune, Insight and Opinion, October 24, 2002.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Enhance public health, safety, and security.
Sustain economic prosperity.
Promote social equity and livable communities.
And, improve energy use and environmental protection.
The Alliance for a New Transportation Charter is a national network of over 500 state and local organizations working to alter federal, state, and local transportation policy and practice to reflect these principles.
This includes groups concerned with environmental quality, such as the Sierra Club; groups concerned with social equity, like the NAACP; public health guardians such as the American Heart Association; and groups concerned with the health of our cities, such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
The New Transportation Charter represents a promise to utilize the power of transportation investments to reach broader community goals and outcomes.
Thus the question "What are we getting for our money?" must be answered in TEA-3.
While TEA21 represented a 40 percent increase of federal funding--the largest public works spending bill ever enacted--there has not been a similar increase in performance.
Traffic congestion is the No. 1 problem in many metro areas, but throwing more money at the problem has not solved it.
Our streets and sidewalks are in urgent need of repair.
Transit systems are struggling to expand and meet the growing demand.
Pedestrian fatalities have not decreased.
The public deserves a better return on its investment.
STPP has identified four main challenges that Congress must address, as TEA-3 is drafted: Navajo Transit System to Participate in Transportation Program The Navajo Transit System (NTS) has been selected as one of only three tribal communities in the nation to participate in the Tribal Passenger Transportation Technical Assistance Program, which will also include developing a thirty year plan.
This program is funded by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA).
Through this program, the NTS and CTAA will be working to develop improved and expanded transportation services for both the general public and clients of agencies on the Navajo Reservation.
A three year plan, funded by the Arizona DOT, was needed to review, refine, and prioritize the service expansion proposed by NTS and to identify additional funding to support the highest priority elements.
The three-year plan will run jointly with the long-range plan.
From this plan, a technical proposal was presented at meetings on July 18 and September 27, 2002, in Window Rock, Arizona.
Attendees included the Navajo Nation's Transportation Advisory Committee, consultant, Rick Evans, of RAE Consultants, Inc., and representatives from New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona.
One of the top priorities is to expand service.
The Navajo Nation occupies nearly 27,000 square miles; and since 1980, NTS has functioned as an intercitytype service, linking distant portions of the Nation.
The average route is over 60 miles.
Approximately 47% of the current potential ridership cannot be reached, and only several links to large cities are available.
Another top priority is to renovate maintenance facilities.
Currently, there are only two vehicle bays for 15 buses and vans, and the taller buses cannot fully enter the bays for repairs.
Maintenance is, therefore, done out-of-doors throughout the year.
Perry Yazzie, Director of the Navajo Nation Transit System, has recommended several potential sources of funding, including a minimal amount of Section 5311 funding from Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico; and Section 5309 funding from the Federal Transit Agency.
Mr. Yazzie is interested in hearing from anyone who has funding ideas or would like to share experiences.
Please contact him at (928) 729-4111.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Require accountability and reward performance by measuring effectiveness in terms of public health, air quality, social equity, land-use impacts, and create incentives for success.
Fix it first: Favor systems repair, management, and choice over new road capacity.
Create better choices and build livable communities by redirecting investment to support existing communities and transportation choices.
Learn to serve people: Require transportation providers to address community needs, involve stakeholders in decisions early and meaningfully, and follow the intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ We invite you to join the struggle by: From the Office of the Bureau Chief Josette Lucero November 2002 The Public Transportation Programs Bureau (PTPB) is proud to announce that they have entered into an agreement with Lazaro and Noel to assist the Bureau in enhancing the safety and quality of transportation services throughout the State of New Mexico.
Lazaro and Noel will provide technical assistance and driver training to all 5311, 5310, and welfare to work transportation providers in the State.
They will also work closely with the PTPB and the New Mexico State Transportation Association (NMPTA) and will train all subgrantees that receive funding from the PTPB.
Some of the training opportunities include: Ream Lazaro, who will be the project manager, has done work for the PTPB for approximately ten years.
He is familiar with Bureau staff and many of the subgrantees and has developed not only a working relationship with them, but has gained their trust and respect.
Mr. Lazaro, prior to being a consultant, was involved in human resources, safety, and training for three large urban transportation authorities.
Since becoming a consultant, he has directed safety, training, and organizational development efforts in forty states.
He has served as the lead trainer and consultant for the Community Transportation Association of America.
Collectively, the principals of Ream Lazaro and Michael R. Noel have over fifty years of experience in operations, maintenance, system safety, management, and organizational development.
Lazaro and Noel will only offer service that they have the legitimate expertise to perform and will soon be coming to a site near you.
For more information, contact the PTPB at 505-827-1577.
Building Livable Communities Public transportation not only provides personal mobility, but also can contribute to the quality of life in communities.
Metropolitan growth and resulting sprawl development patterns have led to increasingly longer trips, poor pedestrian access, traffic congestion, and adverse environmental impacts.
These factors are diminishing quality of life in the nation's communities and reducing effective and efficient operation of public transportation systems.
Every community is different; each has a unique mix of strengths, challenges, and values.
While there is no cookie cutter approach, advocates for livable communities focus on broad agreement about the elements of a livable community and provide the flexibility they need to make the local plans and decisions to achieve that vision.
One of the goals of livable communities is to strengthen the link between transit and communities by improving personal mobility, transportation system performance, and the quality of life in communities.
This goal can be accomplished by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Driver training System safety and security Customer service and satisfaction Drug and alcohol compliance Operational policies, procedures, and structure Leadership development Team empowerment and problem solving Strategic and business planning Service design and delivery Community and political relations Ã¯Â¿Â½ Strengthening the link between transit planning and community planning, including land use policies and urban design supporting the use of transit, and ultimately providing physical assists that better meet community needs; Stimulating increased participation in the decision-making process by community organizations, minority and low-income residents, small and minority businesses, persons with disabilities, and the elderly; Increasing access to employment, education facilities, and other community destinations through high quality, community-oriented, and technologically innovative transit services and facilities; and Leveraging resources available through other federal, state, and local programs.New Freedom Initiative Progress Report Released President Bush announced the New Freedom Initiative on February 1, 2001, as part of a nationwide effort to remove barriers to community living for people with disabilities.
Today, there are more than 54 million Americans living with a disability, representing a full 20 percent of the U.S. population.
Almost half of these individuals have a severe disability affecting their ability to see, hear, walk or perform other basic functions of life.
The New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan that represents an important step in working to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to learn and develop skills, engage in productive work, make choices about their daily lives and participate fully in community life.
The Initiative's goals are to: persons with disabilities.
This competitive grants program funds additional transportation services to jobs and job training sites and addresses unmet needs of persons with disabilities.
[Past recipients of these funds in New Mexico include the City of Santa Fe, City of Las Cruces Transit Department, and the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department.]
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase access to assistive and universally designed technologies Expand educational opportunities Promote homeownership Integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce Expand transportation options Promote full access to community life The Department of Transportation created an interagency working group to coordinate the numerous Federal programs that fund transportation for persons with disabilities.
The working group has produced a resource guide identifying Federal programs that fund transportation for persons with disabilities.
The guide also includes examples of best practice transportation services in getting persons with disabilities to work and employment support services that local officials can use in city planning.
The document is available on the Internet at www.projectaction.org/fundguide/ fundguide.htm, or by contacting Project ACTION at 1-800-659-6428.
In March 2002, the Federal Transit Administration and Project Action held a National Dialogue on Accessible Transportation to foster communication between the transit industry and the disability community in identifying accessibility issues and creative, effective solutions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½
Enhancing personal mobility while building stronger, more vibrant communities will both build transit patronage and improve the quality of life.
Community-sensitive facilities make consumer information readily available, help consumers feel safe and secure, ensure sufficient open space, provide pedestrian and bicycle access, and manage parking carefully.
Community-oriented transit facilities and services are the result of coordinated community-based planning and people-oriented design

The report also outlines next steps that the administration will take toward meeting the New Freedom goals.
Innovative Transportation Solutions Transportation is an integral part of the New Freedom Initiative.
New Freedom Initiative policies seek to test new transportation ideas and develop partnerships to increase access to alternate means of transportation.
Transportation accomplishments outlined in the progress report include: Next Steps The progress report notes that the President will seek authorization to establish the Department of Transportation's New Freedom Initiative program and request $145 million in FY 2003 for a competitive grants program to provide additional transportation services for job access and a pilot program to demonstrate innovative solutions for transportation problems still faced by persons with disabilities.
The President's FY 2003 budget expands the funding for the Job Access and Reverse Commute program to the full authorization level of $150 million, an increase of $50 million since the President took office.
This program includes job-related transportation services for people with disabilities.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Department of Transportation, through its Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, has funded over 200 state and local grantees in 44 states to provide new employment transportation services for low-income persons, including The PTPB Commuter is on the Internet at: ptpb.nmshtd.state.nm.us/publications.asp Voters Show Approval for More Mass Transit by Judith Espinosa, Director, ATR Institute/UNM Hank Dittmar, President, Great American Station Foundation The need for mass transit has gained the support of voters.
Miami and Las Vegas voters recently approved new taxes for mass transit.
The tax that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in Miami will double the bus fleet, give senior citizens free rides, construct a light rail for easy access to the airport, and create a regional transportation authority.
After several measures were rejected three years ago, a committee formed to create a new plan which was named "People's Transportation Plan".
The plan passed with over 70% support.
Similarly in Las Vegas, Nevada, a tax that called for a significant expansion of mass transit and road improvement was strongly supported.
The plan included measures for improving air quality and was greatly advocated by businesses, transportation, and environmental groups including the Sierra Club.
Interestingly, Virginia, Washington, and California rejected a similar tax because the percentage of the new tax designated for mass transit was too little.
The diminutive percentages of 13 to 15 percent of the tax for mass transit were heavily criticized by smart growth advocates and environmental and community groups.
The lack of support in these states also indicates how strong public sentiment has become for transit related initiatives.
A recent report by the national Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP), "Measuring Up: The Trend Towards Voter-Approved Transportation Funding," finds that the failure to increase traditional "user fee" revenues to keep pace with inflation is part of the reason for the shift towards voter-approved general taxes (see www.transact.org).
Obviously, voter approved taxes will garner consumer support, since they reflect the will of the community and can be viewed as providing policy-makers with a broad support base.
The report recommends that there be: (1) a broader public involvement in the initial development of local transportation ballot measures; (2) an end to the "trust us" approach of failing to specify projects or dedicate locked-in funding categories; (3) an elimination of restrictions on the expenditure of state gasoline taxes on public transit; (4) the development of better performance measures and statistical analysis to substantiate promised benefits from funding measures; and (5) more emphasis on coordinated land-use planning and growth management as part of larger transportation ballot measures.
Research and understanding on how new transportation taxes are viewed by the voters and the public are generally critical in assisting policymakers to create and evaluate future ballot measures.
Transparency by policymakers on how transportation taxes and fees will be used can help to improve greater public involvement in developing local transportation measures, substantiating evidence to support the benefits of funding, and emphasizing the coordination of land-use planning and growth in conjunction with transportation.

Espinosa and Hank Dittmar are both Board Members of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a national transportation advocacy group supporting transportation policy and investments to conserve energy, protect environment, strengthen the economy, promote social equity, and make communities more livable.
Z-Trans is Expanding! Z-Trans, a division of Zia Therapy Center, Inc., began providing public transportation in Alamogordo in November of 2001.
In March 2002 a public meeting was held to solicit input from the public on what changes they felt needed to be made in the system.
The changes that were implemented as a result of that first public meeting resulted in a 25% increase in ridership.
With the support of the Public Transportation Programs Bureau, Zia will be greatly expanding public transportation in Alamogordo by November 2002.
Transportation to and from Holloman Air Force Base will be included as well.
Another public meeting was held in September 2002, this time to solicit input into this significant expansion of services.
While the original services covered the City of Alamogordo, the actual overage was not as convenient as people would have liked.
In addition to expanding the coverage area, the bus and vans will run more frequently, making Z-Trans much more convenient for the public as well as responding to the demand from Holloman.
On December 10 Zia will be hosting a Commuter's Choice workshop in conjunction with the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce Business Support Committee to encourage employers to utilize this transportation concept.
Santa Fe Trails Begins New Transit Service On November 9, Santa Fe Trails began delivering new transit service to the Santa Fe community.
Some of the new services included more frequent service on Cerrillos Road, on Airport Road to Vista Primera, and to Santa Fe Community College; all day service to Tierra Contenta; new service on East Alameda Street; and Sunday service on the Aqua Fria, Cerrillos, and Southside routes.
The new routes and schedules were designed to make the bus system more effective in serving the transit needs of the community.
To help pay for the revised and expanded service, the Santa Fe City Council approved a fare increase that will occur in two phases.
The first phase went into effect on September 2, 2002, while the second phase will start on March 3, 2003.
If you have any questions about the service changes or would like to receive the new schedule book, call Santa Fe Trails at 505 9552001.
Candidates Show Increasing Support For Transportation Funding and Public Transit According to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), a recent survey reports that over 90 percent of the 2002 congressional candidates show great support for increasing transportation funding and are strong advocates for developing nationwide public transit.
The survey was conducted by the Center for Transportation Excellence.
Of the 114 congressional responding candidates, 96 percent reported that public transit is essential to a balanced transportation system.
More than 90 percent of respondents support additional federal financing as well as funding guarantees for transportation and highway projects which help to ensure stability for long term infrastructure needs in transportation programs.
APTA president William W. Millar commented, "This survey shows that candidates are aware that investing in public transportation has become a national priority, particularly as the economy slows, traffic congestion and air pollution increase, security concerns heighten and our population ages."
The candidates surveyed offered four primary reasons for their support of public transportation: promotion of economic growth (82 percent), reductions in congestion (81percent) and pollution (74 percent) and energy savings (72 percent).
The results of this survey are particularly significant because the new Congress will be dealing with a major transportation-funding package next year.
The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), which is currently in effect, expires September 30, 2003, and requires reauthorization by Congress.
Public transportation advocates are calling for doubling the annual federal investment in transportation over the next six years to meet the imperative needs of the present and the changing needs of the next decade.
Millar reported that a great majority of respondents are on record supporting public transportation "as an essential long-term component of a balanced transportation system".
TEA 21 has a breadth of support that is represented by the comments of candidates from both parties.
U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) wrote, "I support renewing TEA 21.
This program has been beneficial in the advancement of rural and urban public transportation programs in Kansas."
U.S. Rep. Ronnie Shows (D-MS) stated "Transportation and infrastructure are the foundation of the economy in rural Mississippi."
