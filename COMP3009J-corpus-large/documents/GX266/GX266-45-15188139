(21) "Residential cooperative" means a cooperative consisting of cooperative units, any of which are intended for use as a private residence.
A cooperative is not a residential cooperative if the use of the units is intended as primarily commercial or industrial and not more than three units are intended to be used for private residence, domicile, or homestead, or if the units are intended to be used as housing for maintenance, managerial, janitorial, or other operational staff of the cooperative.
If a cooperative is a residential cooperative under this definition, but has units intended to be commercial or industrial, then the cooperative is a residential cooperative with respect to those units intended for use as a private residence, domicile, or homestead, but not a residential cooperative with respect to those units intended for use commercially or industrially.
With respect to a timeshare cooperative, the timeshare instrument as defined in s. 721.05 shall govern the intended use of each unit in the cooperative.
(23) "Timeshare estate" means any interest in a unit under which the exclusive right of use, possession, or occupancy of the unit circulates among the various purchasers of a timeshare plan pursuant to chapter 721 on a recurring basis for a period of time.
Section 2. to read: 719.107 Subsection (1) of section 719.107, Florida Statutes, is amended Common expenses; assessment.--
(1)(a) Common expenses include the expenses of the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of the cooperative property; costs of carrying out the powers and duties of the association; and any other expense, whether or not included in this paragraph, designated as common expense by this chapter or the cooperative documents.
(b) If so provided in the bylaws, the cost of a master antenna television system or duly franchised cable television service obtained pursuant to a bulk contract shall be deemed a common expense, and if not obtained pursuant to a bulk contract, such cost shall be considered common expense if it is designated as such in a written contract between the board of administration and the company providing the master television antenna system or the cable television service.
The contract shall be for a term of not less than 2 years.
1.
Any contract made by the board after April 2, 1992, for a community antenna system or duly franchised cable television service may be canceled by a majority of the voting interests present at the next regular or special meeting of the association.
Any member may make a motion to cancel the contract, but if no motion is made or if such motion fails to obtain the required majority at the next regular or special meeting, whichever is sooner, following the making of the contract, then such contract shall be deemed ratified for the term therein expressed.
2.
Any such contract shall provide, and shall be deemed to provide if not expressly set forth, that any hearing impaired or legally blind unit owner who does not occupy the unit with a nonhearing impaired or sighted person may discontinue the service without incurring disconnect fees, penalties, or 4 CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

subsequent service charges, and as to such units, the owners shall not be required to pay any common expenses charge related to such service.
If less than all members of an association share the expenses of cable television, the expense shall be shared equally by all participating unit owners.
The association may use the provisions of s. 719.108 to enforce payment of the shares of such costs by the unit owners receiving cable television.
(c) If any unpaid share of common expenses or assessments is extinguished by foreclosure of a superior lien or by a deed in lieu of foreclosure thereof, the unpaid share of common expenses or assessments are common expenses collectible from all the unit owners in the cooperative in which the unit is located.
(d) With respect to each timeshare unit, each owner of a timeshare estate therein is jointly and severally liable for the payment of all assessments and other charges levied against or with respect to that unit pursuant to the cooperative documents, except to the extent that the cooperative documents provide to the contrary.
This paragraph does not apply to any unit that is not committed to a timeshare plan.

719.114 Separate taxation of cooperative parcels; survival of contractual provisions after tax sale.-- (3) Cooperative property divided into timeshare estates shall be assessed for purposes of ad valorem taxes and special assessments as provided in s. 192.037.
Section 4.
Section 719.3026, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:
719.3026 Contracts for products and services; in writing; bids; exceptions.--Associations with less than 100 units may opt out of the provisions of this section if two-thirds of the unit owners vote to do so, which opt-out may be accomplished by a proxy specifically setting forth the exception from this section.
(1) All contracts as further described herein or any contract that is not to be fully performed within 1 year after the making thereof, for the purchase, lease, or renting of materials or equipment to be used by the association in accomplishing its purposes under this chapter, and all contracts for the provision of services, shall be in writing.
If a contract for the purchase, lease, or renting of materials or equipment, or for the provision of services, requires payment by the association in an amount which in the aggregate exceeds 5 percent of the association's budget, including reserves, the association shall obtain competitive bids for the materials, equipment, or services.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the association to accept the lowest bid.
(2)(a)1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, contracts with employees of the association, and contracts for attorney, accountant, architect, community association manager, timeshare management firm, engineering, and landscape architect services shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.

A contract executed before January 1, 1992, and any renewal thereof, is not subject to the competitive bid requirements of this section.
If a contract was awarded under the competitive bid procedures of this section, any renewal of that contract is not subject to such competitive bid requirements if the contract contains a provision that allows the board to cancel the contract on 30 days' notice.
Materials, equipment, or services provided to a cooperative pursuant to a local government franchise agreement by a franchise holder are not subject to the competitive bid requirement.
A contract with a manager, if made by a competitive bid, may be made for up to 3 years.
A condominium whose declaration or bylaws provides for competitive bidding for services may operate under the provisions of that declaration or bylaws in lieu of this section if those provisions are not less stringent than the requirements of this section.
(b) This section does not limit the ability of an association to obtain needed products and services in an emergency.
(c) This section does not apply if the business entity with which the association desires to enter into a contract is the only source of supply within the county serving the association.
Section 5. to read: 719.401 Subsection (1) of section 719.401, Florida Statutes, is amended Leaseholds.--
(1) A cooperative may be created on lands held under lease or may include recreational facilities or other common elements or commonly used facilities on a leasehold, if, on the date the first unit is conveyed by the developer to a bona fide purchaser, the lease has an unexpired term of at least 50 years.
However, if the cooperative constitutes a timeshare cooperative created pursuant to chapter 721, the lease must have an unexpired term of at least 30 years.
If rent under the lease is payable by the association or by the unit owners, the lease shall include the following requirements: (a) The leased land must be identified by a description that is sufficient to pass title, and the leased personal property must be identified by a general description of the items of personal property and the approximate number of each item of personal property that the developer is committing to furnish for each room or other facility.
In the alternative, the personal property may be identified by a representation as to the minimum amount of expenditure that will be made to purchase the personal property for the facility.
Unless the lease is of a unit, the identification of the land shall be supplemented by a survey showing the relation of the leased land to the land included in the common areas.
This provision shall not prohibit adding additional land or personal property in accordance with the terms of the lease, provided there is no increase in rent or material increase in maintenance costs to the individual unit owner.
(b) The lease shall not contain a reservation of the right of possession or control of the leased property by the lessor or any person other than unit owners or the association, and shall not create rights to possession or use of the leased property in any parties other than the association or unit 6 CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

LAWS OF FLORIDA
Ch. 2000-302
owners of the cooperative to be served by the leased property, unless the reservations and rights created are conspicuously disclosed.
Any provision for use of the leased property by anyone other than unit owners of the cooperatives to be served by the leased property shall require the other users to pay a fair and reasonable share of the maintenance and repair obligations and other exactions due from users of the leased property.
(c) The lease shall state the minimum number of unit owners that will be required, directly or indirectly, to pay the rent under the lease and the maximum number of units that will be served by the leased property.
The limitation of the number of units to be served shall not preclude enlargement of the facilities leased and an increase in their capacity, if approved by the association operating the leased property after unit owners other than the developer have assumed control of the association.
This paragraph does not apply if the lessor is the Government of the United States or the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof or any agency or any political subdivision thereof.
(d)1.
In any action by the lessor to enforce a lien for rent payable or in any action by the association or a unit owner with respect to the obligations of the lessee or the lessor under the lease, the unit owner or the association may raise any issue or interpose any defenses, legal or equitable, that he or she or it may have with respect to the lessor's obligations under the lease.
If the unit owner or the association initiates any action or interposes any defense other than payment of rent under the lease, the unit owner or the association shall, upon service of process upon the lessor, pay into the registry of the court any allegedly accrued rent and the rent which accrues during the pendency of the proceeding, when due.
If the unit owner or the association fails to pay the rent into the registry of the court, it shall constitute an absolute waiver of the unit owner's or association's defenses other than payment, and the lessor shall be entitled to default.
The unit owner or the association shall notify the lessor of any deposits.
When the unit owner or the association has deposited the required funds into the registry of the court, the lessor may apply to the court for disbursement of all or part of the funds shown to be necessary for the payment of taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance and operating expenses, and other necessary expenses incident to maintaining and equipping the leased facilities or necessary for the payment of other expenses arising out of personal hardship resulting from the loss of rental income from the leased facilities.
The court, after an evidentiary hearing, may award all or part of the funds on deposit to the lessor for such purpose.
The court shall require the lessor to post bond or other security, as a condition to the release of funds from the registry, when the value of the leased land and improvements, apart from the lease itself, is inadequate to fully secure the sum of existing encumbrances on the leased property and the amounts released from the court registry.
2.
When the association or unit owners have deposited funds into the registry of the court pursuant to this subsection, and the unit owners and association have otherwise complied with their obligations under the lease or agreement, other than paying rent into the registry of the court rather than to the lessor, the lessor cannot hold the association or unit owners in default on their rental payments nor may the lessor file liens or initiate 7 CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

foreclosure proceedings against unit owners.
If the lessor, in violation of this subsection, attempts such liens or foreclosures, then the lessor may be liable for damages plus attorney's fees and costs which the association or unit owners incurred in satisfying those liens or foreclosures.
3.
Nothing in this paragraph shall affect litigation commenced prior to October 1, 1979.
(e) If the lease is of recreational facilities or other commonly used facilities that are not completed, rent shall not commence until some of the facilities are completed.
Until all of the facilities leased are completed, rent shall be prorated and paid only for the completed facilities in the proportion that the value of the completed facilities bears to the estimated value, when completed, of all of the facilities that are leased.
The facilities shall be complete when they have been constructed, finished, and equipped and are available for use.
(f)1.
A lease of recreational or other commonly used facilities entered into by the association or unit owners prior to the time the control of the association is turned over to unit owners other than the developer shall grant to the lessee an option to purchase the leased property, payable in cash on any anniversary date of the beginning of the lease term after the 10th anniversary, at a price then determined by agreement.
If there is no agreement as to the price, then the price shall be determined by arbitration.
This paragraph shall be applied to contracts entered into on, before, or after January 1, 1977, regardless of the duration of the lease.
2.
If the lessor wishes to sell his or her interest and has received a bona fide offer to purchase it, the lessor shall send the association and each unit owner a copy of the executed offer.
For 90 days following receipt of the offer by the association or unit owners, the association or unit owners have the option to purchase the interest on the terms and conditions in the offer.
The option shall be exercised, if at all, by notice in writing given to the lessor within the 90-day period.
If the association or unit owners do not exercise the option, the lessor shall have the right, for a period of 60 days after the 90-day period has expired, to complete the transaction described in the offer to purchase.
If for any reason such transaction is not concluded within the 60 days, the offer shall have been abandoned, and the provisions of this subsection shall be reimposed.
3.
The option shall be exercised upon approval by owners of two-thirds of the units served by the leased property.
4.
The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a nonresidential cooperative and shall not apply if the lessor is the Government of the United States or the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof or, in the case of an underlying land lease, a person or entity which is not the developer or directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the developer and did not obtain, directly or indirectly, ownership of the leased property from the developer.
(g) The lease or a subordination agreement executed by the lessor must provide either: 8 CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

1.
That any lien which encumbers a unit for rent or other moneys or exactions payable is subordinate to any mortgage held by an institutional lender, or 2.
That, upon the foreclosure of any mortgage held by an institutional lender or upon delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the lien for the unit owner's share of the rent or other exactions shall not be extinguished but shall be foreclosed and unenforceable against the mortgagee with respect to that unit's share of the rent and other exactions which mature or become due and payable on or before the date of the final judgment of foreclosure, in the event of foreclosure, or on or before the date of delivery of the deed in lieu of foreclosure.
The lien may, however, automatically and by operation of the lease or other instrument, reattach to the unit and secure the payment of the unit's proportionate share of the rent or other exactions coming due subsequent to the date of final decree of foreclosure or the date of delivery of the deed in lieu of foreclosure.
This paragraph does not apply if the lessor is the Government of the United States or the State of Florida or any political subdivision thereof or any agency or political subdivision thereof.

Such refund shall be made within 20 days of demand therefor by the purchaser or within 5 days after receipt of funds from the purchaser's cleared check, whichever is later.
For purposes of this subsection, the term "benefits made available under the plan" shall not include public offering statements or other documentation or materials that must be furnished to a purchaser pursuant to statute or rule.

The costs incurred by the affiliated exchange company shall be collected by the managing entity as the agent for the affiliated exchange company.
In no event shall the total costs to be assessed against the delinquent purchaser pursuant to this paragraph at any one time exceed 5 percent of the total amount of delinquency contained in the notice given to the delinquent purchaser pursuant to paragraph (b) per timeshare period or $15 per timeshare period, whichever is less.

The timeshare instrument shall allocate common expenses to timeshare interests periods owned or not yet sold by the developer on the same basis that common expenses are allocated to similar or equivalent timeshare interests periods sold to purchasers.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary, the allocation of total common expenses for a condominium or a cooperative timeshare plan may vary on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to, timeshare unit size, timeshare unit type, timeshare unit location, specific identification, or a combination of these factors, if the percentage interest in the common elements attributable to each timeshare condominium parcel or timeshare cooperative parcel equals the share of the total common expenses allocable to that parcel.
The share of a timeshare interest in the common expenses allocable to the timeshare condominium parcel or the timeshare cooperative parcel containing such interest may vary on any reasonable basis if the timeshare interest's share of its parcel's common expense allocation is equal to that timeshare interest's share of the percentage interest in common elements attributable to such parcel.
(2)(a) After the creation or provision of a managing entity, the managing entity shall make an annual assessment against each purchaser for the payment of common expenses, based on the projected annual budget, in the amount specified by the contract between the seller and the purchaser or in the timeshare instrument.

In the event of such a guarantee, the developer is obligated to pay all common expenses incurred during the guarantee period in excess of the total revenues of the timeshare plan.
Notwithstanding this limitation, if a developer-controlled owners' association has maintained all insurance coverages required by s. 721.165, the common expenses incurred during the guarantee period resulting from a natural disaster or an act of God, which are not covered by insurance proceeds from the insurance maintained by the owners' association, may be assessed against all purchasers owning timeshare interests on the date of such natural disaster or act of God, and their successors and assigns, including the developer with respect to timeshare interests owned by the developer.
In the event of such an assessment, all timeshare interests shall be assessed in accordance with their ownership interest as required by paragraph (1)(a).

Provided that a purchaser has been advised in writing at least 60 days prior to turning the matter over to a collection agency that the purchaser may be liable for the fees of the collection agency and a lien may result therefrom, any costs of collection, including reasonable collection agency fees and reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in the collection of a delinquent assessment shall be paid by the purchaser and shall be secured by a lien in favor of the managing entity upon the timeshare interest period with respect to which the delinquent assessment has been incurred.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in the contract between the seller and the purchaser, any common expenses benefiting fewer than all purchasers shall be assessed only against those purchasers benefited.
(5) Any assessments for common expenses which have not been spent for common expenses during the year for which such assessments were made shall be shown as an item on the annual budget.
(6) Notwithstanding any contrary requirements of s. 718.112(2)(g) or s. 719.106(1)(g), for timeshare plans subject to this chapter, assessments against purchasers need not be made more frequently than annually.
(7) A purchaser, regardless of how her or his timeshare estate or timeshare license has been acquired, including a purchaser at a judicial sale, is personally liable for all assessments for common expenses which come due while the purchaser is the owner of such interest.
A successor in interest is jointly and severally liable with her or his predecessor in interest for all unpaid assessments against such predecessor up to the time of transfer of the timeshare interest to such successor without prejudice to any right a successor in interest may have to recover from her or his predecessor in interest any amounts assessed against such predecessor and paid by such successor.
The predecessor in interest shall provide the managing entity with a copy of the recorded deed of conveyance if the interest is a timeshare estate or a copy of the instrument of transfer if the interest is a timeshare license, containing the name and mailing address of the successor in interest within 15 days after the date of transfer.

c. Failure of the managing entity to operate the timeshare plan in accordance with the timeshare instrument and this chapter.
If, under the circumstances, it appears that the events giving rise to the petition for receivership cannot be reasonably and timely corrected in a costeffective manner consistent with the timeshare instrument, the receiver may petition the circuit court to implement such amendments or revisions to the timeshare instrument as may be necessary to enable the managing entity to resume effective operation of the timeshare plan, or to enter an order terminating the timeshare plan, or to enter such further orders regarding the disposition of the timeshare property as the court deems appropriate including the disposition and sale of the timeshare property held by the association or the purchasers.
In the event of a receiver's sale, all rights, title, and interest held by the association or any purchaser shall be extinguished and title shall vest in the buyer.
This provision applies to timeshare estates and timeshare licenses.
