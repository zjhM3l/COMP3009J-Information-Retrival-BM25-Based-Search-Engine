Executive Summary During FY 2001-2002, the Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (GOSAP) extended its state-wide reach and, consistent with its statutory charge, established a solid foundation for maximum coordination of substance abuse prevention resources at the state, county and municipal levels of Virginia government.
GOSAP has provided technical assistance, program guidance, opportunities for interagency collaboration and financial support to scores of Virginia-based prevention programs serving dozens of communities and thousands of citizens in every area of the Commonwealth.
Among these major accomplishments have been: Launching the KIDsafe Virginia program to make the general public aware of the critical causal link between substance abuse and the incidence of crime in Virginia's communities, while taking the prevention message and safety education to children in every locality within the Commonwealth.
Working with James Madison University to provide technical assistance, training for substance abuse prevention professionals, and program guidance for applicants and recipients of funding under the State Incentive Grant or the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program.
Using a training curriculum developed under a grant to JMU, this innovative Capacity-Building Initiative conducted training for almost 300 individuals in 12 regional workshops, with a number of additional substance abuse prevention professionals completing these courses online.
Offering project-specific consultation and assistance for Second-Chance Grants.
This extra support of worthy projects and program proposals made the difference for applicants whose initial proposals were deemed technically insufficient, but whose proposed services were otherwise judged to be important for their local community's prevention efforts.
Redesign of the GOSAP Web site (www.gosap.state.va.us), to become a general information and advocacy resource for prevention professionals, youth and parents, while making substance abuse prevention information and services readily accessible for all Virginians.
Establishing a regional scope for the Youth Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Project (YADAPP).
YADAPP will be expanded to include youth leadership training opportunities in multiple regions throughout the Commonwealth.
Expansion of the State Incentive Grant Advisory Council, on which 40 member representatives from state and local government agencies, private companies, educational institutions, non-profit organizations and substance abuse experts regularly collaborate for the purpose of sharing "best practices."
This Council will be instrumental in development and implementation of GOSAP's State-wide Prevention Strategic Plan, to be published during FY 2002-2003.

Beginning in the late fall of 2002, GOSAP's state-wide reach was greatly expanded with implementation of the KIDsafe Virginia program, Governor Mark R. Warner's comprehensive approach to preventing substance abuse, enhancing the overall safety environment for young people, and imparting personal safety and crime prevention skills to all Virginia schoolchildren.
Using strategies of communication, education and collaboration with numerous new and existing programs operating throughout the Commonwealth, KIDsafe Virginia supplements ongoing prevention efforts and provides a central coordinating office at the highest level of government to ensure public awareness, community preparedness, citizen participation and parental involvement.
Key elements of KIDsafe Virginia include the involvement of teachers, school resource officers, administrators and law enforcement personnel in almost 1,900 Virginia public schools; the free public distribution of approximately 100,000 Child Identification DNA Kits by more than 160 automobile dealerships state-wide; a toll-free safety hotline for the public reporting of incidents and unsafe conditions that pose a threat to any child, school or community; an informative web site co-hosted with the GOSAP web site; an Internet accessible email box for receiving safety suggestions from Virginia's general public, and significant corporate underwriting for major program expenses.
Future Direction GOSAP will continue to support effective state and local prevention efforts through its two grant programs and its capacity-building initiatives.
Additionally, it will: Â· Conduct a substance abuse prevention program survey to more accurately document current prevention activities and assess costs, benefits and needs.
Findings will inform decisions about the coordination of prevention activities and priorities for resource allocation.
Complete and implement Virginia's strategic plan for substance abuse prevention.
Use of an interagency agreement will ensure coordination of prevention activities in accordance with Â§2.1-118, Code of Virginia.
Coordinate and expand Governor Warner's KIDsafe Virginia program.

Report of Activities of the Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention
Statutory Authority The Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (GOSAP) is authorized under Â§2.1-118, Code of Virginia, enacted by the 2000 General Assembly.
This annual report of activities is submitted in accordance with statutory requirements.
The statute sets forth the responsibility of the Governor "to administer the substance abuse prevention program within the Commonwealth and to authorize, direct, and coordinate activities of agencies of the Commonwealth in such program."
The responsibilities of the Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention are "to assist in the coordination of substance abuse prevention activities of the Commonwealth, review substance abuse prevention expenditures by agencies of the Commonwealth, and determine the direction and appropriateness of such expenditures."
The statute further specifies that "the Governor shall cooperate with federal, state and local agencies, private and public agencies, interested organizations, and individuals in order to prevent substance abuse within the Commonwealth."
In addition to its responsibilities for developing a more unified and effective approach to prevention at the state level, GOSAP also administers two major grant programs: the Governor's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program and the State Incentive Grant Program.
These federal funds, awarded to the Governor's Office, support numerous local prevention initiatives throughout the Commonwealth.
These grant programs and the many initiatives they support are described in greater detail in this report.
GOSAP Organization and Operation Governor Warner located GOSAP in the Office of the Secretary of Public Safety where it operates as a separate entity but utilizes available research and technology resources.
The location provides enhanced visibility and support for prevention strategies and emphasizes the important role of substance abuse prevention in the Commonwealth's overall public safety mission.
In April 2002, Governor Warner appointed Marilyn P. Harris as Assistant Secretary of Public Safety and Director of the Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention.

FUNDING GOSAP operations are maintained by two federal funding streams it manages: 1) the State Incentive Grant (SIG) awarded by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, a subsidiary of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and 2) the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (Governor's portion) authorized through the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, Title IV, Part A of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
For FY 2002-2003, GOSAP received $ 2,804,000 through the State Incentive Grant and $1,792,638 through the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program.
GOSAP Philosophy and Guiding Principles The Governor's Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (GOSAP) serves the citizens of the Commonwealth by collaborating with state agencies and private entities to coordinate Virginia's substance abuse prevention activities for efficient and effective use of resources.
Two federal grants that GOSAP administers support substance abuse and violence prevention efforts in communities across the Commonwealth.
Collaboration with active partners who coordinate prevention efforts at the state and local levels is central to the GOSAP mission.
Approaches used by GOSAP are informed by, and consistent with, emerging research that provides valuable insight into what practices do and do not work.
Prevention research has demonstrated the need for a strong prevention infrastructure at the state level, where efforts and resources can be best coordinated to achieve a more unified and effective approach.
GOSAP laid the foundation for a strong prevention infrastructure at the state level by establishing a GOSAP Collaborative and by actively building consensus around a strategic plan for prevention.
These activities are described in greater detail in this report.
Prevention research also supports the use of programs and strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective.
In its administration of both the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program and the State Incentive Grant
2
Project, GOSAP has awarded funding only for programs that have been demonstrated to be effective.
Furthermore, through these grant programs, GOSAP has promoted the use of community-based needs assessments and planning processes that contribute to the development of strong local prevention infrastructures.
Additionally, GOSAP has supported an ongoing training initiative designed to build prevention capacity throughout the Commonwealth.
Activities supported by these grant programs are described in this report.
Approaches The GOSAP Collaborative A GOSAP Collaborative has been established, comprising key leadership representatives from state agencies and organizations responsible for prevention.
Membership includes representatives from the Virginia Departments of Education, Social Services, Health, Alcoholic Beverage Control, Motor Vehicles, Juvenile Justice, Criminal Justice Services, and Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services.
The GOSAP Collaborative is undergoing expansion to include additional key prevention providers.
This leadership group provides valuable advisory consultation to the Governor's Office and serves as a primary vehicle for prevention collaboration among state agencies.
With consultation from the Collaborative, GOSAP will undertake a substance abuse prevention program survey to document current prevention activities and assess costs, benefits, and needs.
Collaborative Activities GOSAP has undertaken a variety of collaborative activities with other state agencies, including these: With the Department of Education...
Â· Â· Â· Developed a consolidated application to the U.S. Department of Education for Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act funding.
Funded a D.A.R.E. specialist position.

Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program Background The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 2001 (SDFSCA) is Title IV of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).
The purpose of the SDFSCA is to support programs that prevent violence in and around schools; prevent the illegal use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs; involve parents and communities; and are coordinated with related federal, state, school, and community efforts and resources.
By fostering a safe and drug-free learning environment, the SDFSCA supports student academic achievement.
SDFSCA funds have been allocated to Virginia since 1987 (previously under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act).
In accordance with the formula set forth in statute, 80 percent of Virginia's SDFSCA funds are administered through the Virginia Department of Education for grants to local school divisions, and 20 percent is set aside as Governor's SDFSCA funds.
The Governor's SDFSCA funds are to be used to implement drug and violence prevention activities, including: Â· Â· Â· activities that complement and support local educational agency activities, including developing and implementing activities to prevent and reduce violence associated with prejudice and intolerance; dissemination of information about drug and violence prevention; and development and implementation of community-wide drug and violence prevention planning and organizing.
GOSAP worked in partnership with the Virginia Department of Education to develop the SDFSCA portion of Virginia's consolidated application for NCLB funding from the U.S. Department of Education.
Under NCLB, a strong emphasis is placed upon well-coordinated, SDFSCA-funded program activities between each state's principal education agency and the Office of the Governor.
SDFSCA Principles of Effectiveness The Governor's SDFSCA awards must be based on "the quality of the program or activity proposed and how the program or activity meets the principles of effectiveness."
Funded Programs must comply with the SDFSCA Principles of Effectiveness that require each one of them to: Â· Â· be based on an assessment of data regarding the incidence of violence and illegal drug use in those schools and communities served; include an analysis of data on risk factors, protective factors, or other variables in the school and community;
5
Â· Â· Â· Â·
be based on an established set of performance measures aimed at ensuring that schools and communities served have a safe, orderly and drug-free learning environment; be based on scientifically based research that provides evidence that the program to be used will reduce violence and illegal drug use; include meaningful and ongoing consultation with parents in the development of the application and administration of the program or activity; and undergo periodic evaluation to assess progress toward reducing violence and illegal drug use, employing these evaluation results to refine, improve and strengthen programs.
SDFSCA Grants In July 2002, GOSAP awarded 35 competitive grants to public and private organizations serving 36 localities across the Commonwealth.
A list of SDFSCA awardees, localities served and brief project descriptions are included as Appendix A. Grants were awarded in four categories: 1.
Community Needs Assessment - Grants of up to $15,000 were awarded for the support of comprehensive community prevention needs assessments.
Communities awarded Needs Assessment Grants are collecting and using objective data from a variety of sources, determining the availability of prevention resources, and developing action plans based on actual needs.
Evaluation - Grants of up to $15,000 were awarded for a rigorous evaluation of an existing, well-established, locally developed program that has demonstrated some credible evidence of effectiveness.
Projects funded in this category use a very rigorous evaluation design to determine whether the program produces quantifiable outcomes.
Community Comprehensive Plan - Grants of up to $50,000 were awarded for the support of a community's comprehensive prevention plan.
The local plan developed by a local coalition/advisory council must have been based on a current needs assessment.
Continuation - A limited number of grants were awarded for the continuation of 2001 - 2002 Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities projects that had been successfully implemented and demonstrated preliminary evidence of effectiveness.

Grant-Writing Workshop and Technical Assistance In the spring of 2002, GOSAP conducted two "Successful Grant-Writing" workshops for agencies and organizations interested in applying for SDFSCA funds.
Workshops offered in collaboration with James Madison University's Office of Substance Abuse Research (OSAR) were conducted in Roanoke on April 15 and in Richmond on April 17.
Follow-up technical assistance has been provided to grantees to support the successful implementation of their projects.
Furthermore, in an effort to support localities in their prevention efforts, GOSAP provided technical assistance to those whose initial proposals were insufficient.
Following technical assistance, five "second chance" applicants were awarded funding based upon their improved project proposals.
Virginia State Incentive Grant Project Background In October of 2000, Virginia entered into a three-year cooperative agreement with the federal Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) and was awarded a $9 million State Incentive Grant (SIG).
CSAP's State Incentive Grant Program is intended to reduce substance abuse among 12- to 17-year-olds through prevention programs that have demonstrated effectiveness and have enhanced prevention systems at the state and local levels.
At the end of FY 2001, CSAP had awarded State Incentive Grants to a total of 41 states.
States awarded SIG funding are required to direct 85 percent of it to the implementation of local community projects; the remaining 15 percent of funding is to be used to coordinate prevention funding at the state level and to develop a state-wide prevention strategy.
The Virginia SIG Project uses a three-pronged approach, as described below: 1) providing grants to local community prevention coalitions, 2) directing a SIG Advisory Council that assists in the development of the strategic plan, and 3) managing a capacity-building initiative.
Grants to Local Prevention Coalitions In October of 2001, 20 local prevention coalitions were awarded three-year grants of up to $360,000 to implement model prevention programs, to implement environmental strategies to change local norms and policies related to alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, and to enhance local prevention planning efforts.
Funded local projects serve a total of 43 Virginia localities.
Brief project descriptions, and a list of all local SIG awardees and the communities served, are included as Appendix B.
7
GOSAP has provided ongoing technical assistance to local coalitions, as well as training of local project staff, to increase their ability to provide outcome-based prevention programming.
Local project staff also received training in the Prevention Based Performance System, a web-based data-reporting system that has received national recognition as an example of state-of-the-art prevention technology.
The reporting system for Virginia SIG projects was developed by Kit Solutions, under a contract with GOSAP.
A comprehensive evaluation of the Virginia SIG initiative is being conducted by Caliber Associates, a nationally recognized firm based in Fairfax, Virginia.
SIG Advisory Council A SIG Advisory Council has provided advice and consultation during implementation of the Virginia SIG Project.
The Council provided guidance in the SIG grant award process, and it has begun work on a strategic plan for substance abuse prevention, as required by the CSAP.
Membership in the SIG Advisory Council has grown to 40 representatives from public- and private-sector prevention organizations, ranging from state agencies with prevention responsibilities to non-traditional prevention providers, such as the Commonwealth Girl Scouts, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Action Alliance for Children, and the United Way.
The SIG Advisory Council has identified nine "core elements" that form a framework for a strategic plan for substance abuse prevention.
The "core elements" are: Work Force Development - building capacities to recruit, develop, and retain substance abuse prevention providers.
Ethical Prevention Practice - to assist in the promotion and assurance of prevention standards of practice by prevention providers.
Science-Based Practice promoting the use of, and building the capacity for, science-based practice.
Environmental Change increasing the focus on the shared environment related to community norms, regulations, policies and data collection.
Collaboration establishing organized prevention partnerships at the state and local levels to foster consistent planning, programming and data collection.
Resource Development securing a consistent and efficiently integrated funding stream for substance abuse prevention efforts.
8
Legislative Issues enacting public policies that clearly reflect what research shows to be effective in promoting successful outcomes in substance abuse prevention.
Public Awareness heightening awareness of prevention goals, messages and initiatives at the local, state and national levels.
Advocacy fostering prevention advocacy development at the local and state levels.
Capacity-Building Initiative GOSAP and the Office of Substance Abuse Research within James Madison University's Department of Health Sciences have established a partnership to make information, training, and technical assistance available to prevention professionals throughout the Commonwealth.
This project is designed to increase the capacity of prevention professionals to select, and to successfully implement, scientifically sound prevention programs.
Information and training are made available to all prevention professionals, regardless of organizational affiliation.
Technical assistance has been provided to local SDFSCA and SIG grantees.
A three-level curriculum has been developed to include: Prevention Basics, Level I (PB I) - Prevention Theory and Research Â­ Basic prevention theory, research and practice for prevention practitioners and those who wish to update their knowledge of prevention science.
Prevention Basics, Level II (PB II) - Skills for Assessing Needs and Evaluating for Results - Designed for those involved in prevention coordination and program development.
Prevention Basics, Level III (PB III) - Building Capacity for Sustainability Designed to develop skills in community-based planning and implementation at the broader community-wide level.
During 2001-2002, PB I was provided for 133 participants in six regional workshops.
PB II was provided for 153 participants in six regional workshops.
Six individuals completed an online PB I offered through James Madison University.
The training schedule for 2002-2003 is: PB I PB II PB III Three regional workshops to be offered (October, March, and June) Six regional workshops to be offered (October, January, March, May, June, August) Six regional workshops to be offered (November (twice), December, May, July, August)

Youth Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Project (YADAPP) GOSAP has provided Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act funding to the Youth Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Project (YADAPP).
YADAPP summer conferences have been held annually for the past 18 years as a way to promote youth-led prevention efforts in Virginia schools.
High schools and communities from throughout the Commonwealth send teams of four students and one adult sponsor; between 90 and 100 teams typically attend.
The first YADAPP was co-sponsored by the Virginia Department of Education and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Subsequent conferences have been supported by a variety of state agencies and organizations.
Currently, the Department of Criminal Justice Services sponsors the YADAPP project with supplemental support from GOSAP, the Departments of Education, Motor Vehicles, and Alcoholic Beverage Control.
Also collaborating are the Virginia State Police and other law enforcement agencies.
YADAPP 2002 was held at Longwood University the week of July 22.
The week included a mix of general sessions, topical sessions, and action planning to develop STAN (Strategies To Act Now) plans for each team represented.
YADAPP aims to "empower Virginia's high school students with the ability to assume positive peer leadership roles toward the goal of safe and drug-free schools and communities."
Adult sponsors are provided training in prevention, grant writing and program evaluation, and they participate in valuable networking sessions to share ideas.
A particularly noteworthy feature of YADAPP is the series of progressive leadership opportunities that are provided for youth.
After attending the conference for one year, participants are invited to apply to return in a more advanced role as Youth Leaders (limited to 40).
After serving as a Youth Leader, a young person may apply to become a Junior Staff (limited to 25).
After two years on Junior Staff, up to six intern positions are available.
These internships are the ultimate opportunity to put into practice the skills learned during their tenure with YADAPP.
Former "YADAPPers" who have moved into leadership positions in state government, law enforcement, and other public service roles have attested to the strong influence of YADAPP in their decisions to pursue career opportunities in public service.
Under Kidsafe Virginia, YADAPP youth training is being expanded to incorporate regional sessions during the school year, in addition to its usual summer program.
10
Future Direction GOSAP will continue to support effective state and local prevention efforts through the two grant programs it administers and through its capacity building project.
Additionally, the following is planned: Virginia's Plan for Substance Abuse Prevention With consultation from the expanded GOSAP Collaborative, a substance abuse prevention program survey will be undertaken for the purposes of documenting current prevention activities and assessing costs, benefits and needs.
It is anticipated that findings will inform decisions about the coordination of prevention activities and priorities for resource allocation.
GOSAP plans to use an interagency agreement to implement Virginia's strategic plan for substance abuse prevention.
The interagency agreement will delineate the respective roles that state agencies will play in the plan's implementation, ensuring coordination of prevention activities in accordance with Â§2.1-118, Code of Virginia.
The GOSAP Collaborative, comprising key leadership representatives from state agencies and organizations responsible for prevention, will play a central role in developing the interagency agreement and successfully implementing Virginia's plan.
KIDsafe Virginia GOSAP has provided leadership for the collaborative, interagency development of a comprehensive approach for keeping Virginia's children and youth safe.
Governor Warner's KIDsafe Virginia is intended to support the coordinated efforts of parents, educators, public safety professionals and students throughout Virginia.
The initiative features educational programs, informational resources for parents and professionals, enhanced youth leadership development opportunities, a hotline for students, and an online suggestion box.
An evaluation mechanism will be developed to determine program participation, effectiveness, and utilization of instructional materials.
A significant element of KIDsafe Virginia is the extension of YADAPP youth leadership development opportunities to the regional level.
These expanded opportunities will broaden the impact of YADAPP by involving additional schools and youth during the school year.
