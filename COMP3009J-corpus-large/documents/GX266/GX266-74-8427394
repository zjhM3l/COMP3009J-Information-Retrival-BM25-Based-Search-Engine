The Rock Cycle Game Â­ page 1 of 18
Objectives of The Rock Cycle Game Be the first to create at least one of each of the main rock types, igneous, metamorphic 
Learn about the distribution of elements in the outer crust of the Earth.
Learn about minerals and rocks found in Michigan
Rules of The Rock Cycle Game You have to collect the elements you need before you can make any minerals.
You have to make the minerals before you can the make any rocks.
When you land on e (elements) or m (make a mineral / rock) space you have to take a card.
! If you have sufficient elements to make a mineral you get an additional free roll of the die.
! After you have used elements to make a mineral, return them to the bottom of the deck.
! If you cannot make a mineral or a rock the next player takes their turn.
When you land on a ? (question) space you have to answer the question on the card.
! Do not pick up the card yourself, another player will read the question to you.
! If you answer correctly, you get another turn.
! If you cannot answer the question, you loose your next turn.
You can move in any direction on the board.
However, you must go in the same direction at least two turns in a row, before you can reverse directions.
Everyone skips the "Center of the Earth".
If you land on a hexagon occupied by another player they are sent to the Center of the Earth until you roll a one (1) or a six (6) then you can return to the board where you were.
If another player is in the same space, they are now in the Center of the Earth.
What you need to play ! Two or more players or teams, ! A die (singular of dice) (two or more dice can be used if the players agree), ! The Rock Cycle Game Board, ! The Rock Cycle Cards, ! `Player Pebbles' or other easily identified items to mark players position on board.
The Rock Cycle Game Â­ page 2 of 18
What you need to do Place the various game cards, face down, on the proper place on the board: ! e = elements, draw a card when you land on one of the "e" spaces; ! !
m = make a mineral / rock, draw a card when you land on one of these spaces;
? = question about the rock cycle, another player draws a card when you land on one of these spaces.
When you use the game for the first time you will have to cut the cards to form the decks.
! Select piece you want be use to mark your place on the board.
To decide who goes first - role the - die Â­ the player with the highest score goes first.
In case of a tie, roll the die again until the tie is broken.
Variations Quick version - "Deal" the elements out to all players then uses use the e spaces as an option to draw a card from another player (or all players).
Short version - Play the game just to make minerals.
Scrabble version 1 - Assign points (variable or constant value) to e 
Scrabble version 2 - Assign points (variable or constant value) to question cards.
Get points for correct answer, loose points for incorrect answers, and "keep score".
Don't like the rules? Don't like the questions? Don't like the board? Make up your own, rules, objectives, questions and/or game board.

Make the `e' (element) cards The following two sheets can be printed (on heavy paper stock) and then cut into individual cards.
There are 160 `cards' in the set or deck.
Students can use these in the Rock Cycle Game.
The number of times an element appears is proportional to its abundance in the earth's crust.
This is meant to reinforce that eight elements make up most of the crust and help the students better understand the distribution and relative abundance of these (and by association the other) elements.
