Our Flag Its history, tradition and proper display The History of Flags In its original and simplest form, a flag is a piece of cloth or similar material that displays the insignia of a community, a nation, an army or an individual and is usually attached to a pole or staff.
Flags were originally used solely in warfare, to identify leadership or designate rallying points.
But, over the years, their use has expanded to signalling, decoration and display.
The modern flag, as a national symbol, was an invention of the Indians and Chinese.
In China, flags were carried on chariots and planted on the walls of captured cities.
In India, they were carried on elephants and were the main object of attack in battle.
If the flag fell, it would mean confusion and sometimes defeat.
In, Europe, the first national flags were adopted during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
Many leaders at that time adopted the flag of their patron saint to represent their country.
For example, in England, the cross of St. George was adopted in the 13th century.
By the end of the Middle Ages, a flag had become accepted symbol of nations, kings, cities, organizations and guilds.
Over the centuries, the flag has developed many special uses.
The white flag is the universal symbol of truce while the yellow flag is the symbol of infectious illness.
In days gone by, the black flag was the feared symbol of the pirate.
Displaying the flag has also developed certain special meanings.
For instance, a flag at halfmast is the symbol of mourning.
An upside down flag is the symbol of distress.
Flags have grown to be such an important part of life on our planet that political scientists, historians and sociologists regard them as artifacts, expressive of certain cultures, times and places.
The study of the history, symbolism, design and manufacture of flags has even been given its own name -- vexillology.
1 Our FlagÃ¯Â¿Â½s History When our forefathers first began to fight for their independence more than 200 years ago, they did so under many different flags.
Often, these flags bore revolutionary slogans or designated local military units.
In 1775, the first flag to represent all of the American colonies -- the Continental Colors, also known as the Grand Union Flag -was first designated.
This flag, on which the British Union Jack appeared in the upper left corner, was the unofficial American flag until the summer of 1777.
On June 14, 1777, after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress first established a national flag for the United States of America.
With 13 stars and stripes depicting the states -- and the colors red, representing hardiness and courage; white, representing purity and innocence; and blue, representing vigilance and justice -- the new flag was a fitting symbol for a young nation full of hope.
Yet, because the Continental Congress did not specify the arrangement of the stars or the direction of the stripes, a confusing array of local, state and homemade Stars and Stripes were flown in the United States for many years.
By 1817, our nation had grown to 20 states.
Congress, leery of cluttering the U.S. flag with 20 stars and stripes, adopted a 2 flag of 13 stripes, with a star for each state.
Congress also ordered a new star to be added to the flag on the July 4th after a state joined the Union.
Still, the design of the stars and stripes on the U.S. flag varied wildly.
It wasn't until 1912 that the flag was assured a uniform appearance, when President Taft signed an executive order prescribing the size, shape and positioning of the flag's components.
No one knows for sure who designed or made the first U.S. flag.
Congressman Francis Hopkinson claimed that he designed it.
In 1870, William J. Canby claimed that his grandmother, a Philadelphia seamstress by the name of Betsy Ross, made the first U.S. flag.
Historians disagree on both claims.
It is known that Francis Scott Key first called the U.S. flag the Star Spangled Banner in 1814, when he wrote the poem that has since become our national anthem.
It is also known that William Driver, a sea captain from Salem, Massachusetts, gave the name Old Glory to the U.S. flag in 1824.
Since the year 1777, the U.S. flag has undergone many changes -- most notably, the addition of 37 stars.
Yet, one thing has always remained the same.
The American flag is still the most recognizable symbol of freedom, justice and liberty on the face of the planet.
3 Take Care of Your Flag ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s Your Duty All citizens should know how to display their country's flag, since owning a flag and displaying it properly are marks of patriotism and respect.
The first code on the proper display of the U.S. flag was passed by Congress in 1942, and has been amended several times.
Most recently, it was changed to prohibit the displaying of the flag on the floor or ground.
Illustrated on the following pages are several basic guidelines for displaying the U.S. flag.
Additional guidelines follow the illustrations.
During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in parade, all persons should face the flag, stand at attention and salute.
A man should remove his hat and hold it with the right hand over the heart.
Men without hats, and women salute by placing the right hand over the heart.
The salute to the flag in the moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag passes.
4 When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height.
The flags should be of approximately equal size.
International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace.

Remember, always hoist the U.S. flag briskly and lower it ceremoniously.
9 The Pledge of Allegiance and what it means 10 School children first recited the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892, when President Benjamin Harrison called for patriotic exercises to mark the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.
Francis Bellamy, an associate editor from Boston, wrote the original pledge -- which has been changed three times.
The last change, in 1954, added the words "under God."
The pledge was officially recognized by the U.S. Congress in 1942, when it was made part of the code for the use of the American flag.
According to federal legislation, when a person is reciting the pledge, he or she should: stand upright, remove any headdress and place the right hand over the heart.
I PLEDGE, means: I promise ALLEGIANCE, means: my support and loyalty TO THE FLAG, means: the Stars 
At government-sponsored rallies on the streets of Tehran and Tripoli, and at demonstrations outside U.S. military bases overseas, the American flag has been subjected to abuse and humiliation.
We have come to expect that from those who have no reverence for democracy or understanding of our country.
Yet, it is much more alarming when this type of activity occurs -- and is legally tolerated -- on mainstreet America.
Often, public desecration of the flag brings forth intense reaction and a large public outcry, as was the case recently at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago.
Thousands of veterans and other concerned Americans protested daily, in an effort to show their displeasure over an art display at the School that actually encouraged people to desecrate the American flag, by walking on it.
As a result of the incident, both the Illinois General Assembly and the U.S. Congress recently amended their laws governing the display of the U.S. flag -- to prohibit the intentional trampling or displaying of the U.S. flag on the ground or floor.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s the Law In Illinois, it is state law that any person who publicly mutilates, defaces, defiles,tramples, or intentionaly displays on the ground or floor the United States flag will be guilty of a Class 4 felony -- punishable by 1 to 3 years in prison and up to a $25,000 fine.
12 Our National Anthem The Star-Spangled Banner O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream: `Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more? There blood has wash'd out there foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
O thus be it ever when free-men shall stand Between their lov'd home and the war 's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'nrescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: "In God is our trust!" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
