INSURANCE DEPARTMENT I. INTRODUCTION: INTERNAL SCAN The Insurance Department is responsible for supervising and regulating insurance business in New York State.
The Department's mission is to ensure the continued sound and prudent conduct of insurers' financial operations; provide fair, timely and equitable fulfillment of insurer obligations; protect policyholders from financially impaired or insolvent insurers; eliminate fraud, other criminal abuse and unethical conduct in the industry; and foster growth of the insurance industry in the State.
The State's aging population will greatly impact on the Insurance Department's programs and policies with respect to automobile, property, life and health insurance and consumer protection and education.
Since the trend of a healthier, more active senior population is expected to continue, there should be more focus on distribution and innovation in product offerings to better serve the needs of an expanding and multicultural senior population.
Some aspects under consideration include: Automobile Insurance : Will seniors in 2015 be driving in daytime Will they be taking shorter, less frequent trips? Will they be subject to renew their drivers' licenses? Are they more or less likely to have they are driving fewer miles? What is the impact on auto premiums or off- peak hours? to re- testing in order accidents because for seniors? Homeowners Insurance : Will seniors be more likely to own or rent in 2015? Will they live alone? Will the trend toward seasonal residence continue? Do they fully understand the coverages and exclusions that can apply in shoreline communities? Life Insurance : People who are living longer need to purchase products that will enable them to accumulate money (invest) and to liquidate or annuit ize that sum of money over their lifetimes so they will not outlive their funds.
Pure protection life insurance (such as term life insurance) is geared more to younger people with dependents to support.
The challenge to the industry in 2015 will be to re fine life insurance products to meet these changing needs, while at the same time not leaving out others who need pure protection.
Health Insurance : As the population ages, there will be more interest in long- term care insurance, Medicare supplement policies and Medicare HMOs.
Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) -- which are regulated by the Insurance Department along with the Department of Health and Office for the Aging -- will also play a more significant role by the year 2015.
In addition, the financial stability of some health insurers could be at risk should premiums fail to keep up with the rising claims of an aging policyholder base.
159 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Consumer Protection and Education: As new products are introduced in the marketplace there will be an increased demand for consumer education and protection against fraud and abuse.
Regulators will need to evaluate the implications of the following: Changing Methods of Distribution: There may be a decline in the role of agents for certain products and an increase of the Internet as a distribution channel of insurance.
New Products : The insurance community (insurers, agents and regulators) attitudes and practices toward the senior market need to be redirected in order to identify this market and its emerging lifestyle changes and evolving needs.
Information Technology : Baby boomers reaching retirement age may be more likely to use the Internet for research and pricing of insurance products than the current senior population as many are already familiar with computers and have access to the web.
Regulators need to recognize the role of e- business in product administration, distribution and information sharing.
For each line of insurance, the Department must ensure that new products developed for the aging population and others are easily understandable and provide meaningful coverage.
The Department will continue to consider new and innovative means of educating aging citizens about the products most useful to them.
The Department has over the past decade initiated numerous policies and procedures designed with the senior market in mind.
The following reflects departmental initiatives to address demographic changes: Long -term Care Insurance : In 1993, the New York State Partnership for Long- term Care was initiated in New York State to encourage more people to purchase long- term care insurance policies.
The Partnership Program allows those persons who purchase Partnership approved long- term care policies to qualify for Medicaid without spending down their assets once the benefits under the long- term care policy are exhausted.
Medicare Supplement Insurance (aka Medigap insurance): Medicare supplement insurance is designed to supplement Medicare's benefits by paying some of the amounts that Medicare does not cover.
A Medicare beneficiary cannot be turned down or charged higher premiums because of poor health.
All standard Medicare supplement policies are guaranteed renewable.
The Department provides information and assistance to senior citizens concerning Medicare supplement insurance and other coverages available to the elderly, such as long- term care insurance.
160 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC):
CCRCs provide living arrangements, including long- term care commitments, to seniors who purchase living units within the community.
The Department is responsible for: reviewing the contract and disclosure documents provided to residents as well as an initial determination of the financial feasibility of a proposed project; reviewing the rating str ucture of a community; assessing the adequacy of reserves; and conducting periodic on- site examinations of the financial condition of CCRCs.
New Assisted Living Product : The number of persons residing at assisted living care facilities has dramatically increased in the 1990s.
The Department has recently approved an "Assisted Living Care Coverage Endorsement".
This optional endorsement extends coverage in the Homeowners policy to provide limited coverage for personal property, additional living expenses and liability to persons who reside in such facilities and are related to an insured.
Senior Discounts on Homeowners Insurance : Some insurers offer discounts on home insurance to retirees or senior citizens.
The Department has approved discounts when the homeowner is 55 years or older and the insured location is not unoccupied for an extended period of time.
Senior Discounts on Automobile Insurance : Premium discounts for the mature driver are available from some insurers.
There are several different age classifications, within which premiums generally tend to decrease as a person matures.
However, some insurers also charge higher premiums for higher- age categories, as insurer statistics indicate that beyond a certain age the claims experience as a group worsens.
Many senior citizens or retirees may also benefit from those insurers that vary their prices by the number of miles a car is driven each year, since they may drive fewer miles than the average insured.
Viatical Settlement Companies/Senior Settlement Companies/Life Settlement Companies: Viatical settlements refer to the selling of life insurance policies by the insured party to a third party.
The insured owner must be terminally ill (death anticipated within 24 months).
The Department provides protections for seniors who decide to sell such policies.
Senior or life settlement companies have begun to arise.
These companies purchase policies of individuals who are not necessarily terminally ill.
These types of settlements currently are not regulated by the Department.
Consequently, seniors may become particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with this type of business.
HIICAP: The Department's consumer services staff are members of the Health Insurance Information, Counseling and Assistance Program (HIICAP) consortium.
This group is comprised of representatives from the Medicare servicing carriers, Medicare contractors, New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC), State Department of Health, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and IPRO (Island Peer Review Organization, a peer review organization for Medicare).
The consortium meets annually to determine the training needs for HIICAP counselor and volunteers and whether there are changes at the Federal and state levels that might impact the insurance concerns of the aging.
161 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Department staff assists in developing the Training Manual for the program, conducting training, and responding to technical insurance questions.
Consumer Education and Outreach: The Department routinely sends Consumer Services Bureau staff to senior centers to explain insurance issues and answer questions.
The Frauds Bureau is gearing up to educate the public in the area of no - fault insurance fraud through a series of presentations in public and private venues.
Emphasis will be placed on working with senior groups.
Web Site : The Department's Web site provides senior citizens and others with access to comprehensive, up - to- date information on links to insurance companies, online complaint filings, disaster assistance, the Healthy New York program, Holocaust Victims resources, instructions on how to report frauds, tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.
Publications on long- term care insurance and Medicare supplement coverage are also available on our Web site and through our toll- free publications telephone line.
The Web site also has an interactive feature that allows visitors to have an online "conversation" with a NetRep.

PRIORITY ISSUE AREAS Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations.
Health insurance is a key issue facing the aging population.
The demands for long- term care (LTC) insurance and continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) products will increase dramatically over the next five to ten years.
Effective and efficient planning is essential to accommodate the need for meaningful health insurance coverage and to ensure the financial solvency and market conduct of insurers providing such coverage.
Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs.
Education through outreach programs provides opportunities for seniors and others to learn about a multitude of existing and new insurance products such as longterm care, Medicare supplement, viatical settlements, homeowners and automobile discount programs.
Many of these products are complex and not easily understood.
Moreover, older citizens are frequent victims of fraud that can result in major financial, emotional and psychological hardship.
This segment of the population is particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with cash settlement of life insurance policies prior to death to pay for care needs (viatical settlements), "staged" automobile accidents and sale of fraudulent investment instruments.
Education and prevention initiatives can help safeguard seniors from fraud, criminal abuse and other unethical conduct.
162 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of information technology to benefit senior cons umers and to bridge the "digital divide."
By 2015, a greater number of seniors will have access to the Internet to research and purchase insurance products online.
It is important that we provide insurance information geared toward seniors on our Web site.
We should also be working with other agencies to help bridge the "digital divide" that separate computer users from nonusers.
III.
ACTIONS AND RESULTS Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations.
Action: Amend Section 3111 of the Insurance Law to require third party notification, such as spouse or children, for long- term care policies regarding premiums due.
Currently, this provision applies to Medicare supplement and other t ypes of insurance but not to long- term care.
Result : The lapse rate for long- term care policies will decrease as a result of such legislation.
As time passes some seniors may forget to pay their premium.
When these policies lapse, it is virtually impossible to have them reinstated if the insured is in poor health.
Action: Amend the Insurance Law Section 3216(c)(10) to extend the "free look" period after the purchase of long- term care policies from 10 to 30 days to provide consumers sufficient time to evaluate their policies.
Currently, this is required for Medicare supplement policies.
Result : The 30- day "free look" provision affords policyholders additional time to review and decide whether to keep the policy or return it for a full refund.
Ten da ys is too short a period in which to review an insurance contract and make informed decisions.
Action: Encourage more senior- oriented insurance products that will meet the needs of an aging population.
For example, life insurance policies might combine a long- term care element with a life insurance component, while continuing care retirement communities could offer contracts that wrap around existing long- term care policies.
Result : New York seniors would gain increased access to flexible, comprehensive insurance products that fit their needs.
Action: Foster the growth of financially stable CCRCs for New York seniors.
163 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Result : Currently, only five CCRCs operate in New York State.
As the aged population increases, these types of facilities would provide key health insurance and residential services to seniors who wish to remain in the State.
Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs.
Action: Establish, in conjunction with the Office for the Aging, a Seniors Advisory Council comprised of representatives from AARP and other senior groups to advise the Department regarding the insurance needs of New York's seniors.
Result : A Seniors Advisory Council would provide valuable information on insurance issues facing that commun ity and provide feedback on Department initiatives directed towards seniors.
Actions : Expand educational outreach and marketing programs to include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increased attendance and/or presentations at public events that attract the elderly, such as county fairs, meetings and conventions of senior citizens groups, etc.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increased advertisements that attract an elderly audience.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop/update multi- lingual pamphlets and guides on senior issues, formatted for ease of readability and comprehension.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop a Mobile Information Center to disseminate information to seniors.
A van would travel throughout the State with trained staff to answer insurance questions and solve problems.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase training to HIICAP volunteers and NYSOFA staff.
Result : Ensure that information on health insurance and related topics is available to a greater segment of the older population including those who are not able to obtain information online and/or whose primary language is not English.
Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of informa tion technology to benefit senior consumers and to bridge the "digital divide."
Action: Establish a senior citizen section on the Department's Web site to include information on long- term care insurance, frauds prevention, CCRCs, Medicare HMO's (Health Maintenance Organizations), Medicare supplement insurance, senior discount programs, etc.
This Web site will have a font size, layout and functionality to best meet the needs of the aged population and enable visitors to use the Net Rep feature currently available to all visitors.
Further, coordinate the Insurance Department's information with other State agencies via online links from the NYS Citizen Guide, NYSOFA, Consumer Protection Board, NYS Department of Health, and others.
Result : Provide user friendly, comprehensive information on the products and services available to senior citizens on a separate section of our Web site exclusively devoted to this segment of the population and via other senior- related Web sites.
164 INSURANCE DEPARTMENT Action: Install kiosks in the I nsurance Department's offices and in other agencies to provide computer access to Department Web site and other information resources.
Result : Increase consumer access to information and awareness of insurance services, products and issues.
