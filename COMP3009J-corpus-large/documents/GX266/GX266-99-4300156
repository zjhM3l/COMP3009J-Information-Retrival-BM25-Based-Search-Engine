C h ar ac t e r i s t i c s of M ar y l an d L on g T e r m C ar e F ac i l i t y R e s i de n t s The focus of this section of the Chartbook is on residents of freestanding nursing homes as well as comparisons of how those residents are similar to and different from the residents of assisted living facilities and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs).
Trends in age, race and gender of nursing home residents are examined in this section.
After establishing the characteristics of a "typical resident", comparisons are made for various subgroups of long term care facility residents by race, gender, living situation prior to admission, marital status, payer source, source of admission, principal diagnosis, degree of care, activities of daily living, and continence.

Â¦ Between 1990 and 1997, the under 65 year age group in all nursing home beds combined increased from 7.7 to 9.7 percent of total residents.
13.9 percent and the 75 to 84 year age group declined from 35.5 to 34.1 percent.
Â¦ The over 85 year age group, as a proportion of all nursing home residents, remained fairly stable between 1990 and 1997.
In both 1990 and 1997, the 85 and
Â¦ Between 1990 and 1997, the 65 to 74 year age group decreased from 14.2 to
older age group accounted for 42 percent of all residents.
Â¦ The development of shorter-stay subacute care units is a factor contributing to the increase in the under 65 year age group between 1993 and 1997.
Figure 15 illustrates the difference in age distribution between the comprehensive
level of care and acute care hospitalbased subacute care facilities in Maryland during 1997.
Â¦ The mean age for comprehensive care residents is 80.6 years.
For hospitalbased subacute care patients, the mean age is 75.4 years.

Â¦ As shown in Figure 15, a higher proportion of the subacute care patients are under 85 years of age as compared to the age distribution observed in comprehensive care facilities.
While 78 percent of subacute care patients were under 85 years in 1997, only 58 percent
of comprehensive care residents were under age 85 in 1997.
Â¦ Typically, subacute care patients are younger, less likely to be disabled and more likely to be discharged home than those in comprehensive care beds.

Â¦ Figure 16 shows the difference in age distribution between Maryland nursing home and assisted living residents on December 31, 1997.
The greater percentage of assisted living residents in
the 85 and over age group indicates that assisted living is utilized proportional to its capacity more than nursing homes by this age cohort.

Â¦ As shown in Figure 17, compared to national figures, Maryland nursing homes have proportionately fewer residents between the ages of 75 to 84 years.
Thirty-four percent of Maryland nursing home residents are 75 to 84 years of age, while nationally 36 percent are in this age group.
Â¦ In the over 85 age group, Maryland nursing homes have proportionately fewer residents as compared with the U.S. as a whole.

Â¦ Figure 18 shows that the risk of entering a nursing home increases with advancing age.
While less than one percent of individuals aged 65 to 74 were residents of a nursing home at the end of 1997, almost 24 percent of Maryland residents 85 and over were living in a nursing home.
Â¦ Less than 5 percent of Maryland residents aged 75 to 84 were residing in a nursing home at the end of 1997.
Â¦ Although the likelihood of residing in a nursing home increases with age, the vast majority of those aged 65 and over live in the community or in other settings.
At the end of 1997, about 4 percent of all Maryland over the age of 65 were living in a nursing home.

Â¦ The racial make up of the Maryland nursing home population is more diverse than that of the nation as a whole.
Maryland nursing homes have fewer white residents of non-Hispanic origin, more than twice as many African American residents than the U.S., and more than twice as many of other races.

Â¦ For many years women consistently made up 75 percent of the nursing home population.
However, the ratio of men to women living in Maryland Nursing Homes has shifted slightly in recent years.
In 1997, the male nursing home population increased to 28 percent with a concomitant decrease in the female population to 72 percent.
Â¦ A lthough the cause of the shift in gender distribution over the last several
years is not clear, a number of factors may have contributed to the increase in the proportion of male nursing home residents.
For example, as noted earlier, there has been an increase in the percent of nursing home residents that are less than 65 years of age.
Because the younger population is more likely to be male, this increase in younger nursing home residents may have contributed to the greater proportion of males observed in the 1997 reporting period.

Â¦ Compared to the United States as a whole, the gender make up of the Maryland nursing home population age 65 years and older is similar.
In 1997, male nursing home residents represented about 25 percent of total residents for both Maryland and U.S. nursing home facilities.
The female nursing home population accounted for about 75 percent of the total.

SUB-GROUPS OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS Maryland Long Term Care Survey data from 1997 was analyzed based on specified sub-groups of residents to determine similarities and differences in key characteristics.
The sub-groups are comprised of nursing home residents, excluding subacute care, and are specified as follows: 1) cognitively impaired on admission; 2) incontinent of bowel and bladder on admission; 3) heavy and heavy-special care on admission; 4) moderate care on admission; 5) light care on admission; 6) c irculatory system disease on admission; 7) nervous system disease on admission; 8) mental disorder diagnosis on admission; 9) 85 years of age and older; 10) 11) 12) 13) under length length length 65 of of of years of age; stay less than 10 days; stay 10 to 20 days, and; stay greater than 20 days.
These sub-groups are defined in the Technical Notes section of this chart book.
The following graphs show only the sub-groups that were notably different from a typical nursing home resident for each variable.
Not all possible responses are shown for each variable.
Note that some groups are not mutually exclusive and may be made up of individuals who are identified in more than one sub-group.
The sub-groups are summarized in Figures 22 through 31.
More detailed information describing the sub-groups is included in Tables 4 through 13.

Summary of Subgroups: Figures 22 - 31 Â¦ A lthough length of stay for both subacute residents and comprehensive care residents combined is 257 days on average, with a median of 22 days, analysis of length of stay patterns for comprehensive care residents only shows different results.
In 1997, the average length of stay for comprehensive care residents only was 413 days, with a median of 41 days.
(Length of stay differences are discussed further in relation to Figure 49).
Â¦ The discharge destination for men and women differs from the distribution of the overall nursing home population.
Women are slightly less likely to be discharged to an acute care hospital (17 percent compared to 21 percent for men) and slightly more likely to be discharged home (37 percent compared to 35 percent for men).
About 33 percent of women as compared to 31 percent for men report discharge due to death.
Â¦ Figure 24A shows that more nursing home residents whose degree of care is categorized as light, and residents whose age is greater than equal to 85 years old have lived alone prior to admission for nursing home care.
Â¦ Figure 27 shows that more residents who are categorized as heavy or heavy special care are admitted from an acute care hospital than what is typical for nursing home residents.
Fewer nursing home residents with an admitting diagnosis of nervous sense organ diseases are admitted from an acute general hospital than a typical nursing home patient categorized as heavyor heavy special care.
Â¦ Figures 22 and 23 shows that the under 65 age group is evenly divided between men and women.
The racial component of the population under 65 is also more evenly divided between African American and white.
The under 65 population is also more likely to be dependent in ADLs.
(See figure 30) Â¦ The over 85 population in Maryland nursing homes consists of a higher percentage of white, female, and w idowed individuals.
This population is slightly more likely to be private pay and slightly less likely to have diagnoses of nervous and sense organ disorders.

Â¦ The cognitively impaired individuals, who are moderately to severely impaired in the Cognitive Skills assessment item on the Minimum Data Set, represent 22 percent of all nursing home residents.
Â¦ The cognitively impaired sub-group is slightly less likely than "typical" nursing home resident to be widowed, or married, and less likely to be living alone or with a spouse prior to admission for nursing home care.
Â¦ Cognitively impaired individuals are more likely than other nursing home residents to be heavy or heavy-special care, and more likely to be dependent in toilet use, transfer, eating, and dressing.
Â¦ In addition, this sub-group is more likely to be incontinent of both bowel and bladder on admission.

Â¦ Residents who are incontinent of both bowel and bladder at the time of admission to a nursing home are less likely to be living alone, and more likely to be Medicaid than a typical nursing home resident.
Â¦ The residents in this subgroup are more likely to be admitted from an acute general hospital and less likely to be
admitted from a private home.
The degree of care for incontinent residents of nursing homes is more likely to be heavy care.
Â¦ Incontinent residents are more likely to be totally dependent in toilet use, transfer, eating and dressing than a typical nursing home resident.
