******************************************************** STATEWIDE TOPICS ******************************************************** Note: This proposal was deferred from the November 2002 Board of Game meeting so that it could be considered for application on a statewide basis.
PROPOSAL 1 - 5 AAC 92.012.
Licenses and tags.
Units 1-4 as follows: Require the use of tags for deer in Units 1-4.
In Units 1-4 the state shall issue waterproof paper tags that are to be attached to the animal immediately after harvest.
If the animal is not taken from the field whole the tag must be attached to the proof of sex.
ISSUE: Many deer in Southeast Alaska are being harvested without the proper tag being cut.
This results in a number of people taking deer in excess of the limit.
There is no easy way for a person to tell if a deer has been tagged by looking at the animal.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Deer will continue to be harvested without being tagged.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Majority of Southeast hunters.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? People who now harvest deer without a tag.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Using locking plastic tags.
Cost is prohibitive.

Permit for falconry.
Increase quota for peregrine falcon take as follows: All three populations of peregrine falcons in Alaska are healthy.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that a take of up to 10 percent of the annual production of young falcons would have no negative effects on the population.
We propose: The take of eyas peregrine falcons be allowed statewide, for general and master class falconers, with the stipulation that the take for any one subspecies must not exceed five percent of Amend the tag requirement for deer in
the annual production of that subspecies and that at least two young must be left in any Tundrius or Anatum nest.
Now that the monitor period has ended, the Colville River and the upper Yukon River should be added to the other areas where peregrine take is allowed.
A passage peregrines take should also be allowed, when it is allowed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
ISSUE: The peregrine harvest quotas are unnecessarily restrictive in numbers and areas where harvest is allowed.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The present take numbers will continue and harvest areas will remain the same.

Permit for falconry.
Add conditions for raptor propagation permits as follows: Captive Breeding 24.
The purpose of captive propagation of raptors is to provide captive bred raptors for qualified falconers and to contribute to the economic well being of the state of Alaska and the United States of America and to allow Alaskan raptor propagators to participate in commerce allowed by the United States Department of the Interior.
Unless a person holds a propagation permit issued by the department, the person may not breed raptors in captivity for falconry or captive breeding.
The department will issue a propagation permit under the following conditions: a.
The department will issue a propagation permit only to a person who holds a federal raptor propagation permit and an Alaska master class falconry permit.
b.
A propagation permitee may have no more than four individual birds originally taken from the wild.
A raptor held under a propagation permit does not count as one of the three raptors that may be held under a falconry permit.
c. Fifty percent of first generation captive bred progeny will be available to Alaska falconers and Alaska captive propagators to reduce the take from the wild.
Fifty percent of first generation progeny may be sold, bartered, or given to falconers or propagators outside Alaska.
d.
Within a calendar year, a propagation permitee may not acquire, for raptor propagation purposes, more than two raptors that originated from the wild. e.
A propagation permitee may not possess a raptor produced by interspecific hybridization unless the raptor has been surgically sterilized.
f.
A raptor that originated from the wild in Alaska and is held under a propagation permit may not be exported from the state.
ISSUE: The captive breeding regulations are twenty years old.
Because of philosophical differences with the department, we would like to update the regulations.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The department will continue to oppose change and stifle the positive changes in the captive breeding regulations we propose.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Alaska falconers, raptor breeders and the economies of the United States and Alaska.

The proposal would eliminate the requirement for the department to produce a separate supplement for the registration hunts.
Registration hunt information would be included in the hunting regulations, consolidating details for hunters.
5 AAC 92.049.
Permits, permit procedures, and permit conditions.
a) ... (b) The department shall produce an annual [REGISTRATION PERMIT SUPPLEMENT,] Tier II permit supplement, and drawing permit supplement.
For each permit hunt the supplement must set out the permit application procedures and permit conditions authorized under 5 AAC 92.050 - 5 AAC 92.052, 5 AAC 92.061 Â­ 5 AAC 92.063, 5 AAC 92.067, and 5 AAC 92.070.
ISSUE: Current codified regulation requires the department to produce a registration supplement.
Over the last few years, more and more of those details have been included in the hunting regulations in an attempt to clarify various hunt types and requirements.
An internal review by department staff found that including the remaining details in the hunting regulations would add very little, and would consolidate the information in one place, making it easier for public and staff to find the information necessary.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The department will continue to produce a registration supplement that few hunters use or need.

PROPOSED BY: Brian Peterson (HQ-04S-G-016) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 6 - 5 AAC 92.049.
Permits, permit procedures, and permit conditions.
Eliminate the requirement to obtain registration permits in person as follows: I prefer the solution of eliminating the in-person requirement of obtaining permits in small remote villages and going to a drawing system.
Or at a minimum, making the permits available in larger
cities like Anchorage, Kodiak, or Juneau and extending deadlines into the hunting season so that all will have equal, fair and reasonable access to obtaining a permit.
ISSUE: The issue I would like to have addressed is the requirement to have individuals obtain registration permits in person in small remote villages like Larsen Bay, Old Harbor, Akhiok, and Port Lions.
This is a requirement for several different hunts.
The ones I am specifically referring to are RG471 to RG479 for goats.
I feel the requirement to have interested applicants show up in person in some small remote village by some specified date before the hunt even opens to obtain a permit is blatantly unfair, overly restrictive and favors the local community members.
This type of requirement does not afford the majority of Alaskan residents with fair and equal access to obtain a permit for a specified game population.
It is unreasonable to expect an individual to take time off work and spend hundreds of dollars to fly to Larsen Bay to get a registration goat permit, return home and then fly back a month later to hunt.
I understand the need to regulate the number of permits issued for specific hunts, but this is a very poor and unfair way of doing so.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? If this problem is not solved the world will not come to an end.
But it certainly leaves a bad taste in one's mouth when they are denied fair and equal access to obtain a permit.
I am not asking for any special treatment, just a system that is fair and reasonable.
The requirement of making folks obtain permits in person in small remote villages is flawed and should be fixed.
It's just a poor way of doing business.
Holding drawings for a specified number of permits would seem more logical and abundantly fairer.
At a minimum, applicants should be able to obtain the permits in larger cities that they must have to travel through to get to the hunting area, i.e. Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, etc.
The application period should remain open throughout the hunt.
If harvest quotas are filled, then the hunt can be curtailed.
These types of registration hunts can be successfully managed without the requirement to have folks show up in person in remote villages to obtain the permits.
We can do better than that.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? No, just the access to obtaining the permit.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Many Alaskan residents will benefit from the elimination of the in-person requirement to obtain permits in small remote villages since they will now be afforded a reasonable opportunity to get a permit.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? The local residents of villages like Larsen Bay, Old Harbor, and Point Lions are likely to suffer since they will now have to compete in a fair and reasonable fashion like the rest of Alaska's residents for permits that once were held pretty much exclusively for their use.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Flying to Larsen Bay to get my goat permit in person, but it was cost prohibitive.

Permits, permit procedures, and permit conditions.
Base number of drawing permits issued on historical harvest data as follows: The number of drawing permits issued in a hunt must be expected to harvest 100 percent of the harvestable surplus based on historical harvest data.
ISSUE: Biologists purposely restricting drawing permits to allow for a registration hunt after the general season.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Individuals applying for drawing permits will be denied opportunity to draw.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes.
Applicants will have a better chance of drawing.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? All drawing permit applicants.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Very few registration hunters.

PROPOSED BY: Brian Peterson (SC-04S-G-003) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 8 - 5 AAC 92.050.
Required permit hunt conditions and procedures.
Amend these regulations as follows: ... (8) a person who has been issued a permit, or that person's proxy under 5 AAC 92.011, shall return the permit harvest report to the department within the time period stated on the permit; in addition to other penalties provided by law for failure to report harvest, and except as provided in (c) of this section, if a permittee or the permittee's proxy fails to provide the required report for a drawing permit, registration permit, a Tier I subsistence permit, or a Tier II subsistence permit, the permittee might not be issued a drawing, registration, a Tier I subsistence, or a Tier II subsistence permit during the following regulatory year. ...
ISSUE: Most registration hunts are managed in season and timely reporting by hunters is necessary so that harvest objectives are not exceeded.
In the case of a drawing or Tier II permit hunt, hunters may be penalized (in addition to a citation) for not returning their harvest reports, and they typically lose the opportunity to apply for a drawing or Tier II permit the following year.
The department would like to extend this penalty to hunters who fail to return their hunt reports for registration hunts.
Specifically, hunters who do not return their hunt reports for registration hunts may lose their
opportunity to apply for any permit the following year.
The threat of this penalty should encourage more registration hunters to report in a timely manner.
Currently, area offices send out postcards, followed by phone calls, and finally a certified letter in an attempt to obtain the information.
At that point, they are turned over to Alaska Bureau of Wildlife Enforcement (ABWE).
If there are several hundred non-reporters on the list, this is a time consuming and expensive process.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Department staff will continue to spend time tracking down hunters that failed to turn in their reports.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? The department would have more accurate and timely information to issue emergency orders for hunts and make sound management decisions.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Those who fail to report will lose their opportunity to apply for any permit hunt the following year.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Raise citation amount to encourage better reporting.

Required permit hunt conditions and procedures.
Implement a point system for drawing permit hunts so that long-term applicants have increased chance of success as follows: A points accumulation system favoring applicants consistently applying for specific hunts, i.e. bison etc.
The longer a hunt is applied for, year after year, the more likely an individual is to be drawn.
ISSUE: Drawing permit hunts for bison, moose, goat, sheep, and caribou should be changed from random to a points system as in other states.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Status quo.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? People who have applied for many hunts without drawing a tag.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? People new to the state and those not willing to consistently apply for hunts.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? N/A (HQ-04S-G-034) PROPOSED BY: Tom Young ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 11 - 5 AAC 92.050.
Required permit hunt conditions and procedures.
Implement a point system for sheep and bison drawing permit hunts so that long-term applicants have increased chance of success as follows: Drawing permits for sheep and bison should be awarded by a "modified preference point" system.
All applicants would be required to be 16 years of age, and first purchase a hunting license.
Unsuccessful applicants would receive one point for each species.
An applicant could also opt to purchase a point for each species without making a hunt choice.
A person may apply for only one hunt (not the current three) per species.
Nonresident applicants could opt to receive a refund of the hunting license fee.
Drawing applications should cost $10-20 per species/hunt choice.
The department would set up a database to track each hunter's points, which would be funded by the license and higher applications fees.
Points should be awarded to unsuccessful applicants for the previous five years to begin the database.
How the system would work: 80 percent (rounded up) of the permits would be awarded to the highest point holders.
If there are more highest-point holders than permits available, the permits will be awarded by random drawing
among these holders.
The remaining 20 percent (rounded down) would be awarded with the current random drawing method.
This would provide an opportunity for first-time/lucky applicants to receive a permit.
Example: There are eight permits for a hunt.
Thirty-five applicants have five points and 1,220 applicants have zero to four points.
Six permits are available to point holders.
A random drawing of the 35 applicants will determine who gets the six permits.
The remaining 29 applicants will be included with the other 1,220 applicants in a random drawing for the other two permits.
ISSUE: A "point" system should be implemented for low-odds drawing permit hunts like sheep and bison.
Most other states have bonus or preference point permit award systems (or combinations thereof) especially for hard-to-get permits.
Unsuccessful applicants are awarded points which may be applied at the next drawing for that species.
The longer the applicants is not successful, the better the chances of getting a permit.
A "weighted" drawing method will reward persistent applicants and provide a better resource allocation system.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Long-time applicants will still not receive permits, and interest will wane (lowering the department's budget).
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? It will better allocate limited permits, and increase income to the department from application and license fees.
There will be more interest in point-system award programs.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Anyone, like me, who has applied for a permit for 28 consecutive years without being drawn.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Very lucky people who seem to get drawn whenever they apply.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? (1) A preference point system unconstitutional, based on "equal protection", since everyone has an equal accumulate points; (2) a total preference point system would not create the same point holders; and (3) eliminating the drawing permit system management/enforcement problems.

(SC-04S-G-008) PROPOSED BY: Brian Peterson ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 13 - 5 AAC 92.050.
Required permit hunt conditions and procedures.
Implement a point system for drawing permit hunts so that long-term applicants have increased chance of success as follows: Change the current hunting drawing permit system to a preference/weighted point system (with a "buy a point" option).
ISSUE: The current drawing permit hunt system is unfair.
The current system does not recognize past participation in the drawing permit hunt process.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Continuation of an unfair drawing permit hunt system.
Solution: Many of the ideas contained in this proposal are currently being used in the State of Washington and Montana permit hunt point systems.
The new point system should include all the current drawing permit hunts offered by the State of Alaska.
Participants would continue the same hunt choice procedure and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game would continue the same method for drawing applicants (random number selection by computer).
In addition, applicants will be identified using their hunter education identification number or current drivers license number.
Applicants will be notified by mail using the address on the application.
The notification will indicate successful or unsuccessful for each species the applicant applied for and, current total points accumulated per species.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to report any discrepancies.
Each person who applies for a drawing permit hunt receives a point per species.
If that person is awarded a drawing permit hunt for that species the persons point total for that species drops to zero.
A person not awarded a drawing permit hunt for that species retains his or her points.
A single point is built up each consecutive year the person applies.
A person must continue to apply each year for each species or the person is purged from that species system and their point total for that species is zero.
The State of Washington permit hunt system does not require continuous yearly participation to maintain points.
The State of Montana allows the applicant to skip two concurrent years of participation without forfeiting accumulated points.
To facilitate persons who will not be able to hunt for a species for a given permit year (for whatever reason) but wants to continue to build points and not lose their current points, a method to buy points for that year shall be offered.
A special hunt choice number will be provided per species for that person to use.
A person applying for these hunts using the special number cannot be awarded a permit and will automatically accrue their point for each species that year.
In addition the person must do everything else normally required to do.
An option to buy points offers the applicant a method to better plan for hunts.
A multiplier shall be used on the persons species point total.
The number of points for each species is then cubed and it is this number of random numbers that are issued to the application for a given species.
Placing a multiplier of cubed on the points more noticeably increases the chances of being selected over someone who is a new applicant or was recently awarded a permit.
The State of Washington squares the total number of accumulated points per species.
The State of Alaska uses random number system: however as the system is today, every year each person, no matter how many times they have applied, receives only one random number per species.
(1) A person can apply the following year of being selected for a drawing permit hunt.
All waiting periods shall be eliminated; (2) only one point is received per year per species; (3) points are not transferable to other species or hunters; and (4) no group or party applications would be offered.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? The quality of the resource will not change: however this system will produce a more positive attitude by hunters thus increasing a person's interest in game management.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Anyone who participates in the drawing permit hunt system.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? A person who does not apply for a drawing permit hunt and does not buy points in any given year will lose their accumulated points for that species.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? (1) Point system without a multiplier.
This would be an improvement to the current system but offers only a limited increase of chance over a new applicant or recently awarded applicant; (2) A system that does not require any kind of yearly participation to retain their points.
Persons could still buy points; (3) A system that does not offer the option to buy points.
This would create the scenario in which individuals are selected for hunts and are not able to hunt for that species that year.
Therefore the following year the person would be back to zero points for that species.
Buying points offers the applicants control and opportunity to better plan hunts; (4) Include group or party hunt applications.
There are some people that like the party hunt concept in which each group member receives a permit.
Using the point system the group's points would be an average of the total points of the group members.
Another option to group/party hunt applications would be that only one permit be issued to the group and that any member of the group could take the animal.
Only one animal per permit.
The taking of game under such a permit would eliminate any member of that group to take game of the same species that year.
Management of such a system may be difficult.
Group and party applicants have less of a chance of selection versus applying individually.
In addition the process adds one more dynamic to the system with added cost and zero benefit; and (5) Eliminate all permit drawing hunts of game species that can be managed based on antler or horn size and enact a point system for the remaining game when resource numbers are in jeopardy.
This issue could be divisive.
Many people believe this would create an overabundance of hunters seeking a very limited number of legal game.

Implement a point system for drawing permit hunts so that long-term applicants have increased chance of success as follows: Provide a system that increases a hunter's odds to be successful for a drawing permit.
Require continuous application for a number of years (three to five) thus increasing odds to draw permit.
Also increase number of years (three to five) required to lapse before same permit could be drawn again.
Since other draw permits require more than one year lapse (buffalo-five years) there should be little opposition.
ISSUE: The process of awarding drawing permit hunts, applicant chance of success, and applicant redraw for same permit.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Lower numbers of hunters applying for drawing permits, lower revenue for the department, and unfulfilled management goals.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? If hunters knew that by persistence they would receive a permit, larger numbers would apply.

Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system.
Modify Tier II permit point system as follows: Basically change the form to show the unit and subunit where applicant's PRIMARY and/or TEMPORARY (cabin residence) is located.
Change: "Where do you purchase fuel and groceries" to the method of transportation used to purchase same.
Scoring is as follows: Your Primary Residence Mailing Address (as shown on your Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend Check (APFDC)).
10 points if outside the unit for the Tier II hunt applied for.
20 points if inside the unit for the Tier II hunt applied for, but not in the subunit.
30 points if inside the unit and subunit for the Tier II hunt applied for.
City, Zip code.
10 points if community qualifies as rural.
five points if community qualifies as urban.
Primary Residence.
Physical address (as shown on your APFDC (street address, if different from mailing address), if remote, also give latitude and longitude, distance from known locations.
Unit and subunit of primary residence.
The highest score based on your primary residence or temporary residence will be used (max score 30 points for primary residence and 25 points for temporary residence).
Method to travel to location to purchase groceries: (1) motor vehicle = five points; (2) airplane or boat = 10 points.
Method to travel to location to purchase fuel: (1) motor vehicle = five points; (2) airplane or boat = 10 points.
Temporary residence (cabins, log homes) physical address and legal description (lot, block, survey info), if remote give latitude and longitude, distance from known locations.
10 points if outside the unit for the Tier II hunt applied for.
15 points if inside the unit for the Tier II hunt applied for, but not in the subunit.
25 points if inside the unit and the subunit for the Tier II hunt applied for.
Name and distance of closest community to your temporary residence.
10 points if community qualifies as rural.
Five points if community qualifies as urban.
Method to travel to location to purchase groceries: (1) = five points; (2) = 10 points.
Method to travel to location to purchase fuel: (1) five points; (2) = 10 points.
Residency: How long have you lived in Alaska? One point for each year of consecutive residency in Alaska (25 points max).
Alaska residents who served in the military or government outside of Alaska but claimed residency and received the APFSC can include those years.
Any area not answered will receive a score of zero points.
ISSUE: The present Tier II application questions are not valid in all subunit management areas and force people within the sub units to stretch the truth in order to qualify.
When the truth is more realistic (gas and groceries) and residency is vague, e.g. Unit 16B; food and fuel are purchased in Anchorage and flown or boated out to the remote residence but they must say they buy their food and fuel in the Unit where there are no stores.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? People will continue to improvise and be creative in the application.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? People living in subunit have a local knowledge of game habitat and are more likely to have a successful hunt.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Individuals residing within the subunit (rural preference complies with the federal mandate).
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Individuals residing in a designated urban area, but they could still qualify for a permit.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? N/A (SC-04S-G-030) PROPOSED BY: Mark Kelliher ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 28 - 5 AAC 92.070.
Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system.
Modify Tier II permit point system as follows: I would suggest changing (a) to 40 points instead of 60.
(a)(1) would need to be changed to reflect the same 40 point number and (a)(2) should be deleted in its entirety.
(a) A Tier II subsistence permit applicant's "customary and direct dependence on the game population by the subsistence user for human consumption as a mainstay of livelihood" may provide up to [60] 40 points.
It is measured by the following indicators and points: (1) the number of years in which the applicant has hunted on or eaten from the game population, plus the number of years in which the applicant would have hunted on or eaten from the game population but did not because state regulations canceled the hunt on the game population during a given year or years, or because the state did not issue the applicant a permit to hunt on the game population for which the applicant applied; one point is given for each year, up to [50] 40 points; and
[(2) THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH A MEMBER OF THE APPLICANT'S HOUSEHOLD HAS HUNTED ON OR EATEN FROM THE GAME POPULATION, PLUS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH THAT MEMBER OF THE APPLICANT'S HOUSEHOLD WOULD HAVE HUNTED ON OR EATEN FROM THE GAME POPULATION BUT DID NOT BECAUSE STATE REGULATIONS CANCELED THE HUNT ON THE GAME POPULATION DURING A GIVEN YEAR OR YEARS, OR BECAUSE THE STATE DID NOT ISSUE THAT MEMBER OF THE APPLICANT'S HOUSEHOLD A PERMIT TO HUNT ON THE GAME POPULATION FOR WHICH THAT MEMBER OF THE APPLICANT'S HOUSEHOLD APPLIED; .2 POINTS ARE GIVEN FOR EACH YEAR, UP TO 10 POINTS. ] (b) The "ability of a subsistence user to obtain food if subsistence use is restricted or eliminated" may provide up to [40]
It is measured by the following indicators and points: (1) the relative availability of alternative sources of game to the applicant's household, which may provide up to [20] 30 points, as measured by the formula Score = [20]
(c) An applicant's total score is the sum of points given under (a) and (b) of this section, up to a maximum of 100 points.
ISSUE: I feel the current point system does not provide for actual subsistence priority, but in fact is slanted more to residence longevity.
By doing this we can put more focus on a person's direct dependence on a particular game population, as a "mainstay of livelihood".
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Newer generations of hunters will never be able to have these opportunities.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? No, it is strictly an allocation issue.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Shorter term residents.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Longer term residents.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? The best solution is to amend the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) and make all Alaskans equal, but this will never happen.

PROPOSED BY: Matanuska/Susitna Valley Advisory Committee (SC-04S-G-056) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 30 - 5 AAC 92.070.
Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system.
Modify Tier II permit point system as follows:
The Priority for Subsistence Hunting Tier II Permits, and Tier II Subsistence Hunting Permit Point System should be changed to provide for an advantage for subsistence users residing in rural Alaska, and to increase points for the subsistence users residing in rural Alaska.
ISSUE: N/A WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The subsistence users in rural Alaska will not have their subsistence needs met, if they are not given an advantage under the Tier II subsistence hunt to hunt for wild game during the fall hunt.
The Alaska Code of Regulations should be changed to allow a hunt from August 15 to September 15 under the Tier II subsistence hunt.
The subsistence users in rural Alaska will have more opportunity to harvest wild game, if they have a longer hunting season.
The overall points for the Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system should be increased to 180 points to allow for more points for the rural subsistence users, who qualify for subsistence priority due to residing in proximity to the hunt area, and because they depend upon wild game for their livelihood.
The regulatory laws should provide for the subsistence users in rural Alaska to have an advantage in customary and direct dependence on the game population for human consumption as a mainstay of livelihood.
The hunters in rural Alaska are at a disadvantage when they hunt for caribou or moose, due to the competition of hunters in the field, and the lack of hunting equipment to hunt off the highway system.
The points for the first criterion for "customary and direct dependence on the game population by the subsistence user for human consumption as a mainstay of "livelihood" should be 80 points.
The criterion for customary and direct dependence should be kept status quo as eaten or hunted from the game population, and an increase in points for this criterion, because this criterion as it is now written allows all residents in Alaska an opportunity in the point system, and provides an advantage for increase in points for those who have eaten from the game population, if they have more years, in which they have eaten from the game population.
The points for the criterion "ability of a subsistence user in rural Alaska to obtain food if subsistence use is restricted or eliminated" should be increased to 60 points.
This will allow for an increase in points for the subsistence users in rural Alaska to gain more points because they reside within 150 miles from the game hunt area.
The points for "availability of food for purchase in the community where most of the applicant's household store-bought food was purchased, and the "cost of gasoline in the community where most of the applicant's household's gasoline was purchased during the past year" should be increased to 20 points for both criterions.
The increased point system for those rural subsistence users in Alaska will help them to gain more points because the rural areas in Alaska have a higher cost of living allowance than urban areas.
The 10-day appeal process under AAC 92.062 should be changed to 20 days so that subsistence users in rural Alaska can have more time to appeal the decision, when they are eliminated in hunting under the Tier II subsistence permit hunt.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? The subsistence users in rural Alaska will benefit, if they are given an advantage in the Tier II subsistence hunt permits, and given an increase in points in the Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system.
They will be able to hunt without competition from other hunts, during an earlier season under the Tier II subsistence hunting regulations.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one is likely to suffer.
All resident and nonresident hunters will be able to hunt during the regular fall season hunt.
There is ample opportunity for resident hunters and nonresident hunters to hunt and to harvest wild game in Alaska.
There are many game units that all resident and nonresident hunters can hunt in for wild game to provide for their needs.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Change the regulatory laws in Alaska to provide for subsistence use priority for the rural areas in Alaska.

Applicants submitting a Tier II application must show up in person with identification showing place of resident and have their Tier II application signed by someone in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, State Troopers or by a public safety officer before the application can be mailed.
ISSUE: People who no longer live in Alaska are getting Nelchina Tier II permits.
They arrive in Alaska for the hunting season, have no permanent resident, yet they claim they are Alaskan residents.
This makes it easy for them with the permanent hunting license, 60 plus license.
This would force these so-called residents to make two trips to Alaska.

PROPOSAL 32 - 5 AAC 92.070.
Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system.
Modify point system for Tier II subsistence permits as follows: All prior Tier II questions and scoring criterion should be sunsetted.
The Tier II hunt application will ask two questions.
1.
For how long have you hunted this game population (including years you applied but were not drawn)? 2.
How many big game animals have you harvested from this unit? ISSUE: Discrimination by the department.
Persons who fill out Tier II applications alike receive different scoring based on their town of residence.
Tier II preference should be provided based on two factors indicating the applicants historical reliance on the hunted population.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? All credibility in the department and the Board of Game will be lost.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? No.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? All who want fairness and equal scoring to all who demonstrate their reliance on a game population.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Persons who benefit under the unfair "community based" scoring system.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? I thought of adding the mil rate of school property tax and subtracting the average per capita pull tab sales to the existing questions.
I rejected them to get away from residency based criterion.

Knowing or with reason to know, with the use of a helicopter in any manor, including transporting to or from the field of any unprocessed game or parts of game, any hunter or hunting gear, or any equipment used in pursuit or retrieval of big game, air strip construction and site preparation including but not limited to the removing of brush, trees, vegetation, rocks or soil, that allows the use of a fixed wing aircraft for big game hunting purposes; and using an area altered by a helicopter by a fixed wing aircraft to hunt big game from.
Expand
ISSUE: Request of the Board of Game to create a more comprehensive ban on the use of helicopters for the hunting of big game: to include a ban on the use of helicopters to access a hunting area during a closed season and create or improve an area to create or improve a landing strip for fixed-wing use during the open big game hunting season.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? I believe that the Board of Game's intent is to totally eliminate the helicopter from the big game hunting process except for the case where there is a dire emergency.
This ban should include the ban on off-season preparation of landing strips.
This procedure has occurred by at least two helicopter operators in Interior Alaska who then use the strips commercially for big game hunting.
Numerous air strips have been constructed or improved using the helicopter for access and then the same company has returned during the open hunting season with a commercially operated fixed wing aircraft dropping off big game hunters.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A.

Except that a leashed tracking dog handler who qualifies under the permit conditions established by the department may use artificial light to aid in tracking and dispatching a wounded big game animal by permit issued at the discretion of the department: ISSUE: Because use of artificial light as an aid in the taking of big game is prohibited, it is currently illegal to use a handheld or headlamp style flashlight to aid in tracking and recovering mortally wounded big game animals.
This proposal would create an exemption to the restriction on the use of artificial light that would allow a leashed tracking dog handler who possesses a department issued, nontransferable permit to use artificial light as an aid in the tracking and dispatch of a wounded big game animal.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Waiting for sufficient natural light to initiate or resume the tracking of a mortally wounded big game animal will unnecessarily delay, and possibly prevent, the dispatch and recovery of wounded big game animals.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Hasty dispatch and recovery of mortally wounded big game animals will preserve meat quality and prevent unnecessary suffering.

Unlawful methods of taking game; exceptions; and 5 AAC 92.085.
Unlawful methods of taking big game; exceptions.
Allow taking of game from motorized vehicles as follows: Delete restriction to take game from motorized vehicle (not just Units 7 and 15).
Allow "snowmachine to position caribou" statewide not just in Units 22 and 23.
Allow snow machine to be used to harvest wolves and bears in all units not just 19.
Allow swimming caribou and wolves and bears to be harvested in all units, not just 23 and 26.
ISSUE: Unnecessary differing regulations.
Regulations should be uniform statewide.
You should be able to take game from a motorized vehicle and/or a boat, and while swimming and with a .22 rifle in all units, not just 7, 15, 22, 23, and 26.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Hunters will become more confused over what methods are and are not permitted.
Equal protection should mandate uniform methods and means statewide.

Allow use of artificial light and communication equipment as follows: Delete references to laser sights, artificial lights, and phone and communication equipment from hunting restrictions.
ISSUE: Low harvest success rate and low overall harvest of hunted game animals.
Alaskans harvest less than five percent of the harvestable surplus of game animals.
Alaskan hunters should be allowed to use phone and radio communications and laser sights (helps individuals with poor eyesight).
The deletion of these restrictions will increase success of predator hunting coyote, wolf, and bears which will increase prey species as much as any additional harvest.

PROPOSED BY: Michael Todd Williams (HQ-04S-G-009) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 48 - 5 AAC 92.085.
Unlawful methods of taking big game; exceptions.
Clarify restriction against shooting across roads as follows: I would like to propose that the regulation be amended to state, "It is a violation to shoot on, from or across the driveable surface of a constructed roadway when it is passable by a highway vehicle."
ISSUE: "It is a violation for shooting on, from or across the drivable surface of a constructed road."
This regulation, as stated, makes it a judgment call for hunters, trappers and law enforcement as to whether the law is actually being broken.
At one time the regulation was, "Shooting on, from or across the drivable surface of a state maintained highway."
I am unaware of any approval from the Board of Game to change the definition of a "highway".
This regulation was initiated because of safety issues to protect people traveling on roadways and should be enforced, however, the law, as currently stated would make it illegal to shoot on, from or across any constructed road or trail even when not passable by highway traffic.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? As stated now, many access roads and trails, which are seasonal use only to highway vehicles, are illegal to shoot on, from or across.
Shooting on, from or across these old roadways and trails is not a safety threat to the general public traveling in their family car or truck, however a person may be fined for doing such at the discretion of the State Troopers.
I have been informed by the State Troopers that any constructed road or trail that
can, at any time of the year, be traveled by any type of highway vehicle (including four wheel drives) is considered a constructed road whether passable or not.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? This proposal simply clarifies the regulation.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? "constructed roadway" defined and the where they can legally shoot and where distinguish between a legal shooting area Everyone will benefit by having the definition of a hunting and trapping public will understand better as to they cannot.
Even the nonhunting public will be able to and an illegal area without confusion.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? There is really no one who loses anything or will suffer.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Changing the regulation.
There is no need to change the regulation as it is a safety issue.
Adding a sentence to clarify when a road or trail should be considered a drivable surface is all that is needed.

ISSUE: I would like the board to consider re-evaluating the regulations on hunting lynx with dogs.
Allowing local houndsmen to pursue lynx with dogs allows us to work our dogs in the winter, when bear are in hibernation, without leaving the state.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? N/A WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes.
Instead of setting traps and risking injury or catching the wrong game, we can safely catch and release lynx according to size or gender.

PROPOSAL 50 - 5 AAC 92.085.
Unlawful methods of taking big game; exceptions.
Allow use of dogs for recovery of wounded big game as follows: (5) With the aid or use of a dog, except that a) a dog may be used to hunt black bear by permit issued at the discretion of the department: the department may issue a nontransferable permit to an individual who qualifies under the permit conditions established by the department in 5 AAC 92.068: and b) except that a leashed tracking dog may be used to aid in the recovery of a wounded big game animal by permit issued at the discretion of the department: the department may issue a nontransferable permit to an individual who qualifies under the permit conditions established by the department ISSUE: Despite the best intentions of hunters, each season a significant number of game animals are mortally wounded but not recovered.
With the exception of black bears, state law currently prohibits hunting big game with the aid of a dog.
This proposal seeks to create an exemption to the prohibition on the use of dogs that would allow a leashed tracking dog handler who possesses a department issued, nontransferable permit, to use a trained, leashed tracking dog to aid in the tracking and recovery of a wounded big game animal.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Despite the best efforts of hunters, many mortally wounded big game animals will continue to go unrecovered.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? This proposal would increase the recovery of wounded game animals and reduce wounding loss.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? (1) Hunters who might otherwise fail to recover mortally wounded big game animals; and (2) the resource.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Status quo, but many mortally wounded game animals would continue to go unrecovered.

(3) with a longbow, recurve bow, or compound bow, unless the (A) bow is not less than (i) 40 pounds peak draw weight when hunting black-tailed deer, wolf, wolverine, black bear, Dall sheep, and caribou; (ii) 50 pounds peak draw weight when hunting mountain goat, moose, elk, brown/grizzly bear, musk ox, and bison; (B) arrow is tipped with a broadhead and is a minimum of 20 inches in overall length and is a minimum of 300 grains in total weight; (C) broadhead is (i) a fixed, replaceable or mechanical/retractable blade-type broadhead when taking black-tailed deer, wolf, wolverine, black bear, Dall sheep, and caribou; (ii) [A FIXED OR REPLACEABLE BLADE-TYPE BROADHEAD WHEN TAKING]
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Animals could die without recovery by the bowhunter.
Some bowhunters would then search for another animal until a kill was accomplished and the animal recovered.
Also animals could be seen by nonhunters that have been wounded which would negatively affect hunting in general.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? The net affect will be that the `wound loss rate' will be decreased and therefore fewer animals will be lost.
By loosing fewer animals bowhunters will have less incentive to shoot more animals.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? All consumptive and nonconsumptive users of animals.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? All hunting will suffer especially if the `wound loss rate' increases.

Allow use of lighted nocks on arrows in archery hunts as follows: (10) with the taking by bow (A) any type exception of a following archery equipment or devices in a restricted weapons hunt that authorizes and arrow: of electronic device, or light attached to the bow, arrow, or arrowhead with the non-illuminating camera and the use of a lighted nock on the end of the arrow;
ISSUE: Restrictions on the use of lighted nocks on arrows used for bow hunting that would significantly improve the recovery potential of hunted animals.
The proposed regulation change would improve the recovery rate of a hunted animal through the use of this visual aid.
Additionally, the ability of the bow hunter to determine the accuracy of their shot would improve.
The lighted nock attached to the arrow is activated as it passes a magnet attached to the bow itself, not aiding the hunter in the initial locating of the animal.
This newly developed electronic device would not offer the bow hunter an unfair advantage in the targeting or likelihood of a bow successfully hitting the animal.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN approved, then interested electronic tool that would time needed to gain access IF NOTHING IS DONE? If the use of lighted nocks on arrows is not bow hunters would be restricted from utilizing a newly developed improve the recovery rate of hunted animals and potentially lessen the to a shot animal.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes, this proposal would improve the bow hunters' ability to recover a hunted animal, therefore reducing the potential of leaving an animal unrecovered.
Additionally, recovery time would be reduced, lessening the time needed to gain access to the animal for field dressing, and potentially improving the quality of the salvaged meat.

Exclude approved Civil Air Patrol missions from the restriction on same day airborne hunting as follows: (8)(c) a person flying on a regularly scheduled commercial airline, including a commuter airline; or participating in a US Airforce approved Civil Air Patrol Mission; or ISSUE: Civil Air Patrol Mission (CAP) pilots are being penalized for their volunteer efforts.
Every hunting season on numerous days, CAP pilots respond to actual missions which may only take a couple of hours.
Because they have been airborne, the pilots cannot hunt that day.
The regulation "same day airborne" is actually penalizing them.

Allow same day airborne taking of black bear from a bait station as follows: Add Paragraph 8F: taking black bear from a registered bait station, between May 1 and June 30 provided the hunter is at least 300 feet from the aircraft at the time of harvest.
ISSUE: Eliminate the conflict between the provisions allowing bear baiting and the prohibition of same day big game hunting.
Currently there is a disparity in treatment of hunters depending on the method used to access the hunting site.
Boat, air boat, SUV, ATV, RV, and automobile operators
are allowed immediate hunting access to the resource at the bait station while aircraft owners must wait.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Smaller, younger bears usually show up after 3 am, when the aircraft hunter is allowed to hunt causing a harvest of younger bears.
Also causes a disdain and disrespect for the law.
To be surrounded by black bears hours before you can harvest one makes no sense.
What reason is there to discriminate against the hunter gaining access by aircraft.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? The change will allow the more even harvest of black bear sizes and age groups leaving a healthier resource.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? This change will benefit aviation-based hunters including the young hunters and elders who find it difficult to stay up until 3 am to hunt.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? None.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Maintain the status quo.
However, it seems nonsensical that the existing regulations allow you to lure a bear to a bait station, then makes you wait until the next day to harvest them based on your form of transportation to the site.
Looks unnecessarily discriminatory.

Allow baiting of brown bear as follows: Not use bait except for black bears under specific conditions and grizzly bears in all Intensive Management areas by allowing the moving of dead animals and/or kill site waste as long as all edible meat is salvaged from legally harvested animals.
ISSUE: Excessive bear predation on newborn calves in Intensive Management areas.
By allowing the moving of "gut piles" and naturally occurring dead animals to areas of increased observation harvest success of predators will increase.

In all units where Intensive Management areas exist no tag fee, no closed season and the baiting of all bears may occur without special permit.
ISSUE: Encourage the harvest of bears in areas where prey population shortage exists in part due to bear predation.

Urban and rural residents will compete for declining populations to feed their families.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes.

Allow same day airborne hunting of black bears hunted over bait as follows: Add (F) Black bears that are hunted over bait sites that are registered with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to the list of exemptions to the same day airborne rule.
ISSUE: Allow same day airborne hunting of black bears that are hunted over registered bait sites.
This will reduce hunting pressure on black bears along the road system.
Currently, hunters that could access baits via aircraft choose to hunt the road system because if they have a limited time to hunt (a weekend) this regulation unnecessarily limits available hunting time, making a road system hunt more attractive and thus adding additional pressure to the resource along the roads.
In addition, guides that offer fly in hunts over bait can offer an extra day of hunting for the same price, making it more attractive and easier to compete with low priced Canadian black bear hunts.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Reduced hunting opportunity of an underutilized resource.
Loss of revenues in Alaska because hunters looking for guided black bear hunts will choose to hunt in Canada.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Anytime that you can reduce hunting pressure in areas with easy access (the road system) and transfer that pressure to a more remote area, you are more likely to have the opportunity to harvest mature male bears, thus improving the quality of the resource and the quality of the hunt.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? All black bear hunters.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Anti-hunters and opponents to bear baiting (mental anguish only).

Unlawful methods of taking big game; exceptions.
Modify restriction on archery equipment as follows: Equipment: You may not hunt big game with bow unless the arrow is tipped with a broadhead, at least 20 inches in overall length and 650 grains total weight.
For moose and brown/grizzly bear, arrows must weigh 900 grains total weight.
ISSUE: Wound rate is too high in the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area.
The reduction in arrow weight has accelerated the wound rate, due to penetration reduction.
Lightweight arrows shoot well at targets, but are inadequate for hunting big game.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The data from the natal study on arrow penetration in South Africa demonstrated the most lethal arrows are a minimum of 650 grains for big game.
Heavier arrows are needed for "super big" animals Â­ 900 grain.
Many animals will needlessly be lost, if lethal weight standards are not adopted.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Hunters who, after making a good hit, lose the animal because of inadequate penetration to be lethal.
The resource will benefit as wound rates will decline.
Managers will know more closely what human induced mortality is, for sustained yield calculation.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Hunters who do not understand that arrows must have deep penetration to be lethal, as bullets do.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? To require a three inch single blade (two blade) broadhead which is found to have deepest penetration.
It complicated the proposal, but further addresses wound rate reduction.

Modify restriction on archery equipment as follows: Legal equipment for the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area consists of arrows and broadheads with a minimum combined weight of 425 grains for class one big game animals and a minimum of 540 grains for class two big game animals.
ISSUE: The Dalton Highway corridor is an entry level hunt for a significant number of archers.
Many archers are using equipment that is designed for hunting smaller game from tree stands.
This country is highly visible to all.
This has resulted in a perceived increase in the number of marginal hits in a highly visible thoroughfare.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Public relations between other Dalton Highway users and archers will erode.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? This proposal would directly improve the quality of resource and its pursuit.
It provides a better definition of legal arrow weight.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? All archers and the bow hunting community.
Public relations between the archery community and the other wildlife and Dalton Highway users.

This proposal aligns the regulations to allow taking of fox and lynx on the same day a person has been airborne, as long as the person is over 300 feet from the airplane at the time of the taking.
A fur animal is a classification of animals subject to taking with a hunting license and includes beaver, coyote, arctic fox, red fox, lynx, flying squirrel, ground squirrel, or red squirrel that has not been domestically raised.
A furbearer is a classification of animals subject to taking with a trapping license, and includes beaver, coyote, arctic fox, red fox, lynx, marten, mink, least weasel, short-tailed weasel, muskrat, land otter, red squirrel, flying squirrel, ground squirrel, Alaskan marmot, hoary marmot, woodchuck, wolf, or wolverine.

Require signage near trapping areas as follows: Before placing a trap or snare within fifty (50) yards of a publicly maintained trail and/or trailhead and/or developed recreation site, the agency, division, department, or service, responsible for holding of the land shall display a sign at the trailhead or developed recreation site, indicating that traps or snares are in the area.
A sign at publicly maintained trail or trailhead, or a developed recreation site must be at least 8 Â½ X 11 inches in size, be clearly visible, and have letters that are visible in a color that contrasts with the color of the sign, and alerts non-consumptive users that trapping could potentially be occurring within the area.
The sign could state: "Warning, trapping in this area allowed" or "Warning-Trapping Zone, Alaska Administrative Code No. 5 AAC 92.095".
ISSUE: The lack of signage and public notice in areas such as publicly maintained trails and trailheads and developed recreation sites where trapping occurs.
Trappers and non-consumptive users should be granted equal access to our public lands while also being alerted that trapping occurs in these areas during certain times of the year.
One particular problem that could be minimized through this proposal is the lack of knowledge regarding trapping on state and federal lands and the unintentional injury to pets in traps and snares in areas seeing heavy recreational use.
In most areas around the state, voice control of unleashed domesticated animals is legal.
Hunting, search and rescue, and obedience training are also other recognized activities where animals are normally off of leash in public areas and under voice control of their owners.
The lack of signage increases the risk of injury due to unidentified trapping areas.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Some pets, game, and humans will be injured and killed by these traps in unidentified areas containing traps and snares.
The increase of injuries and death of domesticated animals will only result in bad public perception of trapping.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Non-consumptive users, other trappers, and pet owners.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? An identification requirement for trappers to identify their traps through a numbered tagging system was considered reflecting the same regulations passed for Unit 1C, Gustavus area, and for Unit 20B, Fairbanks Management Area (Alaska Administrative Code No. 5 AAC 92.095).
This proposal has not been sought due to issues and conflicts with trappers and anti-trappers potentially moving and sabotaging traps out of legal areas into illegal trapping lands.
We understand these conflicts and are advocating for a simpler precautionary measure to address the increase of injuries and death of domesticated animals, specifically warning signage.

For purposes of this regulation, a "publicly maintained trail" is a trail for which public funds have been expended for construction of improvements such as bridges, culverts, and the placement of fill, or for maintenance activities such as the removal of trees and brush.
ISSUE: Conflicts between trappers and non-consumptive users reduce the enjoyment of Alaska's public lands for some, and should be minimized.
One particular problem that should be minimized is the unintentional killing of pets in conibear and similar traps in areas seeing heavy recreational use.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Conflicts will continue and probably increase in number.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? This proposal concerns conflicts between different user groups.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Responsible trappers and recreational users.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? The proposer has not submitted a proposal for a larger buffer zone, or for a complete ban on trapping near designated trails since trapping is an important traditional use and should continue to occur on lands in Alaska, in addition to non-consumptive uses, in order to provide equal access to game resources.
The proposer also asserts that a ban on conibear traps within a larger distance of trails would likely lessen the risks to non-consumptive users but would also inconvenience trappers.
The proposer believes it would be acceptable as a secondary solution to these issues to enact a regulation providing for a 25 yard set-back to accommodate any inconvenience to trappers.
It is noteworthy to add that the South Central Trapping and Recreational Committee, a subcommittee formed to characterize interactions among trappers and recreational users of trails in southcentral Alaska (units 7, 14A, and 14C), to investigate the extent of problems, if there were any, and to develop recommendations for either non-regulatory or regulatory solutions if needed, unanimously agreed to a similar proposal.
The committee was comprised of three advisory committee members, a representative of the Alaska Trappers Association, and two other participants.
The final consensus of that group is as follows: "No 280 or 330 conibear traps within 50 yards of publicly maintained trails, developed recreation sites, and the trailheads with the exception of submerged traps."
PROPOSED BY: J. Todd Brown and Deborah L. Mole, individually (SC-04S-G-060) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 66 - 5 AAC 92.095.
Unlawful methods of taking furbearers; exceptions.
Require use of breakaway snares for trapping wolves statewide as follows: The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has developed a breakaway snare.
The new regulation would require trappers to use this type of snare for wolves.
ISSUE: At present there is no requirement for trappers to use breakaway snares.
The snares currently used by many trappers catch large animals such as moose.
A snare around the mouth or leg will ultimately result in the animal's death.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? These unfortunate animals will continue to die a slow and painful death.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? No.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Everyone who values the animal resource and does not believe that it should be wasted.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? There would be an expense to replace or modify existing snares, but the cost would be far outweighed by the beneficial effects on the resource.
I know trappers who currently use breakaway snares and they report that their trapping harvest is not diminished by the use of the breakaway snare.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? I did not consider any other solutions.
(I-04S-G-062) PROPOSED BY: Virgil Umphenour ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 67 - 5 AAC 92.110 Control of predation by wolves.
Adopt a statewide brown/grizzly bear conservation and management policy, modify 5 AAC 92.110 to change the title to "Control of predation by wolves and bears" and include the policy by reference, as follows: DRAFT BROWN/GRIZZLY BEAR CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT POLICY PURPOSES OF POLICY
1.
To guide the Alaska Department of Fish 
2.
To assure all management actions provide for the conservation1 of Alaska's brown/grizzly bears, their habitat and food sources, and are consistent with the Alaska Constitution, and applicable statutes.
3.
To encourage review and comment and interagency coordination.
BACKGROUND
Brown/grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) are large omnivores found throughout most of Alaska.
Although they are considered the same species, brown and grizzly bears occupy different habitats and have somewhat different lifestyles and body configurations.
Grizzlies are typically found in interior and northern areas.
They are generally smaller than brown bears and more predatory.
Brown bears live in coastal areas of southern Alaska where they have access to productive salmon streams.
Brown/grizzly bears are found throughout their historic range in Alaska, and unlike populations in the contiguous 48 states, they are not considered a threatened or endangered species.
Estimating precise population numbers is difficult because of the bears' secretive habits and often densely vegetated habitat, but in most places in the state, populations are considered stable 1
For the purposes of this policy, conservation means "the care, protection, management and wise use of wildlife and other natural resources."
or increasing.
Throughout most coastal habitats where salmon are abundant, bear densities typically exceed 175 bears/1,000 km2 (450 bears/1,000 mi2).
A population in Katmai National Park on the Alaska Peninsula was measured at 550 bears/1,000 km2 (1420 bears/1,000 mi2).
In most interior and northern coastal areas, densities do not exceed 40 bears/1,000 km2 (100 bears/1,000 mi2).
Densities as low as 7 bears/1,000 km2 (20 bears/1,000 mi2) have been measured in the eastern Brooks Range.
Extrapolations from existing density estimates yielded an estimate of 31,700 brown bears in 1993.
All indications are that the population has increased in the past decade.
Brown/grizzly bears have relatively low reproductive rates and require abundant resources.
Population stability can be threatened by human-caused mortality and from fragmentation or destruction of habitat.
This combination is present to a sufficient extent on the Kenai Peninsula that brown/grizzly bears there have been designated by the State as a "population of special concern."
To address situations where bear populations have declined because of human activities, the Department has implemented remedial management actions.
In the Kenai situation, a conservation strategy has been developed through a public stakeholder process.
Bears are intelligent animals that learn to adapt to new situations.
This ability, coupled with their enduring drive to rebuild fat reserves prior to denning, makes bears experts in finding ways to get a meal.
Garbage is often a source of food from people.
If this happens, bears learn to exploit human-related food resources and lose their natural tendencies to avoid people.
Frequently, such bears become classified as "nuisance" bears and often are killed in defense of life or property (DLP).
Respected by most, and feared by many, brown/grizzly bears can pose a threat in certain situations.
Statewide, there are an average of about six encounters a year in which a human is injured.
About half of those involve hunters in search of other quarry.
About every two or three years, one of the attacks results in a human fatality.
Public interest in watching brown/grizzly bears has increased dramatically in Alaska during the past decade.
Some of this activity is incidental to other pursuits such as sport fishing, hiking, or flight seeing, but much of it is specifically targeted at bear viewing.
Bear viewing is a rapidly growing industry in selected areas of the state.
The demand exceeds the opportunities provided by such established and controlled sites as McNeil River, Pack Creek and Brooks Camp.
As a result, many entrepreneurs are spreading throughout high-density bear areas to provide clients with viewing opportunities.
Whenever bears and people interact with each other there are potential benefits and dangers.
Displacing bears from feeding sites has serious consequences for them.
Human behavior around bears not only impacts their own personal safety and viewing experience, it also impacts the health and safety of the bears and the people who come to the area later.
When bears and people meet, it is important that bears never get food from them and that people are trained how to react to bear encounters.
Comprehensive education is recognized as a vital component in all aspects of any bear viewing program.
Alaska is world-renowned as a brown/grizzly bear hunting area.
It is the only place in the United States where they are hunted in large numbers, and the vast majority of record book bears come from the state.
An average of about 1,500 bears are harvested each year, and the trend has been increasing.
Many of the hunters are nonresidents and their economic impact is considerable.
Hunters have traditionally been the strongest advocates for bears and their habitat, providing consistent financial and political support for research and management programs.
Because brown/grizzly bears can be both prey and predators, their relationship with people is complex.
In areas where a population of large ungulates has been reduced to low levels by hunting and/or predation, brown/grizzly bears may have a regulating influence on species such as moose.
This is especially true when bears are found in combination with thriving wolf populations.
The role of bears in these situations greatly exacerbates the debate over predator control and complicates evaluation of potential management actions.
GOALS
1.
To ensure the long-term conservation of brown/grizzly bears throughout their historic range in Alaska.
2.
To provide guidelines for developing, implementing, and evaluating any brown/grizzly bear management actions designed to reduce bear predation in specific areas for specific time periods.
3.
To increase public awareness and understanding of the uses, conservation, and management of brown/grizzly bears and their habitat in Alaska.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
1.
Manage brown/grizzly bears as part of the overall predator-prey relationship rather than pursue single species management.
2.
Protect the genetic diversity of brown/grizzly bears.
3.
Continue, and if appropriate accelerate research and management of brown/grizzly bears.
4.
Consider short-term and long-term effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bear populations.
5.
Provide for consumptive and non-consumptive uses of brown/grizzly bears in management plans.
6.
Do not allow identified prey populations to decline to a point where predation keeps them at low levels.
7.
Avoid, where possible, programs that encourage the habituation of bears.
8.
Implement measures to reduce brown/grizzly numbers to allow prey species to increase to population management objectives in areas managed for high consumptive use where predation is keeping prey at low levels.
9.
Wherever possible, reduce brown/grizzly numbers through liberalized seasons, bag limits, and hunting methods and means, and through tag fee waivers rather than implementing formalized control programs.
10.
Conduct brown/grizzly bear control activities for the minimum amount of time necessary to achieve the stated management objective for a specific area.
11.
Establish minimum population goals that ensure the long-term viability of brown/grizzly bears in an area, recognizing the slow reproductive capacity of brown/grizzly bears.
12.
Implement this policy in such a manner that the Department and the Alaska Board of Game can respond promptly to unforeseen situations.
13.
Consider the management goals and objectives of state, federal, and private landowners and work cooperatively with them to design, implement, and evaluate bear control activities.
14.
Pursue informational and educational efforts to help the public understand more about brown/grizzly bears and their management.
15.
Work with enforcement agencies to identify priorities and to assist with and encourage adequate enforcement activities.
16.
Review and recommend revisions to this policy as needed.
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
Management Strategies As it does with most species statewide, the Department will manage brown/grizzly bears differently in different parts of the state.
In some areas, such as the Kodiak Archipelago, portions of Southeast Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, bears are managed for aesthetically pleasing trophy-hunting and viewing opportunities.
In many other areas of the state, brown/grizzly bear populations are largely unaffected by human harvest, but continue to be an important big game species sought by resident and nonresident hunters and are managed to maximize opportunity for harvest.
Keeping brown/grizzly bear populations in balance with wolf and ungulate species will be the strategy in areas that are identified as important for high levels of human consumption of prey species.
Bear hunting will be conducted on a sustained yield basis, except in areas where a bear predation control program is approved.
Harvests will not be allowed to threaten the long-term population survival of brown/grizzly bears.
In most areas of the state, sustained brown/grizzly bear harvests will generally be 4-8% of the estimated total population.
Some brown/grizzly bear populations may be able to sustain a harvest above these guidelines and these will be evaluated for more liberal harvest programs.
In areas where brown/grizzly bears have been identified as an important component in reducing and/or holding prey populations well below objectives, higher harvest levels will be allowed.
.
Lacking precise population data, managers will continue to indirect parameters to assess the status of brown/grizzly bear populations.
All brown/grizzly bears harvested under the general hunting regulations must be inspected and sealed by a Department representative, and hunters must obtain a bear tag prior to going in the field (except where the requirement is waived for residents).
Nonresident, brown/grizzly bear hunters must be accompanied in the field by a registered big game guide or a resident relative.
Sows accompanied by cubs, and the cubs, are protected.
The Department will continue to maintain these strategies and regulations for most of the state, unless it is necessary to consider methods to increase bear harvests as part of a bear predation control program.
Large areas of the state have subsistence brown bear hunts with liberal seasons and bag limits, mandatory meat salvage, and relaxed sealing requirements.
The Department will continue to accommodate subsistence needs and will consider the impacts on subsistence while devising any bear predation control programs.
Bear viewing and bear/human interactions are also important aspects of bear management in Alaska.
Increasing interest in watching bears at concentrated feeding areas such as salmon streams and sedge flats is challenging managers to find appropriate levels of human activities near bears without jeopardizing people or bears.
These burgeoning activities also compete in some cases with more traditional activities such as hunting.
The Department and other land managers will seek to strike a balance between user groups by separating viewing and hunting by time and, if necessary, by space.
Brown/grizzly bear hunting and viewing are compatible in many situations, however there are areas where the two uses conflict.
Management programs should be developed that are not mutually exclusive by avoiding habituation wherever possible.
Adoption and implementation of "best-viewing" practices provide the best way to provide such assurances.
Recommendations on how deal with hunting and viewing in the same location have been made in some brown bear management plans.
In areas where formal bear management plans have been developed, the Department will adhere to the recommendations included in those plans.
Research Strategies Developing and implementing precise, cost-effective methods for determining brown/grizzly bear populations will continue to be a research priority for the Department.
Work to date suggests that no single population estimation method will work across the state given the vast areas, varied topography, differing vegetation communities and great differences in bear density.
Some methods work well in one area but not in another.
Aerial stream surveys, line-transect surveys, capture-mark-recapture, intensive aerial surveys, and DNA analysis are some of the tools that can be utilized to provide population estimates.
PredatorÂ­prey relationships between bears and large ungulates have not been thoroughly examined in most of the state.
Bears use a wide variety of foods seasonally including vegetation, fish, mammals, birds, and carrion and they are exceptionally adaptable in their ability to capitalize on available food resources.
Consequently, the impact of ungulate prey abundance on bears is difficult to ascertain.
Similarly, the impact of bears on prey populations is multifaceted and can be further compounded by the presence of other predators such as wolves.
In areas where bear predation control programs are considered, the Department may devise specific research projects to investigate the interrelationships between brown/grizzly bears and other
species and their habitats.
Alternatively, the Department may use standard survey and inventory data and interpretation of other research results to guide the decision-making process.
Where appropriate, the Department will cooperate in research efforts with other agencies.
Research findings will be reported in a timely fashion and presented in a form that is easily understood by the public.
Information and Education Strategies Public education is critical in any brown/grizzly bear management program.
Perhaps as much as any species in Alaska, bears elicit a wide variety of emotions, have myriad uses, and directly impact peoples' lives both in the field and near settlements.
Clear, objective information is necessary for citizens and managers alike to make wise decisions when dealing with bears.
As the agency primarily responsible for bear management, the Department must take a lead role in producing and disseminating this information.
Bear information will be developed for a wide range of audiences and be delivered in a variety of media.
A principal focus of bear education will be to promote a better understanding of life history, behavior, and habitat associations.
Specific messages will include discussions of bear/human interactions, bear hunting, bear viewing, and bear predation on moose and caribou.
To assure consistent and accurate presentation of bear information, the Department will continue to work with the Alaska Interagency Bear Safety Education Committee.
The Department will strive to include the public in all bear management decisions.
The primary method of public involvement will be through existing local Fish and Game Advisory Committee and Board processes.
Whenever practical or necessary, citizen-driven bear management plans will be sponsored and supported by the Department.
To date, such plans have been developed for Game Management Unit 4, the Kenai Peninsula, and the Kodiak Archipelago.
The Department is committed to implementing as many of the recommendations from bear management plans as possible.
In any situation where the Board or Department believe brown/grizzly bear predation control may become necessary, the public will be informed as soon as possible.
Detailed information on the specific location, the predator, prey and habitat concerns, and the proposed management action and its anticipated costs and duration will be widely disseminated.
Public meetings may be held in the affected area and in major Alaska communities, in addition to regularly scheduled Board and Advisory Committee meetings.
Once implemented, the Department will provide the Board and the public with an annual report and evaluation of the management action.
Control Based on careful consideration of scientific information and public comment, the Department and the Board believe that in limited circumstances in some areas it may be beneficial and appropriate to control predation by bears to achieve population and human use objectives.
The Board may consider brown/grizzly bear control when: 1.
Brown/grizzly bear predation is a significant factor in an unacceptable decline in prey population size or productivity;
2.
Brown/grizzly bear predation is a significant factor preventing recovery of a low density prey population; or 3.
Brown/grizzly bear predation is a significant factor preventing attainment of approved prey population or human-use objectives.
If the Department or the Board determines that one or more of these conditions exist in a given area, at the Board's direction, the Department will prepare an implementation plan for public review that includes: Â· Â· Statement of the proposed action, including methods and means; Justification for the proposed action, including previous measures taken that failed to achieve the brown/grizzly bear and prey objectives and other alternatives considered; Geographical description of the area; Population and human use objectives; Relevant information about wildlife populations and human use, including brown/grizzly bear and prey population status and trend, harvest information, habitat, and estimates of the effects of all predators on prey populations; Estimate of the time and funding necessary to meet population and human use objectives; and, Schedule for update and reevaluation of the program.
Â· Â· Â·
Â· Â·
Brown/grizzly bear control will be implemented using the most humane, selective, and effective methods available.
If additional methods that do not require killing of bears are found to achieve desired results in a reasonable time and with reasonable financial resources, they will be considered.
The Department does not intend to use lethal trapping, aerial shooting, or land-andshoot taking for bear control.
At no time will poisons be used for bear control.
Nothing in this policy affects the authority under state or federal laws for an individual to protect human life or property from bears (5 AAC 92.410).
All reasonable steps must be taken to protect life and property by non-lethal means before a bear is killed.

Not buy, sell or barter any big game animal skulls (except wolves, wolverines, and black bears).
ISSUE: There are multiple problems solved by this proposal: (1) The waste of black skulls as marketable renewable natural resources; (2) the unacceptable level of black on moose and caribou calves; (3) the high probability that black bear baiting will initiative thus resulting in unacceptable low level of black bear harvesting; and (4) hunters in finding a human use for more than a few hides or skulls. bear hides and bear predation be banned by the burden on
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Black bears will not be harvested at acceptable levels.
A natural resource (hides and skulls) will be wasted; either left in the field or relegated to attics, garages, or rotting on the sides of outbuildings.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Hunters will properly salvage hides and skulls for market instead of halfhearted effort required by law that results in trash.
Hides and skulls of bears shot for various crimes (eg. eating four wheeler tires and seats; throwing freezer in yard; stealing fish from boat; eating dog's month supply of dog food, etc.) may actually be salvaged and sealed by the department, thus resulting in more accurate biological harvest data.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Anyone who doesn't need to store another unwanted hide or skull.
Rural residents could add the income from the sales of hides and skulls to their meager trapping incomes.

REMAINDER OF UNIT 14(C) AS DEFINED IN 5 AAC 85.045 KALGIN ISLAND ENTIRE UNIT FAIRBANKS MANAGEMENT AREA]
ISSUE: A statewide prohibition on taking moose calves was adopted by the Board of Game in 2002.
There are a number of disadvantages to this prohibition.
It has inadvertently resulted in regulatory complications, inconsistencies, and legal uncertainties.
It could reduce hunting opportunity in some situations and implies that taking moose calves is never a biologically sound wildlife management tool.
Having a general prohibition on the taking of moose calves at the same time that calf hunts are being conducted in areas approved by the board (e.g., Unit 20A), sends a mixed message to the hunting public.
This makes it difficult to gain public support for calf hunts in areas where they are biologically justified.
Finally, a statewide prohibition reduces management flexibility, which is particularly important in Intensive Management areas.
The rationale for repealing the prohibition on taking moose calves fall into two general categories: regulatory and biological.
Regulatory reasons to eliminate this regulation include: (1) "Antlerless" moose hunts are confounded.
It is now illegal to take an antlerless calf in an "antlerless" hunt (e.g., Minto Flats Management Area Tier II hunt), except in a few specific areas where the board has provided for exceptions.
This makes interpreting moose regulations across the state complicated and confusing; (2) If there are indications that calf harvest is affecting population growth or sustainability in an area, it is simpler to protect calves in that specific area than to prohibit calf hunts statewide; (3) It brings into question the legality of taking a calf moose for potlatches; (4) Currently, 5 AAC 92.265 makes the "one bull" bag limit technically incorrect throughout codified and the regulations booklet (i.e., wording should be changed to "one antlered bull" throughout both documents if 92.265 is not repealed); (5) The prohibition on taking calf moose is inconsistent in that there is no analogous prohibition on taking calves or fawns of other species (e.g., deer, sheep and caribou) in Alaska; and (6) The prohibition on taking calves is more restrictive than other states (i.e., a search of most western states found no other state that protects calves or fawns, except for spotted fawns in California).
Biological reasons include: (1) Calves are not harvested in significant numbers anywhere in the state.
Hunter demand for calves is relatively low compared to bulls and cows, yet calves usually comprise 15 to 25 percent of the fall population; (2) The harvest of calves is more compensatory than the harvest of adults.
Because fewer calves survive through winter than any other age class, a higher proportion of calves that are killed by hunters would die in any case, especially when food is limiting.
Therefore, taking calves should increase yield, as has been demonstrated in Scandinavia and several Canadian provinces; (3) Harvesting calves emulates nature (i.e., natural mortality) more closely than "bulls-only" hunts; (4) Calf hunts can be used as a management tool in areas with low bull:cow ratios to reduce hunting pressure on adult bulls while maintaining hunting opportunity.
This is particularly important in Intensive Management areas where harvest objectives are set in regulation; and (5) Taking calves is an efficient use of the resource in terms of allocation of meat.
That is, families that need less meat can choose to take a calf, rather than a large, adult animal.
A moose calf in the fall provides as much meat as an average sized caribou.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The opportunity to hunt a surplus of calf moose during general season, subsistence and potlatch moose hunts in most areas will continue to be lost, despite the fact that regulated calf harvest has not been shown to be biologically detrimental WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes, additional hunting opportunity will be provided.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Hunters benefit from the opportunity to harvest calf moose in subsistence hunts (e.g., Minto Flats Management Area Tier II hunt), general season bulls-only hunts, and potlatch hunts.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.

Taking moose calves prohibited.
Prohibit calf moose hunts statewide as follows: Calf hunting in Alaska is not legal.
ISSUE: The calf hunt in the Tanana Flats area is an unethical hunt, that and we are trying to get more moose to hunt and the department wants to kill our recruitment off.
That and there is less than 100 pounds of meat there.
Why not let it grow up and shoot it in its second year of life and get more meat.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The moose will be killed off where we will not have any to hunt.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Shameful and downright embarrassing and unethical.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? The people of Alaska because they would have more moose and would not be looked down at for being baby killers.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one would suffer.
We would gain moose and have more of a chance to kill moose in the future.

Emergency taking of game.
Expand the emergency taking of game provision to include unemployed residents as follows: The emergency of taking of game regulations should be changed so that residents, who are unemployed, can take wild game, if the wild game population is held at a sustainable level of conservation.
ISSUE: The residents, who do not have jobs, do not have the means to provide for their livelihood, and cannot purchase meat or groceries from a local grocery store.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? The residents who are unemployed do not have the means to purchase meat to provide for their families.
Food stamps provided by the government do not last throughout the month.
They do not have cash to buy groceries since they do not hold jobs.
They will have hard times in providing for their families.
If they have an opportunity to provide meat for their families in amended Emergency Taking of Game regulations, then they can have wild game for their families to eat.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Not applicable.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? The residents, who do not have the means to provide meat for their families.
They will be able to hunt and take wild game, any time during the year, as long as the wild game population is held at a sustainable conservation level.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one is likely to suffer, if a hunt is allowed for those residents who really need wild game to provide for their families.

Hunter education and orientation requirements.
This proposal simplifies and aligns the process of registering a bait station site to mirror registration hunts.
The registration of a bear bait station would be handled as a registration permit for the person establishing the station, and would allow the department to apply discretionary hunt conditions necessary on an unit by unit basis.
5 AAC 92.XXX.
Permit for hunting black bears with the use of bait or scent lures.
(a) The department will issue a permit for hunting black bear with the use of bait or scent lures as provided for in 5 AAC 92.085(4).

Hunter education and orientation requirements.
... (g) a person may not take a black bear over bait in Units 7, and 14 - 16 with a bow and arrow unless the hunter has successfully completed a departmentapproved bowhunting course; ISSUE: Currently the regulations for bear baiting are found under methods and means.
Restrictions have been added over the years, until the section has become burdensome and confusing.
Registering a bait sight is very similar to other registration permit hunts, and administratively changing the registration of bear baiting sites to be treated as registration permits simplifies the process and allows discretionary conditions to be applied by the local biologist.
Two conditions for bear baiting currently apply to all hunters hunting over bait, not just the hunter establishing the bait station.
The requirement to obtain written permission would remain in the methods and means regulation, and the bowhunting requirements for specific units would move to the hunter education regulation.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Any time a small change is necessary, modifying the methods and means section.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? People registering bait stations.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.

This proposal removes all references to the brown bear management areas but retains the way the hunts are actually implemented and the associated special conditions of the hunts (no tag requirement, limited sealing requirements, meat salvage required, etc.).
The only direct effects are a change to the way the department administers the hunts, and a liberalization of the bag limit.
The current management areas span both unit and regional boundaries.
Currently, one biologist administers the hunts in each management area.
Rewriting the regulations to refer to the subsistence hunts at a unit and/or subunit level allows the hunt to be managed locally by each area biologist.
The current general season bag limit for brown bear in all of the associated units but Unit 9 is already one bear per year that does not count against the one bear per four regulatory year bag limit in other areas of the state.
This proposal aligns the subsistence brown bear bag limit with the general season bag limit throughout the unit.
Brown bear tag fee exemptions must be reauthorized annually.
Continuation of the tag fee exemptions listed above is necessary in order to facilitate the associated brown bear harvest programs.
We believe it would be difficult to document subsistence harvest by residents hunting primarily for food if the tag fee is in effect.
Prior to establishment of the brown bear subsistence areas, little harvest was reported by resident hunters in the areas.
In addition to the tag fee waiver and registration permit, conditions that apply to subsistence hunting in the management areas include: salvaging the meat for human consumption, no use of aircraft for subsistence hunting of brown bears in the Northwest Arctic Brown Bear Management Area (NWABBMA), and keeping the hide within the management area unless the skin of the head and front claws are removed at the time of sealing before being exported from the management area.
The registration permit is a simple way to accommodate local subsistence hunting practices, while still conserving brown bear populations and obtaining harvest data.
Brown bear harvest appears to be within sustainable yield limits in the management areas.
Harvest rates do not appear to have increased in response to registration hunting.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Hunters will continue to be confused by references to a management area with separate seasons and requirements.
As general season bear regulations are liberalized, the department will be unable to simplify and liberalize subsistence seasons and requirements when necessary.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? There will be no change to the resource harvested.

5 AAC 92.420.
Taking nuisance wildlife.
(a) The department shall issue a wild animal control license to a person who pays the required fee, provided the applicant (1) Is at least 18 years of age; (2) completed a hunter education course administered by the department or provided proof of equivalent firearms safety training if firearms are to be used to take or euthanize animals; (3) has not been convicted of a violation of the Fish 
(b) A person with a nuisance wild animal control license may take a nuisance wild animal on land owned by another person when (1) the animal being taken has invaded a dwelling, is causing property damage, or is an immediate threat to health, safety or property; (2) the necessity for the taking is not brought about by harassment or provocation of the animals, or by an unreasonable invasion of the animal's habitat; (3) the necessity of the taking is not brought about by the improper disposal of garbage or a similar attractive nuisance; and (4) all other practicable means to protect property are exhausted before the game is taken.
(c) A person taking nuisance wildlife by lethal means, under this section shall, within 15 days after the taking, submit to the department a completed questionnaire concerning the circumstances of the taking; in addition a person with a wild animal control license shall, by January 31 of each year, submit a summary of all nuisance wildlife activity during the previous calendar year, including numbers, species, locations or animals taken and name and addresses of property owners.
(d) Animals taken under this section may be euthanized pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act but may not be held captive for more than 12 hours unless requested by a department representative or required by a physician for public health reasons.
Circumstances will dictate euthanasia methods available to the operator; however, the method employed should be the safest, quickest and most painless available.
(e) Animals taken may not be sold, traded, bartered or otherwise transferred to any other person.
Animals taken may not be retained for personal use; species required to be sealed under hunting or trapping regulations must be presented to the department for sealing and final disposition.
Species not requiring sealing shall be destroyed at the licensee's discretion.
(f) Wildlife may be released to the wild only with the consent of the land manager or property owner and approval of the department.
(g) As used in this section (1) "property" means (A) a dwelling, permanent or temporary; (B) an aircraft, boat, automobile, or other conveyance; (C) a domesticated animal; (D) fenced gardens and landscaped plants, excluding native vegetation; (E) other property of substantial value.
(2) "nuisance wildlife" means feral domestic bird or mammal, deleterious exotic wildlife, unclassified game, small game, fur animals or furbearers or migratory bird for which there is a federal depredation order for Alaska.
Wildlife may be considered "nuisance" when the animal invades a dwelling, causes property damage or is an immediate threat to health, safety or property.
(3) "take" means taking, pursuing, hunting, fishing, trapping, or in any manner disturbing, capturing, or killing or attempting to take, pursue, hunt, fish, trap, or in any manner capture or kill fish or game.
ISSUE: Legislation recently passed allows private contractors to deal with some nuisance wildlife problems.

PROPOSAL 86 - 5 AAC 92.XXX.
New section.
Establish Tier II harvest level based on average resident harvest level of preceding five years as follows: Tier II harvest level cannot be set above the five year average resident harvest before implementation of Tier II less those who use commercial services to harvest.
ISSUE: Tier II qualification: The state subsistence/Tier II law is an obsolete attempt to keep the feds happy.
It didn't work.
If we must keep this archaic law on the books lets try to keep it from being such a farce.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Tier II applicants who are not subsistence hunters will qualify for Tier II permits.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? N/A WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Actual subsistence hunters will qualify for Tier II.

OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? N/A PROPOSED BY: Brian Peterson (SC-04S-G-020) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 87 - 5 AAC 85.045.
Hunting seasons and bag limits for moose. anterless moose bag limit to one moose every four regulatory years as follows: Restrict
Make permits available to people, based on time, i.e. every four years, for the harvest of antlerless moose.
ISSUE: Reauthorization of antlerless moose hunts.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Affect genetic diversity.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? After evaluating antler restrictions as a basis of harvesting game and the affects of genetic diversity on the Kenai Peninsula moose population.
It is clear, or proven, that the sex traits expressed have a genetic or environmental foundation.
It is clear that if the genetic trait is available that deficiencies in the environment can prevent genetic traits from being expressed.
Antler restrictions are great for enforcement of regulation, however; it is most likely doing more harm than good to the population.
Proper management would prevent this and prevent inevitable future costs of transplanting moose to increase genetic diversity for a healthy population.

(SC-04S-G-055) PROPOSED BY: Darrel Williams, NTC Resource Officer ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 271 - 5 AAC 92.085(1)(B).
Unlawful methods of taking big game; exceptions.
Restrict use of muzzle-loading rifles less than .50 caliber statewide as follows: Simply require a minimum of .50 caliber when using a muzzleloader to take big game.
ISSUE: Current regulation is unnecessarily confusing.
Some calibers of muzzleloaders, with some bullets, are not legal for taking some species of big game.
There is actually no significant difference between two bullets with a difference of only .04 inches.
Many other variables would have much more effect on performance.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Situation will remain confusing and virtually unenforceable, with no benefit to hunters or the resource.
It is not practical for an officer to "pull" a load in the field and weigh the projectile; it has probably never happened.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? No.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Muzzleloader hunters and law enforcement personnel.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? Attorneys and gadgeteers who generally enjoy having life more complicated.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? None.
PROPOSED BY: Jason Buist (HQ-04S-G-118) ******************************************************************************* PROPOSAL 272 - 5 AAC 92.080(7).
Unlawful methods of taking game; exceptions.
Modify the size restriction on killer-type (conibear) traps statewide as follows:
(7) ... the "killer" ["CONIBEAR"] style trap with a jaw spread of less than 13 [11]
ISSUE: Unnecessary limitation of jaw-spread on killer-type traps.
Apparently when the regulation was originally passed, there was only one type of larger killer-type trap available and the regulation was designed to accommodate only that trap.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE? Trappers will not be able to utilize some of the new, more humane killer-type traps that are more efficient.
WILL THE QUALITY OF THE RESOURCE HARVESTED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED BE IMPROVED? Yes.
This change would allow trappers to use more efficient and humane devices coming on the market.
WHO IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT? Trappers, fur bearers, and animal rights activists who want more humane devices used.
WHO IS LIKELY TO SUFFER? No one.
OTHER SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED? Removing all reference to jaw spread.
because a 20-30" spread might be dangerous to humans.
