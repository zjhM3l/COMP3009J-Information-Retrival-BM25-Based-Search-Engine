Preventing kids from becoming bullies and intervening to get bullies back on track can not only protect children from the pain that bullying inflicts immediately, but can protect all of us from crime later on.
Fortunately, programs have been developed that can cut bullying by as much as 50 percent.
They just need to be implemented in America's schools.
How miserable does bullying make its victims? Compared to their peers, kids who are bullied are five times more likely to be depressed.
Bullied boys are four times more likely to be suicidal; bullied girls are eight times more likely to be suicidal.
A Cause of Crime and a Crime Prevention Opportunity Nearly 60 percent of boys who researchers classified as bullies in grades six through nine were convicted of at least one crime by the age of 24.
Even more dramatic, 40 percent of them had three or more convictions by age 24.
Bullying is an early warning that bullies may be headed toward more serious antisocial behavior.
Moreover, victims of repeated bullying can explode in ways that threaten not just the bullies but many others as well.
For example, a Secret Service study of school shootings found that "almost three-quarters of the attackers felt persecuted, bullied, threatened, attacked or injured by others prior to the incident."
Proven Programs Can Cut Bullying in Half-- and Sharply Reduce Crime Research clearly shows that half or more of all bullying can be prevented.
The youngsters with the most serious behavior problems benefit most from effective programs.
But bullying prevention efforts should be based on rigorous scientific research.
Creating an untested program and calling it "bullying prevention" doesn't mean it will work.
Thus far, three models that have been rigorously tested have been proven highly effective:
However, most school districts will probably need additional support in order to adopt the LIFT program in their schools.

These proven programs are relatively inexpensive but it is important that they be fully implemented as they were designed.

It has been able to stop the cycle of aggression for approximately twothirds of the families receiving help.
Money Well Spent Bullying prevention programs are relatively inexpensive for the results they deliver.
The upfront training and supply cost for delivering both the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program and LIFT programs throughout a school district are only a few thousand dollars.
Part-time personnel costs for setting up and administering the program can often be covered by existing funding streams that pay for Safe and Drug Free Schools coordinators.
Modest additional funds will typically be needed to implement LIFT and The Incredible Years.
These investments will more than pay for themselves by reducing special education costs and future crime.
For example, special education classes for 12 years for one child with emotional problems can cost $100,000 more than regular schooling.
Professor Mark A. Cohen of Vanderbilt University estimated that each high-risk juvenile prevented from adopting a life of crime could save the country $1.7 million.
Bullying is not just sad, it's dangerous.
Too many bullies and their victims will go on to commit crimes, including murder.
Others will kill themselves.
Every school should be doing what works to prevent bullying.
When relatively little investment is necessary to cut bullying by as much as half, it's penny-wise and pound-foolish not to invest in these proven crime prevention programs.

" Bullying Prevention Is Crime Prevention Introduction A Call for Action From Law Enforcement "It started out with people calling me names, and then it got worse.
They threw things at me, they vandalized my house, and they sang nasty songs about me in school hallways and classrooms.
It got so bad that I felt like I was in danger physically."
The young woman who spoke those words, Erika Harold, survived bullying and became Miss America 2003.
But her experience in ninth grade left an indelible mark, and Erika has became a powerful spokesperson on the need for bullying prevention programs in schools across America.
Erika is a survivor, but that's not the case for all victims or bullies.
The two suicidal teens who killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher at Columbine High School had been bullied.
Among my fellow members of FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN KIDS is Beth Nimmo, whose daughter Rachel Scott was killed at Columbine, as well as many other crime victims whose lives might have been saved by effective bullying prevention programs.
In the aftermath of Columbine and other school shootings, America can no longer view bullying as simply one of the rites of passage kids must endure.
If any doubt remained, this report shows that bullying spawns loneliness, depression and suicidal tendencies among its victims and crime and violence by perpetrators.
Still, little has been done to put in place proven prevention programs in America's schools.
This report identifies programs that have cut bullying by as much as half and cut future arrests in half.
Those are not just wise investments in school safety, they are wise investments in the public's safety.
When violence occurs, law enforcement must respond appropriately.
Yet, it's far wiser to invest in prevention efforts before anyone gets hurt.
That's why FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN KIDS' 2,000 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors and victims of violence call on local, state and national policy makers to invest in proven anti-bullying measures for every school in America.
Such investments will help potential bullies and their victims live better lives, and make all Americans safer from crime and violence.
R. Gil Kerlikowske Chief of Police, Seattle Chairman, FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN KIDS F IGHT C RIME :I NVEST IN K IDS Chapter One What Is Bullying and How Common Is It? Bullying can have terrible consequences for both the victims and the bullies, and can greatly impact many others in schools and communities across America.
That is especially unfortunate because research shows there are effective and relatively inexpensive ways to reduce bullying.
Before discussing the consequences of bullying and what can be done to stop it, it is helpful to first determine what is bullying, what is not bullying, and how many young people in America are either victims or perpetrators of bullying.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ It is carried out repeatedly and over time.2 Ã¯Â¿Â½ It is targeted towards someone less powerful.
Bullying behavior can be verbal, such as insulting someone or making threats; psychological, such as spreading rumors or shunning the individual; or physical, such as knocking down or hitting the person.3 How Common is Bullying? In 1998, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) What is Bullying? Bullying is not a physical fight between two young people of roughly equal strength who are angry with each other and have not yet learned to settle their differences without violence.
Bullying is also not the friendly back-and-forth teasing that sometimes takes place between friends.
According to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), there is a growing consensus that bullying has three components:1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Bullying is aggressive behavior or intentional "harm doing" by one person or a group.
3 out of 10 Kids Are Either Bullies, Victims of Bullies, Or Both Bully only 13% Both victim and bully 6% Neither bully nor victim 70% Victim only 11% National Institute of Child Health and Human Development survey of 15,686 students Bullying Prevention Is Crime Prevention concluded a nationally representative survey that 26 percent of boys were moderate to on bullying of 15,686 students in grades six frequent bullies while 14 percent of girls were 4 The survey showed that 3.2 through ten. moderate to frequent bullies.
Twenty-one million youths were victims of bullying percent of boys were moderate to frequent nationwide, and 3.7 million were bullies.
The victims of bullies while 14 percent of girls youths were counted as moderate to frequent were victims that often.
Girls tended to be bullies if they participated in bullying bullied more often by being repeatedly "sometimes" to "several times a week."
Both belittled about their looks, through sexual the above figures include 1.2 million youths comments or with rumors.
They also were hit, who both bullied others slapped, or pushed, and were themselves although not as frequently victims of bullying.
This as boys.7 "The survey showed that means 30 percent of young 3.2 million youths were The NICHD study results people nationwide at the were similar to studies time of the survey were victims of bullying from other countries and involved in moderate to nationwide, and 3.7 other studies done in the frequent bullying, either as United States.

While that is less than the NICHD When it came to gender, girls were less percentage, the Justice Department survey likely than boys to be either bullies or victims showed that the number of victims is but still experienced high rates of either increasing, not decreasing.9 bullying or being bullied.
The study found F IGHT C RIME :I NVEST IN K IDS Chapter Two Bullying Begets Depression, Suicide, Crime and Violence Bullying occurs all across America and in other countries as well.
Many adults have distinct memories from their childhood of occasions where they either intimidated other children or were bullied themselves.
Often these memories are dismissed with the expression, "kids sure can be cruel!" Only recently has chronic and serious bullying begun to be scientifically linked to more serious problems such as a greater likelihood to commit crimes later in life and higher suicides.
found that there were over three million victims of bullying in America (2.0 million who are victims only, and 1.2 million other youths who are both victims and bullies).10 In a survey commissioned by the Kaiser Family Foundation, more eight to 15 year-olds picked teasing and bullying as "big problems" than those who picked drugs or alcohol, racism, AIDS, or pressure to have sex.
More African Americans saw bullying as a big problem for people their age than those who identified racism as a big problem.11 Though they almost never forget their tormentors, many children who are bullied can quickly move beyond the bullying once it subsides.
Consequences for the Victims The NICHD study of bullies and victims Frequently Bullied Kids More Depressed, Suicidal Girls 26% Not a bully nor bullied Frequently bullied Boys 16% 8% 8% 3% 1% 1% Moderate to severe depression Suicidal British Medical Journal 4% Moderate to severe depression Suicidal Bullying Prevention Is Crime Prevention For many victims of bullying, however, the impact can be very serious: Ã¯Â¿Â½ In a study done in Australia, six percent of boys and nine percent of girls reported staying home to avoid being bullied.12 Ã¯Â¿Â½ In a review by British researchers of ten studies of bullying, every one of the studies reported higher levels of depression among young people who were victimized by their peers.13 Ã¯Â¿Â½ In a study done in Finland, boys who were frequently bullied were over five times more likely to be moderately to severely depressed, and four times more likely to be suicidal than those who were not being bullied, while frequently bullied girls were over three times more likely to be moderately to severely depressed, and eight times more likely to be suicidal.14 Unfortunately, the negative effects of bullying do not disappear with time.
An article in the Journal of the American Medical Bullies More Likely to Carry Weapons to School and be Injured Never bullied others Bullied others at least once a week in school Association (JAMA) reported that "individuals formerly bullied were found to have higher levels of depression and poorer self-esteem at the age of 23, despite the fact that, as adults, they were no more harassed or socially isolated than comparison adults."15 No figures are available on the total number of actual suicides resulting from bullying, either when people are young and enduring the bullying or later because of the residual effects of earlier bullying.
With over three million moderate-to-frequent bullying victims in America, however, it is certain that this is a life-or-death issue for many people.
Bullying: an Early Warning Sign of Criminal Behavior Without intervention, bullies pose a serious risk to fellow students and others.
The NICHD survey indicates, for example, that compared to the students in grades six through ten who reported they were not involved in bullying, the most serious bullies (those who both bullied others at least once a week and continued with their bullying away from school) were seven times more likely to report they had carried a weapon to school in the prior month.
The more serious bullies were also three and a half times more likely to have been in a fight where they sustained an injury serious enough to require treatment by a nurse or doctor.16 Specific studies of bullying also show that bullies' anti-social behavior is not limited to school, but continues in other settings and into adulthood.
Approximately 60 percent of boys who were classified by researchers as bullies in grades six through nine were convicted of at least one crime by the age of 24, compared to only 23 percent of the boys who were not characterized as bullies or victims.
Even more dramatic, 40 percent of the boys who were bullies compared to 10% of those who were neither victims nor bullies -- had three or more convictions by age 24.17 46% 43% 16% 8% Carried a weapon at school in the last month Injured in fight in last year requiring treatment by nurse or doctor Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine F IGHT C RIME :I NVEST IN K IDS Those Who are Both Victims and Bullies May be More At-Risk...and More Dangerous The NICHD bullying survey found that over six percent of students, or 1.2 million young people, reported that they were both victims and perpetrators of bullying.
The researchers found that those who were both bullies and victims often were caught in the worst of both worlds.
They suffered from many of the problem behaviors that bullies exhibited, such as higher rates of smoking and lower academic achievement, but unlike other bullies, these youngsters also experienced problems similar to those of the young people who were victims only, such as trouble developing friendships and loneliness.
This led the researchers to conclude that "youth who both bully others and are bullied may represent an especially high-risk group."18 Not only are these youths at greater personal risk from problem behaviors, but their angry responses to being bullied also puts other people at risk.
For example, experts from the Secret Service were called in to help develop profiles of the Columbine and other school shooters.
They found that most of the shooters had been bullied before choosing to attack their perceived tormentors.
The Secret Service experts reported: Almost three-quarters of the attackers felt persecuted, bullied, threatened, attacked or injured by others prior to the incident...
Bullying was not a factor in every case, and clearly not every child who is bullied in school will pose a risk for targeted violence in school.
Nevertheless, in a number of the incidents of targeted school violence studied, attackers described being bullied in terms that suggested that these experiences approached torment.
These attackers told of behaviors that, if they Boys Who Bully Are More Likely To Commit Crimes 60% Bullies Neither Bullies nor victims 40% 23% 10% At least one conviction by age 24 3 or more convictions by age 24 Blueprints for Violence Prevention occurred in the workplace, likely would meet legal definitions of harassment and/or assault...In some of these cases the experience of being bullied seemed to have a significant impact on the attacker and appeared to have been a factor in his decision to mount an attack at the school.
In one case, most of the attacker's schoolmates described the attacker as `the kid everyone teased'.
In witness statements from that incident, schoolmates alleged that nearly every child in the school had at some point thrown the attacker against a locker, tripped him in the hall, held his head under water in the pool or thrown things at him.
Several schoolmates had noted that the attacker seemed more annoyed by, and less tolerant of, the teasing than usual in the days preceding the attack.19 Obviously, most victims of bullying don't respond with murder, and having been bullied by no stretch of the imagination relieves a killer of responsibility for such a crime.
But punishment after the fact will always be too little and too late to undo the agony such violence leaves behind.
Only prevention comes in time to keep innocent people from becoming victims.
Bullying Prevention Is Crime Prevention Chapter Three Bullying Can Be Prevented Bullying has been with us forever.
That may lead some people to conclude there is nothing that can be done to prevent it.
While eliminating all bullying may be unrealistic, research shows that as much as half of all bullying can be prevented,20 and that the young people with the most severe aggressive behaviors can benefit the most from efforts to reduce bullying and aggression.21
Program was first developed in Norway, following the suicide of three 10-14 year old boys who had been bullied.22 It has now been implemented in several hundred schools in the United States and around the world, including an evaluation that included 39 schools in six school districts in South Carolina.
The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program begins with a school survey to determine how common bullying is, so parents, teachers, and especially principals and administrators can begin to assess the extent of bullying.
Next training is held before the school year starts with the school principal, the anti-bullying coordinator for that area or school district, other school personnel (including nonteaching staff), and selected students and parents.
This further raises awareness and begins the education process on what works to prevent bullying.
Regular school rules against bullying are established, class meetings on bullying are held, and teachers are encouraged to establish positive consequences for those who help prevent bullying and negative consequences for those who engage in bullying.
Adequate adult supervision of outdoor areas, hallways and other specific areas where bullying is likely to take place is implemented and adults are also urged not just to be present, but "to intervene quickly and decidedly in bullying situations."
Parents are included in the school-wide Proven Programs Anti-bullying programs (and the broader anti-aggression programs that are discussed below which also prevent bullying) strive to put more young people onto a trajectory that sends them in the direction of success in school, strong social ties, and productive lives.
This is a trajectory that also lifts them above failure, violence, and ultimately prison.
No one should assume this is easy, and overly simplistic programs are unlikely to be effective.
Serious science should be continually employed to design, test, and replicate new and existing anti-bullying programs so they can have the greatest impact on protecting young people and the larger community.
However, one antibullying and two anti-aggression programs have already proven they can produce results.
The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program The Olweus Bullying Prevention F IGHT C RIME :I NVEST IN K IDS effort.
Finally, individual interventions are initiated with individual bullies and victims.
The talks with bullies often include their parents and reinforce the message that bullying will not be allowed.
The victims are typically reluctant to get adults involved, so in the meetings with victims and their parents the key message is that there are adults at the school who "are both willing and able to give [the victim] any needed help."The goal of the program is to ensure that the whole school, and not just a few teachers, will come together and act to make sure students know that "bullying is not accepted in our class/school, and we will see to it that it comes to an end.

program, typically delivered in 12 classroom sessions, puts a special emphasis on the role of bystanders in preventing school violence or bullying.
There is anecdotal evidence from this program that the emphasis on bystanders is valuable.
At Tahlequah Middle School, in Tahlequah OK, where the program had been implemented, within a few hours after a new student showed up at school with a knife, bystanders had placed four notes in the school's warning box to alert school officials to this danger.
After one program session at Lake Worth Middle School, in Lake Worth FL, two students came forward to report to the police officer who delivered that session that another student said he was planning to bring a weapon to school to attack two teachers.41 Police officers and sheriffs are increasingly delivering the Aggressors, Victims and Bystanders program.
One of the developers of the program, Dr. Ron Slaby, who is Senior Scientist at the Education Development Center and a lecturer at Harvard, was initially unsure about having law enforcement officers deliver the program, but Slaby has become convinced that the officers can be effective.
With the leadership of Palm Beach County School District Police Chief, James Kelly, a new center in Palm Beach Florida has been set up that will help train officers, deputies and others in this approach.
Because of the wide potential for using officers and sheriffs to deliver this program, a well-designed evaluation that tests this program's effectiveness when delivered by sheriffs and police officers would be very useful.
Operation Respect was founded by Peter Yarrow, of the music group Peter, Paul, and Mary.
Former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend has recently joined the effort as president.
A preliminary survey showed that a high percentage of teachers/counselors reported lessened Other Interesting Programs Many anti-violence and anti-bullying programs are emerging across America.
Some of these efforts may not have as great an impact on preventing bullying behavior as the proven programs cited above.
However, there are no doubt good programs being developed that lack only the expensive and time consuming studies necessary to document their effectiveness.
Other programs are being evaluated but the results are not yet available.
Over time a number of excellent new approaches will certainly emerge from the serious efforts now underway that will further refine the antibullying field.
Two programs of particular interest, while not yet having multiple well-designed evaluations with very strong results that would meet tough standards for "proven programs," are certainly worth more attention because they have positive initial evaluations and are beginning to be widely implemented across America.
They deserve the investments needed to complete additional rigorous evaluations that will show how well they work as they are currently being delivered.
The Aggressors, Victims, and Bystanders program has been chosen by the Department of Education as a Promising Program for its Safe and Drug Free Schools program.39 An evaluation of the program found that it significantly reduced bystander support for aggression through either passive acceptance (e.g. letting a fight start without doing anything to stop it) or active encouragement (e.g. encouraging other kids to fight).40 This Bullying Prevention Is Crime Prevention bullying (92 percent), name calling (86 percent), and hostility, hitting and angry explosions (85 percent) in their classrooms as a result of the anti-bullying program.
The survey also indicated this program may be especially effective with elementary school children.42 Operation Respect has already provided workshops for 20,000 educators.43 Many states have begun to develop their own support for anti-bullying programs as well, and some states are beginning to take the important step of mandating anti-bullying programs for schools in their states.
Meanwhile, many education professionals are continuing to develop their own curriculum and seminars.44 established and publicized.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Adequate supervision of young people is essential.
This is especially necessary on playgrounds and in hallways where most incidents of bullying take place.
Often the problem is that adult supervisors do not intervene routinely to prevent bullying and teach positive social skills.
In other cases, enough supervisors are not available to adequately protect children from bullying.
If that is the case, that also needs to be addressed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ These efforts should be maintained over time.
This cannot be a one-time effort.
Some aspects of the program should be repeated once a year, while others, such as closer supervision of hallways and playgrounds, should continue throughout the school year.45 Advice from the Justice Department For schools testing new programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) office in the Department of Justice offers some advice in its report, Bullying in Schools,by Rana Sampson.
The report makes a number of suggestions, including: Ã¯Â¿Â½ The school principal should be actively involved in the anti-bullying efforts.
Without the principal's support the program is likely to have only limited impact.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A "whole school" approach such as the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program should be used.
Such an approach enlists the entire school in a number of ways and therefore is more likely to be effective than programs that address bullying from only one or two directions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ An effort to encourage reporting of bullying should be part of any "whole-school" approach.
For example, a "bully box" in the school will allow children and youths to anonymously alert teachers to any bullying problems or possible attacks on the school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Clear, anti-bullying rules need to be What Doesn't Work The COPS report also advised against relying on some strategies such as: Peer mediation approaches.
As Sue Limber of Clemson University warns "bullying involves harassment by powerful children of children with less power."46 Therefore, Limber argues, mediation approaches might even further victimize bullied children by assuming they have the power, without adult intervention, to prevent the bullying.
Zero tolerance policies.
The report says that the zero tolerance approach "may result in a high level of suspensions without full comprehension of how behavior needs to and can be changed.
It does not solve the problem of the bully, who typically spends more unsupervised time in the home or community if suspended or expelled."
Simply advising victims to "stand up to bullies."This can be unproductive or even dangerous without adequate adult support to prevent bullying in the schools.47 F IGHT C RIME :I NVEST IN K IDS Chapter Four Money Well Spent The proven programs are relatively inexpensive, especially considering the results they deliver.
Often, much of the cost of setting up of the programs and the training of students can largely be covered by existing funding streams that already pay for the salaries of coordinators, counselors, and teachers for whom this work becomes part of their jobs.48 Program.
These personnel are already fully funded and the program is already one of the scientifically proven approaches approved for these coordinators to use in keeping schools safe and drug free.

Studies of generally aggressive behavior (as opposed to studies specifically of bullying behavior) also show similar results.
While many aggressive children do not become violent adults, too many do.
Criminologist David Hawkins and his colleagues reviewed studies showing the link between early and later aggression and concluded that "these studies show a consistent relationship between aggressiveness in males measured from age six and later violent behavior."
One study of ten and thirteen-year-olds showed that twothirds of the boys with high teacher-rated aggression scores had criminal records for violent offenses by age 26.

These interventions took place before the Columbine and other school tragedies.
As a result of the findings that bullying contributed to the Columbine and many other school shootings, schools currently using this approach may find even greater success in reducing bullying now that teachers, parents, administrators, and students are likely more concerned about bullying.

The effect size for the difference in results was 1.5.
Effect sizes are used as a statistical way to compare results across studies, and an effect size of 1.5 is "considered `very large' for a psychological intervention."
32 This is a difficult issue for many parents and schools because children are often misdiagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) today.
Children with a diagnosis of ADHD, and even children with less clinically significant problems such as restlessness, are not in any way guaranteed to be more violent later in life, but there is consistent research showing that a greater proportion of children with those problems will become violent criminals than children without such difficulties.
