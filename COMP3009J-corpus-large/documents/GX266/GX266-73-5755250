Federal Register / Vol. 68, No. 228 / Wednesday, November 26, 2003 / Notices gnatcatcher and 11other identified federally listed animal species through issuance of an ESA incidental take permit.
The NCCP/HCP, coupled with an Implementation Agreement, could also form the basis for issuing an incidental take permit for identified non-listed animal species, should these identified species be listed during the term of the permit.
Although take of plant species is not prohibited under the ESA, section 9, identified plant species, both listed and unlisted, would be included on the permit in recognition of the conservation benefit provided for the species if the Service finds these species are adequately covered under the NCCP/HCP.
On March 25, 1993, the Service issued a Final Rule declaring the California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (50 FR 16742).
The Final Rule was followed by a Special Rule on December 10, 1993 (50 FR 65088) to allow take of the California gnatcatcher pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA.
The Special Rule defined the conditions under which take of the coastal California gnatcatcher resulting from specified land use activities regulated by state and local government, would not violate section 9 of the ESA.
In the Special Rule the Service recognized the significant efforts undertaken by the State of California through the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991 and encouraged holistic management of listed species, like the coastal California gnatcatcher, and other sensitive species.
The Service declared its intent to permit incidental take of the California gnatcatcher associated with land use activities covered by an approved subregional NCCP prepared under the NCCP Program, provided the Service determines that the subregional NCCP meets the issuance criteria of an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA and 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2).
The Authority currently intends to obtain the Service's approval of the NCCP/HCP through a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit.
Proposed Action The Service will prepare a joint EIR/ EIS with the Authority, lead agency for the NCCP/HCP.
The Authority will prepare an EIR in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act.
The Authority will publish a separate Notice of Preparation for the EIR.
The purpose of this subregional NCCP/HCP is to establish a long-term plan for the conservation of covered species and the habitats associated with Authority activities.
The proposed NCCP/HCP will give the Authority increased regulatory certainty, and give the Service and the CDFG increased certainty that lands will be conserved to provide regional habitat resource protection.
The Authority proposes to approach project design, implementation, and maintenance in a systematic, ecologically sensitive manner which focuses on the avoidance and minimization of impacts to sensitive species and habitats that may be affected by Authority activities.
Authority activities subject to the NCCP/HCP are anticipated to include certain specific development projects (such as expansion of existing reservoirs, relocation of pipelines, and construction of new pipelines and support facilities) and operation and maintenance activities necessary to ensure the proper functioning of existing and future Authority facilities.
Preliminary Alternatives The EIR/EIS for the San Diego County Water Authority Subregional NCCP/ HCP will assist the Service during its decision making process by enabling us to analyze the environmental consequences of the proposed action and a full array of alternatives identified during preparation of the NCCP/HCP.
Although specific programmatic alternatives for the proposed action have not been prepared for public discussion, the range of alternatives preliminarily identified for consideration include: Alternative 1, No Action/Project-byProject Authorization The Authority would continue to seek permits for activities that could affect listed species through continuing project-by-project review and permitting pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act and sections 7 and 10 of the ESA and in accordance with existing habitat management efforts.
The Authority would not participate in an existing NCCP/HCP nor prepare their own plan.
Alternative 2, Participation in an Existing NCCP/HCP The Authority would participate in one or more of the existing land-usebased subregional NCCP/HCPs in the region, such as the Multiple Species Conservation Program in the southern and central portions of San Diego County, the draft Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Program in the northwestern portion of San Diego County, and/or the draft Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan in southwestern Riverside County.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Notice of Availability National Park Service, Interior.
Notice of availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study.
AGENCY: ACTION: SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332; 40 CFR 1503.1) the National Park Service announces the availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study.
The document describes ways that the National Park Service can assist in preserving Gullah culture (more commonly known as Geechee in Georgia and Florida) by outlining four management alternatives for consideration by Congress, including a no-action alternative.
The DEIS analyzes the environmental impacts of those alternatives considered for the future protection, interpretation, and management of Gullah cultural resources.
The study area stretches along the southeastern United States coast roughly from the Cape Fear River in North Carolina to the St. John's River in Florida and approximately 30 miles inland.
DATES: There will be a 60-day comment period beginning with the Environmental Protection Agency's publication of its notice of availability in the Federal Register.
ADDRESSES: Copies of the DEIS are available by contacting Cynthia Porcher, Charles Pinckney National Historic Site, 1214 Middle Street, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, 29482.
An electronic copy of the DEIS is available on the Internet at http://www.nps.gov/sero/ ggsrs/gg_res.htm.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Park Service held community and stakeholder meetings to gather advice and feedback on desired outcomes of the study.
The meetings assisted the National Park Service in developing alternatives for managing
associated cultural and natural resources and creating interpretive and educational programs.
The alternatives were presented at community forums in October and November 2002.
Responses from the meetings were incorporated into the four alternatives described in the study.
Under Alternative A, three coastal centers would be established through partnerships with government agencies and nonprofit organizations.
The centers would be dispersed along the southeastern U.S. coast where host and neighboring communities could provide support.
The centers would interpret the history and evolving culture of the Gullah people from colonial times to the 21st Century and would provide learning opportunities for the casual visitor as well as residents of communities.
Under Alternative B, existing national park units would collaborate with state and local park sites located in the project area to administer multi-partner interpretive and educational programs.
Cooperative agreements among agencies would identify and delegate administrative, operational, and program functions for each partner.
Under Alternative C, a National Heritage Area would be established to connect and associate Gullah resources.
The National Park Service would provide startup and related administrative assistance for the heritage area.
Overall management of the heritage partnership would eventually be administered by one or more local entities that would guide and oversee the goals and objectives of the heritage area.
Under Alternative D, Alternatives A and C would be combined into a single alternative.
It is the practice of the National Park Service to make comments, including names and home addresses of respondents, available for public review during regular business hours.
Anonymous comments will not be considered.
We will make all submissions from organizations or businesses, and from individuals identifying themselves as representatives or officials of organizations or businesses, available for public inspection in their entirety.
However, individual respondents may request that we withhold their names and addresses from the public record, and we will honor such requests to the extent allowed by law.
If you wish to withhold your name and/or address, you must state that request prominently at the beginning of your comment.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia Porcher, (803) 881Â­5516 or John Barrett, 404Â­562Â­3124, extension 637.
