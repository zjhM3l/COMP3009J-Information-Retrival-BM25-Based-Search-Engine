Part I What is Integrated Pest Management? Prologue This manual is designed to help school officials understand the principles of Integrated Pest Management and to aid them in implementing those principles into a comprehensive pest control program in their facilities.
Successful pest control has relied on the basic concepts of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) since human beings first attempted to protect their health and property from pests.
In 1955 the National Pest Control Association produced one of the first manuals that dealt with the various steps involved in IPM as we define it today.
The rapid development of the modern residual pesticides during World War II made pest control very effective, very economical, and very easy to accomplish.
The use of these residual pesticides was so effective that in many instances when problems did occur, or clients demanded an even more total elimination of pests, the answer was to simply use more pesticides.
There have been two consequences of this trend of accelerating pesticide usage.
In a few instances "super" pests have appeared that are resistant to common pesticides.
Additionally, a growing segment of our population has become alarmed over the possibility that adverse health effects of this trend might occur.
In the past five decades the research and development work done by chemical manufacturers and the research done by governmental agencies and universities has greatly increased the knowledge of the biology and habits of pests.
As this body of knowledge grew, our ability to control the pests increased dramatically.
Today, this expansion of our current knowledge allows us to control pests more effectively while using minimum amounts of pesticides.
An objective of this manual is to address both of these issues as they may impact schools.
Definition of IPM Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in schools involves the cooperation between school staff and pest control personnel or other specialists to use a variety of nonchemical methods as well as pesticides, when needed, to reduce pest infestations to acceptable levels and to minimize children's exposure to pesticides.
As defined by the Structural Pest Control Act (225 ILCS 235/3.24) IPM is a pest management system that includes the following elements whenever possible: 
Advantages of IPM

2 Disadvantages of IPM

Costs of IPM An IPM program may require additional labor for more inspections by the pest control technician.
Additionally, implementing nonchemical control procedures, such as building modifications or repairs, monitoring and evaluation efforts, and procedural changes in daily routines may result in increased costs.
However, improvement of the physical condition of the school may result in savings in other areas, such as improved energy efficiency for heating and/or cooling.
Part II Setting Priorities for IPM Steps to Build an IPM Program Integrated Pest Management recognizes that not all bugs are bad and need to be killed immediately.
On the other hand, some insects and rodents can be very dangerous to the safety or health of the occupants of the facility, and must be eliminated as quickly as possible.
Therefore, it is very important that the school staff and the pest control operator or school pest control technician establish well-understood guidelines of action in response to reports of pests present in the facility.
Step 1: Determine Tolerance of Pest Activity Roaches.
There should be no tolerance for roaches in any area of the facility.
They can carry several pathogens that can cause health problems under certain circumstances.
Problems can range from salmonella poisoning to severe asthmatic reactions in young children.
Cereal Pests.
These infest flour and other cereal grain products, and should not be tolerated.
Ingestion of insects or pathogens in infested grain products can cause illness in anyone who consumes the food.
House Flies.
In nonfood areas, these are more of a nuisance than a threat to the health of the children and staff.
Thus, an occasional house fly in a nonfood area should not be cause for alarm.
If there are many flies in a nonfood area, this could be a sign of a sanitation problem that needs to be corrected.
House flies in a food area cannot be tolerated.
The pads on the feet of the flies are sticky and will pick up debris from wherever the fly lands.
If the fly should land on garbage or animal feces and then fly into the kitchen and land on exposed food, some of that debris will be transferred to the food.
Other Flies.
Flies such as the Cluster Fly or the Carrion Fly are often found throughout a school building.
Small numbers do not constitute a health threat, but they can be a nuisance and should be treated as such.
However, many flies in a room or area may indicate a problem that needs to be investigated.
Ants.
In a food area they should be eliminated quickly as they may contaminate open food, although to a lesser degree than flies or roaches.
In nonfood areas they are strictly a nuisance and should be handled as such.
Ants outside a building that are not migrating into the building are more beneficial than detrimental and should be left alone.
Occasionally Invading Pests.
These include such pests as Crickets, Spiders (except Brown Recluse and Black Widow Spiders) Boxelder Bugs, Millipedes, Clover Mites (not Fowl Mites), Springtails, etc.
These insects are not a health threat and only become a nuisance if they appear in large numbers or they are found near open food areas.
Stinging or Biting Insects.
These can cause a serious health threat to some children and adults who are hyperallergic to stings or bites.
For this reason, there should be no tolerance for these pests either inside or outside of the building.
The most likely pests found in Illinois schools in this group are bees, yellowjackets and other wasps, brown recluse and black widow spiders.
3 Mice.
There should be no tolerance in any area of the school for mice.
They contaminate food by gnawing into unopened packages and by urinating or defecating on open food or food preparation surfaces.
Their constant gnawing can cause damage to the building and, in extreme cases, may cause an electrical short and resultant fire.
If a student or staff person attempted to pick up a mouse, he or she could receive a rather nasty bite.
Rats.
There should be no tolerance for rats inside or outside of the school building at any time.
Like mice, they can contaminate food through gnawing into packages and urinating or defecating on open food or food preparation surfaces.
Their gnawing habits can cause damage to the building and they could cause a fire by gnawing into an electrical wire.
A bite from a rat can be more serious than one received from a mouse.
Birds.
In general birds should not present a problem for a school.
However, bird nesting on school buildings should be discouraged to prevent accumulation of droppings that may harbor pathogens and to prevent migration of pests such as fowl mites or carpet beetles from an abandoned nest into classrooms.
Raccoons.
These are protected animals and can only be removed from a school by a specialist who is licensed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Raccoons are nocturnal and normally would not contact students or staff.
However, they should be removed from the facility as they can be physically destructive to the building.
They can get into garbage and create a mess that is attractive for flies and other pests.
Additionally, they can carry fleas, and there have been a few isolated cases where children have been bitten by raccoons.
Squirrels.
These are protected animals and can only be removed from a school by a specialist who is licensed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Squirrels can cause physical damage to a building and they carry fleas.
They tend to be more "people tolerant" and will feed on food scraps found on the school grounds or in the garbage area during the daytime.
This will increase the possibility of a student coming in contact with one.
Bats.
These are protected animals and can only be removed by a specialist who is licensed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Although bats are nocturnal and are beneficial in their feeding on night-flying insects, they can pose some problems for a school.
If they are allowed to roost in a building for a long time, the accumulation of bat droppings can become a health hazard, and can cause physical damage to the building.
If a sick bat on the playground is handled by a student, there could be a serious health problem.
Step 2: Determine Response Times If IPM is to succeed, response to a pest problem must be both timely and effective.
However, the facility managers must recognize that some pest problems are more serious than others.
For example, a pest problem that threatens the physical safety of students and/or staff should have a higher priority than the mere presence of a single nonthreatening bug.
Consequently, facility managers and their pest control staff may want to agree on the response times for pests (Table 1).
Table 1.
Response by Pest Control Staff to Pest Problems Pest Response Time Condition Not over four hours Potential physical harm to students or staff Rodents where students or staff are likely to contact them; Wildlife (raccoons, opossums, feral cats, bats, etc.) where students or staff are likely to contact them Stinging or biting insects One working day One working day One to two working days Potential medical harm to students or Fleas, Lice, Bed/Bat bugs and Poisonous spiders staff Potential for food contamination Sighting of large numbers of nonthreatening bugs Cereal pests, Roaches, Rodents, Ants in kitchen or food storage areas and Flies around food.
Ant or Termite colonies in the building; movement into the building of Millipedes, Crickets, Boxelder bugs, etc.
4 Step 3: Establish Periodic Inspection and Reporting System IPM programs can be successfully implemented by trained "in-house" school employees or by contracting with a pest control company.
A combination of in-house and contracted functions may be mixed and matched to the needs and capabilities of the school system.
Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and individual school systems must decide what is best for them.
Inspections by Trained Personnel.
The single most important step in the IPM program is the periodic (not less than monthly) comprehensive inspection of key areas by a trained individual, combined with the evaluation of the documented reports of pest sightings by staff members.
This is the foundation upon which all other IPM actions are based.
The periodic inspections may be done by a staff member, a specialist with the school district, a local health department person or a structural pest control technician.
This person must be able to: 1.

know the life cycle and habits of pests most likely found in schools; know where the signs of these pests are most likely to be found in the school facility; be familiar with the many unusual ways these pests can enter the school facility; have access to all areas of the facility; identify or obtain an accurate identification of any specimen provided by the school IPM coordinator; talk to the staff person who made out the pest sighting report, evaluate the information and make a decision on any subsequent action to be taken; be familiar with pesticide safety procedures and respond to emergency situations as the need dictates; make written recommendations for the upgrading of the facility and for the changing of procedures to diminish the ability of pests to get in or to find harborage areas in the facility; follow up on the recommendations and/or changes in procedures to confirm that they have been completed; and provide a detailed written report for each month.
If the school does not have a person on staff who can meet the above qualifications, then the principal should appoint a staff person to act as the IPM coordinator for the school who will work with the above person.
(The IPM coordinator may need to attend appropriate training to work effectively with pest control personnel.)
The IPM coordinator's duties should include the following: 1.
receive and possibly make preliminary evaluation of all written reports from other staff persons including a. reports of an occasional invader; these should be handled in accordance with the procedures set up under the "response times," b. reports of unknown pests should be passed on to the technical person described above for evaluation, c. reports of those pests deemed to need immediate action should be passed on to the person designated to handle this situation as soon as possible.
coordinate any pesticide applications with the many activities that are common in most schools with the goal being to minimize exposure of students and staff to pesticides; ensure that all areas of the school are accessible for inspection and/or application of control methods; check any monitoring devices such as sticky traps between the periodic inspections, if deemed advisable; be in charge of seeing that structural changes or changes in procedures are carried out; maintain written reports and recommendations in a file for review as needed; and review all written reports every six months and ensure that recommended changes are completed.

Guidelines for Periodic Inspections.
In large facilities, a pest control technician will want to become familiar with the entire operation before making an inspection.
Pests can occur in machinery, stacked products, dumpsters, product spills, etc.
In kitchens and storage areas, excessive clutter, poor lighting, unaccessible storage areas and rooms located above or below infested materials are special target sites.

All inspections should be conducted with bright flashlights.
A knife or spatula, a good hand lens, screwdrivers and mirrors are also useful equipment.
Flushing agents (small aerosol cans of pyrethrin insecticides used to aid the inspection of voids) can be used, but care must be taken not to contaminate foodstuffs or expose occupants of the facility.
Inspect the pathway taken by incoming supplies to detect problems.
Special attention should be given to all spills.
Check for dead insects and tracks in spilled products or dust.
Inspect the back of pantry shelves, floors under shelves and all dark areas.
Traps that use a sex attractant (pheromone) are available for nearly all stored product pests and roaches, which may be used to conduct routine inspections.
Keep written inspection records.
Results of inspections and recommendations for changes by management or maintenance should be written in an easily understandable form.
Be safe.
Use bump hats and be careful of hot machines and electrical hazards.
Monitoring and Reporting by School Staff.
The pest control technician should obtain the assistance of other staff members to monitor pests throughout the school (Table 2).
This will enable the pest control technician to concentrate on kitchens, food storage areas and other rooms where pest invasion is likely.
To establish an effective monitoring system, individuals must be responsible for monitoring particular areas.
Otherwise new pest infestations may be missed because everyone assumed that someone else was responsible for reporting a pest sighting.
Because the pest control technician is not always in the facility, other staff must be relied on as pest monitors.
Staff should file written pest sighting reports, which are important to an effective IPM program.
Otherwise, the message to the pest control technician may become confused or lost during the many activities in a busy school day.
However, the reporting form should be concise and require only necessary information.
A cumbersome or long reporting form may be looked on as burdensome by staff members and thus may never be filed.
Consequently, a new pest infestation may become established because the staff did not want to take the time to fill out a long report form.
Table 3 is a simple pest sighting report that can be modified by schools to fit local needs.

Check with Key Facility Personnel.
A routine monthly inspection schedule should be established by staff for kitchens, product storage areas and other key locations that are most likely to be subject to pest invasions.
The pest control technician should check with key personnel as part of the monthly inspection.
Without a standard inspection procedure,
6 conditions that may encourage pest invasion or proliferation may be overlooked.
As with the pest sighting report, the inspection checklist should be as concise as possible so not to burden staff with excessive paperwork.
Table 4 is an example of a monthly inspection report for a school kitchen and cafeteria.
A monthly inspection report may be needed for other sites including restrooms, utility rooms and janitor closets, entrances, hallways and outdoor areas.

Check of monitoring stations.
At least once per month, the pest control technician should check glue traps or other monitoring devices for evidence of pest infestation.
The presence or absence of captured pests should be recorded so that areas of the school susceptible to pest infestation can be identified.
Step 4: Investigate Pest Sightings and Apply IPM Measures The pest control technician should file a monthly report of pest infestation with school officials.
The report should include the significance of the infestation as a health or nuisance issue, the type of action taken by the pest control technician and any recommendations to school officials to reduce or eliminate conditions that encourage pest infestations.
An example of a pest sighting/infestation report may be found in Tables 5 and 6.

Step 5: Follow up and Evaluation Both managers and pest control personnel must be aware that pest problems may change.
Pests may actively invade schools or be introduced on dry goods, food packaging, pallets, school bags and many other sources.
Consequently, the IPM program should be reevaluated periodically.
Information from pest sighting reports, visual inspections, glue traps and other monitors should be kept in a central log for reference.
Additionally, school administration must insure that changes in food handling procedures or repairs recommended by the pest control technician are acted on in a timely manner.
8 Periodically, pest control staff and/or school personnel should review records to decide if pest numbers are at a minimal level or are increasing.
A quarterly evaluation of the IPM program is important because a variety of events in the school can affect the long-term success of the IPM program.
Consequently, all aspects of the school's pest management program must be periodically reviewed at least quarterly to determine if a pest problem is chronic or temporary.
The quarterly evaluation can also be used to determine if past problems have been eliminated and if new problems are appearing.
If a pest problem occurs repeatedly over a three-month period, the problem may be chronic.
For example, mice seen repeatedly in the same area suggests they are entering from a harborage area like a hidden crawlspace void.
In contrast, temporary or seasonal problems may occur about the same time each year, but usually are over in a few days.
Other changes in the school's operations can affect the functioning of the IPM program: 
It is important to maintain contact between administrators and pest control staff, otherwise, the initial priority given to the IPM program may be lost among the day-to-day demands of a busy school schedule.
Part III Tips for Effective Pest Management Cockroaches Except for size, all cockroaches are relatively similar in overall shape and appearance.
They are most active at night and stay in the dark whenever possible.
(When they are seen in the open or in the light, it usually means that a large infestation is present.)
Cockroaches also like to hide in cracks and crevices where their bodies can touch surfaces both above and below.
As they grow to adulthood, they will seek hiding places (harborage) for their larger size.
Cockroaches do not uniformly infest one room or all rooms.
Knowing the basic biology of cockroaches give the pest control technician important clues to the source of a cockroach infestation.
By considering the habits discussed below, one can increase the effectiveness of a cockroach management program.
The four most common kinds of cockroaches may be divided into two groups, depending on how they are managed.
The "small" cockroaches include the German cockroach and the brown-banded cockroach; the "large" cockroaches are the oriental cockroach and the American cockroach.
German Cockroach
<
Management of Small Cockroaches - The German cockroach and the brown-banded cockroach are responsible for most pest complaints and pesticide use in public and commercial buildings.
The degree of success of the control program depends not only on insecticides, but on management attention to good maintenance and housekeeping practices.
Cockroaches and their egg capsules are being constantly introduced into buildings in packaging and boxes.
Consequently, both pest control staff and management must understand that an effective control program must include monitoring and inspection.
Management of Large Cockroaches - Although these large insects may wander along pipes throughout a building, in most parts of the county they live mainly at ground level or below.
Prevention and treatment should focus on warm, moist areas such as basements, boiler rooms, pipe chases, sumps and elevator or sewer shafts.

MANAGEMENT OF SMALL COCKROACHES The German Cockroach adult is 1/2 inch long with two black stripes behind its head on the "pronotum" (Appendix I).
Young cockroaches (nymphs) are brownish black with a pale brown band down the middle of their back.
The German cockroach is not only the most common cause of indoor pest problems, but also represents the largest number of control failures of any structural pest.
It is most successful at infesting human structures and withstanding pest control activity.
Successful cockroach control programs use several methods to bring the infestation under control.
Behavior and Harborage Groups of cockroaches (aggregations) live in areas of high humidity and nearby food.
They will find harborage (hiding places) into which they can fit closely.
As the number of cockroaches increases and favorable harborage is filled, roaches are forced to leave the aggregation or remain in less favorable harborage.
They are most active just before dawn and after dark.
To cockroaches, the most desirable harborage is in and around refrigerators, stoves, under sinks, and undisturbed cabinets, which provide both protection and food.
Kitchen areas with high humidity, sink traps, leaking faucets, standing water and wet sponges are attractive to cockroaches.
They also may be found in washrooms, because of their toilet bowls, sinks, wet wash cloths, and sometimes, water heaters.
While there is less food in washrooms, food areas are usually nearby or available through holes around plumbing pipes.
These pipes provide additional harborage and areas where cockroaches can enter adjacent rooms.
In schools, German roaches are often found in student lockers or gym lockers.
The two principle reasons for this are food left in lockers and roaches transported from home in the student's book bag or coat.
In kitchen areas, roaches are most often brought in on supplies.
What may be overlooked is that often nonfood supplies are a greater source of roach infestations than food supplies.
Vending machines and recycling bins can also provide a frequently overlooked source of roach problems.
German cockroaches are not likely to leave favorable harborage unless conditions change.
Such changes can be caused by: 
If cockroaches find new locations with favorable conditions, they can move from one harborage to another, or develop new infestations.
Outdoor infestations are found only outside heavily infested structures from which steady cockroach migrations occur and near dumpsters and garbage cans.
! Control and Management
Inspection With Flashlights - An active inspection with a bright flashlight is the most thorough method of locating cockroaches.
The technician can search dark, undisturbed, or remote places of cockroach harborage that have not been properly inspected.
Hand mirrors, magnifying hand lens or other small tools may be helpful to some technicians.
Identification of harborage is critical to an effective cockroach control program.
With Traps - Use of sticky (glue) traps is a common inspection or monitoring method used for cockroach detection.
Correct trap placement depends upon the technician's understanding of cockroach food-seeking (foraging) habits; place sticky traps behind kitchen appliances, in cabinets, supply rooms and similar locations.
Habitat and Harborage Reduction Speak to the facility staff in a friendly, knowledgeable way.
Pest control technicians should explain to both staff and management that often changes in facility operations can reduce or eradicate the insect problem.
These recommendations should include how staff can eliminate or restrict materials that support buildup of cockroach populations.
Site staff should understand that pesticide application alone will not control cockroaches satisfactorily.
Some specific actions that will reduce harborage include:
10 
A review of monthly reports may indicate from time to time that other specific areas may need to be sealed.
Repair holes in walls or floors and seal inaccessible areas that could become harborages for pests.
Replace wood food storage shelves with wire shelves.
Do not store infrequently used items in the same areas as frequently used items and food supplies.
Repair all moisture problems.
Do not keep recycled goods such as beverage containers, cans, paper, cardboard, etc. near the kitchen or food supply areas.
Institute a good cleaning program.
Pesticide use without cleaning and sanitation will not produce long term control of a pest infestation.
Recommend good lighting.
Point out areas that need ventilation.
Recommend reduction of clutter (particularly cardboard boxes) and excess product in cabinets or storage.
Where practical, install air curtains to keep out flying insects.
Recommend rotating stock.
Vacuuming as a Pest Control Method A relatively new method of "cleaning out" a pest population is vacuuming.
This is used to crash (greatly reduce) the cockroach population; it also removes dirt, food particles, etc.
The "clean out" is followed by improved sanitation, pest prevention and, if needed, judicious use of pesticides.
If vacuuming is used as a pest control method, be sure to use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter to avoid suspending materials in the air that can cause respiratory problems.
Pesticide Application In attacking cockroaches, one should concentrate on monitoring the cockroach population and delivering pesticides into active harborage areas rather than "baseboard spraying."
<
Sticky traps are not intended for control, but rather to detect infestations and to evaluate and target control measures.
Place sticky traps behind kitchen appliances, in cabinets and supply rooms.
<
The small, plastic bait containers should be placed as close as possible to harborage sites where the cockroaches are actually living.
Place the bait stations behind refrigerators, in cabinets and along edges of walls and in corners.
Do not place them where students can find them.
The two most common mistakes in using containerized baits are (1) not eliminating nearby food sources and (2) not using enough bait stations.
Paste and gel baits are most effective when applied in small dabs.
Baits are most effective when the cockroach population is low or moderate in size.
If there is a large population, the bait in the stations may be entirely eaten before the cockroaches are eliminated.
Bait stations should not be contaminated by sprays or dusts that may be repellant.
<
Use a narrow diameter extension tube in infested cracks and crevices to provide a thorough application of residual insecticide.
(A crack and crevice treatment implies that the stream of insecticide is never visible during the spraying process.)
Treat cracks and crevices under furniture, drawers, sinks, around pipes and in high cabinets.
First remove utensils and supplies in cabinets; do not treat shelf surfaces.
<
The need for repeated fogging at short intervals indicates the cockroach population is rising, not decreasing.
Space treatments (fogs or aerosol applications) flush cockroaches out of harborage, causing them to cross residual pesticide applications, or the insecticide droplets land on the insects, killing them by direct contact.
Such treatments lack crack and crevice penetration.
Fog treatments should not be used in areas where facility staff are present.
Prior to treatment, all exposed food and food contact surfaces should be effectively protected against pesticide contamination.
After the application, food preparation surfaces should be cleaned before they are used for food preparation.
Follow-up When a cockroach population has been controlled, the technician should continue to monitor the area with sticky traps and interview staff to detect cockroach problems before they become worse.
11 The Brown-banded Cockroach is less commonly a problem in buildings, but they also can build up large infestations where they find favorable harborage.
Adult brown-banded cockroaches are the size of German cockroaches, about 1/2 inch long.
The brown-banded cockroach has two transverse light bands near the head of the insect.
Behavior and Harborage Brown-banded cockroaches, like German cockroaches, build up the highest populations in kitchens.
However, their tendency is to increase in warm rooms.
They can be common around high cabinets and areas near stoves and warm motors, such as those in refrigerators, electric clocks, light timers, televisions and radios.
! Control and Management Inspection Inspection for the brown-banded cockroach is essentially the same as for German cockroaches.
However, brown-banded cockroaches will be more scattered and less attracted to moisture.

First remove utensils and supplies in cabinets; do not treat shelf surfaces.
Follow-up The long egg hatching time of the brown-banded cockroach requires treatments to be monitored with sticky traps.
MANAGEMENT OF LARGE COCKROACHES The Oriental Cockroach is often called the "waterbug."
Adult oriental cockroaches are very dark-brown or shinyblack.
The female is slightly longer than the male, about 1 1/4 inch to his 1 inch.
Unlike other domestic cockroaches, the female does not develop wings, but produces only short triangular wing pads.
The male has wings, but they are short and broad, leaving about 1/4 of the abdomen exposed.
Behavior and Harborage Oriental cockroaches favor crawl spaces, spaces between the soil and building foundations, the undersides of stoops and sidewalks, landscaping mulches, water meters, basements and their floor drains and other such moist places.
These cockroaches frequently live in floor drains that lead directly outside; these drains are also used as entrances to buildings.
The oriental cockroach prefers starchy foods and may build up around garbage cans.
They tolerate cooler temperatures, and they are usually found near humid areas.

The American Cockroach, like the oriental cockroach, is sometimes called the waterbug.
Adult American cockroaches are large (1 1/3 to 1 1/2 inches) reddish-brown insects.
Behavior and Harborage Large populations of American cockroaches live in warm moist habitats.
They are most often found in boiler rooms or other harborage with water heaters, floor drains, water sumps and warm moist basements.

Pantry Pests Many kinds of moth larvae and beetles attack cereal products, flour and other dry foods derived from plants.
Flour beetles, saw-toothed grain beetles and Indian meal moths are some of the more common ones.
These insects can be found in opened packages or containers of grains or plant materials and in the cracks and crevices of cabinets or cupboards.
In schools or other public buildings, infestations often originate by means of food packages brought into the structure.
Sometimes they may even gain entrance to unopened packages.
Because most pantry pests are capable of flying, they may enter buildings that way.
Once inside the building, these insects will spread through other food and the infestation will increase.
Sawtooth Grain Beetle
13 Habits and Damage The young (larvae) and some adults of these insects feed on grains (rice, barley, corn, wheat, and bird seed), grain products (oatmeal, cornmeal, pasta, breakfast cereals, flour, cake mixes, pancake flour, and dry pet food), nuts, dried fruits, and other dried plant materials (dried flower arrangements, ornamental corn, seed displays and pictures made with seeds).
Several types of beetles (cigarette beetles and carpet beetles and relatives) also will feed on spices.
All life stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult) of these insects may be present simultaneously in infested products.
The adult beetles and moths are frequently seen in cupboards, on counters and cabinets and around windows.
Beetle infestations frequently can be identified by the old larval skins left in the stored product.
Indian meal moth larvae spin webbing threads throughout and over the surface of the infested product and the mature larvae frequently leave their food source to complete development to the adult.
These migrating larvae are usually noticed as they crawl in cupboards and across walls and ceilings.

Follow-up Ongoing monitoring and inspection plans should be put into effect in all kitchens and food-storage areas.
A complete pest management program is recommended for these operations.
Clear communication with staff is important.
Cleaning and sanitation procedures should be monitored constantly.
Ants It is important to note that of the ants found indoors, only a few species are responsible for the majority of infestations.
Identification of the ant helps the technician identify possible sites of the infestation.
However, baits can be placed in infested areas while the technician is having the ants identified.
If ants are found in a building, an important first step is to determine whether the ants from a colony located inside or outside the structure.
Indications that a colony is inside are when: 
14 Indications that a colony is outside are when: 
Whether the colony is inside or outdoors, ants that are known to tend aphids for the sweet liquid ("honeydew") that they produce often seek food inside before this food is available outdoors.
After populations of aphids and similar insects increase (in late spring), ants may disappear.
They may return in dry weather seeking moisture, but often will not be seen until the next spring.
When pest control efforts occur during this period, it is often difficult to tell whether the pest management methods are effective or whether the ants left the building because of other food sources.
! Control and Management Inspection 
<
Try to target "hot spots" of the infestation.
<
Inside - Inspect holes and cracks where workers enter, old or new moisture stains, food accumulations (such as bird seed or food for classroom pets), activity near appliances (dishwasher and washing machines), near showers, in drawers, adjacent rooms or rooms above and below activity.
Outside - Inspect for workers behind vines, shrubs, other plants near the building, expansion joints, slabs, patio blocks, bricks, boards, plant pots, under and inside wooden columns and pillars, outside door and window frames, window wells, where telephone wires and air-conditioning refrigerant pipes enter building walls, trees that harbor colonies and provide access to buildings by overhanging limbs that touch, water meters and storm drain inspection manholes.
Outside of ground-level rooms, inspect plants for aphids being tended by ants.

Use baits with slow-acting stomach poisons or with insect growth regulators.
Baits are excellent in sensitive areas, such as computer rooms.
When using baits always remember that students will not leave baits alone if they know where they are located.

Never store baits or bait materials where they can be contaminated with any other odors, especially fumes of pesticides.

If using insect growth regulators (IGRs), remember that IGRs take longer than dusts to show results.
Remember, pesticide treatments can repel ants and make them active in other areas.
Colonies with multiple queens may break up into several colonies.
Black Carpenter Ant The large, black workers range in size from 1/4 inch to almost 1/2 inch.
(Carpenter ants are usually entirely black, but some carpenter ants may be reddish-black.)
Outside workers can be confused with field ants which do not enter structures.
Workers will search for food 30 feet or more from the colony.
The colony may be found in wood (such as a fallen log, tree hole, stump or a structure wall).
When carpenter ant workers dig nest tunnels, they chew out small pieces of wood.
Unlike termites, they do not eat the wood; they drop it out of the nest area or pile it in one place.
This pile of carpenter ant shavings, called sawdust, is very soft and is made up of pieces like a fine chisel would make.
(Gritty construction sawdust in attics or on sills can be left over from construction or repairs and may be mistaken for carpenter ant shavings.)
Carpenter ants do not put mud into their tunnels like termites; carpenter ant tunnels have very smooth sides.
A nest or colony might harbor several thousand ants.
Large colonies of carpenter ants can cause structural damage, but the colony more likely will be found partially in structural wood and partially in void spaces (such as between roof boards, between studs under windows or between subflooring and shower bases).
Black carpenter ant workers forage for sweet foods (such as honeydew from aphids and juices from ripe fruit) and insects.
Indoors, they like sweets, meats, fruit juices and moist kitchen refuse.
! Control and Management
Inspection A thorough inspection is critical to successful control of carpenter ants.
It is important to discover whether carpenter ants are nesting inside or outside.
If ants are nesting inside: 
Carpenter ants are often found near a roof leak or other damp wood.
In many cases, Carpenter ants make their nests in wood that has been wet and infested by a brown rot fungus.
Dark fungus stains on the wood is an indication of the presence of such moisture.

Pavement Ant The Pavement ant is brown or black and about 1/8 inch long.
Pavement ants nest outside under rocks, at the edge of pavement, door stoops and patios.
They commonly move their colonies inside between the foundation and sill plate.
Outside, pavement ants tend honeydew-producing insects and feed on other insects and seeds.
Pavement ants store debris in certain areas of the colony or nest.
When this area is needed to enlarge the nest, workers remove materials such as sand, seed coats, dead insect parts and sawdust from the building construction and dump them outside the colony.
Colonies located on foundation walls drop debris over the side in a pile on the basement floor.

Odorous House Ant The odorous house ant is brownish-gray in color and around 1/8 inch long.
The body of the odorous house ant is relatively soft and can be easily crushed.
When this occurs, a foul odor is released.
Outdoor nests are shallow and are located under stones and boards.

Pharaoh Ant The pharaoh ant is a tiny ant, dull-yellowish to light-orange in color and not much more than 1/16 inch long.
Ants prefer warmer buildings and warm areas (80-85 o F.) in buildings for nesting.
These ants are active year-round in large buildings.
Nesting sites include wall voids, cracks in woodwork, stacks of paper, envelopes, harborage in desk drawers, etc.
It is common to find many colonies in one building and, perhaps, several in one room.
Colonies have multiple queens and increase by dividing: one portion of the colony going with each queen.
No swarms have been recorded, so new infestations are apparently transferred by moving infested objects.
Pharaoh ants trail each other and are attracted to grease, meats, insects and sweets.
These harborage and food preferences bring it to coffee areas, kitchens, paper and other supply storage, office equipment, medical storage, laboratory benches and many kinds of biological cultures.

Spiders Although fear of spiders is common, poisonous types are not likely to be encountered in most public or commercial buildings.
However, the brown recluse spider has been found in schools, particularly in the southern part of Illinois.
Harmless, crawling spiders are occasionally a nuisance in basements or other areas.
Tighter sealing around windows and utility access holes and tight weatherstripping on exterior doors will usually reduce their numbers.
Residual insecticide sprayed on surfaces near potential entry may help somewhat; dust and microencapsulated formulations may have a greater chance for success.
Spiders that build webs in secluded corners or in outdoor locations such as eaves or lights can be most efficiently controlled with a vacuum.
The general approach of sealing up entry points and vacuuming up intruders should be the first consideration for most types of spiders (and other miscellaneous crawling pests, such as crickets and millipedes).
Wandering Spiders Spiders will enter buildings in search of food and shelter.
Below is a list of spiders that are often found in or around buildings.
Although most spiders can bite, the injury from this group is similar to a bee sting.
Wolf Spider The hairy, fleet, wolf spiders are very common outdoors under leaf litter, rocks and logs.
When they come inside, they normally stay on the ground floor and are active in dim light.
Large wolf spiders often frighten people.
If handled, they give a painful bite, but it is not dangerous.
Jumping Spider Jumping spiders are active during the day and are common around windows where they feed on insects attracted to natural light.
Jumping spiders are usually small, up to 1/2 inch in length and many are brightly colored.
They move in quick rushes, jerks or jumps.
They often enter buildings from shrubs near windows or ride in on plant blossoms.
Crab Spider Small crab spiders are dark or tan; some are lightly colored orange, yellow or creamy white.
Their legs extend out from their sides causing them to scuttle back and forth in a crab-like fashion.
These spiders hide in flower blossoms and may be brought inside in cut flowers.
19 ! Control and Management If called on to eliminate wandering spiders, the best action is to locate specimens, identify them, assure staff that they are not poisonous and tell staff how they got inside.
<
<
<
<
<
<
Pesticide application is very difficult; indoor treatment is usually effective only if the pesticide contacts the spider directly.
This means the technician must have access to all spider habitats.
Unless efforts are made to exclude spiders (such as tightening gaps around entrances and inspecting where materials are being brought into the facility), spiders will reenter.
Brown Recluse Spider The brown recluse spider is uniformly tan to brown without markings except for a dark fiddle-shaped mark.
Although they can be found living outdoors in southern Illinois, they can be introduced into buildings in other areas of the state where they have been transported in boxes, pallets or other items.
The brown recluse makes a fine, irregular web.
It commonly wanders in the evening in indoor infestations.
Bites- Brown recluse spiders avoid busy parts of rooms where people are present, remaining where there is no activity and in closed or unused rooms.
Even though indoor infestations can be large, people are seldom bitten.
Bites may occur when rooms are suddenly put into use or when stored clothing is brought out for use.
Brown recluse bites Brown Recluse Spider are sharp but not initially painful, but a blister is quickly raised, broken and surrounded by a red welt.
The depressed center of this raised, red circle (the size of a dime to a quarter) turns dark within a day.
The dead tissue often falls away and the bite area scars over in one to eight weeks.
Death seldom occurs, but the bite can result in a large and disfiguring scar.
The spider is delicate.
After biting, it frequently can be found lying where it was slapped by the victim.
It should be killed and taken to the physician along with the victim for positive identification.
Other biting or stinging insects (and related creatures) can produce injuries resembling the bite of the brown recluse spider.
Consequently, some cases of "brown recluse spider bites" are actually injuries from other causes.
Before any pesticide application occurs, a thorough inspection for the brown recluse spider should be conducted.

Yellowjacket Wasps Yellowjacket wasps (often mistakenly identified as "bees") may become a nuisance around buildings.
From August through October, when yellowjackets have built up large populations, they seek food such as carbonated beverages, cider, juices, ripe fruits and vegetables, candy, ice cream, fish, ham, hamburgers, hot dogs at picnics and other outdoor events.
Many are attracted in large numbers to garbage cans.
Others fly in and out of nests built around buildings and areas where people live, work and play, causing fear and alarm.
Although yellowjackets are considered quite beneficial to agriculture since they feed on harmful flies and caterpillars, it is their aggressiveness and painful stinging ability that cause most concern.
Nevertheless, unless the threat of stings and nest location present a hazard, it may be best to wait for freezing temperatures in late November and December, to kill off the colony.
Stinging workers do not survive the winter and the same nest is not reused.
German Yellowjacket The German yellowjacket is distributed throughout the northeastern quarter of the United States and often nests in wall voids and other cavities.
(Other yellowjackets usually nest in the ground.)
Nests in attics and wall voids are large and workers can chew through ceilings and walls into adjacent rooms.
The nest of the German yellowjacket is made of strong light gray paper.
Colonies of the German yellowjacket may be active in protected wall voids into November and December when outside temperatures are not severe.
Problems with yellowjackets occur mainly when: 
Yellowjackets are sometimes responsible for an infection following a sting.
A contaminated stinger can inject the bacteria beneath the victim's skin.
Blood poisoning should be kept in mind when yellowjacket stings are encountered.
! Control and Management
Inspection Sting victims often can identify the location of yellowjacket nests.
Soil nests are often located under shrubs, logs, piles of rocks and other protected sites.
Entrance holes sometimes have bare earth around them.
Entrance holes in structures are usually marked by fast-flying workers entering and leaving.
A nest high in a tree should not be a problem unless it is where it may be disturbed.
Be sure to wear a bee suit or tape trouser cuffs tight to shoes.
Habitat and Harborage Reduction Management of outdoor food sources is very important.

21 
To limit yellowjacket infestations in wall voids and attics, keep holes and entry spaces in siding caulked; screen ventilation openings.
If yellow jackets are entering rooms through windows, window screens should be installed in windows whenever possible.
Pesticide Application When possible, treat after dark; workers are in the nest at that time.
If nests are located high in a structure where there may be a danger from falls or electrical wires; maintenance staff who also do pest control may be wise to hire a professional pest control contractor to treat the nest.

Remember, do not contaminate food surfaces.
Follow-up Ongoing monitoring throughout the active yellowjacket season is essential when a pest management program is in place at locations where there are outdoor activities.
Whenever possible, screens should be installed in school room windows and garbage cans should have tightly-sealing lids.
Termite and Ant Swarms Termite Swarms Most people are familiar with the extensive destruction that termites can cause to wooden structures.
Termites can also damage structural wood in steel and concrete buildings, such as trim or molding, paneling, furring strips, or door and window frames.
Stored files, stacked books, or any other cellulose-based material (such as fiberboard sheathing or insulation panels) may also be attacked.
22 Most termite problems in large buildings involve subterranean colonies that persist for years on buried scrap wood and constantly explore upwards for new sources of food.
These colonies are often a nuisance not because of the actual damage they cause, but because large numbers of winged "swarmers" periodically find their way into occupied space.
Although extremely disruptive, swarmers are harmless, cannot bite or carry disease and cannot damage interior wood.
Swarming termites should be controlled with a vacuum rather than a space spray, but spraying may be unavoidable in rare circumstances.
The presence of swarming termites should be followed with a termite inspection by a professional pest control company.
Ant Swarms Many types of ants produce winged queens and males at certain times of the year.
Large numbers of these "swarmers" may pour out of crevices into a room, even in locations that never had a problem with crawling ants.
Swarming ant reproductives are sometimes confused with termite swarmers (Appendix II).
Swarming ants can severely disrupt operations and often result in occupant demands for spraying.
In cases where the ants are relatively concentrated (such as at windows), the recommended procedure is to vacuum them up and dispose of the contents in an outdoor trash bin.
However, in some cases, control with an insecticide may be the only practical response.
Winged ants emerging inside a building usually die or disperse quickly, so spraying tends to be of little value if not done immediately.
Rooms should be unoccupied during a space spray treatment, all electronic equipment should be well covered and the space should be ventilated for at least several hours before reoccupation.
Location of the ants' entry points (and the nest itself, if possible), injection of pesticide into these crevices and sealing up afterwards are the standard measures to prevent future swarming.
House Mouse The house mouse is the most successful rodent in adapting to life with people.
It's found almost everywhere people are, feeding on human food, sheltering in human structures and reproducing at a rapid rate.
The house mouse is the most troublesome and economically important vertebrate pest, contaminating millions of dollars worth of food, damaging property and causing electrical fires with its constant gnawing.
Mice may enter a building from the outside and spread through a structure along pipes, cables and ducts.
Although large numbers can build up in food service areas or trash rooms, one or a few mice can survive practically anywhere.
Many control failures against house mice are due to a lack of understanding of mouse biology and habits.
A pair of mice can produce 50 offspring in one year.
Because they seek food over a range of only 10 to 30 feet, traps, glue boards and bait must be placed close to the nest to be effective.
Remember that good inspections are critical for successful mouse control.
Inspection Sounds - Sounds are common at night where large numbers of mice are present; listen for squeaks, scrambling and sounds of gnawing.
House Mouse
Droppings - A house mouse produces many droppings per day; mouse droppings are frequently the first evidence that mice are present.
However, be aware that large cockroaches and bats may produce droppings similar to house mice.
Look along runways, by food near shelters and in other places mice may frequent.
Urine - House mice occasionally make small mounds known as ?urinating pillars."
These consist of a combination of grease, urine and dirt and may become quite conspicuous.
Look for many small drops of urine using a blacklight.
Urine stains will fluoresce under ultraviolet light.
(Mouse urine spots are not as easy to detect as those made by rats.)
Grease marks - Like rats, mice produce greasy smears where dirt and oil from their fur mark pipes and beams.
Runways - Most mouse runways are indistinct trails free of dust and are not readily detectable.
Tracks - Look for footprints or tail marks on dusty surfaces or on mud; use a nontoxic tracking dust (like talc) to help locate mice within buildings.
Gnawing damage - Newly-gnawed areas on wood are light in color, turning darker with age.
Look for small tooth
23 marks and enlarged cracks beneath doors.
Mice make wood chips with a consistency like coarse sawdust around baseboards, doors, basement windows and frames and kitchen cabinets.
Visual sightings - Mice are often active in daylight and this may not indicate a high population (as it does with rats).
Use a powerful flashlight or spotlight at night to confirm mouse presence.
Nest Sites - Inspect garages, attics, basements, closets and other storage places for evidence of nests.
Be alert to fine shredded paper or similar materials; these are common nest-building materials.
Mouse Odors - Mice produce a characteristic musky odor.
Estimating Numbers of Mice - The number of mice observed or food consumed is not reliable as a census technique with mice.
Unlike rats (which may travel widely within a building leaving tracks on many patches of dust) mice do not range widely.
<
<
The more tracks seen in each patch and the more patches showing tracks, the larger the population is.
The percentage of patches showing tracks will reflect the extent of the local infestation.
<
Compare the number of tracks or patches with mouse tracks before and after a control program.
! Control and Management Control and prevention of mice is a three-part process, which includes sanitation, mouse-proofing and population reduction with traps or baits.
Sanitation and mouse-proofing will help prevent mice from entering buildings.
When a mouse population already exists, some kind of lethal control is necessary.
Otherwise, mice, which reproduce rapidly and can find food almost anywhere, will continue to be a problem.
Habitat and Harborage Reduction Sanitation - Good sanitation makes it easier to detect signs of mouse infestation.
It also increases the effectiveness of baits and traps by reducing available food.
However, the best sanitation will not eliminate mice; they require very little space and small amounts of food to survive and reproduce.
<
In storerooms, stack packaged foods in orderly rows on pallets so that they can be inspected easily.
A family of mice can live in a pallet of food without ever having to leave the immediate area.
<
A 12-18 inch yellow or white painted band next to the wall in storage areas permits easier detection of mouse droppings.
This band and the areas around pallets should be swept often so that new droppings can be detected quickly.
Mouse-Proofing - Completely mouse-proofing a building is difficult because mice are reported to be able to squeeze through an opening as little as 1/4 inch high.
To mouse-proof a building: 
<
<
(This limits mice to a smaller area and may make snap traps and glue boards more effective.)
<
Traps Snap Traps.
If used correctly, snap traps are very effective in controlling mice.
They must be set in the right places, in high numbers and in the right position or mice will miss them entirely.
Always place traps in areas that are inaccessible to students.
Here are some tips to keep in mind when trapping mice: 
If mice are sighted throughout a building, it means that there are many locations where you will have to set traps.
Place snap traps not only wherever you see obvious signs of mice, but also in a three-dimensional sphere about ten feet in diameter around those signs.
(Mice are good climbers.)
<
24 
Or they can be below, in floor voids, crawl spaces, or under coolers or other equipment.
The best sites are those with large numbers of droppings since that means the mice are spending a lot of time there.
Other good sites are along walls, behind objects, and in dark corners, particularly where runways narrow down, funneling the mice into a limited area.
Successful trapping requires good mouse baits.
Peanut butter, bacon, cereal and nuts are attractive to mice.
Food baits must be fresh to be effective.
Another bait is a cotton ball, which the female mice like to use for nest material.
It must be tied securely to the trigger.
Two or more traps placed next to each other will capture more mice than single traps.
Probably the biggest mistake made in mouse trapping is not using enough traps.
Use enough to quickly eliminate the mice.
Great care must be taken to place traps out of the public view and to check them regularly.
Mice can carry several diseases, so technicians should wash their hands after handling traps or other items that come in contact with mouse urine and feces.
Use disposable latex gloves or tongs to handle dead mice.
A bleach/water solution of at least three tablespoons household beach per gallon can be used to sanitize traps.
Multiple-Catch Traps.
Multiple-catch mouse traps catch up to 15 mice without being reset.
Some brands are called "windup" traps; the windup mechanism kicks mice into the trap.
Others use a treadle door.
Live mice must be humanely killed.
Mice are curious and like to investigate new things.
They enter the small entrance hole in the trap without hesitation.
Odor plays a role too; traps that smell "mousy" catch more mice.

After the mouse infestation is eliminated, maintenance traps may be placed where mice have been numerous before.
Additionally, traps can also be placed at potential entry points such as storerooms, loading docks, near utility lines and at doorways.
Glue Boards.
Glue boards can be effective when other methods have failed against a "bait-shy" mouse or when food is abundant.
As with other traps, placement is the key.
Locations that are good for other types of traps are good sites for glue boards.

Glue boards do not work well in cold areas.
Rodenticides "Building out" mice and trapping are the most effective control methods.
Rodent baits should be used only in emergency situations to supplement these methods.
If there is a repeated need to use baits, it is likely that sanitation and mouse-proofing should be improved.
Remember that rodent baits are poisons.
Additionally, use of baits in schools represents special problems because of incidents where students have moved or tampered with rodent baits.
In schools, baits should be used only after nonchemical control measures have been instituted.

Place the baits in favorite feeding and nesting sites as determined by large numbers of droppings.
Place the baits between hiding places and food, up against a wall or object to intercept the mice.
Make bait placements 10 feet apart or closer in infested areas if they can be adequately secured.
If bait is refused, try switching to a different type and replace the baits often.
Use small bait stations which are more attractive to mice than the larger rat-type stations.
Make sure that sanitation is such that no other food is readily available to mice.
Head Lice Adult head lice are about 1/8 inch long.
Hatching occurs 7 to 10 days after attachment.
Since lice go through a gradual metamorphosis, the tiny nymphs resemble adults.
They grow to maturity in about 10 days.
Lice live on the scalp.
They are able to crawl on the scalp between hairs with more speed than may be expected.
Head lice suck blood painlessly by piercing the skin with sharp, needle-like mouth parts.
Head lice neatly glue their eggs (called nits) to the hair shaft.
The tiny, pearl-like eggs stick on to the hair so tightly that they can be dislodged only by being torn from the hair shaft by fingernails or a fine-toothed comb.
Nits found within Â¼ inch of the scalp indicate an active infestation.
Head lice spread from host to host through direct physical contact with an infested individual or by indirect contact such as sharing a comb, brush, hat or hair accessory with an infested individual or by storing a coat or hat infested with one or more head lice together with coats or hats of other persons.
Transmission of lice is most common among siblings that have their hair brushed with a "family brush" or children who use hats and brushes of friends.
Louse infestations are often discovered by school teachers who are watching for the signs of itching heads.
However, classroom neighbors are not as likely to be infested as are brothers and sisters or close friends that sleep over or share brushes.
! Control and Management Several over-the-counter and prescription preparations are used to eliminate head louse infestations.
Advise clients to contact health or medical personnel for recommendations concerning insecticidal shampoos and other preventative measures for the home.
Advice regarding treatment of bacterial infections that can result from intense scratching during extensive infestations should be made by health care professionals.
Head Louse
In public areas, advise staff to: 
In kindergartens don't forget to wipe or vacuum napping mats.

Reported louse infestations should be investigated by an individual trained to perform head lice examinations.
If live lice are not seen, the placement of nits on the hair shafts within Â¼ inch of the scalp can serve to indicate a current infestation.
"Mystery Bugs" Pinprick-like biting sensations, usually on exposed skin and often producing inflammations that resemble insect bites, can be a persistent problem in some buildings.
Occupants tend to blame these "bites" on some sort of pest infestation, typically fleas (which are rare in schools or office buildings), or "paper mites" (which do not exist).
Demands for spraying of the affected space are often carried out in the absence of any evidence that biting insects are present.
In fact, "paper mites" are almost always tiny, irritating particles like paper shards that constitute a cleaning or indoor air pollution problem rather than a pest problem.
The Role of Management
26 The most common mistake of management in "paper mite" situations is to automatically request a pesticide treatment, thereby incurring liability in the event occupants experience adverse reactions to the chemical.
The second most common mistake is for supervisors to dismiss the complaints of biting as imagination.
Although there are cases where people imagine they are being attacked by unseen parasites, most instances of biting-like sensations in buildings involve a genuine source of skin irritation.
The circumstances can be further complicated, because health care professionals unfamiliar with the "paper mite syndrome" frequently misdiagnose the resulting welts as insect bites.
Other people may believe that microscopic dust mites are involved; dust mites are real, but they cause breathing distress rather than bites.
Finally, it is normal for the coworkers of a person complaining about "paper mites" to develop a heightened sensitivity to their own skin irritations (many caused away from the workplace) through the "power of suggestion."
Management must treat all concerned with sympathy and respect, at the same time emphasizing that no pesticide treatment can be authorized without positive confirmation that a pest problem exists.
! Control and Management Inspection for Parasites An inspection of the affected area should be carried out by a pest control technician who understands that pests may not be involved.
Usually when real parasites are present, many are present and are readily seen.
The most common types in buildings are mites coming from bird nests or from rodent infestations.
If a thorough investigation fails to produce any specimens, a non-pest cause is probably responsible.
However, it is standard procedure to place sticky traps throughout the area as monitors.
In addition, occupants should be instructed to capture anything they suspect is biting them on a piece of clear tape.
If biting insects such as fleas are present, the area may need to be treated.
However, the captured items are typically bits of debris or tiny, harmless insects that are usually present inside buildings as a result of inadequately filtered air intakes.
Inspection for Airborne Particles When it is reasonably certain that there are no biting insects in the affected space, the pest control program is no longer involved.
Only rarely are the specific culprits in "paper mite" cases positively determined, although there are often strong suspects.
Shards of fiber glass insulation (such as from batting above drop ceilings), particles from both newly installed as well as worn carpet and carpet pads and paper dust from separating forms and computer printouts along tear-lines are some of the most common proven causes of pinprick-like irritations.
The dry air of many workplaces not only makes skin more sensitive to these tiny splinters, it increases the static electricity that is responsible for the particles "jumping" onto exposed skin.
(Sometimes the static-charged bits are mistaken for living bugs.)
Any activity that stirs up accumulated dust, such as building remodeling, renovation or the purging of old files, often leads to a "paper mite" outbreak.
In cases where there is no obvious explanation, or multiple factors are suspected, an industrial hygienist should be called in to investigate.
Corrective Action Sometimes pesticide spraying or fogging brings temporary relief to occupants with a "paper mite" problem.
Although part of the reason is psychological, the main reason is that the spray acts to settle the irritating particles and to decrease static in the room.
Although it is questionable and misleading to use pesticides in this fashion, the same principle can be accomplished by other means.
A program of frequent damp cleaning, including carpet washing with water only, is often an effective short-term response while efforts are made to identify and eliminate the source of the irritation.
Cleaning by wiping rather than vacuuming is recommended, unless the vacuum is equipped with a HEPA (highefficiency) filter, since more dust may become airborne as a result.
Use of humidifiers or air purifiers can be of tremendous benefit if the affected space is not too extensive.
It may be worthwhile for some employees to seek the advice of a dermatologist or other medical specialist, since simple skin treatments (such as the use of moisturizers and milder soaps) are frequently used to minimize problems with irritation.
