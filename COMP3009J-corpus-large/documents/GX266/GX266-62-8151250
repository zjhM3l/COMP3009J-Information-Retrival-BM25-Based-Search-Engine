This publication was written to acquaint the reader with geologic time and the history of life (fossil record) as they are known in Michigan.
passage of time, it could not determine how much time any strata represented.
W ith the discovery of radioactivity, near the close of the 19th century, geologists were given a tool to apply absolute times to rock formations.
Radioactive elements change into other elements at a known rate called half-life.
By carefully analyzing rocks and determining the ratios of various elements and isotopes, an absolute age range can be determined.
Radioactivity is most useful for dating igneous rocks.
W ith the addition of absolute age dating tools an even more complete interpretation of the sequence of rocks around the world has evolved.
GEOLOGIC TIME A key idea that separates geology from other sciences is the concept of geologic time.
Geologic time is used to describe events in the earth's history, especially those seen in the rock record.
Mountain building and the emergence of a new species occur in a geologic time frame -- not the seconds -- minutes -- days --weeks -months -- years -- decades -- references of daily life.
The basic unit of geologic time is 1 ,000,000 (one million) years.
A million is an incredible number.
To better understand how long one million years is, we can convert it to some more familiar unit of measure.
If we let one inch equal one thousand years, then one million years would equal 83.3 feet.
One hundred years (longer than the average life span) would be represented by just one tenth (1/10 or 0.1) of an inch.
If one goes back to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, some 570,000,000 years ago - one would need almost 9 miles to represent this part of the Earth history.
To map out all of geologic time, one would need more than 72 miles.
The concept of geologic time came from work done on the fossils and physical characteristics of exposed sedimentary rocks.
Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers.
The lowest layers formed first and are the oldest.
As you progress up a column of rocks you progress through younger and younger layers.
Early geologists used fossils as markers to correlate and thereby determine the relative ages of rocks.
This led to the ability to construct a geologic column made up of rocks of different ages from different locations.
This orderly succession from oldest at the bottom to youngest at the top is reflected in most time charts.
Eventually a global time scale was developed.
Names were standardized, commonly referring to an area where early work was done or the exposures were good.
Even though this approach could help show similarities and differences with the FOSSILS A fossil is any evidence of past life.
Fossils are the remains, traces or imprints of plants or animals that have been preserved by natural processes.
These plants and animals lived in the geologic past.
The process of fossilization (becoming a fossil) may be long and complex.
After an animal or plant dies it must be buried by sediments before it decays or is destroyed by other forces.
After it is buried, conditions must be right for it to be preserved.
The rock forming processes often erase much of what could have been in the fossil record.
If the encasing rock is eroded or altered by other geologic forces the fossil will be damaged or destroyed.
W eathering destroys many more fossils than are ever collected.
Fossil remains are grouped or classified a number of different ways.
Some fossils can be directly identified when they are found as a whole or nearly complete animal or plant, or indirectly when only a small part or only tracks or trails are found.
Most commonly, only the "hard parts" of plants or animals are preserved as fossils.
Some people tend to overemphasize the identification of fossils.
Although identification is necessary, it is a complicated process, especially for newcomers.
In order to accurately recognize and describe a fossil, one must be familiar with the classification of living plants and animals.
The amount and complexity of the terminology can be staggering.
Becoming Michilogic Timeline CMG 94-01 @ www.deq.state.mi.us/gsd - Page 2 of 20 an adequate fossil identifier takes time; that is one of the reasons why paleontologists (those who study fossils) spend years in specialized training.
Only a small fraction of the plants and animals that ever lived are preserved as recognizable fossils.
Estimates vary, but fewer than one percent of the previous life forms are though to have been preserved as fossils.
To have been included in the rock history, and to have survived millions of years, makes all fossils remarkable.
Fossils should be collected and preserved rather than letting them erode into oblivion.
However, care must be taken to accurately and completely document, identify, label and catalog specimens and localities.
W hat is fresh in our mind today may be forgotten tomorrow.
Some of the items that should be included in a catalog are: the name of the fossil (as much as is known), where it was found, when it was collected, and by whom.
You will not recognize all of the fossils you find.
Most earth science hobby groups and many museums can provide assistance or help you find references.
By studying geology, you can better understand the various areas in Michigan.
Once you learn to interpret the geologic story and see how it affects our lives, the science of geology will take on new depth and meaning.
THE MICHILOGIC TIME LINE was conceived, compiled and written by the Paleontological Study Group of the Midwest Mineralogical

Special thanks to Professor Roger Pabian, Conservation and Survey Division, IANR, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, for his help in clarifying terminology and his advice on nomenclature and interpretation of information from other authors.
The Northern and Southern Peninsulas of Michigan are geologically distinct.
Michigan's vast metallic mineral resources are in the Precambrian and Cambrian rocks of the western Northern Peninsula.
The Cambrian through Jurassic rocks of the rest of the State contain important resources including: gypsum, limestone, dolomite, shale, salt and petroleum.
Deposits of gravels, sands and clays have hidden much of Michigan's geology.
These deposits were once part of the great variety of rocks found in Canada.
The movement of the Pleistocene glaciers picked up soils and rocks, grinding them against one another.
W hen the glaciers melted, meltwater carried the fragments and deposited them as gravel, sand, silt and clay.
Glacial ice movements and meltwaters have shaped Michigan's entire land surface.
W hile some are abundant, our geologic resources are non-renewable.
Once removed, mineral resources do not grow back.
The processes that formed them however, do continue; but ever so slowly in human terms.
To use or not to use non-renewable geologic resources? This is a question that has tradeoffs in either case and one which we must respond to with care.
As good stewards of our resources we must consider our economic needs, our quality of life, and our environment.

This was followed by extensive erosion, especially in Canada and the northeastern United States.
All life was in the sea.
The first evidence of life is of single celled, bacteria-like algae; the preserved forms of some colonies of these microorganisms "algae" are known as stromatolites.
Algal life forms increased the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, leading to early animal life forms.
Although the majority of these animals were more highly developed, they were soft bodied and thus decayed before they could be preserved as fossils.

The land-masses were stable, while the shallow seas became warmer and more hospitable to life.
Massive stromatolites were abundant.
An explosion of complex arthropods (trilobites and their kin) led to their becoming the dominant animal during this period, yet they declined in both type and number toward the close of the Cambrian, due to shrinking seas.

Nautiloid cephalopods were the largest life forms of the time, sometimes reaching a length of 15 feet.
These, with other mollusks, bryozoans and articulate brachiopods were the most abundant animals of the period.
Plant life consisted almost completely of seaweed and algae.

These deposits are the most fossiliferous outcrops in Michigan.
Fish underwent great evolutionary development during the Devonian, with specialized forms such as the placoderms (fish with hard bony plates covering their skin) reaching lengths of 15 to 40 feet.
Other sea life included the corals, bryozoans, mollusks, arthropods and echinoderms.

However, conditions in the Michigan area were more arid, resulting in the deposition of extensive gypsum beds.
By the end of the Mississippian Period the retreat of the continential seas caused a restriction of the marine environment, resulting in a reduced invertebrate populations.
In particular the trilobites were decimated both in numbers and species diversity.

Plants became so abundant in these swampy areas that their decayed remains formed thick deposits of peat.
Over geologic time these peat beds were converted to coal by heat and pressure, while individual leaves, stems and roots were preserved in the mud which turned to shale.
In the seas, shallow water forms such as trilobites and crinoids declined, while deeper-water animals such as sharks and cephalopods continued to flourish.

Giant scale trees, conifers and insects dominated the land.
Climatic and geographic changes at the end of the Permian, combined with extensive mountain building, resulted in the extinction of over 90 percent of all animal species, including ALL trilobites, blastoids and rugose corals.
Reptiles then developed, as well as the first reptile with mammal-like features, Dimetrodon.

The climate was still mild, favoring the development of the first flowering plants and insects that pollinate them.
The evolution of dinosaurs and other reptiles peaked during the Early Cretaceous but declined swiftly toward the end of the period.
This last period of the Mesozoic Era ended with major uplifts and volcanic activity through most of North America.
The resulting catastrophic changes in the climate contributed to the extinction of dinosaurs, marine and flying reptiles, ammonoid and belemnoid cephalopods, and a decimation of two-thirds of the other marine invertebrates.

The Early Tertiary Period (called Paleogene in European references) consists of the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene epochs.
Land plants and animals became the primary forms of life and remain so today.
Mammals increased dramatically in both number and type with the widespread prairies supporting a variety of horses, camels and other larger animals.
Carnivores such as saber-toothed cats and ostrich-like birds reached an unusually large size.
Marine invertebrates such as snails, clams and oysters were much like modern forms.

Continued gradual continental uplifting produced a drier climate and vast grasslands.
During this time many mammals and birds evolved into their modern forms: horses and deer developed hooves; dogs, cats and related families developed canine teeth.
Amphibians and land reptiles increased in numbers.
The first man-related hominids appeared.

During the Pleistocene Epoch great continental ice sheets several thousands of feet thick spread over most of the northern hemisphere at least four different times.
As the ice advanced, some animals were driven to warmer climates while others adapted to the cold by developing thick, furry hides.
The term Holocene is used to denote the last 11,000 years when human beings became the dominate life form by domesticating animals and cultivating the land.
