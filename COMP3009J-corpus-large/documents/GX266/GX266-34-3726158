Legislative Proposals Aging Issues and Long-Term Care In 2000, Iowa ranked second in the percentage of population over 85 years of age, third in the percentage of population over 75 years of age, and fourth in the percentage of population over 65 years of age.
Of those over age 65 in Iowa, 59 percent are women.
As the baby boom generation gets older, the need for both paid and unpaid caregivers will increase.
A 2001 ICSW study on CNA wages and benefits found that 73 percent earn under $10 per hour with few benefits and high turnover.
The typical family caregiver is a married woman in her mid-forties to mid-fifties, works full-time outside of the home, and spends an average of 18 hours per week on caregiving.
To address the needs of the aging, and of paid and unpaid caregivers for dependent adults, the ICSW supports: 1.
Legislation clarifying who is a mandatory reporter of dependent adult abuse; establishing financial institutions as voluntary reporters of suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation; expanding the Dependent Adult Protection Advisory Council's authority to advise any state department that is charged with the protection of dependent adults; and easing access to district court for the purpose of enjoining abusive activity or intervening for provision of support services in situations where abuse is either ongoing or likely to reoccur.
2.
Legislation eliminating the term caretaker in the Code of Iowa Chapter 235B.2(5)(a), so that anyone who abuses, neglects or exploits a dependent adult is charged; addition of a category of emotional/psychological abuse; and enhancing penalties for violation of an individual age 60 or older and/or disabled.
3.
Amendment of state tax policy in the Code of Iowa Chapter 422.9(2)(e) regarding tax deduction to include spouse, brother, and sister for whom in-home care is given.
4.
More standardized education, continuing education, and opportunities for advancement for ICSW 2004 P ROPOSALS
direct care workers (nurse aides/home care aides) in order to ensure equitable pay.
5.
In an effort to be more cost-effective in the provision of long-term care for those in need of services provided by state institutions, any legislation to close the state institution must consider the availability of alternative services for those in need of this long-term care.
6.
Continued funding of the Iowa CareGivers Association through Senior Living Trust Fund dollars appropriated to the Department of Elder Affairs.
7.
Funding to support expansion of the Iowa Nurse Aide Registry in conjunction with the Iowa CareGivers Association's Better Jobs Better Care grant.
Child Care Iowa leads the nation in the percentage of families where both, or the only parent, works.
The percent of mothers with children under age six in the labor force is 74.8, and 85.4 percent of mothers with children ages six to seventeen are in the labor force.
Child care is an economic and social infrastructure issue that affects the bottom line for business, the standard of living for families, and the future competitiveness of the state.
To insure quality affordable child care, in particular for women seeking training and/or employment, the ICSW supports: 1.
A child care and/or preschool subsidy for every Iowa family below 85% of the state median income.
2.
Adequate compensation, including benefits, for childcare workers.
3.
A professional development system for child care/ preschool workers of prerequisite and on-going training, and a process for credentialing workers.

8.
State investments in Head Start and Early Head Start.
3.
Continued funding for Iowans in Transition program grants through the ICSW at the FY01 level of $185,000 providing pre-employment services to an additional 350 displaced homemakers, single parents or female offenders.
4.
Establishing a vehicle for 12 weeks of partial wage compensation for a person taking parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child.

Economics In 2000, 62.7 percent of women age 16 and older were in Iowa's workforce, which represented 47.4 percent of the total workforce.
According to the wage study released that same year, Iowa women made 73 cents for every $1 a man made.
The study also found that 64 percent of female respondents reported annual wages of $25,000 or less while 66 percent of males reported wages over $25,000.
To address the economic needs of Iowa women, the ICSW supports: 1.
Increase in the minimum wage.
(Priority) 2.
Development of a plan for extending a comparable worth policy to all public employees in Iowa, with state assistance to local government entities in conducting comparable worth studies and a plan for making state revenue-sharing monies at future dates contingent upon adopting comparable worth pay schedules for local government employees.
Equality The 2003 Status of Iowa Women Report documents the need for continuing to improve the quality of life for women in this state.
To achieve equality while improving the status of women, the ICSW recommends: 1.
State funding to provide staff and support for the provision of technical assistance on educational equity for school districts and to monitor implementation of Iowa's multicultural, genderfair curriculum requirement as well as Title IX. 2.
Incentives for males and minorities to enroll in programs for training elementary education teachers and secondary family and consumer science teachers, and for females and minorities to enroll in programs of training for secondary industrial technology, mathematics, and science teachers.

It requires safe and healthful physical and social environments, sufficient incomes, safe and adequate housing, proper nutrition, preventive treatment, and education on maintaining healthful behaviors.

In fiscal year 2003, 19,488 victims of domestic violence were served by programs receiving state dollars.
