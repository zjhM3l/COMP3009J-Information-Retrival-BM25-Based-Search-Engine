alluvium Loose sediment deposited by running water.
Often found on the floodplains of streams.
The products of alluvium range from fertile topsoil to coarse aggregate.
argillite A fine-grained, compact sedimentary rock that is similar to shale but lacks the obvious layering of most shale.
Up to half the content of argillite can be low-grade metamorphic minerals.
Argillite is found in the Gettysburg-Newark Lowland Section of southeastern Pennsylvania.

gneiss A banded metamorphic rock, usually consisting of layers of light and dark minerals.
It is found in the Piedmont of southeastern Pennsylvania and in a hilly region extending from Reading into New Jersey known as the Reading Prong. guillotine split Hydraulically split dimension stone having roughly planar surfaces and a natural, rather than a smooth or polished, appearance.
gunning materials Refractory materials that are applied to surfaces by means of airplacement guns for fireproofing and sealing. hornfels A fine-grained metamorphic rock, occasionally porcelain-like, formed by the thermal alteration of shale in contact with igneous intrusions.
It is associated with the diabase intrusions of southeastern Pennsylvania.
igneous rock Rock that formed from hot, molten material.
Igneous rocks may be either extrusive, formed from volcanoes or lava flows, or intrusive, formed from magma that solidified underground.
In Pennsylvania, igneous rocks are found in the southeast, particularly in the Gettysburg-Newark Lowland Section.
Most igneous rocks found in Pennsylvania are intrusive. kame A low hill or mound of sand and gravel deposited at the edge of a melting glacier by a stream of water flowing off the glacier.
Kames are found in the areas of northwestern and northeastern Pennsylvania that were covered by glaciers thousands of years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch.
Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Open File Report 9704 GLOSSARY 281 lime Calcium oxide (quicklime) and, less formally, calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime).
A product made by heating limestone to high temperature.
Used in chemical, industrial, and agricultural applications.
The term "lime" is also commonly applied to pulverized limestone and dolomite that has not been heated.
The term "dolime" is applied to a mixture of calcium and magnesium oxides obtained by heating dolomite to high temperature.
