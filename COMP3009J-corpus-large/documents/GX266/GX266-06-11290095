Eugene Wolf Town Hall Meeting December 9, 2002 ******************************************************************************************* Group 2 Facilitator: Doug Cottam Would like wolves to stay endangered, as long as they exist.
Recorder: Holly Michael
Wolves are a major predator and have an impact on ecosystem and on people in rural areas.
Concerned about losses of: livestock/dogs, human safety and financial impact of new program.
What information is needed to identify a wolf? Are there plans to track wolves in Oregon? What can we do as citizens to track wolves? Producers had 6 times higher losses than reported.
How would livestock owners be compensated? Has lived in MN and never had a dog loss.
Would like to see wolves in Oregon.
Microchip/visually obvious marking of hybrids.
Kill-confirm issue is big.
Need to think beyond reimbursement.
Insurance account for "unconfirmed" losses.
Major predators are needed in ecosystem.
No lethal control on public lands for native species, not just grazing.
Should consider impact that grazing has on public lands.
Hybrids are more dangerous than full wolves.
What would be the difference in protection between wolves and hybrids? Do wolves and dogs readily breed on their own? Let people and other fine minds make management decisions and give children an opportunity to experience learning from mistake of extermination.
They need to be welcomed.
Fine minds can figure out the details.
Has not experienced coyote loss on her property-wolves have a right to be here.
If you don't like wolves, move to a city.
Wolves should be allowed to go anyway.
There are not too many wolves-there are too many people.
We are the predators on deer and elk (everything).
Wolves help balance the ecosystem.
If my livestock were taken, I would live with it.
If wolves took all elk and deer, there wouldn't be any left now.
Wolves are a keystone species--hold all the ecosystem together.
Does not see all elk and deer disappearing from wolves.
Think of species natural range.
Not political boundaries, but historical range.
In upstate New York state, deer overabundant because out of balance.
Need to work wolves back into the ecosystem.
Agree with what was said that was pro-wolf, but restore ecosystem first.
If we remove artificial barriers, we could do it, but won't happen.
Wolves will aggravate situation.
Appreciates sentiments, but thinks it adds fuel to the fire.
Having wolves should be a bonanza if they show up on my land-compensation for losses.
Wolves, spotted owl or whatever.
Would not support reintroduction, would have to include reimbursement.
Is anybody going to starve if they didn't kill a deer? Wildlife not full of chemicals, so hunt them for food.
Would like to see wolves reintroduced and landowners compensated for losses by the state or Oregon.
There has to be some benefit to tourism from wolves-that would help offset reimbursement costs.
Impacts to hunting-financial impact to rural economy.
What do Guides and Packers say about wolves and impacts to other wildlife? Deer and elk have not faced wolves, so higher loss.
Good to see open discussion-would like to see it continue.
*******************************************************************************************
Group 3 Facilitator: Bill Castillo
Recorder: Bill High
Is there historic evidence of wolves in other parts of Oregon than NE Oregon? Can these other areas be used for experimental populations? Why is there not an active reintroduction program in Oregon? How will input from this meeting be weighed against USFWS and other inputs? Is the Idaho wolf population genetically diverse enough to support full recovery in Oregon? Concerned about protection of population if they are down-listed, especially on private lands.
Would like to see a livestock compensation program funded by grazing lease fees for private and public lands.
Modify all hunting seasons to respect wolf biology if there are conflicts.
Several folks are frustrated with format.
They want more information about the subject before they make their comments.
Would like to see this process continue for an exchange of information between all concerned groups.
2
Concerned that USFWS is not here tonight as they are a major player.
This meeting structure is good, but they want more of it.
Population in Idaho is experimental, so until experiment can be analyzed, wolves should stay in Idaho.
A friend of one participant saw a pack in Oregon near border with collared wolves.
Why can't those packs be monitored closely to get better info on migration and travel of packs? What is being done in Idaho (data from feds)? Use this info to make decisions in Oregon.
Do not reinvent wolf management.
Wants wolves in Oregon.
Afraid of what will happen when ESA restrictions are lessened.
Idaho was chosen for wolf reintroduction because of good prey base.
Need to evaluate OR for areas where adequate prey populations exist.
Also, identify areas where prey is lacking and conflicts may be more severe.
Is there data about wolves possibly helping control CWD through predation on weak animals? Support development of active wolf reintroduction plan but pending that Oregon wolves would need protection not dependant on federal protection.
Are ways to protect livestock such as llamas protecting sheep from coyotes, that can be used with wolves? (Instead of compensation).
OR ESA does not have need for flexibility or protection to adequately manage wolves (compared to experimental status in Idaho).
Likes wolf population increase situation in N. Montana.
Trickle in re-introduction should be looked at closer.
That should be compared to proactive reintroduction to choose best path.
First answer needed is "Does Oregon want wolves?" Possible reason for dramatic wolf population increase in Idaho is the prey species are uneducated about wolves.
We need monitoring and research to better understand full impacts on Oregon's deer and elk populations.
Work cooperatively with Idaho on more research.
No wolves in Oregon.
We did not ask for Idaho's strays.
Remove them as they arrive.
Support wolf reintroduction, whether by natural or planned methods.
Stable funding needed for ODFW to be able to properly manage wolves and other species.
Supports wolves being regulated by specific agents instead of individual landowners, except when human life is at stake.
Believes there is no situation where a wild wolf should be killed.

Group 4 Facilitator: Bruce Campbell
Recorder: Richard Irish
Will Oregon be working on a recovery plan-what would the plan cover? Why do we have a choice based on Endangered Species Act parameters? Don't think Oregon can afford a wolf plan.
Wolf recovery would be the best thing that could happen.
Wolves should maintain endangered status on public land.
Encourage Oregon to have an education program about wolves.
If reduced to threatened status, does that allow control on public land? Limited controlled hunt if allowed under threatened status.
Would like to see wolves have rights on public lands.
Why should humans have the right to profit from grazing domestic animals on public lands while wolves are shot although they're native.
Concern that wolves are a social family-impact that hunting would disrupt the family social structure when trying to rebuild population.
Shooting has been proven to be ineffective in controlling populations of coyote, therefore with wolves.
Social hierarchy entirely different between wolves and coyotes-don't confuse the species.
Overjoyed and bursting in the heart to know that wolves are returning to Oregon.
To encourage recognizing wolves not as the bad guy-with intrinsic value.
Very close watch on all data on wolves and wildlife interacting with them.
Number of public land grazed cattle killed by wolves each year.
Concerned that the definition of recovery by primarily a scientific process rather than political.
Remove the wolf from the Oregon ESA list-we can't afford to manage it financially-let USFWS deal with it.
4
Lack of suitable habitat.
Negative impact to Oregon agriculture cost $158 x 106 negatively to Oregon agriculture.
Overall safety concern-vulnerability of wildlife, children, domestic pets, humans.
Wolves are not biologically in danger of extinction.
North America contains over 50,000.
Facilitating a compromise between economic and environmental interests.
(Ranchers on private land.)
There isn't sufficient prey base to support another large predator.
This is out chance to regain some sense of diverse life.
Cattle are the driving force for lowering the prey base-reduce cattle on public lands to create a higher prey base.
Auto road kill has a large impact on wildlife.
We people have always shown ourselves to be the most lethal and merciless of all predators-let another predator live here.
Concerned that the thoughtless and ignorance advancement of humans and our greediness is going to override the true right of wolves to exist.
They were here before us therefore they have as much right to be here as us.
*******************************************************************************************
Group 5 Facilitator: Rick Klumph How long do wolves remain experimental under ESA? How many are killed within that population each year by humans? What is states role in delisting process through federal process? What are the state and federal goals? Need for information? Ideas, direction.
Is the delisting issue purely economic with livestock industry?
Recorder: Vince Tranquill
State needs to develop a management plan.
People need time to adapt to wolves to allow to live with.
Don't set goals prior to experiencing wolves.
Period of full protection need for it, controlled by state personnel (staff) as part of a management plan.
5
Concern how will recover in Oregon based on land management in Oregon vs. other states.
Wants statewide habitat analysis based on prey base and human population density.
Remind Commission of ODFW Mission, which has nothing to do with livestock industry.
Today's decisions affecting future generations.
Start management plan sooner than later.
Governor appointed committee vs. a legislative appointed committee.
Livestock, hunters and people are affected by wolves.
All people are affected by wolves.
Recovery of wolves presents a positive economic affect to NE Oregon.
Eco-tourism should be factored into decisions.
When ODFW presentations are made, allows positive and negative statements including animals in neutral zone, benefits vs. costs, tourism and ecological.
There are positive affects.
Hope state does not spend 20 years to develop information, use information already generated to develop a management plan-don't repeat the process.
Need a massive education process to debunk myths vs. reasons why wolves were eradicated.
It is a multifaceted issue.
Commentator had a profound experience observing hybrids.
Welcomes the conflict to reincorporate nature.
Comments human-centric.
Wolves have natural right to be here-misuse of ODFW to prevent.
People or cattle...
Oregon 50% public ownership have sufficient resources-land and prey base.
Livestock most contentious.
Summarize what depredation has occurred in other states.
Make data/facts available to public.
Why is reintroduction not being considered at this time or future? Consider relocating wolves in NE Oregon to here-areas where less conflict with humans and habitat.
Ranchers are a small part of the total population.
I fed the wolves-they prefer deer and elk to beef and chicken.
Worked with them-personal experience.
People need to experience wolves--education.
Ranchers' concerns must be addressed and solutions provided if a management plan is to work.
6
Having seen entire populations of cattle wiped out by storms, etc., is cattle insurance available? Encouraging to have comments cover a large base.
Like to see a management plan emphasize recovery, not containment.
Concern that one wild scream in wilderness stop.
Value of animals so great.
Allow people to speak outside of economic model-above and beyond simple economics.
Reintroduction of wolves biggest ecological opportunity to Oregon in decades.
Ecosystem benefits to riparian and aquatic ecosystems as examples.
Consider everyone's needs.
Build an enforceable document (Management plan) that jives with federal ESA. Eco-historic opportunity 20-30 years.
State of Oregon goes beyond federal ESA.
State has duty to require protection beyond state lands.
ODFW needs to enforce state ESA to adopt a recovery plan.
Want to emphasize that the benefits of returning a keystone species goes beyond what we humans can perceive.
Wolves are a valuable natural resource.
People are slow to understand.
Allow wolves to survive and prosper.
Wolves need to be protected.
It is a shared planet.
If coming, commitment by ODFW to research and develop.
Like to see a state tax item check off dedicated to wolf research - would give indication of public sentiment.
Wolves are better for public land than cattle.
Vision-value system for our state-looking at wolves as good for humanity.
Hope Oregon doesn't make the mistake of other states: not wolf vs. rancher.
Reimbursement money to cattle ranchers address concerns of ranchers if to work.
Make if effective-we need it.
Education.
The people, issues and opportunities.
All Oregonians.
Look at re-education/re-training.
All economic options to reimbursement issue.
Fantastic if ODFW started mediating conflicting wolf interests-bring everyone to the table.
Strongly against wolves as a game animal with regular hunting seasons, control if needed by state and federal biologists.
Success based on attitude about wolves.
ODFW be positive about reintroduction.
ODFW has agency needs to develop goals based on science, not economics and politics.

Very different than spotted owl. *******************************************************************************************
Facilitator: Steve Smith
Recorder: Tami Wagner
Wolves are an important part of the ecosystem, important to have predators.
Should also protect livestock, perhaps pay.
Raising dogs with livestock can protect from wolves and other predators.
Wolves are important to us as humans.
Wolves will not naturally pursue livestock.
Wolves decimating livestock and elk herds in Yellowstone.
Budget/programs (wildlife and habitat protection) needed to educate public (public schools).
Have experts to advise.
Need programs to compensate ranchers.
Concerned about government involvement.
Studies provide no more knowledge, no problem since '30's with wolves.
Wolves may be needed in Oregon to control elk populations.
USFWS has no interest or would have done it.
Negative impact on Eastern Oregon and rural areas to livestock, livestock production and loss in hunt/recreation activities.
Oregon without wolves is broken-needs to be fixed.
Catch migrants and spay/neuter.
Negative impacts to deer and elk, bighorn and moose populations.
Why are they important to the food chain? Removing one part of the ecosystem leads to imbalance.
Wolf has a place somewhere.
Wolves may get into populated areas, concern for human safety.
Wildfires will force wolves into communities to eat pets and may eat babies.
We've done without wolves until now, why do we need them? Animals were here first.
People are being selfish.
No one has ever been attacked by a wolf Mexico-North Pole.
They will prefer prey they were raised on.
Don't delist in Oregon until numbers are established.
Wolves have lived with other animals for thousands of years without decimating them.
8
Remove from Oregon list.
As federal delisting occurs, Oregon should delist also.
Heard many reports of cougar problems (can't control)-don't need more problems.
ODFW may not be able to handle.
Elk and deer will be decimated.
Won't be any license/tag revenues for ODFW.
ODFW employees and Commission should be held criminally liable if a wolf harms a child.
Introducing wolves will destabilize prey populations for a while, then will stabilize.
Would like to hear wolves howl in Oregon.
ODFW should not perpetuate lies about wolf attacks.
They do occur.
Research.
Who pays the ranchers tax subsidies? We are the government.
Government should tax non-livestock owners for monetary losses (livestock).
Research ways to separate wolves and livestock.
Find some middle ground.
Can't afford wolves as a livestock owner, one more obstacle.
ODFW should continue to ask USFWS to remove migrants.
If there is a wolf plan in Oregon, will this absolve federal government responsibility? Not our wolves-don't accept their expense.
We need to respect the planet-won't be anything left but humans.
Need to do a better job of finding the wolves that are here now.
Some ranchers live with wolves-what are they doing right? Who are these ranchers? Worst predator now bear and cougar and numbers have increased.
Wolves can reproduce faster and are a killing machine--no wolves in Oregon.
All domestic dogs are related to wolves.
So why do we need wolves? Monitoring is too expensive-Oregon can't afford it.

I 
ODFW may be cutting our own jobs.

Group 6 Facilitator: Sue Knapp Why isn't wolf reintroduced into Oregon? Would parts of Idaho introduction plans apply to Oregon? Who would determine if wolf is listed in Oregon?
Recorder: Dave Budeau
Are state endangered species regulations less stringent than federal regulations? Oregon is wolf country, need balanced approach to have back in Oregon.
Very positive, extra effort to have meetings.
Big issue is how predators are viewed by government agencies.
Let them alone to start with.
Biology speaks for itself.
What are we deciding? How to deal with wandering wolves? What is the difference between managing cougars and wolves? I believe all predators are unwelcome in Oregon.
How are we going to welcome another predator when we can't manage the native predators we have.
I live in the country.
I welcome the wolves back.
Need to protect on private land.
Anti-cougar, hunting with hounds, still allows hounds in woods.
All predators in Oregon are mismanaged.
Keep ESA in place, persecution of coyotes has increased their populations.
Wolves in Yellowstone balanced coyote populations.
Keep hands off predators.
Let population naturally balance itself.
Have ESA protect wolves in Oregon.
Humans need to be managed as wolves-need education program.
There will be more conflict in Oregon than Idaho as wolves move into Oregon because less wilderness.
Need map of areas where wolves are protected in Oregon if dropped from federal ESA listing.
Need wolf and predator education in Oregon.
North of contiguous United States, maybe we can learn from Canada.
Are there ways to ease concerns of ranchers to livestock loss through reporting and compensation.
There should be a quick response to livestock kills by proper authorities.
10
Educate people on non-lethal ways to manage predators and protect livestock (Don't use traps, use llamas.)
Hire court reporter for the big meeting.
Focus education in counties where wolves are likely to occur.
I-84 is a big barricade.
Wolf impact on more than livestock, e.g. pets.
Manage wolves with other animals, like llamas.
Any way to diffuse polarization would help.
I have sheep, I see farmers mismanage.
Educate farmers and ranchers.
Use good management practices.
If wolves come back, need to invest in big game winter range-public.
Have good inventory of wolf and prey habitat-especially winter range for prey.
Don't lose but promote.
I hope our kids have the opportunity to see wild wolves in Oregon.

Group 8 Facilitator: Chris Wheaton
Recorder: Wayne Morrow
Article in R/G Newspaper suggests ODA to have jurisdiction over wolves.
Would prefer ODA to have jurisdiction over wolves.
Wants citizen concerns to also be heard, not just ranchers and hunters.
Use non-lethal predator control.
Favor natural introduction of wolves and wants state to assist with damage and education.
Landowner adjacent to BLM land-keep as endangered species and allow to naturally expand in Oregon.
Landowner, lost 10 sheep.
Need to be compensated for loss when there is damage/loss.
Damage to date has been by cougar.
If wolves cause damage, need compensation as well.
Compensation for livestock damage or if any citizen injured by wolf, would be negligent because the government allowed wolves back in.
Support natural reintroduction of wolves in Oregon.
Keep in perspective predator loss vs. all other livestock loss.
Encourage wolves to go where prey base is adequate/abundant.
Wolf predation small in perspective.
State should take responsibility for compensation.
11
Wants public informed about the realities of wolf reintroduction.
Recommends advisory committee to work with ODFW.
Allow wolves to do what they naturally do.
Didn't want wolves in the past.
Don't want wolves now.
Education is crucial.
Balance advisory committee with equal representation.
Agrees with compensation for damage.
Use lottery, income tax check-off for compensation fund.
Lemar valley/ encourage reintroduction of wolves for their ecological value.
Favor reintroduction of wolves along with protection for ranchers.
Assistance financially if possible.
Favor concerns for wolf welfare over hunter concerns relating to ungulate populations.
Favor wolf reintroduction along with compensation for landowners.
Study best methods for preventing damage to landowners (non-lethal).
Favor wolf reintroduction, support compensation, emphasis on education.
Support re-colonization of wolves in Oregon.

Explore strategies to minimize lethal control of wolves.
Encourage ODFW to work with Defenders of Wildlife for a non-state funded compensation program.
Favors natural reintroduction of wolves.
Favors full protection of wolves in Oregon on public lands.
Wolves should have priority because much livestock in Oregon is grazed on public lands at discount rates.
Wants compensation for small operators, not huge corporations.
Damage from predators cannot be claimed on income tax.
Compensation doesn't account for future value of loss (breeding animals).
Compensation should reflect true value of the loss and factor in creative response to the loss.
Committee to respond to these concerns so it is not so black and white.
Thinks we'll find wolf predation is low (will be low) and compensation won't be as much as we think.
12
Use tax check-off for option to go toward predator loss compensation.
Will have healthier ecosystems with natural wolf reintroduction.
Take into account Montana and Wyoming Elk situation (counts down by 1/3, Calf survival under 2% in Yellowstone.)
Start by putting wolves at Dean's Creek Elk Area-see what really happens.
Compensation for loss only on private land, not on public land.
Compensation only for proven wolf kills.
Educate to make sure other sources of predation not blamed on wolves (dogs, etc.).
In Yellowstone, coyote population dropped dramatically following wolf reintroduction.
Appears this is a city vs. country situation.
Why get something in here that we can't live with.
This is a larger issue than dollars and cents.
Need broader ecological view.
Need to do more restoration for the damage we've already done.
Wolves have a value in and of themselves, not just what they can do for us.
They are native to Oregon.
Where will wolves be reintroduced? Eastern Oregon, the Cascades, Troutdale? Where will populations establish? What are we going to do about wolf damage? Shouldn't have to live in fear.
Concerned about human safety.
Cougars have caused concerns.
Wolves do more.
Has more fear of drunken men with guns than wolves.
Acknowledge: Wolves do not attack people.
Wolves do attack people (other countries).
Use trained volunteers to do educational outreach.
Urge Commission to give full value to the citizens making these comments-we all have a stake in the state's future.
Where is money to come from for compensation? Who is going to pay for it? Why are we waiting so long for sightings to be reported and verified? In future, educate timber companies about value of wolves-control of ungulate populations who damage trees, as alternative or addition to hunters.
13
Explore strategies to minimize lethal control of wolves.
Impressed with Defenders of Wildlife compensation program-works well.
Domesticated wolves, cross-bred, turned loose.
This may responsible for some of the wolf sightings.
Do you know how to tell the difference between domestic vs. wild dogs? Domestic runs tail up and wild runs tail down.
Need to pay attention to wolves and their rights.
Get damage money from Nature Conservancy type organizations and wildlife conservatories (PETA).
Timber and ranching industry has a lot more money than environmental groups.
He who has nothing to lose-applies to us all.
