BEAUTIFUL FACES Performance Standard (7A/7B/7C/8B).I Measure photographs of seven persons for particular aspects of beauty, calculate a set of ratios to compare them to a standard of beauty (the Golden Ratio of (1 + 5) / 2) accordingly: Â· Mathematical knowledge: Measure distances and calculates ratios.
Â· Strategic knowledge: Solve problems involving scale and ratios.
Â· Explanation: Explain completely and clearly what was done and why it was done.
Procedures 1.
In order to measure and compare quantities using appropriate units, instruments, and methods (7A), estimate measurements and determine acceptable levels of accuracy (7B), select and use appropriate technology, instruments, and formulas to solve problems, interpret results, and communicate findings (7C), and interpret and describe numerical relationships using tables, graphs, and symbols (8B), students should experience sufficient learning opportunities to develop the following skills: Â· Calculate by an appropriate method the length, width, height, perimeter, area, volume, surface area, angle measures or sums of angle measures of common geometric figures or combinations of common geometric figures.
Â· Determine answers to an appropriate degree of accuracy using significant digits.
Â· Solve problems involving scale drawings, models, maps or blueprints.
Â· Approximate and interpret rates of change from graphical and numerical data.
Provide each student a copy of the "Beautiful Faces" task sheets and the rubric.
Have students review and discuss the task to be completed and how the rubric will be used to evaluate it.
If available, students should complete the task with Internet access in a classroom or outside of class to find "face shots" of 3 other famous persons on their own.
If internet is not available, they can find pictures of famous persons' faces in magazines.
Ask students to solve the following problems: In art, many sculptures and paintings of faces are considered to be beautiful.
Photographs of famous people can also be categorized as "beautiful faces" and "not so beautiful" faces.
Using a metric ruler, measure 4 pictures of faces to the nearest millimeter accordingly: a. top of head to chin; b. width of head at widest part; c. top of head to pupil of eye; d. pupil to where lips meet; e. length of lips (side to side, not smiling); and f. width of nose (widest part including nostrils).
Calculate the following ratios: a/b, c/d, and e/f.
Then compare your results to (1 + 5) / 2, also known as the Golden Ratio.
Download and print photographs of three famous people from the Internet, and make the same measurements.
Choose one of the people as famous but not necessarily considered attractive.
Write a comparison of the values you calculated for each of the pictures and the Golden Ratio and record any observations you have from this activity.

BEAUTIFUL FACES
In art, many sculptures and paintings of faces are considered to be beautiful.
Photographs of famous people can also be categorized as "beautiful faces" and "not so beautiful" faces.
Using a metric ruler, measure the following faces to the nearest millimeter:
a = top of head to chin b = width of head at widest part c = top of head to pupil of eye d = pupil to where lips meet
____________ ____________ ____________ ____________
a = top of head to chin b = width of head at widest part c = top of head to pupil of eye d = pupil to where lips meet
____________ ____________ ____________ ____________
e = length of lips ____________ (side to side, not smiling) f = width of nose ____________ (widest part including nostrils) Calculate the following: a/b = ____________ c/d = ____________ e/f = ____________
e = length of lips ____________ ( side to side, not smiling) f = width of nose ____________ (widest part including nostrils)
a/b = ____________ c/d = ____________ e/f = ____________
