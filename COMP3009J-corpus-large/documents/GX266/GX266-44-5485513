CHECKLIST OF FLORIDA'S BIRDS Prepared by The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Edited for Internet Use) Florida's wild places are home to an incredible diversity of birds.
A myriad of different habitats support this diversity from the pine flatwoods of Apalachicola National Forest, to the scrub communities of the Lake Wales Ridge, to the vast sawgrass prairies, mangrove swamps and cypress domes of Everglades National Park.
Our natural areas harbor many bird species seen nowhere else in the United States including the Florida Scrub-Jay, Mangrove Cuckoo and Snail Kite to name just a few.
In addition, Florida's birdlife is ever changing with the cycle of the seasons.
A virtually constant turnover of breeding, wintering and migratory species provide new birding experiences year-round.
To help you keep track of the spectacular range of birdlife the state has to offer, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Commission) has published this checklist of Florida's birds.
This booklet is the official checklist of the "Wings Over Florida" birding certificate program.
"Wings Over Florida" awards full-color certificates at five different achievement levels to birders who report their Florida life lists to the Commission.
This program is a free service for Florida residents.
For more information, visit www.wld.fwc.state.fl.us/wof/ or write to Wings Over Florida Certificate Program, Bureau of Wildlife Diversity Conservation, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, 620 S. Meridian Street, Tallahassee, FL, 32399-1600, and ask for an application packet.
If you wish to receive only the "Checklist of Florida's Birds," write to Bird Checklist at the same address.
The "Checklist of Florida's Birds" was first prepared by Dr. Henry M. Stevenson in 1986.
During his lifetime, Dr. Stevenson made many invaluable contributions to the field of ornithology, culminating with his writing The Birdlife of Florida with Bruce H. Anderson (1994).
This book offers the most comprehensive information published on the lives of Florida's birds.
This current checklist is based on "verified" records of native birds and established exotics from the book, Florida Bird Species: An Annotated List, published by the Florida Ornithological Society (Robertson and Woolfenden 1992).
Verified species are defined as those whose presence can be confirmed by reference to specimens, photographs or voice recordings.
In addition, more recently verified species were added from the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth reports of the Florida Ornithological Society Records Committee (Anderson 1996; Bowman 2000, in press).
Recent taxonomic changes were included from the seventh edition of the American Ornithologists' Union's Check-list of North American Birds (1998) and the forty-second supplement to the checklist
(AOU 2000).
At the publishing of this checklist, 485 verified species have been documented within the state of Florida in historical time (i.e., since European discovery).
This total includes 11 established exotics and four species now considered extinct in Florida.
Symbols used in the checklist are as follows: B -- A species that is (or formerly was) a breeder in Florida.
BI -- Species for which breeding is limited to introduced components of the population.
For example, Mallards winter in Florida in low numbers, but the only Mallards breeding here are introduced birds that are permanent residents in the state.
It is not known whether Whooping Cranes ever bred in Florida historically.
Breeding today is limited to individuals introduced to create a non-migratory population.
E -- Established exotic - non-native birds with stable or increasing breeding populations in Florida.
-- Extinct R -- Rare birds that should be documented and reported to the Florida Ornithological Society.
Send records to Reed Bowman, Secretary, Archbold Biological Station, P. O. Box 2057, Lake Placid, FL 33862.
Birding is always more enjoyable when you have information on where to go and what species to look for.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is developing the Great Florida Birding Trail to help you find Florida's birding hot spots.
To download or request your free copies of these trail guides, visit www.floridabirdingtrail.com.
Another source of information on the regional status and seasonal occurrence of Florida's birds (and where to find them) is Bill Pranty's A Birder's Guide to Florida published by the American Birding Association (1996).
Good luck and good birding!
