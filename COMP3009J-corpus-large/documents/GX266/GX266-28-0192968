Examine housing needs and choices for individuals and families Analyze components of housing design and construction Analyze components of interior space and planning Analyze the components of a safe and attractive environment Analyze career paths within the housing, interiors, and furnishings industry Demonstrate design and presentation skills What does a Typical Classroom Look Like? Because this course emphasizes full-class participation, teamwork, and individual projects and/or study, there should be enough room for tables, chairs, equipment, and lab stations.
Accommodations should be made for work stations with electrical outlets.
There should be enough storage space to contain resources, display activities, materials, software, and unfinished projects.
Both reusable and consumable instructional materials are generally used in this experience.
If there is not enough money in the school budget to purchase materials, equipment, and books, outside funding and/or in-kind services may be required.
Some teachers may need to develop classroom materials themselves.
If so, adequate time for developing the materials should be allowed.
Equipment might include an overhead projector, computers, videos/VCR's, camcorders, microcomputer courseware, and video courseware.
Special locks or other security precautions may need to be taken to protect equipment.
The teacher is the instructional facilitator and the manager of the classroom environment and resources.
He/she helps students identify instructional goals and creative activities, moves about the classroom observing and giving assistance, and works with other teachers to plan and deliver the curriculum.
The students are active rather than passive learners.
They do individual and group work.
They develop skills through hands-on activities, test theories, and relate and/or apply what they learn.
The classroom is always alive with activity, sounds, and conversation.
The purpose of this curriculum is to help students to make connections.
The one condition that makes this happen is teachers planning and teaching together.
Teachers can work together to integrate the curriculum.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 1 At least one teacher on the team is vocationally certified in Family and Consumer Sciences.
The teachers should regularly attend in-service activities and conferences to update and upgrade teaching and content knowledge.
Internships for the instructors are recommended to keep current in business and industry techniques.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 2 Sample Activities In addition to other activities and lessons, the following activities can be used as supplements to the curriculum framework to teach the competencies.
These activities may be used as written or adapted to meet the needs and abilities of individual students.
Teachers should consider other combinations and activities.

Other fabrics may be used if so desired.
SUPPLIES: Each lab group will need a pair of tweezers (to hold the fabric when being flame tested), a container of water, and a candle inserted in a beaker full of sand.
PROCEDURES: 1.
Describe the characteristics of the fabric swatch, how to care for the fabric, household uses, and the average cost.
You may need to look up some of this information.
2.
Cut a small piece from the fabric swatch to be flame tested.
3.
Holding the fabric piece with the tweezers, place it in the candle flame.
Observe what occurs.
What was the flame like? Did it smoke? What was the odor? Were ashes produced? If so, describe them.
4. Record the results in the appropriate box on the fabric cards.
5.
Attach the unburned portion of your swatch to the fabric card in the designated space.
TEACHER'S NOTE: Other experiments may be conducted such as the application of heat, rather than an open flame (using an iron) or the effects of chemicals (such as acetate) when applied to these fabrics.

Their dyes work well and do not wash out.
Tie dyeing is a craft that dates back to ancient times in China, Japan, and India.
It become popular in America among the "hippie" generation during the 60's.
The 90's somewhat a repeat of the 60's, has made tie dyeing popular again.
The intent of tie dyeing in interior design is not necessarily to be a "flower child," but rather to see others combine and experience a method of dyeing techniques.
Dye may come from a natural source such as onion skin, beets, roots, etc.
These give a muted natural color.
Contemporary commercial dyes, like RIT dye will give more vibrant colors and offer a wider selection, but still are less vibrant than spray dyes that can be purchased in many categories.
Natural fabrics generally dye best.
Cotton is the most readily available, but silk is best for a more dedicate, intricate design.
Nylon also dyes well.
Light-weight fabrics tend to produce better results.
You can experiment with techniques, but every design is unique and considered a work of art.
It might be fun to first dye a pair of socks, then move on to a T-shirt or a broomstick skirt of matching outfit.
I T-shirt, men's cotton boxers, and a pair of socks are other favorites.
Techniques Designs are created by "tying off" an area of fabric.
The idea is to dye part of the fabric while protecting other areas to create a design.
The most common method is simply scrunching a handful of fabric together and wrapping it with an elastic.
Wherever the elastic is placed, the fabric will remain the original color, creating a burst of color surrounded by a line of the original color of the article.
This design can be altered by placing a coin or stone inside the fabric before wrapping with the elastic.
There are many, many ways to tie the fabric.
Try using tape on both sides of the garment to create lettering or stripes.
Designs may also be hand-stitched into the fabric, gathered together lightly and covered with plastic before dyeing to create specific designs such as hearts, stars, etc
.Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 32 Bath Dyeing Prepare dye according to package directions.
Place fabric in bath.
Immerse all areas you desire to be dyed completely at least 10-15 minutes.
Do not leave in longer than one hour.
For more intense colors use hot water, allow the article to remain in the dye for long periods of time, or add salt (1-2 cups per package).
Natural dyes work best when heated in a pot on top o ft he stove and stirred.
Agitation will give uniform results.
Too little agitation results in splotchy spots, desirable if you want a marble or acidwash effect.
Remove the fabric from the dye bath.
DO NOT remove the elastics.
Allow the project to dry on a well-protected surface for several hours, turning every hour for the first 4-5 hours and every 6 hours for the next 24 hours to avoid dark ridges from forming where the dye evaporates.
Using More Than One Color If a second color is desired, remove the article from the first dye bath, rinse in cool water until the water runs clear.
Remove the ties and tie again in a new design.
Place in the second color.
Remove and rinse again.
Remove the ties and dry on a hanger.
The dye will continue to migrate until the cloth is dry.
For a more distinct design, remove ties only after the garment is completely dry.
Setting the Dye Heat set the dye by pressing with a hot iron, or by drying in a clothes dryer for about 20 minutes.
Care of the Finished Article To clean the garment after use, wash separately in cool water and mild detergent.
Spray Dyeing Most craft stores stock dye in spray bottles ready for immediate application.
Any dye may be placed in a bottle and used as a spray, but the colors will not be as vibrant as commercial spray dyes.
When spray dyeing, wear old clothing and cover an 8 - 10 foot area with plastic.
Tie off the article and wet it for a muted, blended look.
Spray thoroughly, spread open the folds (wear plastic gloves) and spray inside without removing the elastics, to ensure uniform dyeing.
Turn and spray the other side of the article.
If using more than one color, be careful to clean work areas before and after spraying the wet article.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 33 Some designs can be created with spray dye that won't work using the bath method.
A favorite is to twist the article starting at the center into a tight ball, then securing with three large elastics crisscrossing to create six areas.
Spray each area a different color or alternate 2 or 3 colors.
Spray the back of the article with corresponding colors.
Another popular design is to create the illusion of a sunflower.
Simply tie a small portion of the fabric for the flower center, followed by a larger section for the petals, followed by an even larger section for the leaves.
Spray each section separately, being careful of the over spray.
Spray dyeing may also be done on a dry garment.
Simply place the article on a 3-5 foot plastic covered area.
Twist or fold a design into the article you desire to dye and spray with the dye in the designated areas.
When using more than one color, straighten the article and fold or twist into a new design, then spray.
Continue this process until all the desired colors have been applied to the fabric.
Hang in a protected area for 1-2 hours.
Colors sprayed onto dry fabric will be more vibrant and will not migrate into other colors.
Allow the project to dry on a well-protected surface for several hours, turning every hour for the first 45 hours and every 6 hours for the next 24 hours to avoid dark ridges from forming where the dye evaporates.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 34 Stenciling on Fabric Stenciling is an easy, inexpensive technique for decorating any flat surface: fabric, floors, walls.
Stenciling is fun because it allows creation of designs tailored to you and your home.
By using your own creativity, it ensures an original design.
Any natural fiber, except wool and cotton blends, may be stenciled.
Before stenciling, was the fabric to remove the sizing, then dry and press.
MATERIALS: Stencil pattern or plastic sheets to make your own stencil Utility knife (X-acto) Glass Pencil Black marking pen Masking tape Brushes or sponges to apply paint Textile paints Plate to hold paint Spoon or palette knife to mix paints Paper towels Fabric Iron MAKING A STENCIL: 1.
Transfer the design of your choice to a plastic stencil sheet (available at craft stores).
You will need a sheet for each color to be used in your design.
2.
Cut the designs in the plastic sheets using a sharp utility knife (X-acto).
Place the stencils on glass for a better cutting surface.
3.
Mark the fabric with the design to ensure the stencil will be placed correctly.
4.
Tape the precut stencil to the fabric and begin painting.
Dip the brush in the paint and wipe off any excess paint.
Apply with dabbing strokes.
Start at the edge and work toward the center.
5.
Before lifting the stencil, make sure all areas have been covered.
Lift the stencil straight up from the cloth.
6.
LET THE PAINT DRY COMPLETELY.
7.
Repeat this process for other colors you wish to use.
ALLOW DRYING TIME BETWEEN EACH COLOR.
8.
After letting the pain dry completely, heat seal the paint by ironing both sides for three minutes.

When working as an interior designer, the client's (not the designer's) desire to use specific colors will be the controlling factor.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 41 Activity: 9 Presentation Techniques Interior perspective are drawings of a room inside a home, which include backgrounds, furnishings, and accessories planned for the finished project.
When color, shades, shadows, pattern, and texture, are added to an interior perspective drawing, it is known as a rendering.
Presentation floor plans present not only the layout of rooms in a home, but may include traffic patterns, appliances, and furniture arrangement.
Color may also be added to define areas.
A presentation election represents sides of a room, but displays no depth.
Presentation boards enable a client to visualize the proposed finished product by displaying colors, designs, and textures that will be used in the completed room.
Mat board or illustration board is used for mounting manufacturers samples, drawings, and photos.
Models may be used by the designer to allow the client to view all sides of a proposed project by showing a three-dimensional likeness.
For more advanced presentations, slides may be used to show examples of previous work or designs used in similar situations to that of the client.
A plan without text does not communicate a complete description of the various components.
Appropriate text helps communicate information, but also makes the presentation look professional.
Practice is necessary to develop skills necessary for legible lettering.
Place lettering transparency on the overhead projector.

All projects must have a title.
Check the spelling of all words for accuracy.
Always use guidelines when lettering.
Block lettering is the basic lettering and is acceptable for project presentations.
Letters should be bold and clear.
Avoid making fancy, cute letters.
Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 42 5. Make each line quickly from the beginning to the end of the stroke.
This makes the lines straighter and more accurate.
Begin the letter with a straight line, then add diagonal and curved lines.
Letters will be written in a variety of sizes.
Generally, the smaller the letter, the easier it is to write.
Practice lettering in a variety of sizes.
Block letters are usually all CAPITALIZED.
The size of the lettering is usually related to the importance of the labeling.
For example, titles are lettered larger than notes in small areas.
Spacing between letters and words is cortical.
Think of all the letters as being the same size, approximately square ("M" and "W" are a little wider.)
Labeling should be done from left to right.
Keep borders simpleavoid flowers and excessive curved lines.
Simple border unite the project and make it look professional.
Rounded letters will slightly top the guidelines and can be slightly closer together than straight letters.
Do not cross "J" and "I".
There are definite strokes to be used when lettering.
Practice lettering, using the stroke guidelines shown on the next page.
Use a soft pencil, but be careful not to smudge your lettering.
Keep the point on your pencil sharp at all times.

Do you have any idea what that term means? Programming is helping a family find a house that fits their particular needs.
No matter where one lives there are certain needs a person has, regarding living space.
Can you identify some of these needs (privacy, cleanliness, protection, beauty, etc.)? There are many influences for selecting a place to live: 1.
What are the employment opportunities? 2.
Are the roads and highways finished and usable? 3.
Is public transportation available? 4.
How are the schools? 5.
What is the crime rate? 6.
How is the climate? 7.
What is the cost of living relative to income potential? It is a challenge to discuss the specific needs of people because we so often incorrectly stereotype personalities and circumstances.
For example, many high-strung athletes enjoy doing hand-work, such as counted cross-stitch and many frail-looking women drive school buses.
In our discussion today, remember that we are discussing society's perceptions of the average family or person.
However, keep clear in you mind that each person is an individual, and only he/she knows what individual needs are most important to him/her.
Discuss the typical advantages and disadvantages of the various types of living conditions, but remember there will be exceptions to all of them.

The Zoning Board has the power to make exceptions to the zoning laws on a case by case basis (this is called a variance and the special use is referred to as nonconforming).
Zoning laws mandate the kinds of building that can be built size of lots minimum size of dwelling minimum number of rooms in a dwelling kinds of businesses that may be allowed setbacks how close to other buildings a new building may stand how far from the street and other boundaries a building must be Building Code Building codes contain rules about building construction.
They specify such things as the width, height, and number of doors a building must have; the kind of electrical wiring that may be used; and the fire safety rating of insulation materials that is acceptable.
They are designed to ensure that health and safety standards are met throughout a community.
Housing codes also regulate housing that is already constructed.
These laws require certain minimum facilities and equipment such as good heating systems, adequate Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 54 lighting, and complete bathroom.
These codes also attempt to limit the number of persons or families that can reside in each living unit.
The primary reason for having housing codes is to ensure safe and sanitary housing conditions for the residents of a community.

Identify each ad as it relates to the numbered situations below.
Attach the adds to this worksheet and explain why you selected each ad.
Remember, housing costs should not exceed 25% of take home pay per month.
This means the total price of a house should not exceed 2.5 times an annual salary.
