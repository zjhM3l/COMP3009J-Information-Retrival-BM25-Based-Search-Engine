Dear Fellow Virginians: As Attorney General of Virginia, one of my most important duties is to serve as Consumer Counsel for the citizens of the Commonwealth.
My office works every day to fight consumer fraud, to protect Virginians from those who prey on unsuspecting victims, and to increase consumer awareness and fraud prevention through education.
In recent years, "identity theft" has become a growing problem in Virginia and around the nation.
"Identity theft" occurs when an imposter misuses your personal identifying information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, secure deposits on cars and houses, rent property, establish utility service and obtain benefits such as insurance or social security.
This form of financial sabotage can devastate your credit and take endless hours of telephone and written communication to resolve.
Identity theft is a criminal offense in the Commonwealth.
All Virginians should be aware of this increasingly widespread method of identity theft.
My office has produced this guide to assist you in preventing identity theft.
Should you become a victim, this guide can help you regain your good name and credit record.
If you would like further information, please write to the Office of the Attorney General, Victim Notification Program, 900 East Main Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219, e-mail at mail@oag.state.va.us, or visit us at www.oag.state.va.us or call 800.370.0459.
It is a great honor to serve as your Attorney General, and I hope you will find this guide helpful in making you feel more confident about your personal and financial security.
Sincerely,
Jerry W. Kilgore Attorney General

How to Avoid Identity Theft 
HOW TO AVOID IDENTITY THEFT Identity theft crimes are on the rise across the nation.
Your personal identifying information can be accessed in a variety of ways.
An imposter can misuse your information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, secure deposits on cars and housing, obtain employment opportunities, create insurance benefits, and rob retirement earnings.
This form of financial sabotage can devastate your credit, and require endless hours of telephone and written communication to resolve.
In the meantime, you may experience difficulty writing checks, renting apartments, and securing employment.
While following these precautionary steps is not a guarantee of protection, it will greatly reduce your chances of becoming the next identity theft victim.
The rapid advance in technology in the past fifty years has created an "information revolution" that has affected government, business, commerce, education, and communication.
Sadly, in recent years the increased use of computers has also led to sophisticated opportunities for criminal activity.
Hardly a day goes by that the news media does not report new examples of the use of computers and the Internet to commit fraud and economic crimes such as identity theft.
Thieves and con-artists often use ordinary means to obtain an individual's personal information by going through mailboxes or trash cans for credit card receipts or calling potential victims pretending to be on official business.
Once they have the stolen information in hand, criminals often employ computers and the Internet to quickly and easily profit from it.
A thief can open accounts or purchase merchandise with a click on the computer; and credit can be obtained in your name without any face-to-face interaction.
Virginia recognized the need to address this new form of crime and in 1999 established a Computer Crime Unit within the Office of the Attorney General.
The Computer Crime Unit is comprised of specially trained and equipped investigators and attorneys skilled in computer, communication and Internet technologies in order to vigorously investigate and prosecute illegal activities conducted over the Internet.
The foremost mission of the Computer Crime Unit is to proactively investigate and prosecute crimes such as identity theft that are committed by means of a computer.
If you need assistance in the investigation and/or prosecution of a computer-facilitated identity theft crime, contact the Office of the Attorney General, Computer Crime Unit at 804.786.8587, 877.245.5521 or at cybercrime@oag.state.va.us.

REDUCING ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: To minimize the amount of information subject to theft, do not carry extra credit cards, your Social Security card, birth certificate, or passport in your wallet or purse, except when needed.
To reduce the amount of your personal information that is in circulation, you may wish to consider the following: Remove your name from the marketing lists of the three credit reporting bureaus--Equifax Information Services, LLC , Experian (TRW), and Trans Union.
This will limit the number of pre-approved offers of credit that you receive in the mail.
When in transit or tossed into the garbage, such solicitations are a potential target of identity thieves who can use them to order credit cards in your name.
Order your credit report once a year from each of the three credit bureaus to check for inaccuracies and fraudulent use of your accounts.
Monitoring your credit card statements and your credit report are the most important steps you can take to safeguard your credit identity.

How to Avoid Identity Theft 
Remove your name, home address, and home telephone number from many mailing and telephone lists through the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service.
This free service is only available for individuals and home addresses (not businesses).
You will only be removed from the Direct Marketing Association's member lists for five years, so after five years you need to request to be removed again.
To remove your name and home address from national mailing lists, write to: DMA Mail Preference Service Preference Service Manager 1120 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036-6700 www.the-dma.org/cgi/offmailinglistdave#regform To remove your name from telephone solicitation lists, write to: DMA Telephone Preference Service Manager Preference Service Manager 1120 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036-6700 www.the-dma.org/cgi/offtelephonedave Remove your name and address from the telephone book, reverse directories, and city directories.
There is usually a nominal monthly charge for this service.
It typically ranges from $1 to $2 per month.
By eliminating your name from these sources, you can reduce access to your personal information from sources such as the Internet (where public information resources are used as databases), telemarketers, and identity thieves.
Please call your local telephone service to make these changes.
Virginia law does require you to disclose your Social Security number to the Department of Motor Vehicles when applying for a Virginia driver's license, even though it will not be on your license.
The Social Security number is the most frequently used record keeping number in the United States.
The widespread use of Social Security numbers makes invasion of privacy and fraud easier.
As of July 1, 2002, Virginia law requires that a driver's license number be different than a licensee's social security number unless the licensee requests in writing that his social security number be used.
(Virginia Code Section 46.2-342) How to Avoid Identity Theft 
7
Virginia law protects personal information contained within motor vehicle records from public disclosure, except in limited circumstances.
(Virginia Code Section 46.2Â­208).
Virginia law prohibits the State Board of Elections from releasing the Social Security number of any registered voter except on lists furnished to a court of the Commonwealth or the United States for jury selection purposes.
(Virginia Code Sections 24.2Â­405 and 444).
Install a locked mailbox at your residence to reduce mail theft or use a post office box.
When you order new checks, consider removing extra information such as your Social Security number, assigned driver's license number, middle name, and telephone number.
The less personal identifying information you make available, the more likely an identity thief will choose an easier target.
Do not have new checks sent to your home mailbox; ask that they be delivered to the financial institution and make arrangements to pick them up in person.
When you pay bills, do not leave the envelopes containing your checks at your home mailbox for the postal carrier to deliver.
If stolen, your checks can be altered and then cashed.
If stolen, credit card payments contain all the necessary information that an identity thief needs.
To the maximum extent possible, do not write your credit card account number or Social Security number on your checks when making a payment.
Virginia law generally prohibits merchants from requiring customers who pay for goods or services by check to produce a credit card for recordation of the number on the check.
(Virginia Code Section 11Â­33.1.)
Due to an increased risk of theft and vandalism, it is best to mail bills, tax payments, and other sensitive items at the post office rather than from your residence or neighborhood drop boxes.

E. Upon conviction, in addition to any other punishment, a person found guilty of this offense shall be ordered by the court to make restitution as the court deems appropriate to any person whose identifying information was appropriated.
Such restitution may include the person's actual expenses associated with correcting inaccuracies or errors in his credit report or other identifying information.
F. Upon the request of a person whose identifying information was appropriated, the Attorney General may provide assistance to the victim in obtaining information necessary to correct inaccuracies or errors in his credit report or other identifying information; however, no legal representation shall be afforded such person.
CREDIT CARDS: Reduce the number of credit cards you actively use to a bare minimum.
Carry only one or two of them in your wallet.
Cancel all unused accounts.
Even though you do not use them, their account numbers are recorded in your credit report, which is full of data that can be used by identity thieves.
Keep a list or photocopy of all of dates, and the telephone numbers of your card issuers.
Keep this list in a can quickly contact your creditors in same with your bank accounts.

Do the
Never give your credit card number or other personal information over the telephone unless you have a trusted business relationship with the company AND YOU HAVE INITIATED THE CALL.
Identity thieves have been known to call their victims with a fake story that goes something like this: "Today is your lucky day! You have been chosen by the _______ Sweepstakes to receive a free trip to the Bahamas.
All we need is your credit card number and expiration date to verify you as the lucky winner."
Always take credit card and ATM receipts with you.
Never toss them in a public trash container.
You should also shred such receipts before discarding them in the garbage.
Request, in writing, that each of your credit card issuers removes your name from any marketing and promotional lists that they may sell or share with other 10 How to Avoid Identity Theft 
companies.
In addition, if any of your credit card issuers send random issue convenience checks, request, in writing, to be removed from their mailing list for these checks.
Credit card convenience checks are easy prey for identity thieves to steal and use, while often times the consumer is unaware that the checks were even issued.
Your credit card billing statement should contain a different address for correspondence to the issuer.
Do not send your requests to the same address where you send your credit card payments.
Watch the mail when you are expecting a new credit card that you have applied for or a reissued credit card that has expired.
Immediately contact the issuer if the credit card does not arrive.
One of the benefits for consumers using the Internet, a global network of interlinked computer networks, is the ability to purchase products and services around the clock electronically from the convenience of their home or office.
One of the drawbacks is the potential for fraud and deception.
Be very careful before you use a credit card on the Internet or provide personal information (such as your Social Security number or date of birth) on an electronic application.
When creating passwords and PINs, do not use the last four digits of your Social Security number, your birthdate, middle name, mother's maiden name, address, or anything else that could be discovered easily by thieves.
Ask your financial institution to add extra security protection to your account.
Most will allow you to use an additional code (a number or a word) when accessing your account.
Do not use the common passwords and PINs listed above.
Memorize all your passwords.
Don't record them on anything in your wallet, purse, or dayplanner.
Shield your hand when using your PIN at an ATM, a debit machine, or when making long distance phone calls with your phone card.
"Shoulder surfers" may be spying nearby with binoculars or a video camera.

SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS: Protect your Social Security number.
Release it only when absolutely necessary or when required by law (such as tax forms, employment records, banking/stock/property transactions, driver's/marriage/professional license applications, etc.).
If a government agency requests important personal information, including your Social Security number, a Privacy Act notice should accompany the request.
(5 United States Code Section 552a(e)(3)).
This notice will explain whether disclosure of such information is required or requested, the use that will be made of the information, and what will happen if you refuse to provide all or any part of the information.
Your Social Security number is the key to your banking accounts, credit card accounts, and your insurance and health benefits.
This makes it a prime target of identity thieves.
As previously discussed, you may wish to use an "assigned" driver's license number rather than your Social Security number whenever possible.
Do not have your Social Security number printed on your checks.
Because of the risk of fraud, even though one may be requested for identification, ask that merchants not hand-write your Social Security number on your checks.
Currently, however, there is no law against a merchant requiring you to divulge your Social Security number for recordation before accepting a check.
Offering an assigned driver's license number is usually an adequate substitute.
Order a copy of your Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) (SSA-7004) from the Social Security Administration every three years to check for inaccuracies or fraud.
To request a PEBES application call or write to: Office of Public Inquiries 6401 Security Blvd.
Baltimore, MD 21235 Phone: 1.800.772.1213 Web site to download a PEBES application: http://www.ssa.gov

How to Avoid Identity Theft 
RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION HANDLING: Carefully review your credit card statements and all of your bills for unauthorized charges or fraudulent use.
Be especially careful with your phone bills, because your local telephone company is obliged to let other carriers use their billing systems for a fee.
More and more unscrupulous third parties are billing consumers for goods such as: special services, calling plans, or memberships that they did not order and do not want.
The practice is commonly called "cramming."
Scrutinize your local, long distance, and cellular telephone bills each month for fraudulent or unauthorized charges.
Additionally, be aware that some long distance telephone companies resort to deceptive tactics to switch your service without authorization.
This practice is commonly called "slamming".
You may contact your local telephone company to verify your long distance carrier and request a freeze on your account, which prevents account changes without your specific authorization using a password.
There is often a nominal fee to "freeze" your account.
Do not toss credit card convenience checks or pre-approved credit offers in your trash or recycling bin without first tearing them into small pieces or shredding them.
They can be used by "dumpster divers" to cash the checks or order credit cards in your name and mail them to their address.
Do the same with other sensitive information like credit card receipts, banking statements and phone bills.
Home shredders can be purchased in most office supply stores.
Demand that your financial institution adequately safeguard your personal identifying information.
Discourage your bank from using the last four digits of your Social Security number as your assigned personal identification number (PIN).
Request that your financial institution remove account numbers from ATM receipts (many have already done so).
Inquire whether they shred all paper records before discarding them.
Always take your receipts from ATMs with you and shred or store them in a safe place.
By adopting responsible information handling practices, you and your financial institution can reduce the risk of fraud.

When you complete credit or loan applications, determine how the company disposes of them.
If you are not convinced that they store them in locked files and/or shred them, you may want to take your business elsewhere.
Some auto dealerships, department stores, car rental agencies, and video stores have been known to be careless with customer applications.
For example, an employee at the business with insider access may retrieve your personal information to sell or use fraudulently.
When you pay by credit card, ask the business how it stores and disposes of the transaction slip.
Avoid paying by credit card if you think the business does not use adequate safeguards.
Store your canceled checks in a safe place.
In the wrong hands, they could reveal a lot of information about you, including your account number, telephone number, and driver's license number.
To the maximum extent possible, do not permit your credit card number to be written onto your checks.
As a general rule and as noted above, Virginia law prohibits merchants from recording your credit card number as a condition of acceptance of a check for the sale of goods or services.
Virginia law does NOT prohibit a merchant from requesting that you display a credit card, in limited situations, and for limited purposes, such as an indication of credit worthiness or identification, and in these situations allows the merchant to record only the card type, the issuer (bank name) and the expiration date of the credit card.
However, a credit card number may be requested and recorded in lieu of a deposit to secure payment in the event of loss, damage, or default.
(Virginia Code Section 11-33.1.)
When in public places, always be aware of your surroundings.
Thieves commonly use a distraction in cramped public places such as elevators and revolving doors to "bump and lift" your money, identification, and credit cards.
Be especially cautious with bags and purses that can be an easy target for a thief to grab and run.
Magazines, credit card companies, clubs and organizations, charities, manufacturers, and retailers often make lists of their subscribers, customers, members, and donors available to other businesses for a fee.
Because your personal information is reproduced and sold in countless ways, you should always exercise caution when you are making personal identifying information available by utilizing the Internet, sending a mail-in rebate/survey/warranty card, entering a drawing or sweepstakes, donating money, and even subscribing to magazine services.

FEDERAL AND STATE IDENTITY THEFT LAWS The federal government and several states have passed identity theft laws.
Virginia's identity fraud statute is at Va.
Code Ann.
Section 18.2-186.3.
The Federal Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act is at 18 U.S.C.
Section 1028.
Federal identity theft cases are prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice.
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a national clearinghouse for identity theft.
If you are a victim, you can file a complaint with the FTC.
The FTC will make your complaint available to law enforcement nationwide to assist them in their investigations and prosecutions of identity thieves.
The FTC also aggregates the information in your complaint with other complaints to develop trends and statistics which enable policymakers and others to better understand identity theft and to craft effective remedies.
Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft Clearinghouse 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580 Toll-Free Hotline: 1.877.IDTHEFT (1.877.438.4338) TDD: 1.202.326.2502
CREDIT BUREAUS Immediately call the fraud units of the three credit reporting companies-- Equifax Information Services, LLC, Experian (TRW), and Trans Union.
Report the theft of your credit cards and the misuse of your account numbers.
Request that your credit account be flagged.
Also, add a victim's statement (up to 100 words) to your report, such as: "My identification has been used to apply for fraudulent credit.
Contact me at [your telephone number or mailing address] to verify ALL applications."
Be sure to ask how long the fraud alert is posted on your credit account and how you can extend it if necessary.
Be aware that these measures may not entirely stop fraudulent new accounts from being opened by the identity thief.
Ask the credit bureaus in writing to provide you with copies every few months so you can monitor your credit report.
Upon 16 How to Avoid Identity Theft 
your request, a credit bureau is required to provide you with one free credit report during any 12-month period if you have reason to believe the report contains inaccurate information due to fraud.
Additional credit reports shall not exceed an $8.00 charge and this fee is often waived.
(15 United States Code Section 1682j(c)(3)).
Request, in writing, that the credit bureaus provide you with the names and phone numbers of credit grantors with whom fraudulent accounts have been opened.
Request, in writing, that the credit bureaus remove inquiries that have been generated due to the fraudulent access.
Request, in writing, that all fraudulent information and inquiries be permanently removed from your credit report.
You may also request the credit bureaus to notify those who have received your credit report in the last six months to alert them to the disputed and erroneous information (two years for employers).

CREDITORS Contact all creditors immediately with whom your name has been used fraudulently--by telephone and in writing.
Obtain replacement cards with new account numbers for your own accounts that have been used fraudulently.
Ask that old accounts be processed as "account closed at consumer's request."
This is better than "card lost or stolen," because when this statement is reported to credit bureaus, it can be interpreted as blaming you for the loss.
Carefully monitor your mail and credit card statements for evidence of fraudulent activity.
If you find such activities, report it immediately to credit grantors.

The Federal Truth in Lending Act limits your liability--in most cases--for unauthorized credit card charges to $50.00 per card.
You must notify your credit card issuers in writing.
The Federal Fair Credit Billing Act establishes procedures for resolving billing errors on your credit card accounts.
For more information on these laws, contact the FTC (see contact information under the Federal Trade Commmission listed on page 16).
Request that credit grantors provide you with a copy of all fraudulent credit applications and all statements of incurred charges.
Such information may be helpful in disputing the application and/or charges as fraudulent.
If the credit grantor resists providing you this information, contact your local police or sheriff 's department for assistance.
The credit grantor should readily provide such information when requested to do so by local law enforcement authorities.
Pay particular attention to the personal identifying information the identity thief has provided on the application and note any discrepancies that may exist.
When reviewing the charges, note the date of the purchases, where the purchases were made, and what types of products or services were purchased.
Look for dates, places or items that contradict your own schedule, whereabouts, or tastes.
CREDIT REQUIREMENTS TO VERIFY FRAUD You may be asked by banks or credit grantors to complete and notarize fraud affidavits, which could become costly.
The law does NOT require that a notarized affidavit be provided to banks or creditors.
A written statement and supporting documentation should be sufficient (unless the bank or creditor offers to pay for the notary).
Overly burdensome requirements by banks or creditors should be reported to the government authority that regulates the credit card issuer.
To determine which authority regulates the particular credit card issuer in question, contact: State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions 1300 East Main Street, Suite 800 P.O. Box 640 Richmond, Virginia 23218 - 0640 Phone:.

SECRET SERVICE JURISDICTION The Secret Service investigates crimes dealing with credit card fraud, financial institution fraud, and crimes dealing with the false use of personal identifiers (such as name, date of birth, or Social Security number) relating to financial crimes.
However, the Secret Service usually does not investigate individual cases unless the dollar amount is high or you are one of many victims of a fraud ring.
If the actual crime (fraudulent application or charges) occurred outside of Virginia, the Secret Service may forward your case to the appropriate office.

charges.
Notify your gas, electric, water, cable, and trash utilities that you are a victim of identity theft and alert them to the possibility that the thief may try to establish accounts using your personal information.
DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER MISUSE You may need to change your driver's license number if someone is using your number fraudulently.
Call the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles' Information Center and verify the last issuance date of your license.
If there is a discrepancy and you have a non-commercial driver's license, go to your local driver's license station and apply for a duplicate license with an assigned number.

If a civil judgment has been entered against you for actions taken by your imposter, contact the court, or the Commonwealth's Attorney where the judgment was entered and report that you are a victim of identity theft.
If you are wrongfully prosecuted for criminal charges, contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and ask how to clear your name.

CREDIT REPORT FRAUD If you find that there has been unauthorized access or use of your credit report, both this office and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can provide you with information about your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
The FTC receives complaints from consumers who are victims of identity theft.
The FTC does not investigate or prosecute criminal cases; those are handled by the United States Department of Justice.
The Commission can provide information to consumers who have been victimized by identity theft to assist them in resolving the financial and other problems that can result from this crime.

INSURANCE COVERAGE You may want to consult your insurance agent to determine whether your losses are covered by household or other insurance policies.
LEGAL HELP You may want to consult a private attorney to determine what legal action to take against credit grantors and/or credit bureaus if they are not cooperative in removing fraudulent entries from your credit report or if their negligence is a factor.
An attorney can help you recover from the fraud and determine whether your rights under various credit, banking, Social Security, and other laws have been violated.
The Lawyer Referral Service of the Virginia State Bar can provide you with the names of attorneys in your area that handle consumer protection issues.
If you should decide to consult with the attorney to whom you were referred, this service ensures that you will not be charged more than $25.00 for the first half hour of consultation.
