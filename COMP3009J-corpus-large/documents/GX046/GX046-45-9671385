Chapter 3.
TEXAS WORKS
The Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) adopts the repeal of Subchapter PP, consisting of Â§3.6001; and adopts new Subchapter H, consisting of Â§Â§3.801-3.810, without changes to the proposed text published in the May 9, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 3804).
DHS undertook the repeal and new sections as part of its initiative to reorganize Chapter 3 rules and write them in plain language question-and-answer format that is easier for the public to understand.
DHS also wanted to place rules concerning time limits for both the Food Stamp and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs in one subchapter.
New Â§3.807 establishes a 60-month lifetime limit for receipt of TANF cash assistance, whether funded by TANF federal or TANF state dollars.
Current rules allowed for a time limit inequity in the TANF-State Program (TANF-SP), which limited receipt of TANF-SP assistance to 60 months lifetime and counted cash assistance months from both TANF and TANF-SP in calculating the lifetime limit.
Receipt of TANF cash assistance also had a 60-month lifetime limit, but months of TANF-SP assistance did not count toward the lifetime limit, which led to the inequity between the programs.
DHS proposed the new rule to eliminate the inequity and to eliminate confusion on the part of staff and clients in calculating the lifetime limit.
DHS received no comments regarding adoption of the repeal and the new sections, including at the public hearing held on May 20, 2003.
Subchapter H. TIME LIMITS: THE TANF AND FOOD STAMP PROGRAMS
40 TAC Â§Â§3.801 - 3.810
The new sections are adopted under the Human Resources Code, Chapters 31, 33, and 34, which authorizes DHS to administer financial and nutritional assistance programs and to administer a state temporary assistance and support services program.
The new sections implement the Human Resources Code, Â§Â§31.001-31.081, 33.001- 33.027, and 34.001-34.007.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

GENERAL RULES OF THE VETERANS LAND BOARD
Subchapter A. GENERAL RULES AND CONTRACTING FINANCING
40 TAC Â§175.19, Â§175.23
The Veterans Land Board of the State of Texas (the "Board") adopts amendments to Title 40, Part 5, Chapter 175 of the Texas Administrative Code, Â§175.19, relating to Subdivision Loan Processing and Â§175.23, relating to Notification of County Officials as published in the July 11, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 5500).
The adopted amendments change the duties of the County Committees and any reference thereto.
Section 161.218(c) of the Texas Natural Resources Code authorizes the Board to abolish the County Committees if it finds that they are no longer necessary.
The Board found that the review of the loan applications provided by the County Committees was no longer necessary.
Loan underwriting procedures and reviews presently in place are sufficient oversight.
However, the Board found that the County Committees could still provide valuable service to the Board and the programs.
The adopted amendment to Â§175.19 deleted a reference to the County Committees.
The adopted amendments to Â§175.23 changed the requirement of oversight by the County Committees to a request to assist the Board on various matters associated with the program.
No comments were received regarding the proposed amendments.
The amendments are adopted under the Natural Resources Code, Title 7, Chapter 161, Â§Â§161.001, 161.061, 161.063, 161.218, 161.222, 161.233, and 161.283.
These sections authorize the Board to adopt rules that it considers necessary and advisable for the Land Program.
The adopted amendments affects Â§161.217 and Â§161.218 of the Texas Natural Resources Code.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

LICENSING
The Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (PRS) adopts amendments to Â§Â§745.1, 745.21, 745.37, 745.243, 745.249, 745.341, 745.371, 745.373, 745.379, 745.383, 745.385, 745.433, 745.507, 745.619, 745.631, 745.683, 745.693, and 745.8411, in its Licensing chapter.
The amendments to Â§745.37 and Â§745.243 are adopted with changes to the proposed text published in the June 13, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 4532).
The amendments to Â§Â§745.1, 745.21, 745.249, 745.341, 745.371, 745.373, 745.379, 745.383, 745.385, 745.433, 745.507, 745.619, 745.631, 745.683, 745.693, and 745.8411 are adopted without changes to the proposed text and will not be republished.
The justification for the amendments is to revise Licensing's administrative rules to conform to applicable changes in the minimum standard rules that were made due to the consolidation of multiple sets of minimum standards into two sets--one for child-care homes and one for child-care centers, and to conform to new terms and definitions in Chapter 746, Minimum Standards for Child-Care Centers and Chapter 747, Minimum Standards for Child-Care Homes.
The amendments will function by ensuring that the language in these rules is consistent with child day-care minimum standard rules, facilitating understanding and compliance with the rules.
No comments were received regarding adoption of the amendments.
PRS is adopting Â§745.37(3)(C) with a minor change to provide clarity.
PRS is also deleting one sentence in Â§745.243(2)(C) because the sentence conflicts with Â§747.909.

Part 20.
TEXAS WORKFORCE COMMISSION
Chapter 815.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
Subchapter C. TAX PROVISIONS
The Texas Workforce Commission (Commission) adopts the repeal of Â§815.132 titled the Rate and Collection of the Additional Tax, without change, and new Â§815.132, Computation of Unemployment Obligation Assessment for Chapter 815 Unemployment Insurance, with changes to the proposed text as published in the July 18, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 5647).
The purpose of the rule is to set forth the provisions applicable to the computation of the unemployment obligation assessment provisions added to the Texas Labor Code.
The rule is authorized under Subchapter F, Issuance of Financial Obligations for Unemployment Compensation Fund (compensation fund), Texas Labor Code Chapter 203, as added by Article 6 of Senate Bill 280, 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003.
The Legislature has made the following findings.
It is an essential governmental function to maintain funds in an amount sufficient to pay unemployment benefits when due.
At the time of the enactment of Article 6 of Senate Bill 280, 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003 borrowing from the federal government was the only option available to obtain sufficient funds to pay benefits when the compensation fund is depleted.
The Legislature also determined that alternative methods of replenishing the compensation fund may reduce the costs of providing unemployment benefits and employers' cost of doing business in the state; and that funds representing revenues received from the unemployment obligation assessment authorized under Article 6 of Senate Bill 280, 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003 and any income from the investment of those funds are not state property.
The purpose of Article 6 of Senate Bill 280, 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003 (SB280) is to provide appropriate methods through which the state may continue the unemployment compensation program at the lowest possible cost to the state and employers in the state.
Insolvency of the compensation fund has traditionally been addressed by borrowing from the Federal trust fund using a line of credit with the U.S. Department of the Treasurer.
The expense associated with this type of borrowing may be more costly than with various commercial borrowing options.
SB280 provides the agency with options for borrowing funds during periods of compensation fund insolvency.
The borrowing process provides that the Agency must collect the unemployment obligation assessment to pay for the advanced interest and bond obligations when due.
To facilitate this process, new rule Â§815.132 sets out the formulas for determining the unemployment obligation assessment rate.
Texas Labor Code Â§203.105, V.T.C.A. provides that the Commission shall collect an unemployment obligation assessment, also referred to as assessment, from each employer eligible for an experience tax rate.
An assessment rate will be calculated if, after January 1 of a year, an interest payment on an advance from the federal trust fund will be due and the estimated amount necessary to make the interest payment is not available in the obligation trust fund or is not otherwise available.
In addition, an assessment will be collected if bond obligations are due and the amount necessary to pay in full those obligations, including bond administrative expenses, is not available in the obligation trust fund or is not otherwise available.
When the Commission determines that an assessment must be collected after January 1 of a year, the Commission will compute the assessment rate using the formulas set out in the rule before November 20th of the year prior to the year of the assessment.
This rate will be published in the Texas Register .
These assessments will be collected quarterly in the same manner as provided in Â§815.109 of this chapter (relating to Payment of Contributions and Reimbursements).
The formulas in the rule will insure that the Commission will collect adequate revenue to satisfy bond obligations and advance interest payments when due.
The Commission received no public comments on the rules; however, two technical changes are made for clarification.
At Â§815.132(e) the language is changed to clarify that the sum of the employer's general tax rate refers to the employer's prior year general tax rate.
Relating to Â§815.132(e)(1)(A) the word "by" is removed because it is unnecessary.
40 TAC Â§815.132
The repeal is authorized under Texas Labor Code Â§203.105 and Â§301.061, which provide the Texas Workforce Commission with the authority to adopt, amend, or repeal such rules as it deems necessary for the effective administration of Agency services and activities.
The repeal affects Texas Labor Code, Title 4.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

The new rule is adopted under Texas Labor Code Â§203.105 and Â§301.061, which provide the Texas Workforce Commission with the authority to adopt, amend, or repeal such rules as it deems necessary for the effective administration of Agency services and activities.
The adoption of the new rule affects Texas Labor Code, Title 4.
Â§815.132.Computation of Unemployment Obligation Assessment.
(a) Texas Labor Code Â§203.105, V.T.C.A. provides that the Commission shall collect an unemployment obligation assessment, also referred to as an assessment, from each employer eligible for an experience tax rate if, after January 1 of a year, an interest payment on an advance from the federal trust fund will be due and the estimated amount necessary to make the interest payment is not available in the obligation trust fund or available otherwise; or bond obligations are due and the amount necessary to pay in full those obligations, including bond administrative expenses, is not available in the obligation trust fund or available otherwise.
(b) When the Commission determines that an assessment as referred to in the paragraph above will be due after January 1 of a year, the Commission shall compute the assessment rate using the formulas set out below in this section, before November 20th of the year prior to the year of the assessment.
This rate shall be published in the Texas Register .
(c) The calculation for the unemployment obligation assessment rate is the sum of subsection (d) and (e) of this section.
(d) The rate for the portion of the assessment that is to be used to pay an interest payment on federal loans shall not exceed two tenths of one percent.
The rate shall be calculated by dividing two hundred percent (200%) of the additional amount estimated to be needed to pay interest due, as determined by the Agency, by the estimated total taxable wages for the 1st and 2nd quarters of the year in which the interest is due, and rounded up to the next hundredth.
(e) The rate for the portion of the assessment that is to be used to pay a bond obligation is a percentage of the product of the unemployment obligation assessment ratio and the sum of the employer's prior year general tax rate, the replenishment tax rate and the deficit tax rate.
The percentage, to be determined by Commission resolution, shall not exceed 200%.
(1) The Unemployment Obligation Assessment Ratio is computed by:
(A) dividing the numerator computed under paragraph (2) of this subsection by the denominator described in paragraph (3) of this subsection; and
(B) rounding that result up to the next hundredth.
(2) The numerator is computed by adding the total principal, interest and administrative expenses on all outstanding bonds determined to be due during the next year.
However, if the Commission determines that there will be excess funds available in the obligation trust fund that are not anticipated to be expended for the purposes set out in Texas Labor Code, Â§203.258 (2)-(4), the numerator may be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(3) The denominator is the amount of contributions due under the general tax rate and the replenishment tax rate for the four calendar quarters ending the preceding June 30 from employers entitled to an experience rate on the tax rate computation date.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.
