TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ LONG-TERM INTROGRESSION OF CROP GENES INTO WILD SUNFLOWER POPULATIONS Author(s): LINDER C R TAHA I SEILER GERALD J SNOW A A RIESEBERG L H Interpretive Summary:
Sunflower is one of the few crop species that is native to North America.
This affords the opportunity for exchange of genes between the cultivated crop and its wild ancestors.
Hybrids between cultivated and wild sunflower are frequently reported suggesting that transgenes in cultivated sunflower could introgress into wild sunflower populations.
This study looks at gene flow from cultivated sunflowers and their genetic structure and persistence up to 40 years in wild sunflower populations.
Persistent, long term gene flow in sunflower can lead to high levels of crop-wild introgression.
The selected molecular markers from the cultivated sunflower were found in nearly all plants of the wild populations demonstrating a high rate of introgression between cultivated and wild sunflowers and that pure wild plants in these populations have been replaced by plants of hybrid ancestry.
These results clearly demonstrate the high probability that transgenes will flow into wild sunflower populations.
However, the escape and spread of transgenes in sunflower and other crops will largely depend on fitness consequences and linkage relationships of individual transgenes in a wild-type genetic background rather than overall hybrid fitness.
