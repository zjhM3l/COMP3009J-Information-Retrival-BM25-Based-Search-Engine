TEXAS WORKS
The Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) adopts the repeal of Â§Â§3.601-3.604 and adopts new Â§Â§3.601-3.603, without changes to the proposed text published in the May 23, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 4079).
Justification for new Â§3.602 is to comply with a clarification issued by the United States (U.S.) Department of Justice concerning alien eligibility for TANF.
The clarification states that aliens are eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) if they entered the U.S. prior to August 22, 1996, and remained continuously present in the U.S. until becoming qualified aliens.
This eligibility applies regardless of whether these individuals entered the U.S. legally or possessed qualified status at the time of entry.
A qualified alien is defined as a refugee, asylee, Cuban/Haitian entrant, battered alien, parolee, conditional entrant, legal permanent resident, or alien whose deportation has been withdrawn.
In addition, the repeals and new sections were undertaken as part of a DHS project to rewrite agency rules in question- and-answer format to make them easier for contractors and the public to use and understand.
DHS received no comments regarding adoption of the repeals and new sections.

Justification for new Â§3.604 is to comply with 8 United States Code 1612(a), which was amended by the 2002 Farm Bill to partially restore Food Stamp Program eligibility to qualified aliens in three different phases.
The first phase of this restoration, effective October 1, 2002, restored eligibility to qualified aliens receiving disability benefits regardless of the date they entered the United States (U.S).
The second phase, effective April 1, 2003, restored eligibility to applicants possessing qualified alien status for five years.
The third phase, effective October 1, 2003, restores eligibility to qualified aliens under the age of 18, regardless of the date of entry into the U.S. Section 3.604 ensures that DHS complies with federal law.
In addition, the new sections were undertaken as part of a DHS project to rewrite agency rules in question-and- answer format to make them easier for contractors and the public to use and understand.
