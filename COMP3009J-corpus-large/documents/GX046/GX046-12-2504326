Both of them were kurds coming from Turkey, one of them (A) identified herself as a real kurd fighting for a free Kurdistan, the other one (B) had in a way been so assimilated in Turkey that the refused even to call herself a kurd, was maybe ashamed of it.
"A" got very angry with "B" and told her that she must not refuse her origin and identity.
To get stop of the struggle two of our teachers (i only Swedish-speaking and the other teacher Swedish/Turkish/Kurdish-speaking) sat down talking with them and tried to make them accept each other and their different ways of handle their identity...
As they are adults one can not handle such conflicts as if they were children, but sometimes it is difficult just to ignore them without doing anything...
In Sweden we have many kurds, when I ask from where they came (to train Swedish), some kurds from for example the turkish part of Kurdistan answer Turkey, others answer Kurdistan.
I let them choose their own identity without saying what is wright or wrong...
How is your view of the teachers role in such situations?
(I suppose you know about the kurdish conflict, kurds live as minorities in Turkey, Syria, Libanon, Irak and Iran, but nowadays they have no own country).
