7 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
a Commuter Transit Subsidy Benefits:
(1)
Employees in the NCR who commute using qualified transit facilities or commuter highway vehicles will receive up to $65 per month (or the subsequent statutory limit), or their actual commuting cost whichever is less, in the form of a transit voucher, i.e., Metrochek supplied by the agency.
Outside of the NCR, employees who commute using qualified transit facilities or commuter highway vehicles will receive $30 per month, or their actual commuting cost whichever is less, in the form of a transit voucher supplied by the agency.
Agencies may elect to provide a greater subsidy amount for qualified expenses (up to $65 per month or the subsequent statutory limit).
Outside of the NCR, where a voucher or similar item is not readily available for direct distribution and exchange, qualified employees will receive cash reimbursements at the end of the month.
This includes locations where the lowest denomination monthly transit voucher costs more than the normal amount of monthly benefits provided to employees.
(4) Commuter transit subsidy benefits become effective on the date of the employee's signed application.
However, if the application is received after the 15th in any month, actual distribution of the faremedia will not be until the next month's distribution.
b Eligibility:
(1) Participants must be USDA employees (i.e., full-time, part-time, temporaries, stay-in-school, etc.) who use qualified transit facilities or commuter highway vehicles for at least 50 percent of their regular monthly commuting trips, and who do not receive a free Federal Parking Benefit except as noted in b(2).
(2) Drivers, alternate drivers, and passengers of qualified vanpools receiving a free Federal parking benefit are eligible for transit subsidy benefits.
c Recordkeeping and Reporting:
(1) Mission areas/agencies/staff offices must maintain records to ensure recording of and accounting for expenditures (i.e., transit passes or vouchers ordered, dispensed, accounted for, etc.) to ensure protection against loss and possible abuse.
Recordkeeping for those mission areas/agencies/staff offices participating in a Department-wide service agreement will be provided by the service provider to the Director of SHEWD; and,
(2) Mission areas/agencies/staff offices not participating in a Department-wide service agreement must submit an annual report to the Director, OHRM, for the period October 1 through September 30.

However volunteers are not permitted to participate, nor are temporary employees who are assigned from private temporary services.
2.How do I apply for the transit benefit? Complete Form AD 1147.
Prior to completing this form you must make sure you meet the eligibility requirements.
3.What are the eligibility requirements for transit subsidy?
Participants must be USDA employees who use qualified transit facilities (subway, train, bus, ferry, or etc.) or commuter highway vehicles (vanpool) for at least 50 percent of their regular monthly commuting trips, and who do not receive a free Federal parking benefit (vanpools are exempted from the free Federal parking).
4.

Public law 105-178, Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, dated June 9, 1998.
Executive order 13150 dated April 21, 2000.
26 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1, Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits.
5.
Who administers the transit subsidy program?
The Department of Transportation (DOT).
6.
Who should I contact when I have a question about the transit subsidy program?
Your mission area/agency/staff office transit coordinator.
The list of coordinators can be obtained on this website: http://www.usda.gov/da/shmd/transitcoord.html
7.
Do I receive the monthly maximum of $100.00 a month even though my actual monthly commute amount remains $60.00?
No, the law states you will receive the maximum amount of $100.00 or the actual commute cost, whichever is less.
So, your amount would remain $60.00 per month.
For example: Mary Smith's monthly commuting cost is $110 (so Mary would receive the maximum benefit of $100 per month).
Mary would receive $300 quarterly.
Bob Dulles' monthly commuting cost is $50.
Bob would receive $150 quarterly.
8.
When does the transit subsidy become effective?
Commuter transit subsidy benefits become effective on the date of the employee's signed application.
However, in the National Capital Region (NCR) if the application is received by DOT after the 15th in any month, actual distribution of the fare media will not be until the next month's distribution.
Field applications received by DOT after the 5th of any month will not receive benefits until the following month.
9.
Are carpoolers eligible to receive transit benefits?
No
10.
Can employees apply for this program at any time?
Yes, the program is open continuously for new, change, or cancelled applications.
11.
What is fare media?
Fare media is the type of ticket or pass you will receive to be used for monthly transit expenses.
12.
When computing my monthly cost how many working days should I use and can I include other expenses?
You should use the exact number of days you actually use mass public transportation or commuter highway vehicle (vanpool).
Do NOT include parking fees, gasoline costs, mileage, or etc. on the AD-1147.
13.
How, when, and where will fare media be distributed to employees?
In the NCR fare media is distributed quarterly and the distribution schedule is available on the following website: http://www.usda.gov/oo/subsidyschedule.htm.
Distribution can occur monthly or quarterly based on arrangements made with local mass transit companies and it is done by the procedures set by the local coordinator.
14.
When do I have to fill out a new form?
If you have a change of name, address, or monthly commuting cost you should fill out a new form.
If you are leaving the Agency, you should fill out the form and check the space for cancellation.
You should return any Metrocheks or Vouchers you have in your possession with your application.
Attach them to the form with a paperclip, not a staple, and submit them to the transit coordinator.
It is best if they are returned in person and not through the mail system.
If you are new to the Agency, but have been in a Federal transit subsidy program before coming here, you must still fill out a new transit application, and check the space for new employee.
15.In the NCR, if I am not at work during the quarterly distribution and I miss it, what can I do about it?
After the quarterly distribution has taken place, you can go to the DOT on the Plaza level and pick up your subsidy at their TASC office.
Take the subway to L'Enfant Plaza.
Exit at the 7th 
Go up the escalator to the Plaza Level.
Veer slightly to the right and straight ahead, and go through the glass doors that say Southwest Entrance.
The guard will direct you to the TASC office on the entry level.
Show the clerk your USDA badge and provide the last 4 digits of your social security number and you will receive the subsidy.
Additionally, the Department holds monthly make-up sessions in the rear of the South Building cafeteria.
16.
Can another individual pick-up my fare media for me?
No, you must pick-up your own fare media.
17.
Do I need to present any identification to pick-up my fare media?
Yes, you need either your Government ID or driver's license.
18.
Can I be reimbursed for prior months when I am unable to pick-up my fare media during a particular month?
No.
If you miss a month, you may only receive fare media for any remaining months in the quarterly distribution.
For example, if the quarterly distribution is for March-April-May and you miss the March distribution dates, you can only receive fare media for April-May during the make-up distribution dates.
19.
What can I do if I am disabled and have some difficulty picking up my subsidy?
USDA has made arrangements with the TARGET Center on the first floor South Building to have your subsidy picked up and distributed directly to you.
You just need to contact them at 202-720-0600, identify that you are a disabled user, and follow through on their instructions for obtaining the quarterly subsidy.
20.
Am I permitted to transfer my subsidy to other family members, such as my husband or children?
No, transfer of the transit subsidy benefit is not permitted to anyone, whether family member, co-workers, or others.
Along the same lines, you may not sell the transit benefit to another person.
If you cannot use the subsidy, you should return it to your transit coordinator.
If you need to withdraw from the program, you should fill out a form and note that you are canceling.
You can always sign up for the program again.
21.
I am a disabled employee who rides Metro Access.
I need tokens to ride Metro Access; can I get tokens from DOT?
No, actually you obtain your Metrocheks and then take them downtown to Metro Center and get the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) cashier to exchange the Metrocheks for tokens.
You can then use the tokens to pay Metro Access.
22.
When I leave the Agency what do I do about my transit benefit?
You must cancel your transit application through your transit coordinator and they will calculate what you need to return to the agency in unused fare media and it should be turned in at that time.
23.What if I don't have enough fare media to cover what I owe the government in fare media?
You will need to write a check to the Department of Agriculture for the balance of your fare media.
24.
What if I get a job in another agency within the Department can I keep my unused transit subsidy?
No, you must cancel your transit application through your program coordinator and they will calculate what you need to return to the agency in unused fare media and it should be turned in at that time.
When you get to your new agency the Human Resources staff will be able to get you in contact with their transit coordinator to sign up in your new Agency.
25.How should I return unused fare media?
In person is the best option for returning fare media.
If this is not practical use a private shipping company such as Federal Express, of United Parcel Service so you will have a receipt and be able to track the delivery of your package.
Regular mail is irradiated and Metro will not accept irradiated cards, so if you use the regular mail to return fare cards your Agency may hold you financially liable for your returned cards.
Remember that until your coordinator receives your fare media you are financially responsible.
26.
Will I be held financially responsible for returned fare media that is damaged and cannot be returned to the DOT for a refund to the agency?
This is up to the individual Agency and will depend on the circumstances that caused the damage to the fare media.
27.
Can I use my fare media to travel between the USDA buildings during the day?
No, fare media is to be used for traveling from your residence to your place of employment and return.
28.
What do I do with my fare media if I transfer within the same Agency but go to the field from the NCR or vice versa?
If you use a form of mass transit at your new location, you must change your transit application through your transit coordinator and they will calculate what you need to return to the agency in unused fare media and it should be turned in with the application.
You must return fare media because it is not interchangeable between systems.
If you are not going to use mass transit at your new location, then you must cancel your application through your program coordinator and they will calculate what you need to return to the agency in unused fare media.
29.
Can I use my fare media on travel from airport to hotel and vice versa?
No.
30.
Are fare media replaced if lost or stolen?
No, unless the agency authorizes to pay a second time for the same fare media.
31.Can I put all my fare media I receive for the quarter on my Smart Card, to my vanpool driver, or to VRE at one time?
No, you may only use the fare media for one month at a time.
The application you signed when you entered the program stated that: "I certify that in any given month, I will not use the Government provided transit benefit in excess of the statutory limit."
By using your fare media at one time you are violating the agreement you signed when you applied for the program.
32.In the NCR standing in line to receive fare media is cumbersome.
Can disbursement be done in a less time consuming way?
No, not at this time.
DOT and USDA have set the procedure for distribution of fare media.
They have worked together to create more distribution points and expand times to reduce wait times and this seems to be working.
33.
My spouse drops me at work but I take mass transit home am I eligible to receive a benefit?
Yes, as long as you use a form of mass transit for 50% of your regular commute between work and your residence.
34.
If a person only uses mass transit during bad weather or occasionally are they eligible for the program?
No, unless the use of mass transit makes up 50% of their commute regularly they are not eligible.
35.
What if I have a change in the way I commute or the cost, what do I need to do if anything?
It is your responsibility to submit an updated application to your program coordinator as soon as possible.
36.
What should I do if I commute less days in a month than I stated on the form for reasons of vacation, extended sickness, etc.?
You will reduce your next quarterly pick-up amount by the amount you have left.
You will be required to inform the DOT agent that you should receive less and tell them the amount.
It requires you being honest.
37.
Some areas receive a cash reimbursement, who determines who gets cash and who gets fare media?
DOT has entered into agreements with mass transit companies all over the country and anywhere that fare media is not available we are authorized to pay a cash reimbursement to eligible employees.
DOT determines who will get cash and who will get fare media.
38.
Can fare media be provided more than 3 months in advance?
No, the IRS code only authorizes a 3-month advance of fare media.
39.
How do I replace a demagnetized metrochek?
You can ask a metro station attendant for an envelope to mail the tickets back to Metro for replacements; or, you can take them to Metro Center Sales Office.
40.
Will DOT replace a demagnetized metrochek for USDA employees?
No, USDA does not have an agreement with DOT to replace demagnetized metrocheks.
There would be an additional charge to the organization to replace them.
41.
Where can I exchange Metrocheks for the Marc train or other fare media?
Go to the website http://www.wmata.com/and across the top of the screen select FARE; then click on Metrocheks ; and then click on Metrochek exchange sites ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________

TO: Deputy Administrators for Management
FROM: Donna D. Beecher/signed by Joseph Colantuoni Director
SUBJECT: Pre-Tax Parking
The Office of General Counsel has provided guidance that clarifies the authority and eligibility for employees to exclude certain parking expenses from their taxable income (pre-tax parking).
This benefit is provided for by Executive Order 13150, Code of Federal Regulations 1.132.9, and 5 United States Code 7905.
Based on the above, any mission area/agency/staff office may authorize pre-tax parking for their eligible employees.
Where there is bargaining unit representation, mission areas/agencies/staff offices must fulfill any labor/management obligations.
For simplicity, we are providing this guidance in the attached questions and answer format.
If you have any questions please contact Marge Adams at (202) 720-3286 or e-mail: marjoriea.adams@usda.gov.
Attachment ______________________________________________________________________
PRE-TAX PARKING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ______________________________________________________________________
Q: Which employees are eligible for pre-tax parking?
A: Employees who park at eligible parking locations and who also meet any of the additional qualifying criteria as presented here.
Q: What are eligible parking locations?
A: A metro-parking lot, commercial lot, privately owned parking lot, parking garage, parking meter, or employer provided parking.
Q:
What are the additional qualifying criteria? A: An employee must either take mass transportation, or ride in a vanpool, or in a carpool of two or more persons from the parking location to work.
Q: Can an employee driving a vanpool or carpool and parking in an eligible location be authorized pre-tax parking? A: Yes.
Example: The primary driver of a vanpool or carpool that parks in a commercial lot (or other eligible parking location), and whose members then walk to work is eligible for pre-tax parking.
Q: Can a single occupant of a vehicle who drives to work, parks at an eligible parking location, and does NOT take mass transportation, and does NOT ride in a vanpool or carpool from that location be authorized pre-tax parking?
A: No.
The intent of the program is to encourage employees to use mass transportation, a vanpool, or carpool and to discourage the use of single occupancy vehicles to travel to work.
Q: How do employees apply for pre-tax parking?
A: Eligible employees should submit an application to their designated transit subsidy coordinator.
The transit subsidy coordinator will submit the approved application to the servicing personnel office for inputting into the National Finance Center personnel/payroll system.
Q: Is a written policy required to implement pre-tax parking?
A: No.
Q: Is proof of the cost of parking required?
A: Yes.
It may be in the form of a parking lot receipt or, if no receipt is provided, the application itself will suffice.
Q: Is the National Finance Center able to process pre-tax parking applications?
A: Yes.
NFC instructions were previously provided to operating personnel offices on August 31, 1999, and remain in effective.
The entry is done through the Allowance Screen of PRES (Payroll/Personnel Remote Entry System).
Q: What document is used to report the amount of an employees pre-tax parking to the Internal Revenue Service?
A: The W-2 Form.
Q: How is the pre-tax parking benefit computed in the personnel/payroll system?
A: The answer is based on an example of a GS-15, Step 5 in the 30% Tax Bracket and claiming $180.00 a month for pre-tax parking.
You would take $180 x 12 (months) divided by 26 pay periods.
This would equate to $83.07.
The GS-15, Step 5 gross salary is $3,881.60 (depending on locality).
Subtract the $83.07 from the $3,881.60 ($3,798.53).
Taxes are then calculated on the $3,798.53, if this was the only allowance the employee had.
