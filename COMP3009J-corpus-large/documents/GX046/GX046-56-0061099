During the Civil War, the officers from the opposing sides sometimes chose different map features to name battles.
In the case of Manassas, Federals named the two battles after the nearby Bull Run, while Confederates used Manassas Junction, the rail center that eventually developed into the town of Manassas, for the name.

George Carr Round contributed an article to the Confederate Veteran on Manassas park efforts in 1917, which may have influenced Ewing's pursuit of the Confederate park in 1920.

The sources do not indicate why the federal government chose "Bull Run" as the name for the recreational demonstration area, but the Northern designation probably seemed more appropriate to the New Yorker Roosevelt and his administration.
My discussion of the recreation demonstration area depends on a limited array of planning documents and some correspondence.
Unfortunately, the RG 96 field office files, which include case files for land acquisition and the records for resettlement projects for Prince William County, have been destroyed.
These documents were under the custodianship of the National Archives and were transferred to the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives in Philadelphia.

Spalding supported Manassas National Battlefield Park, while Hanson expressed a preference for Bull Run.

Evidence that the Park Service expected a largely white audience at Manassas is found in discussions about segregated toilet facilities.
One Park Service memorandum noted that "colored toilets" could be incorporated in the service building since they would be "little used."
Other memoranda discussed the possibility of building separate facilities for Park Service employees and for white visitors in the museum building, and a third possibility included separate toilets for whites and blacks, without special facilities for park employees.
The fact that only one set of facilities was built in the administration-museum building, without mention of complementary facilities for African Americans in another location, implies that the Park Service largely expected white visitors.

Although the term "visitor center" may have been used infrequently earlier in the Park Service, Mission 66 formalized its use.
Correspondence from the Manassas National Battlefield Park uses the phrase "museum-administration building" until the Mission 66 period, at which points it adopts the newer term.

In his oral history, Wilshin relates that the idea for the reenactment may have surfaced in late 1959.
In the prospectus for First Manassas Incorporated, the group formed to coordinate and finance the reenactment, it is noted that the "germ of the idea" came during a September 1958 conference at the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
The 1958 annual report does not mention this meeting.
The fact that Wilshin produced a detailed advance plan for the reenactment, including cost estimates, in February 1960 suggests that the idea had been developing for longer than a few months.

In 1960, after Naisawald resigned as park historian and Mrs. Frances Dogan, one of the last residents of the Dogan House, retired as tour leader, Wilshin obtained permission to convert the tour leader position into another park historian job.
In this way, Wilshin obtained two park historians.
Wilshin also had a seasonal ranger who provided interpretive help during spring and summer.

Naisawald lived in the Stone House when he first came to the park.
The building had been renovated to serve as a living quarters when it first transferred to the Park Service, but its heating had deteriorated by the time Naisawald moved in.
See Naisawald, interview, 2.
The Stone House did not open when Wilshin planned.
The 1971 interpretive prospectus suggests that Berry, Wilshin's successor, was in the process of setting up the field hospital exhibit in the early 1970s.
Richard Hoffman, superintendent of Manassas during the mid-1970s, remembered later that he oversaw the final installation of the field hospital exhibit at Stone House, replacing an antebellum plantation display that had been on exhibit during Berry's superintendency.
I have not found supporting documentation regarding the antebellum plantation display.

An example of the point-by-point rebuttal format used by the Friends of the Park to argue against the national cemetery can be seen in Anne Snyder to Robert Bridges, 9 March 1969, A. Snyder Files, MNBP.
Wilshin more than likely provided some of this information; he was working with Snyder's group in the strategy meetings.
An indication of Wilshin's devotion to the battlefield park and his opposition to the national cemetery proposal is a poem he wrote at this time: "This Manassas, this hallowed battleground, fear ye ghostly legions of Bull Run who here 200,000 strong, twice fought with such desperate gallantry for liberty and principle.
We pledge you our honor, we shall not falter, we shall not fail, to keep faith in our tryst with the past.
We shall not be diverted by the false cry of dual use, nor the callous claim of economic expediency.
To the thousands of you whose blood stains these fields--to the hundreds of you who yet silently sleep in unmarked graves--we solemnly swear that time will not dim the luster of your deathless deeds, nor will perverted interest impair your heroic images.
Sleep on undisturbed, a grateful nation will find other means to provide your gallant sons honored burial" (Wilshin, interview, 76-77).

Barry Mackintosh clarified for me that the orientation program took eleven weeks and included a history of the Park Service as well as practical skill building in fighting forest fires, rappelling cliff faces, and other ranger activities.
Interpretive skill building was also included.
Berry's two different administrative titles at Manassas did not reflect a change in duties.
The National Park Service had established a group park arrangement with two satellite parks--Manassas and the George Washington Birthplace National Monument--coming under tIme general supervision of the superintendent at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park.
During his four years at Manassas, Berry set the overall policy and kept the general superintendent informed, a relationship similar to that between park superintendents and the regional director.
