They were wearing CAP blue shirts-USAF-
Very snazzy! Anyone know what happened to that 
CAP *does* have a military music Summer event...
Alice/All -
The CAP Pipe Band was from the Brockton Cadet Sqd in Massachusetts.
They wore the uniform you mentioned, and when they need to wear a jacket, they wore the old "Ike" jackets.
The base drummer was the then Mass Wing Commander, Col Ed Raymond, and I believe the Pipe major was one of his sons.
Sad to say, but the band does not exsist any more.
The Pipe Band did play at a Presidential Inaguaration one year, although I do not remember who the President was.
The USAF Reserve has a Pipe Band, based out of Dobbins AFB I believe.
They wear the USAF Reserve tartan, which was approved by the Tartan Society in Scotland.
This band has performed all over the world.
The following is the link to thier site:
