AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO Respondent
and
U.S. AIR FORCE, AIR FORCE LOGISTICS COMMAND, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO Charging Party
Case No. 5-CO-4
DECISION AND ORDER
THIS MATTER IS BEFORE THE AUTHORITY PURSUANT TO THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR'S ORDER TRANSFERRING CASE TO THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 2429.1(A) (5 CFR 2429.1(A)) OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS.
UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THE SUBJECT CASE, INCLUDING THE PARTIES' STIPULATION OF FACTS, ACCOMPANYING EXHIBITS AND BRIEFS SUBMITTED BY THE RESPONDENT, THE CHARGING PARTY AND THE GENERAL COUNSEL, THE AUTHORITY FINDS: DURING THE COURSE OF CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS, THE ACTIVITY (CHARGING PARTY) ADVANCED SEVERAL PROPOSALS CONCERNING THE FOLLOWING MATTERS: POLICY CHANGES DURING THE TERM OF THE PARTIES' AGREEMENT, UNION REPRESENTATION, AND THE PARTIES' NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
THE UNION (RESPONDENT) REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE OVER PORTIONS OF THESE PROPOSALS ON THE BASIS THAT THEY PERTAINED TO INTERNAL UNION AFFAIRS AND WERE THEREFORE OUTSIDE THE MANDATORY SCOPE OF BARGAINING.
THE CHARGING PARTY THEREUPON FILED AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE BASED UPON THE REFUSAL TO BARGAIN, AND THE GENERAL COUNSEL SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(B)(5) AND (1) OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (THE STATUTE) BASED UPON THE RESPONDENT'S CONCEDED REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE.
/1/
AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER, THE AUTHORITY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE CHARGING PARTY'S ASSERTION THAT, AS THE RESPONDENT FAILED TO ANSWER THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S COMPLAINT, SUCH FAILURE, PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.13(B) OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS (5 CFR 2423.13(B)), SHOULD BE DEEMED AN ADMISSION OF THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE COMPLAINT AND SHOULD RESULT IN THE FINDING OF A VIOLATION.
/2/ THE AUTHORITY NOTES THAT SUCH ASSERTION WAS RAISED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE CHARGING PARTY IN ITS BRIEF TO THE AUTHORITY, FILED AFTER THE PARTIES HAD ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF FACT APPROVED BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, IN WHICH STIPULATION THE RESPONDENT DID IN FACT PLEAD TO THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED IN THE COMPLAINT.
MOREOVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO SHOWING THAT THE RESPONDENT'S FAILURE TO ANSWER THE COMPLAINT IN ANY MANNER PREJUDICED THE CHARGING PARTY OR THE GENERAL COUNSEL INASMUCH AS BOTH PARTIES NOT ONLY ENTERED INTO THE STIPULATION BUT WERE AWARE OF THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR SUBMISSIONS TO THE AUTHORITY.
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESPONDENT'S FAILURE TO ANSWER THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, REQUIRE THE AUTHORITY TO FIND A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE.
THE UNDISPUTED FACTS, AS STIPULATED BY THE PARTIES, ARE AS FOLLOWS: ON JANUARY 13, 1978, THE RESPONDENT WAS CERTIFIED AS THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CONSOLIDATED UNIT OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 EMPLOYEES LOCATED AT A NUMBER OF THE ACTIVITY'S FACILITIES.
IN FEBRUARY 1979, DURING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A MASTER AGREEMENT COVERING THE EMPLOYEES IN THE FOREGOING CONSOLIDATED UNIT, THE ACTIVITY TO BE OUTSIDE ITS DUTY TO BARGAIN AND CONCERNING WHICH IT REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE.
THESE PROPOSALS, WHICH ARE SET FORTH IN AN APPENDIX TO THIS DECISION (WITH THE DISPUTED PORTIONS UNDERSCORED), PERTAIN TO "POLICY CHANGES DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT," "UNION REPRESENTATION," AND "GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE."
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
THE RECORD REVEALS THAT THE PROPOSALS IN ESSENCE PRESCRIBE THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL AND SEGMENT FROM WHICH THE RESPONDENT MUST DESIGNATE ITS REPRESENTATIVES WHEN DEALING WITH AGENCY MANAGEMENT ON THE ABOVE-NOTED MATTERS.
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH REGARD TO THE APPOINTMENT OF UNION STEWARDS PURSUANT TO THE ACTIVITY'S PROPOSAL CONCERNING "UNION REPRESENTATION," THE UNION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SELECT EACH SUCH STEWARD ONLY FROM AMONG THE EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL SEGMENT THE STEWARD WOULD REPRESENT.
AND, WHEN DEALING WITH AGENCY MANAGEMENT CONCERNING POLICY CHANGES DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, THE DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE FOR DEALING WITH MANAGEMENT ON MATTERS BELOW THE ACTIVITY'S DIVISION LEVEL WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE DISTRICT STEWARD, PURSUANT TO THE ACTIVITY'S PROPOSAL, WHILE THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE DESIGNATED TO DEAL WITH MANAGEMENT ON DIVISION AND DIRECTORATE LEVEL MATTERS WOULD BE THE DIVISION AND DIRECTORATE STEWARDS, RESPECTIVELY.
MOREOVER, UNDER THE ACTIVITY'S PROPOSAL, MATTERS HAVING ACTIVITY-WIDE IMPACT COULD BE NEGOTIATED ONLY BY THE RESPONDENT'S PRESIDENT.
SIMILARLY, THE PROPOSAL PERTAINING TO THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE WOULD SPECIFY THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL OF THE STEWARD INVOLVED AT THE SECOND STEP OF THE GRIEVANCE PROCEEDING.
IN OUR VIEW, IT IS WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF BOTH AGENCY MANAGEMENT AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HOLDING EXCLUSIVE RECOGNITION TO DESIGNATE THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES WHEN FULFILLING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE STATUTE.
SEE, GENERALLY, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, LOCAL 1451 AND NAVAL TRAINING CENTER, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, 3 FLRA NO. 14(1980), WHEREIN THE AUTHORITY, IN FINDING THAT A UNION PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE ACTIVITY TO DESIGNATE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF NEGOTIATIONS WAS OUTSIDE THE ACTIVITY'S DUTY TO BARGAIN UNDER THE STATUTE, FURTHER NOTED THAT, "(A)LBEIT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, A MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL THAT THE UNION DESIGNATE A PARTICULAR NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES TO NEGOTIATIONS LIKEWISE WOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE DUTY TO BARGAIN UNDER THE STATUTE."
THE PROPOSALS IN THE INSTANT CASE, AS NOTED ABOVE, WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE THE RESPONDENT TO DESIGNATE ITS REPRESENTATIVES FROM PRESCRIBED ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS AND SEGMENTS WHEN DEALING WITH AGENCY MANAGEMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONAL FUNCTIONS.
AS SUCH, THE PROPOSALS WOULD INFRINGE UPON THE RESPONDENT'S PREROGATIVE TO DESIGNATE ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES FOR SUCH PURPOSES.
THE PROPOSALS, THEREFORE, ARE OUTSIDE THE REQUIRED SCOPE OF BARGAINING AND THE RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO BARGAIN CANNOT BE HELD TO CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE.
THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT A UNION MAY NOT, IF IT SO ELECTS, BARGAIN OVER SUCH MATTERS.
INDEED, THERE IS MERIT TO FORMALIZING THE BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO STABILITY AT THE WORKPLACE AND, IN FACT, MANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IN THE FEDERAL SECTOR PROVIDE FOR A FORMALIZED BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP.
HOWEVER, IN THIS CASE, THE RESPONDENT ELECTED NOT TO BARGAIN OVER THE PROPOSALS, WHICH ARE PERMISSIVE IN NATURE AND THEREFORE OUTSIDE THE REQUIRED SCOPE OF BARGAINING.
ACCORDINGLY, ITS CONDUCT IN THIS REGARD CANNOT BE HELD TO CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE, AND THE COMPLAINT ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(B)(5) AND (1) OF THE STATUTE MUST BE DISMISSED.
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE COMPLAINT IN CASE NO. 5-CO-4 BE, AND IT HEREBY IS, DISMISSED.

SUCH INFORMAL GRIEVANCES MAY BE PRESENTED ORALLY OR IN WRITING.
IF THE GRIEVANCE IS PRESENTED IN WRITING, THE STANDARD GRIEVANCE FORM (APPENDIX . . .
) WILL BE USED.
(1) AN EMPLOYEE DESIRING TO FILE AN INFORMAL GRIEVANCE MAY REQUEST THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS DISTRICT SHOP STEWARD IN PREPARING AND PRESENTING THE INFORMAL GRIEVANCE.
A GRIEVANT WILL INFORM HIS SUPERVISOR OF THE NATURE OF HIS GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DISTRICT SHOP STEWARD SO THAT ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE MADE TO INFORMALLY DISCUSS THE GRIEVANCE.

THE GRIEVANCE MUST BE SUBMITTED TO AND RECEIVED BY THE SERVICING ACTIVITY'S LABOR AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS DIVISION WITHIN 7 CALENDAR DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE STEP 2 DECISION.
(1) THE STANDARD GRIEVANCE FORM WITH ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DISCOVERED AT STEP 2, AND THE DECISIONS RENDERED AT STEPS 1 AND 2, WHERE APPLICABLE, WILL BE FILED AS PART OF THE CASE FILE.
NEW OR ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS OR ISSUES NOT CONSIDERED AT PRECEEDING STEPS OF THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE SHALL NOT BE RAISED.
(2) THE COMMANDER OF THE SUBORDINATE AFLC ACTIVITY OR HIS DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL REVIEW THE GRIEVANCE, AND, AT HIS DISCRETION, MAY SCHEDULE A MEETING WITH THE GRIEVANT AND HIS/HER DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE.
AT SUCH MEETING, THE GRIEVANT MAY PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HIS/HER GRIEVANCE.
THE GRIEVANT AND HIS/HER DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL BE GRANTED OFFICIAL TIME FOR SAID MEETING IF OTHERWISE IN A DUTY STATUS.
