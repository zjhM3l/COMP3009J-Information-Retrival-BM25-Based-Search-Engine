Case No. 9-CA-381
DECISION AND ORDER
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED HIS DECISION IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED PROCEEDING FINDING THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD ENGAGED IN THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT AND RECOMMENDING THAT IT CEASE AND DESIST THEREFROM AND TAKE CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
THEREAFTER, THE RESPONDENT FILED EXCEPTIONS TO THE JUDGE'S DECISION AND A BRIEF IN SUPPORT THEREOF, AND THE GENERAL COUNSEL FILED AN OPPOSITION.
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (THE STATUTE), THE AUTHORITY HAS REVIEWED THE RULINGS OF THE JUDGE MADE AT THE HEARING AND FINDS THAT NO PREJUDICIAL ERROR WAS COMMITTED.
THE RULINGS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED.
UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGE'S DECISION AND THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THIS CASE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ADOPTS THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS, /1/ CONCLUSIONS /2/ AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AS MODIFIED HEREIN.
THE AUTHORITY ADOPTS THE JUDGE'S CONCLUSION THAT THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1), (5) AND (8) OF THE STATUTE BY REFUSING TO FURNISH NECESSARY INFORMATION TO THE UNION AS REQUESTED UNDER SECTION 7114(B)(4) OF THE STATUTE.
THUS, AS FOUND BY THE JUDGE, THE UNION WAS ENTITLED TO SUCH DATA TO ENABLE IT TO PROPERLY REPRESENT A UNIT EMPLOYEE AT AN ORAL HEARING PRIOR TO MANAGEMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF A PROPOSED ADVERSE ACTION, WHICH HEARING IS PROVIDED FOR IN THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT.
/3/
IN HIS PROPOSED REMEDY, THE JUDGE RECOMMENDED THAT THE RESPONDENT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE UNION UPON REQUEST, AND TO HOLD ANOTHER ORAL HEARING AT WHICH THE UNION WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERSUADE THE RESPONDENT TO RECONSIDER THE ADVERSE ACTION PREVIOUSLY IMPOSED ON THE UNIT EMPLOYEE.
HOWEVER, THE AUTHORITY TAKES OFFICIAL NOTICE THAT THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD HAS ALREADY RESOLVED THE ADVERSE ACTION ISSUE AND DETERMINED THAT THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IMPOSED WAS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY LAW FOR THE VIOLATION FOUND TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE EMPLOYEE.
RICHARD P. RODRIGUEZ V. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, INITIAL DECISION NO. SF07528010416 (FEBRUARY 12, 1981).
/4/ UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, A RE-RUN OF THE PRE-DECISIONAL ORAL HEARING TO ENABLE THE RESPONDENT TO RECONSIDER THE ADVERSE ACTION IMPOSED WOULD SERVE NO PURPOSE, AND THEREFORE SHALL NOT BE DIRECTED BY THE AUTHORITY.
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE STATUTE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WESTERN REGION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, SHALL:

DECISION
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
PURSUANT TO A COMPLAINT AND NOTICE OF HEARING ISSUED ON AUGUST 29, 1980 BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, SAN FRANCISCO REGION, A HEARING WAS HELD BEFORE THE UNDERSIGNED ON JANUARY 15, 1981 AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
THIS CASE ARISES UNDER THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (HEREIN CALLED THE ACT).
THE COMPLAINT HEREIN IS BASED UPON AN AMENDED CHARGE FILED ON MAY 23, 1980 BY NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION (HEREIN CALLED THE UNION) AGAINST INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WESTERN REGION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA (HEREIN CALLED RESPONDENT).
THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED IN SUBSTANCE THAT RESPONDENT, SINCE OR ABOUT JANUARY 29, 1980, REFUSED TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION AS THE EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS EMPLOYEES BY REFUSING TO FURNISH NECESSARY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION RELATING TO AN ADVERSE ACTION OF UNIT EMPLOYEE RICHARD RODRIGUEZ - ALL IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 7116(A)(1), (5) AND (8) OF THE ACT.
RESPONDENT FILED AN ANSWER ON SEPTEMBER 23, 1980 IN WHICH IT DENIED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE UNIT AS WELL AS THE STATUS OF THE UNION AS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE.
/5/ IT ALSO DENIED THE COMMISSION OF ANY UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.
ALL PARTIES WERE REPRESENTED AT THE HEARING.
EACH WAS AFFORDED FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, TO ADDUCE EVIDENCE, AND TO EXAMINE AS WELL AS CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES.
THEREOF THE BRIEFS WERE FILED WITH THE UNDERSIGNED WHICH HAVE BEEN DULY CONSIDERED.
UPON THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THIS CASE, FROM MY OBSERVATION OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, AND FROM ALL OF THE TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, I MADE THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS.
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
AT ALL TIMES MATERIAL HEREIN THE UNION HAS BEEN, AND STILL IS, THE EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF PROFESSIONAL AND NON-PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY RESPONDENT IN ITS NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES.
2.
INCLUDED WITHIN THE WESTERN REGION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ARE 10 WESTERN STATES.
EACH STATE HAS A DISTRICT OFFICE, EXCEPT THAT CALIFORNIA IS DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTRICTS: ONE IN LOS ANGELES AND THE OTHER IN SAN FRANCISCO.
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST PARTICULAR EMPLOYEES IS KEPT AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE WHERE SUCH EMPLOYEE IS STATIONED.
AUTHORITY TO TAKE ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE REPOSES IN THE DISTRICT DIRECTOR, AND THE AUTHORITY IS DELEGATED BY THE NATIONAL OFFICE.
3.
BOTH THE UNION AND RESPONDENT ARE PARTIES TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH, BY ITS TERMS, BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR A FOUR YEAR PERIOD COMMENCING ON JANUARY 31, 1977 AND IS AUTOMATICALLY RENEWABLE, ABSENT PROPER NOTICE, FOR YEARLY PERIODS AFTER ITS TERMINATION DATE.
4.
ARTICLE 34 OF SAID AGREEMENT, WHICH DEALS WITH ADVERSE ACTIONS, PROVIDES IN PERTINENT PART AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE 34
ADVERSE ACTIONS
SECTION 2
"A. IN ALL CASES OF PROPOSED ADVERSE ACTION, THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE GIVEN WRITTEN NOTICE OF
THE SPECIFIC CHARGES WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED ADVERSE ACTION THIRTY (30) DAYS IN
ADVANCE OF THE ACTION. . .
THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND ORALLY
AND/OR IN WRITING TO THE CHARGES PRIOR TO A DECISION ON THE CHARGES . . .
IF THE EMPLOYEE
ELECTS TO MAKE AN ORAL REPLY, THE EMPLOYER WILL RECORD THE REPLY VERBATIM AND PROVIDE A COPY
OF THE VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT TO THE EMPLOYEE PRIOR TO THE TIME THE DECIDING OFFICIAL CONSIDERS
THE CASE."
5.
BY A LETTER DATED JANUARY 16, 1980 /6/ RESPONDENT INFORMED RICHARD RODRIGUEZ, AN EMPLOYEE IN THE BARGAINING UNIT WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN THE PHOENIX, ARIZONA DISTRICT, THAT IT PROPOSED TO SUSPEND HIM FROM DUTY FOR 30 DAYS BECAUSE OF HIS UNAUTHORIZED USE OF A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE FOR OTHER THAN OFFICIAL PURPOSES.
/7/
6.
IN A WRITTEN DECLARATION, DATED JANUARY 18, RODRIGUEZ STATED THAT HE CHOSE NTEU CHAPTER 33 TO REPRESENT HIM IN THE PROPOSED ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST HIM.
7.
ON JANUARY 21 THE UNION WROTE RESPONDENT THAT IT HAD BEEN ASKED BY RODRIGUEZ TO REPRESENT HIM AT ALL MEETINGS RE THE PROPOSED "ADVERSE ACTION ISSUED TO HIM."
FURTHER, THE UNION REQUESTED AN ORAL REPLY BE MADE ON BEHALF OF RODRIGUEZ.
8.
BY LETTER DATED JANUARY 29 CAROL W. PERKINS, ASSISTANT COUNSEL FOR THE UNION HEREIN WROTE STUART ZIDEL, LABOR RELATIONS SPECIALIST OF RESPONDENT, STATING THAT SHE NEEDED AND REQUESTED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN ORDER TO PROPERLY REPRESENT RODRIGUEZ AND PREPARE HIS CASE RE HIS PROPOSED SUSPENSION:
"1.
COPIES OF ALL ADVERSE OR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS WITHIN YOUR
REGION DEALING WHOLLY OR IN PART WITH VIOLATION OF 31 U.S.C. 638(A)(C)(2) OR ANY OTHER CHARGES
INVOLVING WHOLLY OR IN PART THE UNAUTHORIZED OR IMPROPER USE OR LOSS OR THEFT, OR DAMAGE OR
NEGLIGENCE IN CONNECTION WITH A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE OR THE TRANSPORTATION OF UNAUTHORIZED
PERSONS IN A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE.
2.
COPIES OF ALL MATERIAL RELIED UPON TO SUPPORT THE CHARGES IN THE AFORESAID ACTIONS.
3.
COPIES OF ALL ORAL AND WRITTEN REPLIES IN THESE ACTIONS.
4.
COPIES OF THE LETTERS OF FINAL AGENCY DISPOSITION OF THE ACTIONS.
5.
COPIES OF REPORTS OF ANY SUBSEQUENT MITIGATION OR ALTERATION IN THE AFORESAID
DISPOSITION.
6.
COPIES OF ALL RELEVANT PARTS OF INSPECTION INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR INTERVIEWS INTO THE
IMPROPER USE, LOSS, THEFT, DAMAGE OR NEGLIGENCE (IN CONNECTION WITH A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE OR
TRANSPORTATION OF UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS IN A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE) IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE SUBJECT
OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT PROPOSED FOR DISCIPLINARY OR ADVERSE ACTION."
9.
IN REPLY TO THE AFORESAID REQUEST, ZIDEL WROTE PERKINS THAT RESPONDENT COULD NOT FURNISH THE INFORMATION SOUGHT BY THE UNION.
HE STATED THAT DATA PERTAINING TO OFFICES OTHER THAN THE PHOENIX DISTRICT WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR FULL AND PROPER DISCUSSION; THAT NO ACTIONS WERE TAKEN IN THE PHOENIX DISTRICT DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS INVOLVING THE SUBJECT AREA ABOUT WHICH PERKINS INQUIRED; AND THEREFORE NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.
10.
THE ORAL REPLY PROCEEDING WAS HELD ON MARCH 20.
IT WAS CONDUCTED BY PETER COONS, THE ORAL REPLY OFFICER DESIGNATED BY THE DISTRICT DIRECTOR, AND A TRANSCRIPT WAS MADE THEREOF.
THE OFFICER STATED FOR THE RECORD THAT THE PROCEEDING WAS NOT A HEARING; THAT IT WAS HELD SOLELY TO PERMIT RODRIGUEZ TO PRESENT HIS POSITION AND FURNISH INFORMATION AND AFFIDAVITS IN SUPPORT OF IT, AND THAT THE ORAL REPLY WAS NON-ADVERSARY IN NATURE WITH NO CROSS-EXAMINATION CONDUCTED.
THE DATA SOUGHT BY THE UNION, FOR USE AT THE ORAL REPLY PROCEEDING, WAS NOT FURNISHED BY RESPONDENT.
11.
BY LETTER DATED APRIL 17 PRESCOTT A. BERRY, THE PHOENIX DISTRICT DIRECTOR, INFORMED RODRIGUEZ THAT HIS SUSPENSION WAS WARRANTED, AND THAT THE EMPLOYEE WOULD BE SUSPENDED FROM APRIL 19 UNTIL MAY 18.
THE DIRECTOR ALSO ADVISED RODRIGUEZ HE HAD THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THIS ACTION TO THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD.
THE EMPLOYEE WAS SUSPENDED FOR 30 DAYS EFFECTIVE APRIL 19.
12.
THEREAFTER AN APPEAL WAS TAKEN TO THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD (MSPB) FROM RESPONDENT'S ADVERSE ACTION TOWARD RODRIGUEZ.
BY LETTER DATED JULY 14 TO GEORGE SWEGMAN, PRESIDING OFFICIAL, MSPB, CAROL PERKINS REQUESTED A SUBPOENA BE ISSUED TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION BY RESPONDENT HEREIN OF THE SAME INFORMATION INITIALLY REQUESTED OF IT FOR USE AT THE ORAL REPLY PROCEEDING.
13.
UNDER DATE OF AUGUST 7, SWEGMAN NOTIFIED PERKINS IN WRITING THAT A PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE IN RE THE APPEAL OF RODRIGUEZ WOULD BE HELD ON AUGUST 15.
THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE, AS STATED, WAS TO CLARIFY THE ISSUES BEFORE MSPB AND TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION FROM RESPONDENT.
14.
SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE AT THE MSPB, AN ORDER WAS ISSUED ON AUGUST 25 BY PRESIDING OFFICIAL GEORGE SWEGMAN.
HE STATED THEREIN THAT THE INFORMATION SOUGHT BY APPELLANT RODRIGUEZ WAS "POTENTIALLY RELEVANT TO THE ISSUES RAISED BY APPELLANT."
HE FURTHER DECIDED THAT RECORDS FOR TWO YEARS, RATHER THAN THREE AS REQUESTED, WOULD PROVIDE ADEQUATE STATISTICAL DATA TO SHOW A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.
SWEGMAN ORDERED THE AGENCY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE INFORMATION SOUGHT IN THE SECOND PART OF APPELLANT'S SPECIFICATIONS 1 AND 6 EXISTS, AND DIRECTED THE AGENCY TO INDICATE WHERE AND IN WHAT FORM RECORDED.
FURTHER, THE OFFICIAL ORDERED THE EMPLOYER TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SUCH RECORDED INCIDENTS AND ADVERSE ACTIONS DURING THE TWO YEAR PERIOD; THAT, IN ACCORD WITH AN AGREEMENT REACHED WITH APPELLANT, IT BE LIMITED TO 5 OF THE 11 DISTRICTS WITHIN THE REGION.
FINALLY, SWEGMAN ORDERED THE AGENCY TO PROVIDE THESE ANSWERS TO THE PRESIDING OFFICIAL AND APPELLANT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER.
15.
ON SEPTEMBER 8 THE AGENCY FILED WITH THE MSPB A MOTION TO QUASH THE ORDER ISSUED BY SWEGMAN ON AUGUST 25.
THIS WAS OVERRULED BY PRESIDING OFFICIAL F. L. LIGGETT OF MSPB ON THE GROUND THAT A MOTION TO QUASH MUST BE ADDRESSED TO A SUBPOENA; THAT NO SUBPOENA HAD BEEN ISSUED, BUT RATHER AN ORDER BY THE APPEALS BODY.
IN HIS ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 25 LIGGETT STATED THAT THE ORDER OF AUGUST 25 DID NOT REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO PRODUCE ANY OF THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY APPELLANT; THAT THE ORDER OF AUGUST 25 WAS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT BY THE PRESIDING OFFICIAL TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY APPELLANT EXISTED IN ANY RETRIEVABLE FORM AT THE IDENTIFIED DISTRICT.
SINCE THERE WAS NO COMPLIANCE WITH THE EARLIER ORDER, LIGGETT ORDERED THE AGENCY TO SHOW CAUSE WHY SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSED UPON IT.
16.
BY LETTER DATED OCTOBER 1, ADDRESSED TO LEGGETT, THE RESPONDENT STATED THAT: (A) THE INFORMATION REQUESTED IN SPECIFICATION 1 IS MAINTAINED IN THE RECORDS OF THE DISTRICT OFFICES OF PHOENIX, LOS ANGELES, RENO, SALT LAKE CITY, AND PORTLAND; (B) THE TYPE OF DATA SOUGHT IN SPECIFICATION 6 IS NOT MAINTAINED IN THE RECORDS OF THE SAID DISTRICTS, BUT MAY EXIST IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
HOWEVER, SAID INFORMATION IS NOT RETRIEVABLE BY THE SUBJECT CATEGORIES SET FORTH IN SAID SPECIFICATION; (C) THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADVERSE ACTIONS, DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS, OF THE TYPE STATED IN SPECIFICATION 1 IN THE AFORESAID DISTRICTS; (D) THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS IN SAID DISTRICTS HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF INCIDENTS OF THE TYPE STATED IN SPECIFICATION 6 DEALING WITH ADVERSE OR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS.
CONCLUSIONS
IT IS CONTENDED BY RESPONDENT THAT A REFUSAL TO FURNISH THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE UNION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.
THE EMPLOYER ALSO INSISTS THAT THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED IN THE APPEALS PROCEDURE BEFORE THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD (MSPB), AND THUS IT IS BARRED FROM CONSIDERATION HEREIN UNDER SECTION 7116(D) OF THE ACT.
FURTHER, IT TAKES THE POSITION THAT THE MATERIAL WAS NEITHER RELEVANT NOR NECESSARY TO A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER RODRIGUEZ WAS PROPERLY SUSPENDED FOR 30 DAYS.
RESPONDENT ALSO INSISTS THAT NO OBLIGATION EXISTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO A UNION OFFICIAL DIVORCED FROM THE BARGAINING PROCESS.
APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 7116(D) OF THE ACT
IT IS PROVIDED IN PERTINENT PART, UNDER SECTION 7116(D) OF THE ACT AS FOLLOWS:
"ISSUES WHICH CAN PROPERLY BE RAISED UNDER AN APPEALS PROCEDURE MAY NOT BE RAISED AS UNFAIR
LABOR PRACTICES PROHIBITED UNDER THIS SECTION."
RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT THE ABOVE SECTION WAS ENACTED IN SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE AS ITS PRECURSOR, SECTION 19(D) OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 11491, AS AMENDED.
FURTHER, THAT ITS INTENT, AS SET FORTH IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, WAS TO PRECLUDE RELITIGATION OF THE SAME ISSUES.
WHERE ADVERSE ACTION MATTERS ARE COVERED BY A NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE, AN EMPLOYEE MUST ELECT BETWEEN THAT COURSE OF ACTION OR APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROCEDURES.
IT IS ARGUED THAT THE UNION REQUESTED THE INFORMATION HEREIN TO REPRESENT RODRIGUEZ RE HIS PROPOSED SUSPENSION; THAT THE ISSUE PRESENTED WAS WHETHER THE INFORMATION WAS RELEVANT TO THE ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST THIS EMPLOYER; AND THAT THE ISSUE WAS ADJUDICATED UNDER THE STATUTORY PROCEDURE BEFORE THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD.
TO THIS END, AND IN SUPPORT OF ITS POSITION, THE EMPLOYER RELIES UPON SEVERAL CASES WHERE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE COMPLAINTS WERE DISMISSED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ISSUES PRESENTED THEREIN WERE RAISED IN A PRIOR PROCEEDING.
SEE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 3 FLRA NO. 75; BOSTON DISTRICT OFFICE, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, A/SLMR NO. 727.
WHILE THE MATTER IS NOT FREE FROM DOUBT, I AM PERSUADED THAT THE CITED CASES ARE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ONE AT BAR.
MOREOVER, I AM CONSTRAINED TO FIND THAT THE PRECISE ISSUE RAISED BY THE UNION'S UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE HEREIN IS DISSIMILAR FROM THE QUESTION RAISED OR RESOLVED AT THE STATUTORY APPEALS PROCEEDING.
AS HEREINAFTER SET FORTH IN MORE DETAIL, I CONCLUDE THAT THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO, AND DID NOT, PASS UPON THE ENTITLEMENT OF THE UNION AS THE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE TO THE INFORMATION INITIALLY REQUESTED FROM RESPONDENT IN PURSUANCE OF ITS DUTIES.
IN THE CHICAGO, IRS CASE, SUPRA, THE EMPLOYER PROPOSED TO SUSPEND TWO BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES AS A DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
BOTH INDIVIDUALS FILED GRIEVANCES UNDER THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT.
A UNION REPRESENTATIVE REQUESTED CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE EMPLOYER, ON BEHALF OF THE TWO GRIEVANTS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF THEM IN THEIR GRIEVANCES OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.
THE INFORMATION WAS NOT PRODUCED.
IN THE COMPLAINT PROCEEDING BEFORE THE AUTHORITY IT WAS ALLEGED THAT THE UNION AND THE AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEES HAD REQUESTED RELEVANT AND NECESSARY INFORMATION RELATING TO THE SUSPENSION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS; THAT SAID REQUEST WAS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPRESENTING THE EMPLOYEE RE THE PROPOSED ACTION; AND THAT THE EMPLOYER REFUSED TO FURNISH SAME.
IT WAS HELD THAT THE ELECTION BY THE GRIEVANTS TO RAISE THE NON-PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION IN THEIR GRIEVANCES PRECLUDES THE UNION FROM RAISING THE SAME ISSUES UNDER UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEDURES.
THE INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED ON THEIR BEHALF RE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION, AND FAILURE TO FURNISH THE INFORMATION WAS RAISED IN THEIR GRIEVANCE.
SINCE THE DATA WAS NEEDED TO REPRESENT THE INDIVIDUALS AT THE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING, THE UNION WAS NOT PERMITTED TO RAISE THE SAME REFUSAL TO FURNISH THE INFORMATION IN AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE MATTER.
AS SUCH, IT WAS BARRED BY SECTION 7116(D) OF THE ACT.
IN THE BOSTON, IRS CASE, SUPRA, AN ADVERSE ACTION PROCEEDING WAS INITIATED BY THE EMPLOYER AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT.
COUNSEL FOR THE BARGAINING AGENT REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM THE AGENCY WHICH IT DEEMED RELEVANT IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL DURING SUCH PROCEEDING.
IT WAS REFUSED.
THEREAFTER ARBITRATION WAS INVOKED AND THE UNION ASSERTED IT NEEDED THE DATA TO FULFILL ITS ROLE AS THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EMPLOYEE.
THE UNION RELIED UPON PAST DECISIONS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR RE THE RIGHTS OF SUCH REPRESENTATIVE TO OBTAIN SUCH MATERIAL.
THE ISSUE WAS LITIGATED BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR, AND THE LATTER ISSUED A WRITTEN RULING AS TO WHETHER THE UNION WAS ENTITLED TO SUCH INFORMATION.
AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE COMPLAINT /8/ WAS FILED BY THE UNION PRIOR TO THE HEARING BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR.
IN A DECISION INVOLVING THE ALLEGED UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE, BASED ON A FAILURE TO FURNISH THE INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM THE AGENCY, THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY CONCLUDED THE ACTION WAS BARRED BY 19(D) OF THE ORDER.
HE RELIED ON THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE WAS LITIGATED BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR, AND THAT THE UNION PRESSED ITS RIGHT AS A LABOR ORGANIZATION TO OBTAIN MATERIAL FROM AN ACTIVITY IN PROCESSING A GRIEVANCE OR PURSUING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE.
BOTH OF THE CITED DECISIONS INVOLVE FACTUAL DIFFERENCES WHICH, IN MY OPINION, COMPEL THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE NOT DETERMINATIVE OF THE MATTER AT HAND.
THUS, IN THE CHICAGO, IRS CASE THE INFORMATION REQUESTED WAS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPRESENTING THE TWO EMPLOYEES IN THE GRIEVANCE PROCEEDING.
THE DATA WAS SOUGHT ON THEIR BEHALF IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.
IT WAS NOT REQUESTED BY THE UNION IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS RIGHT AS BARGAINING AGENT IN ORDER TO FULFILL ITS DUTIES AS SUCH REPRESENTATIVE.
IN FACT, JUDGE DEVANEY SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT "THIS CASE DOES NOT INVOLVE A REQUEST BY THE UNION FOR INFORMATION 'QUA' THE UNION, AND NOTHING HEREIN IS INTENDED, NOR SHALL IT BE SO CONSTRUED, AS DISPOSITION OF A UNION'S INDEPENDENT RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THE UNION'S OVERALL BARGAINING RESPONSIBILITY . . . ".
THUS, NO DETERMINATION WAS MADE AS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 7116(D) WHERE THE UNION, QUA THE UNION, REQUESTED INFORMATION AND AN INDIVIDUAL GRIEVANCE HAS RESULT IN A REFUSAL TO FURNISH INFORMATION.
IN THE BOSTON, IRS CASE THE UNION PRESSED ITS RIGHT TO THE DATA REQUESTED AS A BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE TO FULFILL ITS DUTIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE AGENT.
ITS POSITION, IN THIS RESPECT, WAS CONSIDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR, AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE ADJUDICATED AGAIN IN THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING.
IN THE CASE AT BAR THE ISSUE RAISED BEFORE THE MSPB, WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA REQUESTED, WAS WHETHER EMPLOYEE RODRIGUEZ, OR SOMEONE ON HIS BEHALF, SHOULD RECEIVE THE INFORMATION FOR USE IN THE APPEALS PROCEEDING.
THE ISSUE RAISED BEFORE THE UNDERSIGNED, IN THIS UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE MATTER, IS WHETHER THE UNION WAS ENTITLED TO THE INFORMATION REQUESTED (ALBEIT THE SAME MATERIAL) TO FULFILL ITS DUTIES AS BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING RODRIGUEZ.
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE EMPLOYEE, AS THE APPELLANT, SEEKS THE INFORMATION TO CONVINCE THE MSPB THAT HIS SUSPENSION WAS WRONGFUL OR NOT JUSTIFIABLE.
THE UNION, AS BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE, WOULD HAVE HAD NO STANDING QUA UNION BEFORE THE APPEALS BODY. /9/ IN THE SECOND INSTANCES THE UNION NEEDED THE MATERIAL AT THE OUTSET TO ACT AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BARGAINING UNIT.
IN THE COURSE THEREOF IT COULD ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE MANAGEMENT AT THE ORAL REPLY MEETING THAT UNIT EMPLOYEE RODRIGUEZ SHOULD NOT BE SUSPENDED.
TO PURSUE THIS ENDEAVOR CERTAIN INFORMATION REQUESTED, I.E. DISCIPLINE METED TO OTHER EMPLOYEES FOR SIMILAR INFRACTIONS, OR THE FAILURE TO INVOKE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, COULD WELL BE MATERIAL AND HELPFUL.
THE MSPB, IN THE STATUTORY APPEALS PROCEDURE, COULD NOT PASS UPON THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE UNION SHOULD OBTAIN THE MATERIAL TO FULFILL ITS FUNCTION AS AFORESAID.
THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE IN AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING.
A CONTRARY RESULT WOULD MEAN THAT IF A UNION SEEKS INFORMATION TO REPRESENT A BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEE LIKELY TO BE DISCIPLINED, IT COULD NOT PERFORM ITS FUNCTION AND OBTAIN SAME IN THE EVENT THE EMPLOYEE APPEALS THE ADVERSE ACTION AND SEEKS SIMILAR DATA FOR USE BEFORE THE APPEALS BODY.
THIS NECESSARILY CONSTRICTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE.
ACCORDINGLY, I CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESENT PROCEEDING IS NOT BARRED UNDER SECTION 7114(D) OF THE ACT.
RELEVANCE AND NECESSITY OF INFORMATION REQUESTED
THE ESSENTIAL DATA SOUGHT BY THE UNION COMPRISES DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIS EMPLOYER WHICH INVOLVE INFRACTIONS BY OTHER EMPLOYEES OF A SIMILAR NATURE.
IN THIS RESPECT THE BARGAINING AGENT DESIRED MATERIAL RELIED UPON TO SUPPORT THE CHARGES IN OTHER ACTIONS, AS WELL AS REPLIES FROM THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL REPORTS SHOWING DISPOSITION OR MITIGATIONS, OF SUCH ACTIONS.
SUCH MATERIAL IS, IN MY OPINION, CLEARLY RELEVANT AND NECESSARY /10/ FOR THE UNION TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION IN REPRESENTING A UNIT EMPLOYEE UNDERGOING DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT.
THE AUTHORITY HAS RECOGNIZED THE RELEVANCE OF SUCH DATA IN INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, JACKSONVILLE DISTRICT, JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, 1 FLRA NO. 35.
IN THE CITED CASES MANAGEMENT PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY ACTION TOWARD A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE.
THE UNION THEREIN SOUGHT DATA RE WORK RECORDS OF SIX OTHER PROBATIONERS IN ORDER TO PROPERLY REPRESENT THE PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE.
IT WAS HELD THAT SUCH INFORMATION WAS RELEVANT AND NECESSARY FOR THE BARGAINING AGENT TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION.
DISPARITY OF TREATMENT ACCORDED EMPLOYEES COULD WELL BE A SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATION, AND PERFORMANCE DATA OF OTHER PROBATIONERS WAS DEEMED RELEVANT IN DETERMINING WHETHER DISCIPLINE OF THE PROBATIONERS WAS JUSTIFIABLE.
I CONSIDER THE AFOREMENTIONED CASE TO BE DECISIVE IN CONCLUDING THAT THE INFORMATION SOUGHT HEREIN WAS BOTH RELEVANT AND NECESSARY.
ACTION TAKEN BY RESPONDENT IN RESPECT TO OTHER EMPLOYEES CHARGED WITH THE SAME INFRACTION MIGHT WELL ASSIST THE UNION IN CONTENDING THAT THE PROPOSED SUSPENSION OF RODRIGUEZ IN 30 DAYS WAS UNFAIR AND SHOULD NOT OCCUR.
AS SUCH, IT IS CLEARLY RELEVANT AND NECESSARY.
FAILURE TO FURNISH SAME CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1), (5) AND (8) OF THE ACT. /11/ ACCORDINGLY, I CONCLUDED THAT: (A) THE PRESENT COMPLAINT WAS NOT BARRED UNDER SECTION 7116(D) OF THE ACT BY REASON OF THE MSPB PROCEEDING WHEREIN RODRIGUEZ SOUGHT THE SAME INFORMATION AS REQUESTED INITIALLY BY THE UNION HEREIN; (B) RESPONDENT'S FAILURE TO FURNISH SUCH DATA TO THE UNION, WHICH IS CLEARLY RELEVANT AND NECESSARY TO ITS PROPER REPRESENTATIONAL DUTIES, RAN AFOUL OF SECTION 7116(A)(1), (5) AND (8) OF THE ACT.
REMEDY
IN ITS BRIEF THE GENERAL COUNSEL SEEKS, IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION REQUESTED, THAT THE ORAL REPLY BE CONDUCTED AGAIN TO ALLOW RESPONDENT TO RECONSIDER THE ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST RODRIGUEZ.
A FULL STATUS QUO ANTE REMEDY APPEARS UNWARRANTED IN VIEW OF THE DECISION RENDERED BY THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION BOARD.
COMPLETE RESTORATION WOULD REQUIRE DISTURBANCE OF THE RULING BY AN APPELLATE BODY.
NEVERTHELESS, I BELIEVE THE UNION SHOULD BE ENTITLED, UPON REQUEST OF THE DATA SOUGHT HEREIN, TO EVALUATE AND UTILIZE IT IN REPRESENTING RODRIGUEZ DURING AN ORAL INTERVIEW.
IN FULFILLING ITS DUTIES AS BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE THE UNION MAY ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE RESPONDENT THAT ITS ACTION WAS UNJUSTIFIABLE IN LIGHT OF THE INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE EMPLOYER.
ACCORDINGLY, I AGREE THAT A PROPER REMEDY, IN ADDITION TO SUPPLYING THE DATA REQUESTED, CALLS FOR ANOTHER ORAL REPLY TO ENABLE THE RESPONDENT TO RECONSIDER ITS ADVERSE ACTIONS.
HAVING FOUND AND CONCLUDED THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTIONS 7116(A)(1), (5) AND (8) OF THE ACT, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE AUTHORITY ISSUE THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ORDERS THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WESTERN REGION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA SHALL:

--------------- FOOTNOTES$ ---------------
/1/ IN HIS DECISION, THE JUDGE INADVERTENTLY INTERCHANGED REFERENCES TO THE RESPONDENT, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WESTERN REGION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, WITH REFERENCES TO INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, PHOENIX DISTRICT OFFICE.
THE AUTHORITY CORRECTS THIS INADVERTENT ERROR, NOTING THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WESTERN REGION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, IS THE RESPONDENT HEREIN, AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, PHOENIX DISTRICT OFFICE IS ORGANIZATIONALLY PART OF THE RESPONDENT.
THE RESPONDENT WESTERN REGION WAS THE PARTY WHICH REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE UNION IN ITS CAPACITY AS EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF A MEMBER OF THE BARGAINING UNIT.
/2/ THE JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPLAINT HEREIN WAS NOT BARRED BY SECTION 7116(D) OF THE STATUTE, AS CONTENDED BY THE RESPONDENT.
IN THIS REGARD, HE FOUND THAT THE ISSUE RAISED IN THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING AS TO WHETHER THE UNION WAS ENTITLED TO INFORMATION REQUESTED IN ORDER TO FULFILL ITS DUTIES AS EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE BARGAINING UNIT WAS NOT THE SAME ISSUE AS THAT RAISED BY AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS ASSERTING HIS OWN RIGHT TO SUCH INFORMATION AS THE APPELLANT IN A STATUTORY APPEAL PROCEEDING BEFORE THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD (MSPB).
FOR THE REASONS MORE FULLY STATED BY THE JUDGE IN HIS DECISION, THE AUTHORITY AGREES THAT THE UNION'S RIGHT TO THE INFORMATION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN RAISED OR DECIDED IN THE PROCEEDING BEFORE MSPB AND THEREFORE WAS NOT BARRED BY SECTION 7116(D) FROM BEING RAISED HEREIN AS AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.
/3/ SEE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL OFFICE, DENVER, COLORADO, 7 FLRA NO. 100 (1982); DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD, 4 FLRA NO. 82 (1980); INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, JACKSONVILLE DISTRICT, JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, 1 FLRA 265 (1979).
/4/ THIS DECISION WAS NOT APPEALED, AND UNDER THE MSPB'S RULES HAS BECOME FINAL.
/5/ STIPULATIONS AT THE HEARING BETWEEN THE PARTIES REFLECT THAT THE UNION IS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGENT FOR EMPLOYEES OF RESPONDENT IN AN APPROPRIATE UNIT, AND THAT THE EMPLOYEE INVOLVED HEREIN IS A MEMBER OF SUCH UNIT.
/6/ UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ALL DATES HEREINAFTER MENTIONED OCCUR IN 1980.
/7/ SUCH USE IS PROHIBITED UNDER 31 U.S.C. 638(A)(C)(2) AND PROVIDES FOR SUSPENSION FROM DUTY OF THE EMPLOYEE FOR NOT LESS THAN ONE MONTH.
/8/ IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROCEDURES APPLICABLE UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 11491, AS AMENDED, THE CHARGING PARTY FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST RESPONDENT.
/9/ IN ITS BRIEF RESPONDENT STATES THE UNION HAD NO RIGHT TO REPRESENT RODRIGUEZ BEFORE THE MSPB.
THIS CONTENTION SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LATTER COULD NOT HAVE PASSED UPON THE UNION'S ENTITLEMENT TO THE INFORMATION AS BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE.
/10/ RESPONDENT ARGUES THAT THE UNION HAS NO RIGHT TO REPRESENT AN EMPLOYEE IN A STATUTORY APPEALS PROCEDURE.
IT INSISTS THE REQUESTED INFORMATION MUST BE RELEVANT TO THE LABOR ORGANIZATION'S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS DUTY.
THUS, SINCE THE UNION HAS NO SUCH RIGHT OR OBLIGATION, NO RELEVANCE OF THE DATA CAN BE SHOWN.
THIS ARGUMENT, SOMEWHAT SPECIOUS, IS REJECTED IN LIGHT OF MY PRIOR FINDINGS RE THE DUTY OF THE UNION TO REPRESENT EMPLOYEES WHEN PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS INITIALLY COMMENCED.
/11/ RESPONDENT'S FAILURE TO FURNISH THE DATA BREACHES SECTION 7114(B)(4).
