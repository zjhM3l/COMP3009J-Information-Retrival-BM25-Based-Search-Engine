The area has steep and rugged terrain in the river and creek canyons and moderate to gentle slopes on the numerous benches and ridges.
Elevations range from 1,000 feet along the Feather River to 4,400 feet in the north.
Most of the area is drained by the West Branch and the North Fork of the Feather River.
Major streams are Empire, Shake Ravine, Flea Valley, Camp, Lockerman, and Dogwood Creeks.
Erosion potential is high for most of the area, and the potential for landslides as a result of disturbance is high to extreme on the portions along the North Fork Canyon.
The vegetation is characterized by ponderosa pine in the higher elevations and typical foothill mixed conifer, oak-madrone mix, shrubs and some grass in the lower portions.
The area provides winter range for the Tehama and Bucks Mountain Deer Herd.
Portions of two spotted owl territories are included.
The largest recorded fire occurred in the Sawmill Peak vicinity in 1968 and burned 2,000 acres.
Prehistoric sites, ranging from single components to large village areas, and historic sites are numerous in the area.
Recreational activities are dispersed camping, fishing, and hunting.
Paradise Lake is the major attraction: the adjacent picnic area is operated by a Special Use Permittee.
The "Flea Valley" grazing allotment is within the area.
Logging, including early railroad logging, has been extensive.
The demand for fuelwood cutting permits is steadily increasing, and timber harvesting continues.
Mining has occurred since the Gold Rush era.

The entire area is within Butte County.
A checkerboard ownership pattern exists.
The area has steep and rugged terrain except along French Creek and on ridges.
Elevations range from 5,149 feet at Four Trees in the northeast to 900 feet in the southwest.
The area is primarily the watershed of French Creek, which flows into the North Fork of the Feather within Oroville Reservoir.
On the west a few creeks flow directly into the North Fork.
Soils are extremely erodible, and the French Creek Basin is a watershed where conventional land management can cause excessive sedimentation.
Mass instability is usually limited to slumping along roads.
The vegetation consists of mixed conifers in the lower elevations and true fir in the higher elevations.
Fires have been few and small.
Portions of three spotted owl territories and a bald eagle management zone are in the area.
Approximately 6,000 acres are Bucks Mountain deer herd winter range.
Fishing, recreational mining, and hunting are the primary recreational activities.
"Rogers Cow Camp" is the only developed campground.
The area encompasses the "French Creek" grazing allotment.
From the early 1900's to the 1930's the area was heavily logged, using rail transportation.
Many of the grades form today's road system.
The area is still a major timber producer.
During the gold rush, the area was extensively mined, as evidenced by cobble tailings along all major creeks.
Dredge mining took place along French Creek in the 1930's.
Some mining still occurs.

Description
The Galen Management Area extends easterly from Big Bend on the North Fork's Oroville Reservoir to the canyon of the Middle Fork of the Feather River.
It is bounded on the north by a segment of the North Fork and the Oroville-Quincy Road through the Brush Creek Work Center and on the south by the Forest boundary.
The land ownership pattern is checkerboard.
Most of the unit is in Butte County, but a small part is in Plumas County.
Prominent features include Wild Yankee H i l l , Big Bald Rock, L i t t l e Bald Rock, and the Big Bend arm of the Reservoir.
The area has broad ridgetops and steep canyon slopes.
Elevations range from 1,000 feet in the Big Bend area to 4,000 feet on Shute Mountain.
The western and eastern portions are in the North and Middle Fork watersheds, respectively.
Principal drainages include Galen, Martin, Berry, Brush, and Mountain House Creeks.
Galen, Martin, and Berry Creeks flow into Madrone Lake, a s m a l l reservoir just outside the area.
The geology is very uniform: coarse-grained granitic rock occurs extensively throughout.
Consequently sheet and gully erosion are critical problems.
Mass instability is a problem in the steep North Fork Canyon.
The Big Bald Rock Batholith, a group of granite domes, is of special geologic interest.
Vegetation is mixed conifer but with extensive hardwood riparian corridors.
Most of the creeks support a modest trout population.
The area is critical winter range of the Bucks Mountain deer herd.
A part of a spotted owl territory and a bald eagle management zone are included.
Dispersed recreation is light because the area lacks recreational attractions and private land is widespread.
Major activities include fishing, hunting, and some camping.
No developed campgrounds are in the area.
About 70 acres of the Bald Rock unroaded area are present.
A portion of the "Berry Creek" grazing allotment is within the area: it is used in conjunction with adjacent private lands.
Logging activity has taken place on both PNF and private land and is continuing.
Historical evidence of mineral exploration is found throughout the area, and there are several recent claims.

Description The Axford rim of the and Willow except for Management Area extends from the Oroville-Quincy Road to the canyon of Middle Fork of the Feather River between Sky High Creek.
The entire management area is within Plumas County 1,000 acres in Butte County.
The area has several major ridges which include Toland.
Rock Island, Sky High, and Glazer.
Terrain is moderately sloped along the ridges but extremely steep in the creek canyons.
Elevations range from approximately 4,000 feet to 6,000feet.
Almost the entire area is in the Little North Fork of the Feather River watershed, drained prominently by Marble, Buckhorn, Frazier, Axford, Coquette, and Coldwater Creeks.
Soils are derived from many rock types and are moderately to very highly erodible.
Mass instability is a problem in serpentine areas and the steep inner canyons.
Vegetation consists of mixed conifers at the lower elevations and red and white fir at the higher elevations.
The Bucks Mountain deer herd uses approximately 2.500 acres for winter range.
Most of the area is used for summer deer summer range.
A spotted owl territory is included.
Most of the creeks support trout.
Recreational use, mostly dispersed, includes fishing, hunting, camping, and hiking, but the Little North Fork Campground is present.
A hiking trail paralleling Marble Creek is used primarily by fishermen.
Portions of the "Gravel," "Bear Gulch," and "Granite Basin" grazing allotments are within the area.
Use is intermittent.
Extensive railroad logging took place in the 1920's and 1930's.
virtually eliminating the old growth stands.
Present management involves thinning of young stands.
Mining has had a significant impact here.
The largest, and one of the oldest mines is the "Robinson" which began operations in the mid 1800's and supported a large population through the 1930's.
Mining is still an important activity in the area.

The Kellogg Management Area is a 1 to 2 mile wide corridor along the north side of the Middle Fork of the Feather River Canyon from Oroville Reservoir to near Bear Creek (Oroville-Quincy District boundary).
Fifty percent of the PNF land is within the federally-designatedWild and Scenic River area.
Slightly more than half of the management area is in Plumas County; the remainder is in Butte County.
Prominent features include large, scenic granite domes and several waterfalls.
The southern portion is within the Feather Falls Scenic Area.
Terrain is generally extremely steep and rugged, and vertical cliffs in the main canyon average 2,000 feet in height.
Elevation ranges from 760 feet to 5,620 feet.
Soils are highly erodible and the landslide risk is generally high to extreme.
Vegetation is a typical foothill association in the lower elevations and mixed conifer in the higher elevations.
Approximately 9,000 acres are winter range for the Bucks Mountain deer herd.
Portions of two spotted owl territories are included.
Evidence of prehistoric land use is found throughout the management area.
Recreational use consists of camping and fishing, primarily in the vicinity of Milsap Bar, a developed campground on the south side of the river.
It is served by the only road that crosses the Wild and Scenic River between the Quincy-LaF'orte Road crossing and Oroville Reservoir.
The river is managed primarily for its scenic qualities and related recreational use.
The Hartman Bar and Hunter Ravine Trails and the Little California Mine 4-Wheel Drive road are the other routes to the river.

Lost Creek District: La Porte Acreage: 57,244 Total 28.074 or 49% PNF
Description The Lost Creek Management area is between Fall River on the northwest, Slate Creek on the southeast, and Little Grass Valley Reservoir on the northeast.
It is in Butte, Plumas, and Yuba Counties.
Intervening private lands are substantial.
Prominent features are Lumpkin.
Mooreville and Harrison Ridges, Lexington Hill, Lost Creek and Sly Creek Reservoirs, and the community of La Porte.
Terrain consists of steep slopes and broad ridgetops, and elevations range from 1,800 to 5,700 feet.
Soils are deep and moderately to highly erodible.
Risk of instability is generally low to moderate, except in the steep inner canyons.
Streams paralleling the southwest-trending ridges drain to the Middle and South Forks of the Feather River and to the North Fork of the Yuba River.
Vegetation consists of mixed conifer and true fir stands and brushfields.
Bald eagle and osprey habitat exists at Little Grass Valley Reservoir, and blacktail deer of the Mooretown herd utilize the entire area, primarily for summer range.
Portions of three spotted owl territories are included.
Due to extensive hydroelectric development only modest populations of trout occur.
However, the South Fork of the Feather River and Lost Creek have some isolated thriving populations.
The establishment of the Marysville-Onion Valley Road, and later the Marysville-La Porte Road, opened this area for settlement in 1850, and several small towns and inns were established along the way.
Four developed recreation sites are located on the peninsula of Little Grass Valley Reservoir (see Area #15 also).
Portions of the "Fall River", "Little Grass Valley" and "Strawberry Valley" range allotments are in this area.
Fall River and Strawberry Valley are active, but Little Grass is inactive due to livestock control problems and conflicts with recreation.
Timber management is intensive for green sawtimber, and productivity is moderate to high.
Two large-scale gold mines and several small placer operations currently
