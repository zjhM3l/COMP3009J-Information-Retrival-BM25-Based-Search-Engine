Samples of Student Work The samples of student work included in this section are intended to begin the process of articulating the performance standards at each level of achievement.
This collection is not yet adequate for that purpose in either numbers or scope of examples.
As New York State continues to collect work samples from the schools for inclusion in the document, we expect a much clearer understanding of the performance standards to be evident.
Neither are these samples presented as models of excellence.
They vary in degree of achievement.
Some are "acceptable"; others "more proficient."
All are meant to provide examples of the kind of work students might produce to demonstrate progress toward the standard.
