E. GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION PROGRAM
State legislation passed in 1987 requires all Texas school districts to provide educational programs to serve the needs of gifted and talented students at all grades.
Gifted and talented students are characterized as those students who demonstrate high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.
In 1995, state law required the State Board of Education (SBOE) to "develop and periodically update a state plan of the education of gifted and talented students."
The plan was designed "to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented."
The SBOE plan, adopted in 1996, provides direction on refining existing services and creating additional curricular options for gifted students.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students identifies five program areas that serve as the basis for measuring how well districts provide services to gifted and talented students.
The areas are student assessment, program design, curriculum and instructions, professional development and family-community involvement.
Districts are required to have a systematic process for identifying gifted and talented students.
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) issues guidelines for identifying gifted and talented students to ensure all of these students receive a quality education.
The identification process must include quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation tools.
Funding through the Texas Foundation School Program is intended to provide gifted and talented programs for students from various cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Teachers, counselors, parents or other interested persons may nominate students for the gifted and talented program at any time.
Anyone wishing to nominate a student contacts the campus principal or the student's teacher.
All students in kindergarten through grade five are screened by classroom teachers using a behavioral checklist.
Special Education students are also given opportunity to participate in the program through alternative identification process.
A selection committee whose members have received training in the nature and needs of gifted students determine if the data meets the necessary criteria.
If the student qualifies, the parents and students are notified in writing.
La Pryor ISD's gifted and talented program has 48 students in grades K-12, representing 10.5 percent of total enrollment.
The percent of LPISD students enrolled in the gifted and talented program is higher than all its peers and the regional and state averages (Exhibit 2-27).
The proportion of instructional expenditures budgeted for gifted and talented programs are second lowest among peer districts and lower than the regional and state averages.
Exhibit 2-27 Percent of Students and Budgeted Instructional Expenditures for Gifted and Talented Program LPISD, Peers, Region 20 and State 1999-2000
Entity G/T Student Enrollment G/T Instructional Expenditures
Charlotte 7.4% 1.3%

Pearsall 8.2% 0.4%
Carrizo Springs 9.1% 2.5%
Cotulla 10.1% 1.2%
La Pryor 10.5% 0.5%
State 7.5% 1.9% Region 20 8.4% 1.2% Source: TEA, AEIS 1999-2000.
All 14 elementary teachers attended workshops at Region 20 to receive the 30 hours of required Training in Gifted and Talented education.
The elementary principal and seven elementary teachers have more than 30 hours training.
Teachers serving these students at the secondary schools, as well as administrators and counselors have met the training requirements.
FINDING
LPISD does not have a formal long-range plan in place for their gifted and talented program.
The program in LPISD began in 1988-89 as a pullout program in grades two through six and remained a pullout program for three years.
The next two years the program was integrated within the regular classroom.
In 1993-94 the program returned to a pullout program in K- 8.
During the next two years, the program was within the regular classroom again, and the following two years it became a pullout program.
Currently the kindergarten through fifth grade program is integrated with the classroom.
Grades six through eight are served through the Language Arts Department.
In high school, students are served through Advanced Placement courses.
Although the District Improvement Plan includes a strategy stating Gifted and Talented Programs will be implemented and reflect the use of technology and a differentiated curriculum, there is no program plan to follow.
To avoid the instability of changing the program from year to year, the district should develop a five-year plan.
Long-range planning and student evaluation are important components of a successful program.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students provides a long-range plan with viable targets that local school districts can strive to attain.
Examples of "recognized" and "exemplary" performance are included in the plan.
Districts following this plan offer additional challenges to this group of students.
Recommendation 11:
Comply with the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students and adopt a five-year plan for the Gifted and Talented Program.
