Between 1996-97 and 1998-99, funds budgeted for instructional operating expenses in FBISD increased 15.4 percent for all programs, from $117.2 million to $135.2 million.
During the same period, funds budgeted for the G/T program increased 2.8 percent, from $2.4 million to $2.5 million.
However, because the increase in enrollment in the G/T program was more than twice the enrollment increase districtwide, the budgeted instructional operating expenditure for each student enrolled in FBISD's G/T program declined by 13.3 percent over the same two-year period, from $478.83 to $415.32.
These data are provided in Exhibit 2-19.

FINDING
The district encourages all district teachers to obtain the 30 hours of initial staff development training required for teachers providing services to gifted and talented students as well as the six hours needed for annual update training.
It has been the district's position that instructional strategies appropriate for use with gifted and talented students are also appropriate for other students.
Although approximately 255 full-time equivalent teachers served students in the district's gifted and talented program during 1998-99, district records indicate 800 teachers had received the 30 hours of initial staff development training through summer 1999.
COMMENDATION
FBISD has demonstrated a commitment to providing opportunities for all staff to receive staff development training related to teaching gifted and talented students.
FINDING
Students in FBISD establish eligibility for placement in the district's gifted and talented program based on quantitative and qualitative measures.
The quantitative measures include two mental ability tests, the Cognitive Abilities Test and the Raven Progressive Matrices; and an achievement test, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills/Tests of Achievement and Proficiency.
The qualitative measures used are the Parent/Student Nomination Form and the Teacher Nomination Form.
An eligibility profile based on the student's scores on each of the assessment measures is developed and made available to Campus Selection Committees (CSCs).
Board policy, EHBB (Local): Special Programs: Gifted and Talented Programs, states: "evaluate each nominated student according to the established criteria and...select those students for whom placement in the gifted program is the most appropriate educational setting."
The basis for placements is the individual student profile.
Although students scoring in the top two of the five categories on the profile normally are placed in the gifted program, the CSC may place students in the program without regard to their profile scores.
To ensure all classes in a grade level are similar in size, principals have the authority to assign students who are not identified as gifted and talented, or "fillers," to gifted and talented classes.
The number of FBISD students identified as gifted and talented varies widely among schools.

The number of FBISD students identified as gifted and talented varies widely among schools.
At Briargate Elementary, only 9 students, or 1.2 percent of the enrollment, were identified as gifted and talented while at Commonwealth Elementary, 118 students, or 22.3 percent of the enrollment were identified.
The six elementary schools with the lowest percentage of students identified as gifted and talented are: Briargate (1.2), Burton (2.6), Hunters Glen (1.2), Jones (2.7), Ridgegate (1.8), and Ridgemont (2.7).
These schools were six of the eight schools with the highest percentages of minority students in the district.
Conversely, the six elementary schools with the highest percentage of students identified as gifted and talented, Austin Parkway (12.2), Colony Bend (12.6), Colony Meadows (10.5), Commonwealth (22.3), Palmer (11.1), and Settlers Way (9.7), were the six schools with the lowest percentages of minority students.
At the secondary level, the two middle schools with the lowest percentage of identified students, McAuliffe (9.3) and Missouri City (6.6), were the schools with the highest percentage of minority students, 99 percent at both schools.
The middle schools with the highest percentage of identified students; First Colony (29.1) and Garcia (23.6) also had the lowest percentage of minority students, 39 percent and 37 percent, respectively.
Similarly, of the district's high schools, the three schools with the lowest percentage of students identified as gifted also had the highest percentage of minority students.

Most research on giftedness shows that 3 to 5 percent of the population is gifted in one or more areas.
In FBISD, 11.8 percent of the students are identified as gifted and talented; 6.9 percent at the elementary level, 18.8 percent at the middle school level and 13.3 percent at the high school level.
These figures reveal that students have been over-identified districtwide for the FBISD gifted and talented program.
However, gifted and talented students are under-represented at several individual schools, a number of which have the highest minority populations in FBISD.
It should also be noted that having more than 10 percent of its students identified as gifted and talented could trigger a District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) audit by TEA.
Recommendation 15:
Review criteria and procedures used for identifying students for the gifted and talented program.
This will reduce problems associated with over and under identification.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The coordinator of Gifted/Talented develops and submits a plan for training appropriate staff on the characteristics of the under-represented to the associate superintendent of Achievement and Development through the director of Instructional Support Services for review and approval.
February-March 2001 2.
The associate superintendent of Achievement and Development submits the plan to the superintendent's cabinet for approval.
April 2001 3.
The superintendent submits the plan to the board for consideration for the 2001-02 budget.
May-June 2001 4.
The coordinator of Gifted/Talented and other appropriate staff conduct training for school-based personnel.
Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation could be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
The district's five-year Gifted/Talented Improvement Plan (1997-2002) addresses all five components included in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
However, the document has not been updated since its development in 1996-97.
The costs associated with completing the activities are listed as "none" or "to be determined," and there is no mention of the status of any of the activities, such as whether they have been completed or are still in progress.
In addition, documentation provided by the district on completion of some of the activities shows that the completion dates, in some cases, have been modified from those contained in the five-year plan.
One purpose of any five-year improvement plan is to focus planning efforts on the activities necessary to securing the resources required to meet the program objectives.
To achieve that objective most effectively, the plan must be evaluated and revised regularly to ensure tasks, completion dates and areas of responsibility are up-to-date and that the resource requirements are realistic.
Recommendation 16:
Update the Gifted/Talented 5-Year Improvement Plan.
Particular attention should be given to the status of completed activities and to any appropriate modifications to future activities with implementation costs provided where available.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The coordinator for Gifted/Talented recommends to the director of Instructional Support Services individuals to serve on a committee to update the Gifted/Talented 5-Year Improvement Plan.
November 2000 2.
The director of Instructional Support Services submits the recommended list of committee members to the associate superintendent of Achievement and Development for approval.
November-December 2000 3.
The committee updates the 5-year plan and submits it for review to the associate superintendent of Achievement and Development through the director of Instructional Support.
January-March 2001 4.
The associate superintendent of Achievement and Development submits the updated plan to the superintendent's cabinet for approval.
April 2001 5.
The superintendent submits the updated Gifted/Talented 5-Year Improvement Plan to the board for approval.
May-June 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation could be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
The College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Program provides high school students exposure to college-level materials and the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the material through an examination.
Although not required to take an AP course to take the AP exam or, conversely, to take the exam if enrolled in a course, many students attempt the AP examinations because a grade of 3, 4 or 5 generally qualifies the student to receive equivalent credit at colleges and universities that participate in the program.
Teachers must receive special training to teach an AP course.
Advanced Placement (AP) courses offered in FBISD are approved through the same process, as are all other courses.
Once approved, each course is offered at all of the district's high schools.
The district provides funding for teacher training and curriculum development related to AP courses.
The counseling staff of each high school has the responsibility for scheduling AP examinations and serving as monitors during the exams.
Based on information provided by FBISD, minorities as a whole are under-represented in Advanced Placement (AP) classes in the district's high schools.
For example, Clements has the lowest minority enrollment (39.4) and the highest percentage (46.0) of students enrolled in AP courses.
Conversely, Willowridge has the highest minority enrollment (98.7) of the district's high schools and the second lowest percentage (13.9) of students in AP courses.
Although Hightower has Grades 9-11 only, it has the second highest percentage of minority students
(84 percent) and lowest percentage (10.4) of students enrolled in AP classes.
These data are provided in Exhibit 2-22.
It should be noted, however, that when considering ethnic groups individually, Asian-Americans are over-represented in AP courses, while African Americans and Hispanics are under-represented (Exhibit 2-23).
The percentage of students in each of the district's high schools taking and passing AP courses with a grade of 3 or above is shown in Exhibit 2-24.

The district has made some efforts to increase minority enrollment in AP classes.
Dialogue has occurred between central office and school personnel about the availability of student scholarships offered by the state.
Middle schools have been encouraged to offer pre-AP programs, and seminars related to programs, such as the Duke University Talent Search, have been conducted.
At the high school level, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), a program designed to increase access to four-year universities among low-income and underserved students has been implemented at four schools: Elkins, Hightower, Kempner and Willowridge.
A contributing factor in the low minority participation in the district's AP program may be financial.
There is a fee of $76 associated with taking an AP examination.
The College Board, the program sponsor, and the State of Texas provide reductions of $22 and $42, respectively, for students who demonstrate financial need.
If the student's high school forgoes the $7 rebate for test administration, the resulting cost to the student for taking an AP exam is $5.
Four of the seven FBISD high schools report that one or more organizations on the campuses conduct fund-raisers to help defray cost for minority students.
Officials at two of those campuses said that all costs are underwritten when a need is established.
According to a district report dated September 1999, FBISD students took 2,033 AP examinations in May 1999.
Minority students, excluding Asian Americans who are over-represented on the examination process, took 204 (10 percent) of the total number of examinations.
African American, Hispanic and Native American students represent approximately 44 percent of the student enrollment in FBISD.
If the percentage of those ethnic groups taking AP exams reflected closer to the 44 percent of the total FBISD student population they represent, African-American, Hispanic and Native American students would be taking an estimated 900 AP examinations resulting in more than 2,725 total exams taken by FBISD students.
The cost of underwriting the $5 fee that is not waived by the College Board, the state or the student's high school is estimated at $13,625.
If the $5 fee is waived, it could encourage more students to take AP exams.
Recommendation 17:
Identify sources of funding to reduce Advanced Placement examination fees to encourage minority participation in the Advanced Placement program.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The directors of Curriculum and Student Support Services review fee-reduction programs in other school districts.
November 2000-February 2001 2.
The directors of Curriculum and Student Support Services submit a proposal to reduce AP examination fees to the superintendent's cabinet for approval.
February 2001 3.
The directors of Curriculum and Student Support Services meet with area business leadership and the Education Foundation to discuss the endowment of a fee-reduction program.
March-April 2001 4.
The directors of Curriculum and Student Support Services submit to the superintendent's cabinet a proposal to reduce AP examination fees for all FBISD students based on discussion with business and the Education Foundation.
May 2001 5.
The superintendent submits to the board a proposal for reducing AP examination fees for FBISD students for 2001-02 budget consideration.
May-June 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation could be implemented with existing resources.
