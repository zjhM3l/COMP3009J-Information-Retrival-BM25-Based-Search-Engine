and individuals can meet their basic needs, share in our healthy, educated, just, and caring community.
Policies and priorities for distributing CDBG funds to community-based organizations are derived from the City's Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, which is coordinated by the Human Services Department (HSD).
As required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Consolidated Plan outlines funding policies and strategies for CDBG funds as well as for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), the HOME Investment Partnership (HOME), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG).
The 2003 Adopted Budget estimates the amount of CDBG dollars anticipated by the City to be available, appropriates these funds, and makes specific CDBG proposals for certain City programs.
The City's 2003 revenue projections hold CDBG resources constant at the 2002 actual award level.
Final CDBG program allocations are subject to the appropriation levels set by the U.S. Congress and implemented by HUD.
While the federal government's annual CDBG allocations will be made next year for 2004, the 2003 allocation decisions are carried forward in the City's biennial budget for 2004.
However, it is likely that the 2000 census data will affect future allocations.
Policy and Program Changes The 2003 allocation process for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) was different from the process conducted in recent years.
Departments applied for new and existing programs in an effort to target the funds to meet some of the Mayor's community development priorities.
FaÃ§ade improvements, business attraction and retention, and neighborhood implementation plans all received increased funding in 2003.
Contracts with human service providers continue to make up almost one-third of the total block grant; this is much higher than other major cities where human services spending is capped at 15%.
However, no-cost-of living adjustment is provided for block grant funds to human services providers in 2003.
Reductions are made in block grant funding in the Office of Housing, community facilities, and Human Services Department administration.
Another change reflected in this budget is the removal of the designation of Human Services Program (HSP).
These funds have always been and will continue to be General Subfund resources and are now solely reported in department budgets.
The Human Services Program expanded City support for basic human services in response to federal funding reductions and CDBG limits on the use of funds for human services.
Processes were combined and uniform policies and funding categories were applied to allocations and contracting for CDBG and resources that were set aside from the City's General Subfund and labeled HSP.
In 1994, HSP was included with CDBG as part of the Consolidated Plan.
However, HSP funds come from the General Subfund and are appropriated at the department level, not through the CDBG appropriations listed below.
The resources formerly identified as HSP are eliminated from the Consolidated Plan and the CDBG Program and are included in the budget under General Subfund in the appropriate departments (Public Health and the Human Services Department) in 2003 and 2004.

This programming also helps to strengthen parent, school, and community partnerships that support children and youth.
The Department of Neighborhoods/Office for Education administers the Levy.
Implementing departments are Department of Neighborhoods, Human Services Department, Public Health - Seattle 
The Families and Education Levy funds 21 programs that provide critical health and social services to children, youth, and families.
A portion of Levy funds goes directly to Seattle Public Schools via contracts with the above-mentioned departments.
Note: The budget control level for the Levy is a unique program in either Department of Neighborhoods, Human Services Department, Public Health-Seattle 
Positions listed are paid for by the Families and Education Levy, but authorized in each department's position list.
Policy and Program Changes Actions have been taken in 2002 to commit $3,272,317 from the accumulated fund balance in the Families and Education Levy.
Due to higher than anticipated interest revenues and property tax collections, additional funds are appropriated to existing and Levy-related programs.
The majority is appropriated (through Ordinance #120832) to increase the current budget allocation for eight teen health centers and two middle school wellness centers; open one new teen health center at Ingraham High School and one new middle school wellness center; and increase services at Madison Middle School and New Options Middle School.
The 2003 budget adds $215,000 in teen health centers in order to fund the Rainier Beach Teen Health Center from the Education Levy, instead of the General Subfund, as is the case for all the other teen health centers.
Funds are from the Levy fund balance and will be continued to fund Rainier Beach Teen Health Center through the end of the Levy.
The purpose of the new Family Partnerships Project, a combination of the existing Volunteer and Family Partnership Project and the Family Involvement Project, is to increase the ability of individual schools to form effective partnerships with all families.
Because the Families and Education Levy is up for renewal in the fall of 2004, an extensive outreach effort to design the new Levy proposal will be initiated in 2003.

Department Description The Human Services Department's (HSD) mission is to find and fund solutions for human needs so that lowincome, vulnerable residents in greater Seattle can live and thrive.
HSD contracts with more than 230 community-based human service providers and administers programs to ensure that residents of Seattle and King County have food and shelter, productive education and job opportunities, adequate health care, and many more of life's basic necessities.
HSD has adopted a set of community goals to guide its investments.
HSD works towards ensuring that all people have: - food to eat and a roof overhead; - supportive relationships within families, neighborhoods, and communities; - a safe haven from all forms of violence and abuse; - health care to be as physically and mentally fit as possible; and - the education and job skills to lead an independent life.
To accomplish these goals, HSD is organized into the following lines of business that encompass a continuum of care for the neediest populations: - Area Agency on Aging - Senior and Adult Self-Sufficiency - Child Development - Youth Development - Family Development - Children, Youth, and Family Resource Development - Emergency and Transitional Services - Community Facilities - Community Services System and Resource Development - Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention - Leadership and Administration The professionals who work at HSD are committed to working with the community to provide appropriate, culturally competent services.
Policy and Program Changes The Human Services Department (HSD) contracts with community-based organizations to provide programs and services to clients.
Approximately 72% of the Department's budget goes toward contracts with communitybased organizations.
Through this funding, HSD maintains a continuum of services, including crisis intervention, stabilization, and prevention programs.
HSD undertook an extensive community process in the spring of 2002 to allow input into categorizing services funded by the Department into core and non-core in order to provide a funding framework.
The community process yielded the Human Services Policy Framework, City of Seattle 2003 Adopted and 2004 Endorsed Budget 145
Human Services which identified core services that informed decision-making for the 2003 Adopted and 2004 Endorsed Budget.
Those services are as follows: 1.
Food banks and emergency meal programs 2.
Shelter, rent assistance, and transitional housing 3.
Domestic violence and sexual assault services 4.
Case management services that help to maintain the health of elders and people with disabilities 5.
Childcare subsidies that support working families and early learning programs that support child development and school readiness 6.
Utility assistance 7.
Intervention services for homeless and at-risk children and youth 8 Youth development, including programs that focus on academic achievement Illustrating the services categorized as non-core is the following list: 1.
Non-emergency meal programs 2.
Support services to maintain housing, including utility assistance 3.
Family support services, including support for teen parents, and citizenship and English as Second Language services for refugee and immigrant families 4.
Community programs for elders that increase nutrition and physical activity and reduce social isolation 5.
Domestic violence and sexual assault prevention education and training 6.
Senior wellness services 7.
Employment and training programs for youth and elders 8.
Educational programs for parents, children, and youth that build individual and family stability 9.
Human services supports that enable people to attain and maintain livable wage jobs Before any service reductions were made, HSD cut internal administration by 9%.
Another 3% was cut during budget deliberations.
Every effort was made to propose service reductions only in non-core areas, thereby maintaining, to the greatest extent possible, the current safety net.
In addition to specific service cuts, no cost-ofliving adjustments (COLA) are allocated in contracts with community-based organizations.
The effect of providing no COLA will vary depending on the agency.
In addition to this policy change, the designation applied to Human Services Program (HSP) resources is eliminated in this budget.
While that label suggests a revenue source other than the City's General Subfund (GSF), HSP resources are, and always have been, GSF resources.
The allocation of GSF includes those services that were previously funded under the HSP designation.

Human Services Leadership and Administration: Leadership Purpose Statement The purpose of the Leadership program is to provide vision, direction, planning, and coordination to the Department, other City departments, and the community, and to develop, strengthen, and expand relationships with our community partners so that human services are responsive to community needs and are delivered through efficient and effective systems.
Program Summary Reduce funds available for contracts with community-based organizations for advocacy and capacity building by 21%.
Contracts will be awarded for the first six months of 2003, and the Human Services Department will develop a competitive process for distributing the remaining funds.
While the 2002 level of advocacy and capacity building will be scaled back due to reduced funds, there is adequate funding remaining to sustain strategic advocacy efforts and maintain a strong non-profit infrastructure capacity.
See Council budget provisos for details.
Reduce planning capacity and various operating costs in Leadership; these cuts will affect the ability of the Director's Office to coordinate certain Department-wide issues and partnerships with community organizations.
Staff support will only be provided for mandated and top priority functions.
Increase General Subfund resources to Leadership to facilitate the effective use of the Community Development Fund (CDF).
The CDF, which is managed by a the non-profit Rainier Vally Community Development Fund, is a loan fund intended to lessen the impact of light rail on Rainier Valley businesses and property owners by providing business loans for relocation and improvements.
The loan fund, administered by the Office of Economic Development, requires the use of Community Development Block Grant Funds rather than General Subfund.
General Subfund for Leadership is increased but a corresponding entry under the Community Development Block Grant Program reduces Leadership by the same amount.
Transfer position from Office for Economic Development to Leadership.
This consolidates the administration of "Help for Working Families" into the Human Services Department.
Help for Working Families is a service that helps low- to moderate-income families enroll in public benefits for which they are eligible.
It provides a single point of contact and application for state- and city-funded public benefits, including utility rate assistance, Basic Health Plan and other low-cost insurance, food assistance, and child care subsidies.

Public Health Public Health - Seattle 
Department Description Public Health - Seattle and King County (Public Health) provides public health services that promote health and prevent disease throughout King County.
Administered by King County, Public Health serves all of King County, including the City of Seattle.
In partnership since 1951, the City of Seattle and King County jointly finance and operate a City-County Health Department.
The City's financial contributions to the Public Health Department are voluntary and are used to enhance health services to Seattle citizens.
With the support of the City of Seattle, Public Health provides a wide range of services targeted to populations largely under-served by the private health care system.
The Department's services are offered regardless of income and include: - prevention-focused primary care and dental services for "at-risk" and vulnerable populations; - family health care; - health care for teens in Seattle's public schools; - health care for homeless individuals and families in Seattle's shelters; - HIV/AIDS programs; - a nationally recognized tobacco prevention program; - specialized care for seniors who live in the downtown area; - programs to reduce the disparities in health between populations in Seattle; and - public health nursing care home visits to give mothers and babies a healthy start in life.
All Public Health employees are under the administration of King County.
Policy and Program Changes The budget for Public Health - Seattle and King County makes a General Subfund contribution of $9.7 million in 2003 and $6.5 million in 2004 to enhance public health services for residents of Seattle.
This represents a reduction from previous years' support and is proposed in the following context: 1) the Mayor is committed to support measures in the State legislature realizing the principle in State law that public health services are the responsibility of State and County governments; 2) in addition to assuming increases in patient-generated revenue, the Department continues to be successful in leveraging appropriate funding sources to pay for services previously covered by City funds; 3) the County has agreed through this biennium to substitute City General Subfund with regional revenue sources that continue services identified in the Joint Executive Committee agreement; and 4) funding for community health clinics (Community Health Center Partners) is reduced in light of the fact that they have enhanced Medicaid and Medicare rates; local, state, and federal grants; and managed care plans that were not available to the clinics when the City began subsidizing them nearly 30 years ago.
The City Council restored Community Health Center Partners funding pending the results of a Council Statement of Legislative Intent, as noted in the Council Changes and Budget Provisos below.

Public Health The Joint Executive Committee agreement was reached between the City and County to clarify provisions of their 1996 interlocal agreement, which specifies that King County has financial responsibility for basic or critical health services, commonly understood to be those formerly mandated by the State of Washington.
The City of Seattle provides voluntary contributions to enhance services above the critical service base.
In 2000, the County and the City undertook a study to determine compliance with the financial responsibility provisions of the interlocal agreement and mutually determined that City General Subfund was being used to fund $2 million in critical health services in 11 programs.
Based on those findings, the County agreed to supplant City funding for those services over a three-year period, so that by 2004, City money will be paying only for enhanced services to Seattle residents.
Public Health - Seattle and King County is challenged not only with reductions in General Subfund, but also diminishing resources from King County's general revenue used to fund county-wide services and the potential loss of State General Fund, money that replaced formerly allocated collections from the Motor Vehicle Excise Tax.
The Department eliminates all enhanced public health services, except for those supported by Seattle's General Subfund.
The Department has also made reductions in legally mandated and critical health programs to meet the County Executive's priorities in balancing the County budget.
City Council Budget Changes and Provisos Council increases the proposed 2003 budget for Community Health Center Partners by $1,630,333, yielding a total 2003 budget of $5,083,000.
Fifty percent is reserved in Finance General pending the review of the Community Health Center Partners' funding called for in a related Statement of Legislative Intent.
Council increases the proposed 2004 budget for Community Health Center Partners by $761,445, yielding a total 2004 budget of $3,697,438.
One hundred percent of the 2004 allocation is reserved in Finance General pending the results of the above-mentioned Statement of Legislative Intent.
Council adds funding to the Family Support Services for a two-nurse team to be added to the Best Beginnings Program.
This program provides nurse home visits to low-income, first-time teen mothers from pregnancy through age two.
Council restores funding at the 2002 Adopted Budget levels to the following programs: Alcohol 
Council reduces funding for Interpretation Services by 50% in 2003 and 100% in 2004.
Interpretation services are mandated by federal law, and consequently are a core health service and not an optional local enhancement.
By interlocal agreement, King County is responsible for core public health services and Seattle funding is for optional enhancements.
