May 9, 2001 Final Report
Executive Summary "Quality Metrics" is the term used to describe the analytical process for measuring and estimating future energy, environmental and economic benefits of US DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs.
This report focuses on the projected benefits of the forty-one (41) programs currently supported through the Office Of Transportation Technologies (OTT) under EE/RE.
For analytical purposes, these various benefits are subdivided in terms of Planning Units which are related to the OTT program structure.
The scope of this report encompasses light vehicles including passenger automobiles and class 1 
The range of light vehicle technologies investigated include flex-fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends) electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas-fueled, and stratified charge direct-injection.
The hybrid category is further split between two versions, one with twice the fuel economy of conventional vehicles (2X) and the other with three times the fuel economy (3X).
The fuel cell category is further subdivided between gasoline-fueled and hydrogen-fueled versions.
A future distribution of light vehicle sizes, applications, and performance levels is calculated based on current vehicle stocks and trends, and consumer preferences.
The heavy vehicle technologies investigated include hybrid, natural gas-fueled and advanced diesel.
The effects of advanced materials technologies across all vehicle types are also analyzed.
Analysis results quantify various national benefits including energy and petroleum consumption reductions, carbon emission reductions, criteria pollutant emissions reductions, and the associated economic impacts on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and jobs.
Benefit/cost analyses of the various technologies are also included.
The time focus of the analysis is from the present to the year 2030.
The programs currently conducted by OTT Offices are shown on the left side of Exhibit E-1.
OTT is composed of four line-offices managing many separate programs.
For Quality Metrics, OTT activities are aggregated into planning units based on specific program activities that are shown in the right side of Exhibit E-1.
Exhibit E-2 summarizes the specific vehicle technologies and alternative fuel that are evaluated under Quality Metrics.
Five light vehicle categories and four heavy vehicle categories are considered.
Each technology-vehicle category/type is analyzed separately as to when and how quickly the new technology can enter the market and its effects on energy use, the environment and the economy.
The estimated total effect of the OTT programs is then simply the sum of the individual effects.
A variety of analytical models are used to calculate the various projected OTT Program benefits.
Various analytical tools and models are used to develop the results produced in this report.
Outputs from some of these models become inputs to some of the others.
The relationships of the various models are shown in Exhibit E-3.

An example of the various technologies applied to one of the light vehicle categories (large cars) is shown in Exhibit E-4.
Note that the advanced technology attributes are normalized and presented as ratios to the conventional vehicle baseline attributes.
These attributes form the basis for the inputs to the VSCC Model.
A key output of the VSCC model is market penetrations of the technologies.
The projected market penetration of the combined light vehicle technologies is shown in Exhibit E-5.
Note that these technologies must not only compete with the conventional light vehicles they replace but also with each other.
A separate sensitivity study was also conducted in which each light vehicle technology was analyzed separately against conventional light vehicles in order to measure their maximum market penetration potential.
Based on the assumed vehicle technology attributes and the projected market penetrations, the energy and petroleum savings, energy cost savings and carbon emissions reductions attributable to each of the OTT Planning Units were calculated over the analysis period.
This comprises the main element of the Quality Metrics reporting requirements and is shown individually and totaled in Exhibit E-6.

October 18, 2001 Final Report
The projected effect of the OTT program on U.S. transportation system energy use is shown in Exhibit E7.
The petroleum "Gap" is defined here as the difference between transportation energy use and domestic petroleum production.
In the baseline case, note that the gap approaches 12 million barrels per day by Year 2020.
The OTT program impact is projected to reduce this shortfall by nearly 1.5 million barrels per day, or about twelve percent (12%).
About two thirds of this reduction is in the form of efficiency improvements.
The remaining third is obtained via substitution of non-petroleum energy sources.

Introduction Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this report is to describe the methodology and results obtained from a continuing DOE Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) activity to estimate future effects of OTT projects on national energy use, petroleum consumption, criteria emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and various measures of national income and employment.
Assumptions are made about the future costs and characteristics of alternative vehicles and fuels.
Computer models that take into account the value that vehicle buyers place on various vehicle characteristics are used to estimate the market penetration of new vehicle technologies.
A different set of assumptions would yield results that are different from what is presented here.
Analysis results quantify benefits including energy and petroleum reductions, carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, criteria pollutant emissions reductions, and the associated economic impacts on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and jobs.
Life-cycle cost analyses also are in progress to define advanced technology economic performance compared to conventional technology estimates.
The scope of this report addresses light vehicles including passenger automobiles, class 1 
The time focus of the analysis is from current conditions projected through the year 2030.
All energy savings start from baseline projections of transportation sector energy use obtained from the "Annual Energy Outlook," issued annually by the US Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (Ref. 1).
This analysis is based on conventional vehicle fuel economy and purchase price as designated for the "Large Car" in the AEO Annual Energy Outlook, although the other characteristics of the large car and of the other vehicle types have been generated from other sources The range of light vehicle technologies investigated includes battery electric, hybrid, fuel cell, advanced diesel (CIDI), natural gas-fueled, and stratified charge direct-injection (SIDI) prime movers.
Both conventional automotive fuels (gasoline and diesel fuel) and unconventional fuels (bio-derived fuels, natural gas and hydrogen) are investigated.
A representative distribution of light vehicle sizes, applications, and performance levels is postulated based on current and projected vehicle stocks and trends.
The heavy vehicle technologies investigated include hybrid, natural gas-fueled and advanced diesel power plants.
All of these light and heavy vehicle technologies are projected to become mature and grow significantly over the next two decades.
This report meets two programmatic purposes.
First, it constitutes the OTT final documentation for the Quality Metrics 2002 (QM 2002) analytical process of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE/RE).
Quality Metrics has been an active annual DOE EE/RE-wide analysis and review procedure since 1995.
QM seeks to monitor and measure the impacts of all DOE EE/RE programs and to summarize their overall national effects.
The Quality Metrics process is described in more detail in Section 1.2 below.
Second, this report serves as an internal OTT program management tool.
This report was initially developed to meet the reporting requirements set forth in the EPACT 2021 Report to OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002 -9May 9, 2001 Final Report
Congress in 1992 and has been since updated annually for internal reporting and management purposes (Ref. 2).
This dual purpose led OTT to the development of the analysis methodology, OTT Impacts Assessment, described in Section 1.3 below.
The report updates also reflect annual changes in the DOE/EIA Annual Energy Outlook and in OTT program structure, goals and milestones (Ref. 1).
Each publication includes projections for the budget year identified in the report title.
This specific issue is named QM 2002 because the impacts and benefits are consistent with the FY 2002 budget report to Congress.
1.2 Background-The EE/RE Quality Metrics Review Process
"Quality Metrics" evaluations are conducted annually in the U.S. DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to assess and project the energy and environmental benefits of EE/RE programs.
The Quality Metrics program of EE/RE and the preparation of the EPACT 2021 report to Congress led to the development of an impacts assessment methodology for the Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT), which is continually improved and updated.
Within OTT, the QM methodology is applied to four major functions.
Each function relates to an element of the transportation system associated with one or more of the technologies addressed by the OTT organizational structure.
Each major function is further subdivided into Planning Units that are separately analyzed.
An element may be a separate technology or a separate transportation sector or both.
The total energy savings and emissions reductions attributable to OTT programs is equal to the sum of the savings from each of these separate elements.
Planning Units are similar, but not identical to the OTT program structure.
The OTT Quality Metrics Functions and Planning Units are listed and described below: 1.
Technology Deployment: This area includes OTT projects that involve moving new technologies into the public and private sectors.
These include: EPAct Fleet Mandates and penetration of CNG vehicles in the household market.
2.
Fuels Development: This area involves the development of transportation system technologies to make use of some of the more promising fuels that may substitute for gasoline in the future.
These currently include biomass-based ethanol used in flexiblefuel vehicles and utilized in fuel blends.
3.
Vehicle Technologies R
Currently, this includes Light Vehicles (cars and Class 1 and 2 trucks) and Heavy Vehicle Technologies (Classes 3-6, 7

Â·
Â· Â·
4.
Materials Technologies: This area deals with more fundamental issues concerning the use of advanced materials in light and heavy vehicles.
Some of these (such as ceramics) promise higher engine efficiencies while others reduce structural weight and hence increase fuel economy.
The planning units include the following project areas: Â· Â· Light Vehicle Materials for electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles, and Heavy Vehicle Materials.
It is assumed that the electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle technologies will require the use of light weight materials to achieve program goals for fuel efficiency.
Prior Quality Metrics (QM 2001) analyses and results are described in Reference 3.
The Analytic Team has continued to improve the modeling process with improved market penetration modeling.
For QM 2002, the number and designation of light vehicle classes was maintained at five (5) as shown below: 1.
Small Cars (all other EPA size classes; 
Large Cars (EPA size classes Large and Midsize; 110 ft3 of passenger and luggage volume and larger, e.g., Dodge Stratus and larger).
The Large Car designation used here shares common fuel economy and cost assumptions with the conventional vehicle AEO Large Car designation.
3.
Minivans 4.
Sport Utility Vehicles and; 5.
Pickup trucks and large vans.
It is the intent of this analysis that these vehicle classes be utilized as building blocks to produce a reasonable simulation of the current and projected light vehicle fleet in the U.S. over the next three decades.

1.3
Background-The Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT)
The OTT seeks to develop and promote advanced highway transportation vehicles, systems and alternative fuel use technologies that lead to reduced imported oil, lower regulated emissions and reduced emission of atmospheric gases that may add to the greenhouse effect.
To these ends, OTT develops partnerships with elements of the domestic transportation industry and private and public research and development organizations.
The analytic impacts methodology is referred to as "OTT Impacts Assessment."
The scope of the OTT Impacts Assessment contains analyses that supplement those required by QM.
These include: Â· Comprehensive end-use criteria and carbon pollutant reductions (QM requires carbon as a CO2 equivalent, hydrocarbon, CO, and NOx reduction benefits only); - OTT Impacts consider the fuel cycle carbon savings (QM benefits are limited to the end-use, fuel economy benefits); Â· Â· Â· Gross Domestic Product/Jobs (in the QM process, macroeconomic effects are determined by others); Cost analyses, including the capital/infrastructure estimates, and oil security cost valuations; and The determination of benefit to cost ratios for the target technologies.
All OTT functions and projects are subdivided among four (4) functions: Â· Â· Fuels Development strives to increase the use of biologically-derived fuels in highway vehicle applications.
Advanced Vehicle Technologies develops advanced technologies for automobiles and other light vehicles including electric and hybrid technologies, advanced heat engines, alternative fuels utilization, and advanced high strength/lightweight materials.
The office also works on technologies applied to heavy duty trucks and buses, and other large highway vehicles.
Materials Technologies explore the potential for petroleum conservation through the development and application of materials technologies that enable propulsion systems with high energy efficiency, and vehicle structures that reduce weight.
Technology Utilization works to develop and promote user acceptance of advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels within the U.S. highway vehicle transportation sector.

Technical Analysis Overview Background
The analysis process involves the following four activities: 1) Definition of vehicle characteristics for advanced technologies; 2) Market penetration analysis estimated by vehicle size class; 3) Energy savings, petroleum displacement, environmental and economic benefits quantification via motive source and vehicle efficiency improvements and alternative fuel use; and 4) Development of summary documentation.
The time frame for the study spans the present to 2030.
2.2 Vehicle/Technology/Fuel Baseline Assumptions
The fuel and vehicle characteristics can be considered in three categories: fuel attributes, light vehicle attributes and heavy vehicle attributes.
These attributes are defined by program staff and are subjected to external peer review.
All of these vehicle attributes are tracked since they have been identified as pertinent variables in people's vehicle purchase decisions.
The light and heavy attributes for conventional vehicles used in this analysis are presented in Exhibit 2-1.
Note that there are five classes of light vehicles and two "class groupings" of heavy vehicles with three market segments of class 7 
Heavy vehicle costs are in the form of incremental costs and are discussed in Section 3.2.

2.3 Vehicle Attributes 2.3.1 Light Vehicle Attributes The five classes of light vehicles areas follows: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Small Car Large Car Minivan Sport Utility Vehicle Pickup Truck/Large Van
The various technology options considered are as follows: Light Vehicles: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Advanced Diesel-Compression Ignition/Direct Injection (CIDI-Diesel) Electric (battery) Flex-Fuel (gasoline/alcohol) Hybrid-Electric (battery/gasoline-2x and 3x versions(1 Fuel Cell (gasoline and hydrogen) Natural Gas-Fueled Stratified Charge Direct-Injection (SIDI) )
(1) Two HEV light vehicles are postulated, one with twice the fuel economy of conventional autos and the other with three times the fuel economy.
These constant ratios are maintained over time.
The vehicle attributes summaries for the five light vehicle classes are indicated in Exhibits 2-2 through 2-6.
Conventional vehicle attributes are projected to change with time.
For example, purchase price is expected to escalate in real terms (See Appendix Table A-29).
Flex alcohol vehicles also are considered in the analysis, but these vehicles are assumed to have the same attributes as the conventional vehicles.
The reference year for conventional vehicles attributes is 1996.
Fuel economy values are assumed to be "Combined Cycle" values (fifty-five percent (55%) City Cycle and forty-five percent (45%) Highway Cycle per EPA emissions certification test data).

(1) Technology ratio = Value of parameter for the technologh/Value for the conventional vehicle in the same year.
The exhibits show year of technology introduction (Initial) and final values in year 2030.
Timing of technology maturity varies due to the complexity of the technologies and is determined by OTT Program Manager input as well as goals set forth by the offices.
Changes in attributes can be assumed to occur non-linearly during the analysis period; e.g. significant improvements may occur shortly after introduction with lesser changes occurring in later years.
In some cases, the technology may be assumed to be commercially mature from the time when it is introduced into the vehicle class.
Years of introduction vary among the car and truck size classes to account for market growth and development.
As Exhibits 2-2 through 2-6 indicate, in some cases, technology characteristics also vary among the size classes both for conventional gasoline and alternative technologies.

2.4 Summary of Modeling Assumptions and Structures
The modeling process is illustrated in Exhibit 2-7.
The vehicle attributes for the advanced technologies are input into the vehicle choice model and emissions models.
The light vehicle choice model then estimates market penetration by size class.
The emissions model estimates tailpipe and upstream emissions on a grams per mile basis for each technology.
For light vehicles, the market penetrations and emissions rates are then input into a model that is based on the Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies, or IMPACTT, the vehicle stock/energy/emission model.
Finally, energy and vehicle stock information is input into the economic model to estimate GDP and jobs impacts.
The heavy vehicle choice model estimates market penetration by market class.
For heavy vehicles, the market penetrations are used to calculate benefits, then energy and vehicle stock information is input into the economic model to estimate GDP and jobs impacts.

2.4.1
VSCC Model
Vehicle Size/Consumer Choice Model The VSCC Model is an excel-based spreadsheet m penetration of light vehicles with new technologies based of those technologies such as cost, fuel economy, range, calculates alternative fuel consumption and incremental technology vehicles.
Inputs: The model, as now operated, has a universe of five (5) light vehicle types/sizes: large car, small car, sport utility vehicle, minivan and pickup truck/large van.
It also has seven (7) technology groupings: conventional (gasoline-fueled, spark ignition), CIDI, electric, hybrid-electric, fuel cell, natural gas fueled (spark ignition), and SIDI.
More technologies could be added.
The choice among technologies is made by a logit model that has influence coefficients determined in a national survey (Ref. 4).
The model includes influence coefficients for purchase price, range, maintenance cost, 0-30 mph acceleration time, top speed, luggage space, fuel cost ($/mi), whether home refueling is available, whether multiple fuels are available, whether or not the vehicle can use gasoline and the gasoline range.
In addition, fuel-specific factors and alternative fuel availability are also part of the evaluation process.
A more detailed discussion of the VSCC Model can be found in Section 3.1 2.4.2 IMPACTT Model odel that predicts the future market on the measured or estimated attributes and maintenance cost.
The model also costs borne by purchasers of advanced
Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies The IMPACTT model is a spreadsheet model developed by Marianne Mintz of ANL that calculates the effects of advanced-technology vehicles and market penetration on baseline fuel use and emissions.
For QM analysis purposes, it has been modified to accept the market penetration data output from the VSCC model and determine the vehicle stock and miles traveled as a function of time for each technology.
In addition, it calculates fuel use and emissions reduction effects using EPA Mobil 5A and GREET Models.
A more detailed discussion of the IMPACTT Model can be found in Section 4.1.1.
2.4.3 GREET Model Â­ Version 1.5
Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy in Transportation Model GREET is an analytical tool developed by Michael Wang of ANL for estimating criteria and greenhouse gas emissions.
It calculates total fuel cycle emissions from feedstock extraction through final combustion.
It includes both light and heavy vehicles.
It has the capability of analyzing up to sixteen (16) fuel cycles and twelve (12) vehicle technology/fuel combinations.

more detailed discussion of the GREET Model can be found in Section 4.2.4.
2.4.4 HVMP Model
The Heavy Vehicle Market Penetration Model serves the same purpose as the VSCC model except that it applies to potential market impacts of new technologies in the medium and heavy truck transportation sectors.
This sector is subdivided into two categories with classes 7 
Historical market penetration data for energy conservation technologies were used to calibrate the model.
Cost effectiveness of the energy conservation investment is considered a prime determinant in its introduction and growth rate.
A more detailed discussion of the HVMP Model can be found in Section 3.2.
2.4.5 ESM Model
The Economic Spreadsheet Model developed by NREL calculates the employment effects of the OTT programs by industry sector for each OTT technology.
A more detailed discussion of the ESM Model can be found in Section 4.2.1.
2.4.6 Other Calculations
As required, off-line market penetration and benefits analysis is required.
Examples are ZEVs and alternative fuel vehicles commercialized under EPAct "Fleet" provisions.
In addition to all of the above models and calculations, results from the IMPACTT model are used to calculate infrastructure incremental capital requirements for the vehicle manufacturing industry and energy cost reductions from OTT technologies.

Vehicle Choice Analysis
Vehicle choice analysis is used to develop market penetration estimates of advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles.
These market penetration estimates provide the basis for estimating the future energy, environmental, and economic benefits associated with OTT programs.
Models to estimate consumer behavior have been developed are described below, as well as the market penetration results.
3.1 Light Vehicles
Vehicle Size/Consumer Choice Model The VSCC model was developed to define the successful introduction of technologies in light vehicles by vehicle size class.
This modeling exercise acknowledges that the introduction of advanced technologies is a gradual one.
The VSCC model is a discrete choice, multi-attribute logit model designed to simulate the household market for alternative-fuel light vehicles.
Light vehicle fleet purchase decisions are assumed to be similar to the household market.
Subsequent analyses will account for any observed differences between household and fleet preferences in the future when such survey data become available.
The model forecasts, through the year 2030, the future sales of conventional and alternatively fueled light vehicles by size class, technology and fuel type.
Market penetration estimates are based on consumer derived utilities related to vehicle attributes that are associated with the different alternative fuels and advanced propulsion technologies.
As such, the model is "household" based.
Other market sectors are considered in various "off-line" calculations.
The vehicle demand function used in this model is based on the utility-maximization theory in which the consumer demand for alternative vehicles is defined as a function of the attributes of these vehicles and the fuels they use.
The total utility of each light vehicle technology and fuel makeup is determined by the sum of the attribute utilities of that vehicle for each size class.
The size class market share penetration estimates for the different technologies are a function of each technology's total utility compared to the total utility of other vehicles and technologies in that size class.
The technology's total utility is calculated by summing attribute input values that have been multiplied by their corresponding coefficient The attributes of conventional and alternative vehicle technologies were defined for five vehicle classes: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· small car large car minivan sport utility vehicle pickup and large van.
Technologies considered include: OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002 - 25 May 9, 2001 Final Report
Â·
Conventional -- spark ignition, gasoline.
This baseline technology is assumed to improve slightly through technological innovation and weight reductions to yield a fuel economy improvement of about 7.2% by yr. 2030 compared to yr. 2000.
Advanced Diesel-compression-ignition, direct-injection (CIDI) Â­ which offers at least a thirty-five percent (35%) fuel economy improvement with the same tailpipe emissions as conventional gasoline vehicles of the same year.
This emissions performance assumption is significant, given historical experience that diesel engines pollute more than comparable gasoline-fueled, spark ignition engines.
Hybrid-Electric Â­ grid-independent, parallel or series configuration, using gasoline.
Fuel cell Â­ proton exchange membrane, fueled with gasoline, ethanol or hydrogen.
Currently, gasoline and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are modeled.
Additional fuel cell fueling options (e.g. methanol) are under consideration for investigation during the next analysis year.
Natural gas Â­ spark ignition-powered vehicle, similar to Conventional, but fueled with natural gas (CNG Dedicated).
SIDI Â­ spark ignited vehicle with gasoline injected directly into the combustion chamber.
This technology also is referred to as spark-ignition direct injection.
Electric Vehicles Flex-fuel vehicles which run on a wide mixture range of gasoline and ethanol.

It was assumed that all technologies apply to all vehicle classes.
LPG and methanol were not considered in this analysis because: 1) OTT conducts minimal R
As a result, replacing imported petroleum with imported LPG or methanol would not help the U.S. balance of trade.
Note that the values presented are intended to project the relative effects of the only.
Therefore, other market effects outside of OTT's purview (conventional light vehicles, methanol fuel, other fuels, etc.) are not factored-in.
Therefore, the should not be used in external comparisons; only the relative change numbers are OTT programs diesel-powered totalized values valid.
Of principal concern to the analysis is the alternative vehicle fuel economy, cost, relative range and maintenance cost in comparison to conventional vehicles.
Fuel economy ratio assumptions are indicated in Exhibit 3-1.
For this year, two fuel cell fueling options are considered; gasoline

and hydrogen.
The baseline Large Car gasoline-fueled fuel cell vehicle exhibits an initial fuel economy ratio of 2.0 increasing to 3.0 at the end of the analysis period.
For the hydrogen option, these same values are 2.2 and 3.0 reflecting a higher initial fuel economy due to the absence of the gasoline reforming step.
The cost ratios are shown in Exhibit 3-2.
Exhibit 3-3 shows the comparison of relative ranges.
Exhibit 3-4 shows the comparison of relative maintenance.
As indicated in Exhibit 3-1, the electric, CIDI, hybrid-electric, and fuel cell vehicles have significantly better fuel economies than conventional vehicles.
All technology fuel economy ratios are applicable to the point of use, including electric vehicles, which reflect comparisons at the plug and the fuel tanks.
The cost comparison indicates that the non-conventional vehicle technologies are consistently more expensive than conventional with SIDI being the least expensive.
When comparing ranges, electric and natural gas-fueled vehicles are found to have significant range penalties.
CIDI vehicles however, have a range benefit, due in part to the higher volumetric energy content of diesel fuel compared with gasoline.
Maintenance costs differ substantially from conventional vehicles with ratios ranging from 0.6 to 1.10.

The analyses show that at aggressive market penetration rates, advanced technologies will comprise more than half (62.2%) of light vehicle sales by 2010.
In fact, advanced vehicle technologies reach seventy five percent (75.2%) aggregate market penetration in 2020 although stock of advanced vehicles in 2020 is just over fifty five percent (55.2%) as shown in Exhibit 3-5.
By 2030, the alternative light vehicle sales are projected to constitute 82.9% of sales and 74.1% of stocks.
(See Appendix A, Table A8).
Exhibit 3-6 is a graph developed from the same sales data in Exhibit 3-5.
Exhibits 3-7 through 3-11 are graphical representations of the market penetration of each vehicle class.
In 2010, Advanced Diesel vehicles comprise the largest percentage (35%) of alternative small cars (Exhibit 3-7).
This share is reduced to twenty eight percent (28%) by 2030.
Hybrids with 2X fuel economy and SIDI reach nineteen percent (19%) and twenty one percent (21%), respectively, in 2010, with 2X-Hybrids reducing slightly by 2030 to 18%, being partly supplanted by 3X hybrids.
SIDI loses a more considerable market share to 14% over the same period.
As shown in Exhibit 3-8, the scenario for alternative large car penetration indicates that hybrid cars reach ten percent (10%) in 2010, and SIDI is at seventeen percent (17%) in 2010.
As shown in Exhibit 3-9, Advanced Diesel is the best performer in the minivan class, reaching more than thiry percent (30%) market share by 2030.

Exhibit 3-9: Market Penetration of Minivan Technologies
Exhibit 3-10 shows that sport utility buyers are highly receptive to 2X Hybrid, SIDI and Advanced Diesel technologies, which perform well from 2010 through 2030.
Flex alcohol and hybrids also show lower but still significant market potential.
Advanced Diesel and SIDI tend to dominate the pickup and large van market in 2010 with Advanced Diesel fading from importance in 2020 and later due to the rapidly growing popularity of the 2X Hybrid as indicated in Exhibit 3-11.
Pickup and large van SIDI holds prominence at about 20% market share through the entire analysis period, fading only slightly.

Heavy Vehicles
The Heavy Vehicle Market Penetration Model (HVMP) was developed to estimate the potential market impacts of new technologies on the medium and heavy truck market as follows.
Â· Â· Medium - Classes 3 through 6 and, Heavy - Classes 7 and 8 are further subdivided by end-use characteristics:
- Type 1 Â­ multi-stop, step van, beverage, utility, winch, crane, wrecker, logging, pipe, garbage collection, dump, and concrete delivery; - Type 2 Â­ platform, livestock, auto transport, oil-field, grain, and tank; OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002 - 34 -
May 9, 2001 Final Report
- Type 3 Â­ refrigerated van, drop frame van, open top van, and basic enclosed van.
The HVMP was configured using the 1997 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (Ref. 6).
Data were examined for all vehicles in use and vehicles two years old or less.
The HVMP model utilizes the data constructed from the two years old or less data base.
The heavy vehicle market was analyzed to develop market segments with similar operation and use patterns.
Refueling and travel characteristics were specifically addressed by vehicle body type and major use classification for the two market segments.
Heavy vehicle characteristics are summarized in Exhibit 3-15.
In the medium truck market segment (Classes 3 through 6), all vehicle types, with the exception of auto transport, on average travel about 20,000 miles per year.
Heavy trucks, depending on type, travel an average of 40,000 miles to 92,000 miles per year.
One of the more interesting findings was the significant difference in fuel economy among the vehicle types with Type 3 heavy vehicles exhibiting an average fuel economy nearly twice as high as Type 1 heavy vehicles (8.90 vs 4.55 MPG).

Percent Centrally Refueled(1) 40.1% 59.8% 41.0% 42.0%
In the HVMP model, the truck classes are further segmented according to refueling location (i.e. central or multiple locations).
As shown in Exhibit 3-15, all vehicle segments have central refueling occurring at least forty percent (40.1%) of the time.
As vehicles age, central refueling declines.
This may be explained by the transition from larger fleet operations to small independent owner operators as centrally refueled vehicles age.
Overall market characteristics for vehicle stock, travel, and fuel use were also examined using the VIUS data (Exhibit 3-16).
The data revealed that although medium trucks account for almost forty-one percent (40.51%) of the combined medium and heavy vehicle stock, they account for just over sixteen percent (16.25%) of vehicle miles traveled and fourteen percent (14.09%) of fuel use.
As expected, the data show that Class 7
It is also important to note that Type 3 vehicles show the greatest utilization, accounting for fifty percent (50.4%) of all fuel use and

fifty-eight percent (58.13%) of all travel in the heavy vehicle market, while accounting for only thirty-five percent (35.45%) of the stock.
In addition to the market characterization, historical market penetration data was obtained from VIUS surveys for energy conserving technologies including radial tires, aerodynamic devices, and fan clutches.
This data was utilized in the calibration of the rate of efficiency technology adoption in the model.

The HVMP model estimates market penetration based on cost effectiveness of the new technology.
Cost effectiveness is measured as the incremental cost of the new technology less the discounted expected energy savings of that technology over a specified time period.
Exhibit 3-17 shows the payback distribution assumed in the HVMP model.
This payback distribution was generated using data taken from a survey of 224 motor carriers conducted by the American Trucking Association.
(Ref. 7) Exhibit 3-17: Heavy Vehicle Payback Periods Number of Years 1 2 3 4 Percent of Motor Carriers 16.4% 61.7% 15.5% 6 .4 %
The new technology cost and the expected efficiency improvements are exogenous inputs.
Energy savings are calculated using the following data and assumptions: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Annual vehicle miles traveled; Fuel efficiency (mpg) without new technology (Ref. 6); Fuel efficiency (mpg) with new technology; Projected fuel price Â­ diesel, ethanol, and CNG (Ref. 8); Incremental cost of new technology over time (economies of scale); Discount rate; and - 36 May 9, 2001 Final Report

Payback period.
Eleven travel distance categories for medium trucks and twenty-one (21) for heavy trucks are represented in the model.
These categories were determined using travel distributions developed with the VIUS data by ORNL (Ref. 9).
Graphs of the actual data are shown for each market segment, with central refueling and not-central refueling shown separately.
All results have been reduced to eleven distance categories for presentation.
As Exhibits 3-18 and 3-19 show, the majority of medium trucks travel less than 40,000 miles per year, with about sixty percent (59.9%) in the non-centrally refueled portion.
Note that the percentages on the central and non-central refueling exhibits must be added to characterize 100% of the vehicle market.

As shown in Exhibits 3-22 and 3-23, the Type 2 vehicle travel distribution shows travel peaks at both the upper and middle ranges.
Further analysis may reveal that some vehicle types in this segment may fit better in the Type 1 or Type 3 segment.
As expected, travel in this market segment increases significantly for both the central and non-centrally fueled vehicles.

Exhibit 3-27 illustrates market penetration forecasts for heavy vehicles.
For the assumptions utilized, the natural gas truck characteristics are not economically competitive except in the year 2000 in Class 7 and 8 trucks.
Advanced diesel technology has the best penetration in Type 3 trucks, which also have the greatest utilization level in terms of miles driven per year.
Penetration in Type 2 trucks is also significant.

3.3 Stand-Alone Technologies Implicit in the market penetration analysis for light vehicles to this point is the assumption that all of the advanced vehicle technologies being investigated will enter the market and compete not only with conventional light vehicles but also with each other.
This reduces the potential sales and resulting vehicle stocks of any one of the advanced vehicle technologies investigated.
In an effort to gauge the effects of this inter-technology competition, the VSCC model was rerun for five separate technologies and three sub-combinations of technologies, as described below in Exhibit 2-28.

Stand-alone runs for the Flex Fuel and CNG technologies were not executed since limited fuel availability would prevent their widespread use.
As expected, this added restriction greatly increases the potential energy and petroleum savings, fuel costs and carbon reductions ascribed to each of the technologies and sub-combinations.
The five separate technologies are shown in Exhibits 3-29 through 3-33.
The primary energy displaced, primary oil displaced, energy cost savings, and carbon reductions of each of the OTT technologies and for each of the applicable OTT Planning Units taken separately are compared with the same estimated when all technologies are allowed to freely compete with each other.

The savings for the Materials Technology Planning Unit are combined and shown in Exhibit 334.
These values do not include heavy vehicles.
The grand total savings for all technologies over all planning units are presented in Exhibit 3-35 and include all light and heavy vehicles.
It is noted that the heavy vehicle parameter values are constant across all stand-alone scenarios presented.
Note that there is a substantial increase in the potential market penetration of any given technology when it is assumed to be competing only with the conventional technology.
For instance, in Year 2030, the primary energy savings attributable to stand-alone HEVs are about 2.4 times higher than when HEV's are forced to naturally compete with all of the other seven technologies considered The total savings for all planning units for each technology stand-alone are compared with the total QM 2002 savings when all technologies are permitted to compete with each other is shown in Exhibit 3-35 for Year 2030 estimates.
The total savings of the combined technologies is greater than any of the individual stand-alone savings with one exception: Hybrid Vehicles.
The HEV technology would end up saving more energy, petroleum and carbon if it were the only available new technology.

(1) The value attributed to the all vehicle technologies combined in competition with each other.
(2) The value attributed to the all vehicle technologies combined except advanced diesel.
Note that the lack of an advanced combustion technologies option results in a small reduction in the energy and oil savings during the early years when this option initially becomes available.
However, in the later years, the savings without the advanced combustion technologies is greater as the higher technology vehicles (3X hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) replace what would have been lower-efficiency SI and CI power plants.
Energy cost savings and carbon reductions are drastically increased in the out years due to the removal of the SI/CI option.
3.3.2 Sensitivity Study: Fuel Price/Technology Cost Changes
Recent increases in fossil fuel prices have created interest in gauging the effects of possible future increases in gasoline and diesel retail prices on the introduction rates of the selected slate of alternate technologies and their projected effects on petroleum and energy savings, energy cost savings and carbon savings.
In the first study, it was assumed that the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel double over the baseline (AEO) assumptions.
In the second study, the incremental costs of the alternative technologies were halved.
The results of these forced changes in input assumptions are shown in Exhibit 3-37.

In the case of the doubling of petroleum prices, note that energy savings are not affected substantially but that primary oil savings are substantially affected, as more alternative vehicles use non-petroleum fuels.
The energy cost savings is also greatly enhanced, although the carbon reduction potential is about the same.
In the case of a halving of the advanced technology incremental cost, the only substantial effect is an increase in petroleum displacement as more non-petroleum vehicles come on-line.
Otherwise, the effects of such a seemingly substantial change are rather subdued.

Alternative fuel demand is estimated as the amount of fuel required by dedicated fuel vehicles plus fuel demanded by multifuel and flex-fuel vehicles.
Alternative fuel choice for multifuel and flex-fuel vehicles is estimated using consumer derived utility values associated with the attributes of the fuel.
The fuel attributes include: Â· Â· Â· Fuel price in dollars per gallon of gasoline equivalent (125,000 BTU-HHV); Fuel availability (percent of stations offering the fuel); and Vehicle range associated with the use of that fuel.
Exhibit 4-1 shows the amount of fuel demanded by flex-fuel vehicles and the use of fuel blends.
The exhibit summarizes a detailed year-by-year estimate of biofuel demand for each technology which is presented in Appendix A. Fuel demand is constrained to match supply as indicated in the Exhibit.
Ethanol is used in fuel blends in order to meet EPA requirements such as Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) and winter oxygenation, or to reduce petroleum consumption even in regions of the U.S. that need no RFG or oxygenated fuel.
4.1.2 Fuel Choice for Flex-Fuel Vehicles
Alternative fuel consumer utility values are compared to values for conventional fuels, when fuel choice estimations are made.
Exhibit 4-2 shows the market share that an alternative fuel will achieve given a specified price and availability relative to gasoline.
This graph illustrates the relationship between fuel availability and fuel price.
For example, at fifty percent (50%) availability and a zero cost increment, the alternative fuel should be chosen forty-five percent (45%) of the time (Point A).
If the price increment is decreased twenty percent (20%), it is estimated the alternative fuel will be chosen nearly 90% of the time (Point B).
Whereas, if fuel availability is increased to seventy percent (70%) only marginal increases in alternative fuel selection occur (to 49% at Point C).
The calculations for this graph assume no range penalty for using the alternative fuel.

4.1.3 Estimates of the Value of Reducing Imported Oil Many researchers have developed estimates of the magnitude and cause of cost premiums associated with importing oil.
The oil import premium exists because the market price of oil does not cover the societal cost incurred by importing.
In order to calculate the value of an alternative to imported oil, one must add the market price of oil to the import premium.
The "categories" of the oil import premiums, the rationale for including an oil import premium, and the range of estimates for the value of the oil import premium are explained in this section.
Definitions of the Components of an Imported Oil Premium Externalities associated with imported oil can be defined as follows: demand costs ("market power" or monopsony effects, plus indirect effects such as inflation and balance of payments), disruption costs (economic losses due to price spikes), direct military costs (expenditures to maintain a military presence in oil producing regions), and environmental costs (costs due to oil spills and other environmental problems associated with importing oil).
The demand and disruption costs are the most commonly used measure of an oil import premium (Ref. 14).
Demand costs can be broken into a direct and indirect component.
The direct component is known as the "market power" or monopsony effects.
Monopsony costs occur when the increase in the demand for imported oil causes world oil prices to rise, thus increasing the costs of all imports, not just the incremental demand.
Not only is the added cost borne by the demander responsible for the increase, but by all importers equally.
The market power premium can be OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002 - 53 May 9, 2001 Final Report
illustrated by a simple example.
Suppose the U.S. were importing 5.5 million barrels of oil a day at a price of $30 per barrel.
Then the daily import bill would be $165 million.
If increasing imports to 6.0 million barrels per day causes prices to rise to $31 per barrel, the daily import bill becomes $186 million.
In this situation, the importing country bears an additional cost of $21 million per day in order to import an additional 0.5 million barrels per day.
The cost to the economy is $42 per additional barrel of oil imported.
Since the individual oil importers initially pay only $30 per barrel, the remainder -- $12 per barrel -- is a cost not borne by those who decide to import more oil.
In this case, the market power premium is $12 per barrel.
Indirect costs are the macroeconomic costs of importing oil such as inflation impacts, lowering the level of savings, and terms of trade impacts.
Imported oil bills increase the current account deficit in the U.S. balance of trade, leading to an excess supply of U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and thus lowering the buying power of U.S. consumers.
Higher imported oil costs can lead to "structural" inflation that leads to adverse macroeconomic conditions.
Disruption or "security" costs can also be broken into direct and indirect components.
The direct component is similar to the above direct component because it is the monopsony affect that occurs when prices increase due to a disruption.
The indirect, or macroeconomic, component of disruption costs are associated with the depressed aggregate demand caused by the disruption and the accompanying higher inflation and unemployment.
The demand and disruption costs are traditional components of the calculation of an oil import premium.
Somewhat untraditional and harder to quantify, additional components of the oil import premium are direct military expenditures and environmental costs.
The military expenditures are some fraction of the costs to the U.S. to maintain a military presence in the Middle East to ensure continued access to oil.
The environmental costs are less straightforward - they primarily include the costs of oil spills and emissions from oil combustion.
At this time, we have no estimates of the environmental costs.
There are a variety of estimates of military costs based on the amount of military resources dedicated to the Persian Gulf region.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory recently conducted a literature review and assessment of military costs to assure the supply of oil imports to the U.S.
The total estimated cost of defending the Middle East Oil supplies is estimated to be about $32 billion per year in Reference 15.
This is a difficult value to estimate, since it must be calculated based on allocations of costs to meet various needs.
In this respect there is no "real" military cost other than that which is allocated and all allocation schemes are highly subjective.
The range of estimates reviewed by Reference 15 is about a factor of ten.
The military cost of Middle East oil is borne by all and it is therefore reasonable to assign this cost to all petroleum consumed in the country whether from domestic, OPEC, non-OPEC or Middle East sources.
Since the total U.S. petroleum demand is about thirty-nine (39) Quads or about 6.7 billion barrels per year, the "effective" cost of the military support of the Middle East allocated over all petroleum is about $4.78 per barrel.
For purposes of this analysis, a benchmark "military cost" charge of $5.00 per barrel (about eleven (11) cents per gallon of gasoline) has been assumed.

Range of Estimates of Imported Oil Premium Exhibit 4-3 identifies a range of estimates of an oil import premium (the market price of oil plus the oil import premium equals the value of reducing oil imports).
They range from $1 to $225 depending on what is included in the estimate, the price of oil, and other assumptions.
These values do not indicate whether or not the price of imported oil has an impact on its premium.

Impacts of Imported Oil The economic literature suggests that there are indirect economic costs and economic security costs associated with imported oil at prices influenced by a cartel.
These costs are not captured in the gross domestic product (GDP) estimates from the economic models that are used in our analysis.
Therefore, these costs need to be subtracted from any GDP estimate.
Several types of costs are not captured in the standard economic valuations.
These are: Â· Â· Demand costs that are caused by the oil price increases that will occur when U.S. demand increases.
This will have an effect on GDP.
Disruption costs which reflect the expected economic costs of sudden shifts in oil price or availability due to possible political unrest in the Mid-East.
Also, unpredictable oil costs

tend to suppress innovations that might otherwise have been implemented, thereby reducing petroleum consumption.
Â· Other costs which include the military costs of protecting Mid-East oil supplies and environmental costs associated with foreign oil production and transport.
The suggested cost associated with the use of imported oil, based on a subjective evaluation of the alternative estimates (Exhibit 4-3), and placing greater weight on estimates since 1990, is a nominal $5/barrel ($1996).
This cost is in addition to the military cost of $5/barrel discussed previously.
4.1.4 Petroleum Reduction Estimates
Exhibit 4-4 shows the energy and oil that will be displaced as a result of the OTT programs discussed in this report.
It can be seen that the total oil displacement that will occur in the year 2030 is about 3.1 million barrels per day; about 16% of the projected total transporation energy use.

Economic and Environmental Benefits Analysis Results
In this section, economic and environmental benefits analyses are presented.
The scope of the OTT Impacts Assessments contains analyses that supplement those required by QM.
These include total fuel cycle criteria and carbon pollutant reductions, while QM requires direct carbon, hydrocarbon, CO, and NOx reduction benefits only.
The Economic Spreadsheet Model (ESM), a spreadsheet model that estimates employment impacts of OTT's programs, is described first.
The next section describes the methodology for estimating vehicle infrastructure capital requirements.
The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) Model, an analytic tool for evaluating emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases also is summarized.
The next section concerns criteria pollutant emissions reduction values.
Finally, estimating reductions in carbon emissions from the commercial utilization of OTT-sponsored technologies is discussed.
4.2.1 Economic Benefit Estimates
The ESM is a spreadsheet model that estimates employment impacts of OTT's programs.
The spreadsheet takes economic impacts from the Quality Metrics process and applies them to economic multipliers, developed with Department of Commerce data, to estimate employment impacts of OTT technologies.
Key inputs to the model are: 1) incremental vehicle cost of OTT technologies (if any); 2) money spent on alternative fuels associated with OTT's technologies; and 3) money saved from decreased spending on gasoline or diesel.
Exhibit 4-8 shows a summary of job impacts by sector of the economy.
The multipliers used to provide these numbers are industry specific at an aggregate level.
The multipliers are derived from the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce.
They are based on an aggregate U.S. industry structure and updated with 1995 regional data.
A detailed analysis of how the multipliers were calculated can be obtained from Reference 32.
The multipliers are used to calculate net jobs and GDP by multiplying them with the spending quantities associated with the advanced technologies.
Expenditures considered are: Â· Â· Â· Â· spending on vehicles; decreased spending on oil; fuel cost savings; and increased spending on alternative fuels.

May 9, 2001 Final Report
Exhibit 4-7 shows that the mining industry loses jobs while most other industries gain jobs.
Advanced transportation technologies create jobs, in large part, because they induce spending in areas with larger multipliers than areas where spending would have occurred.
The mining industry loses jobs because the reduced spending on oil affects the mining industry more than other industries.
Job impacts attributable to the individual technologies fostered by OTT are indicated in Exhibit 4-8.

The increase in GDP is shown in Exhibit 4-9.
Like the increase in jobs, the increase in GDP was calculated by applying the multipliers discussed above and in Appendix C. While the impact on GDP appears to be large, compared to the baseline, it represents an effect of less than one percent (1%).

4.2.2
Vehicle Infrastructure Capital Requirements
This section describes the methodology for estimating vehicle infrastructure capital requirements.
The basic methodology, rationale for production volume cost estimates, and capital constraints of auto manufacturers are addressed.
A rough estimate of capital investment necessary to produce advanced light vehicles was made.
The methodology consists of three (3) steps: 1.
2.
3.
Estimate vehicles sold per technology by year; Estimate production facility costs on a volume basis by technology; Apply the production facility cost factor to vehicle sales that exceed the sales in the previous year for each technology.
Step 1 is based on the vehicle choice model results--the vehicle choice model provides sales estimates by technology per year.
Step 2 is from empirical data and is discussed in more detail below.
Step 3 is a simple way to estimate the incremental costs.
In general, it is anticipated that a minimum of 300,000 vehicle sales per year are required in order for the production of an advanced technology or alternative fuel vehicle to be sustained.
Production Facility Costs To estimate production facility costs, some recent estimates to develop new car lines were reviewed.
Examples used include (Refs. 16-22): Â· Â· Saturn production plant costs of $4.5 billion to produce 500,000 vehicles per year.
Ford Contour costs to retool nine assembly plants for new model costing $6 billion to produce 700,000 per year.
OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002
- 61-
May 9, 2001 Final Report
Â·
Various estimates of engine and transmission plants indicating costs of about $300 million to build facilities with production outputs of 100,000 engines/transmissions per year.
A Congressional Research Service report estimating changeover costs (for producing more efficient vehicles and engine) of $1.5 billion to $3.0 billion per car line (250,000 to 300,000 vehicles per year).
Â·
Based on the above information, the following production infrastructure costs by type of vehicle were estimated: Â· CIDI and SIDI: $300 million per 100,000 vehicles.
This cost is based primarily on cost to build a new engine plant.
It is assumed that these technologies would be options for an existing production line.
CNG Vehicles: $700 million per 100,000 vehicles.
This cost is based on engine costs plus supporting fuel systems costs such as different on-board tanks and fuel supply systems.
It is assumed that CNG vehicles would be adapted from existing car lines.
Electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles: $2 billion per 100,000 vehicles.
This cost is based on new assembly plant, engine, battery, motor, and supporting technology plant costs.
It is assumed that these vehicles would be totally new car lines.
Â·
Â·
Exhibit 4-10 shows capital infrastructure costs associated with producing advanced automotive technologies.
It shows that expenditures are greatest in 2010 at almost $1.155 billion, primarily due to production of hybrid vehicles.
This table is reproduced from Appendix A, Table A-32.

Capital Constraints of Auto Manufacturers Exhibit 4-11 shows aggregate capital expenditures by the motor vehicle industry in the U.S. and expenditures by the major domestic manufacturers globally in billions of dollars for 1991 to 1997.
The U.S. expenditures column includes expenditures by the major domestic manufacturers, transplants and parts suppliers.
Our analysis indicates that in most years, the capital spending on production facilities would be less than $2 billion per year, which is substantially less than what the major domestic

manufacturers have been spending on capital infrastructure.
However, this may mean that other improvements may be deferred.

Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Used in Transportation (GREET) Model
GREET was developed to be used as an analytic tool for evaluating emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases, energy use, and petroleum consumption of various vehicle technologies on a full fuel-cycle basis (Ref. 27).
For a given transportation fuel, a fuel cycle covers the processes from energy feedstock (or primary energy) production to on-vehicle combustion of fuel.
In particular, the following stages are included in a fuel cycle: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Energy feedstock production; Feedstock transportation and storage; Fuel (or energy product) production; Fuel transportation, storage, and distribution; and Vehicular fuel combustion.
The GREET model consists of three elements: Â· Â· Â· Light vehicles (current version 1.5) Light vehicle materials (current version 2.4), and Heavy vehicles (current version 3.4).
Exhibit 4-12 lists the Carbon Coefficients for the different fuels.
These coefficients are used in the Appendix A Table A-21, "Total Carbon Emissions Reductions" to calculate the reduction in carbon emissions each year to 2030 due to the market penetration of the advanced vehicle technologies.

BTU)
GREET includes sixteen (16) fuel cycles.
Among them, four (4) are petroleum-based cycles: petroleum to conventional gasoline, petroleum to RFG; petroleum to diesel; and petroleum to LPG.
Seven (7) cycles are natural gas (NG)-based: NG to CNG; NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG); NG to LPG; NG to methanol; NG to dimethyl ether; NG to hydrogen; and NG to Fischer Tropsch diesel.
Three (3) cycles are ethanol production cycles: corn to ethanol; woody biomass to ethanol; and herbaceous biomass to ethanol.
The remaining two (2) cycles are soybean to biodiesel, and solar energy to hydrogen.
GREET was developed for estimating emissions and energy use of light and heavy vehicles (i.e., passenger cars, light, medium, and heavy trucks, and buses).
The advanced and conventional technologies included are: electric vehicles; hybrid vehicles; fuel cell vehicles operating on hydrogen, ethanol or methanol; CNG vehicles; LPG vehicles; and internal combustion engine vehicles fueled with RFG, low-sulfur diesel, M85, M100, E85, or E100.
Fuel cycle grams per mile emissions and Btu per mile energy use are calculated for each vehicle type.
GREET calculates the energy consumption of a fuel cycle by taking into account the amount of energy consumed in each of the stages involved in the fuel cycle.
In addition, by considering petroleum consumption in each fuel-cycle stage, the model calculates petroleum use by different vehicle types using different fuels.
Calculation of emissions for a particular stage are estimated in grams per million Btu of fuel throughput from the stage.
The calculation of emissions takes into account combustion of process fuels, leakage of fuels, fuel evaporation, and other emission sources.
Outputs resulting from GREET include the following: Â· Â· Â· Grams per mile emissions for HC, CO NOx, PM10, and SOx; Grams per mile emissions for CO2, CH4, and N2O; Global warming potential weighted greenhouse gas emissions;
OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002

May 9, 2001 Final Report
Â· Â·
Btu per mile fuel-cycle energy consumption; and Btu per mile fuel-cycle petroleum consumption.
Currently, the GREET model has been linked with the IMPACTT model so that IMPACTT output is now directly and automatically used by GREET.
Also, Version 1.5 of GREET has been released by the author but has not yet been integrated into the OTT QM/PAM tools.
4.2.4 Costs of Various Pollutants
The criteria pollutant emissions reduction values were calculated using an EPA estimate developed in 1990 which sets the costs of environmental controls at $360/ton for CO, $3660/ton for HC and $3300/ton for NOx (Ref. 28).
Costs in Reference 29 were modified to reflect 1996 dollars.
Various CO2 control cost estimates are indicated in Exhibit 4-13.
Control costs are used instead of damage costs due to the great difficulty of calculating damage costs.
These costs represent the "value" of reducing CO2 emissions.
For the QM 2001 evaluations, a low-end value of $15/metric ton (tonne) of CO2 reduction was utilized.
This equates to $55/metric ton of carbon reduced.
Note that the QM benefit values (carbon reduction) relate to fuel economy/conservation effects only.
4.2.5 Aggregate Environmental and Economic Benefits Estimates
The OTT Program Analysis Methodology includes estimating reductions in carbon emissions from the commercial utilization of OTT-sponsored technologies.
Exhibit 4-14 details carbon emission reductions estimated by technology.
By 2030, the OTT program impact will reduce carbon emissions by more than thirteen percent (13%).
Emissions reductions for NOx, CO, and HC also are evaluated.
Total emissions reductions and values for NOx, CO and HC are found in Tables A23 Â­ A28 in Appendix A.

5.0 Accomplishments and Future Plans 5.1 Accomplishments Three principal changes were made in the Quality Metrics calculations compared to the preceding year.
These modifications contributed to the changes in oil savings and other program benefits: 1.
The EIA AEO 00 base case fuel prices were similar to the base case in AEO 99.
The lower petroleum prices continue to influence benefits estimates.
2.
A high fuel price scenario was added to the sensitivity study to reflect the current surge in petroleum prices.
Current long term AEO energy price projections do not yet reflect current price increases.
3.
A sensitivity scenario was added to reflect a possible future market without the advanced diesel or SIDI technologies.
4.
Changes in the technology input assumptions.
For example, hybrid electric vehicles are presented in two versions: the 2X version (twice conventional fuel economy) is currently available in limited classes.
The 3X version, which is system-optimized, becomes available in the 2005-2008 time period.
Fuel cells were split into two subcategories: gasoline-fueled and hydrogen-fueled, with the hydrogen version becoming available in the mid-teens.
5.
Heavy Vehicle technology market performance was analyzed using updated VIUS attributes and considering alternative vehicle cost and fuel price assumptions.
6.
Analysis results were extended to year 2030.
5.2 Future Plans Analytical improvements planned for future QM and OTT Impacts Assessments include the following: 1.
2.
3.
4.
Â· Updating the vehicle choice methodology, Comparisons to Annual Energy Outlook Projections, Disaggregate Truck Class 2 benefits onto Classes 2A and 2B, Update the review of estimates of the premium for imported oil.

May 9, 2001 Final Report
7.0 Supporting Information 7.1 Glossary 1.
APU Â­ Auxiliary Power Unit: APU's are smaller prime movers typically mounted within a vehicle to provide power to auxiliary equipment.
An example would be to power a refrigeration system on a refrigerated truck.
APU's are often more efficient than using the main power unit to provide power to auxiliary systems.
2.
CIDI Â­ Compression Ignition/Direct Injection: Diesel engines produce combustion via high pressure compression of the air/fuel mixture, rather than with a spark as in conventional automobile engines.
Direct Injection (DI) diesel engines inject the fuel directly into the main combustion chamber rather than indirectly into a smaller pre-chamber.
This tends to be more difficult to control, but yields a higher efficiency than the indirect injection technique.
This term applies in this report to advanced direct-injected automotive-size diesel engines.
3.
CNG: Compressed Natural Gas: When used as a transportation fuel, natural gas is stored on-board either as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid form.
Most CNG systems store compressed natural gas at pressures up to 3,000 to 3,500 psig.
At 3,000 psig, one gallon of compressed natural gas contains about 27,500 BTU, about 30% of the energy density of liquefied natural gas.
4.
CV Â­ Conventional Vehicle: In this case, this usually applies to a conventional automobile, powered with a spark ignition engine burning gasoline.
5.
EE/RE Â­ Office Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at DOE 6.
EIA Â­ Energy Information Agency 7.
EPAct Â­ Environmental Policy Act 8.
ESM Â­ Economic Spreadsheet Model 9.
ETOH: An acronym abbreviation for ethanol or ethyl alcohol.
Ethanol can be used in its "pure" form (95% + ethanol) or as blended with various petroleum-based hydrocarbon fuels.
10.
FCV-Fuel Cell (Powered) Vehicle: A vehicle obtaining motive power from an on-board fuel cell.
11.
FFV - Flex Fuel Vehicle: A vehicle designed to operate within a range of different fuels or fuel mixtures.
For instance, one vehicle may be designed to burn pure ethanol or mixtures if ethanol and gasoline within specific limits.
Emissions effects often control the permitted ranges of FFV's.
12.
FLEX FUEL-see FFV 13.
FUEL ECONOMY Â­ All fuel economy values presented in this report are normalized equivalent energy economy values, that is, miles per unit of energy consumed, where the unit of energy is defined as one gallon of standard-grade gasoline containing 125,000 BTU (high heat value).
To convert to miles per million BTU, multiply values by 8.0.
14.
GREET Â­ Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation Model 15.
GPRA Â­ Government Performance Results Act: The basis of the Quality Metrics Program.
16.
GVW Â­ Gross Vehicle Weight: This is the maximum total weight (vehicle + passengers + cargo) that is permitted by the manufacturers.
17.
HEV Â­ Hybrid Electric Vehicle: A Vehicle that utilizes two or more power systems for motive power-typically a combination internal combustion engine and a battery/motor.
These systems may be interconnected in parallel (both providing motive power) or series (the internal combustion engine feeding the batteries and the batteries feeding the electric motor).
OTT Program Analysis Methodology Quality Metrics 2002 - 73 May 9, 2001 Final Report

HDDV -Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicle: A generic term applied to large diesel-powered trucks.
19.
HVMP Â­ Heavy Vehicle Market Penetration Model 20.
IMPACTT Â­ Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies Model 21.
LV Â­ Light Vehicle: An automobile or light truck under 6500 LB GVW. 22.
LNG Â­ Liquefied Natural Gas: Natural gas can be converted into liquid form for on-board storage if it is cooled to approximately -258oF.
at atmospheric pressure.
23.
LPG Â­ Liquid Propane Gas: LP gas is typically a mixture of propane and butane.
24.
MMB/DOE-Millions of Barrels per day of Oil Equivalent: An energy measure expressed in cure oil production rate at 5.8 million BTU per barrel.
25.
MMTONS Â­ Million Metric Tons: Commonly used as a measure of carbon emissions generation.
26.
NG Â­ Natural Gas: A naturally-occurring mixture of light hydrocarbons (mostly methane with some ethane and higher carbon gases) as well as other trace gases (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen).
When gathered into pipelines, natural gas is made more uniform by mixing propane and other gases with it.

OAAT Â­ Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies 28.
OEM Â­ Original Equipment Manufacturer 29.
OFD Â­ Office of Fuels Development 30.
OTT Â­ Office of Transportation Technologies in the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 31.
PNGV Â­ Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle Program 32.
QUADS: A measure of energy quantity.
One Quad is equal to 1015 (a million-billion) BTU's.
One Quad of petroleum is equal to 181 million barrels of crude petroleum or 8 billion gallons of gasoline.
The US consumes about 100 Quads of energy annually.
33.
RIMS II Â­ Regional Input-Output Modeling System 34.
RFG Â­ Reformulated Gasoline: Gasoline that has been refined in such a way to reduce emissions more than conventional gasoline-typically lower in sulfur and with better control of the volatile subfraction.
35.
SIDI Â­ Spark ignition direct injection or stratified charge direct injection 36.
VIUS Â­ Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey 37.
VMT Â­ Vehicle Miles Traveled: This term usually applies to the sum of the miles traveled by each vehicle within a selected group.
It is a measure of overall transportation service.
