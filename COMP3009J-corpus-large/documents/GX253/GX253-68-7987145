Window on State Government Carole Keeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller __________ [search_blu.gif]-Submit Fiscal Notes Fiscal Notes May 2003 Texas candy makers stir up sweet treats Texas' Sugar Rush While U.S. sales of confectionery products indicate that America's sweet tooth is growing stronger, Texas sales of sweets have hit the highs and lows of a sugar rush.
Americans ate about 3.1 billion pounds of chocolate confectionery products and about 3.2 billion pounds of non-chocolate confectionery in 2001, says Susan Fussell of the National Confectioners Association (NCA).
"The candy industry is doing very well," Fussell says.
From 2000 to 2001 the candy industry grew 1.5 percent, and the chocolate industry grew 2.3 percent, she says.
Retail sales of candy and chocolate products in the U.S. rose from $23.8 billion in 2000 to $24 billion in 2001, according to the NCA Web site, www.candyusa.org.
Except for a slight downturn in 1999, sales of candy and chocolate products have risen steadily in the U.S. since 1994.
Fussell says that economic downturns do not prompt consumers to cut back on sweets.
"Fortunately, there is candy sold at every price range, so people can modify their budgets and still buy candy," she says.
In Texas, however, candy sales tend to fluctuate, sometimes greatly, from year to year.
According to sales tax data from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Texas sales of candy and other confectionery products rose from $48.1 million in 2000 to $48.4 million in 2001, though numbers haven't returned to the state's 1998 high of $87.1 million.
The industry also has consolidated in Texas.
The number of confectioners dropped from a 1993 high of 61 firms to 46 firms in 2002.
Despite these fluctuations, Texas candy makers are claiming their part of the nation's billion-dollar candy industry with several Texas confectioners poised for expansion.
Willy Wonka of the West
In March 2002, Susie Hitchcock-Hall, owner of Susie's South Forty Confections in Midland, Texas, moved her operation to a facility five times larger than its previous one.
"I started in my kitchen in November 1991," Hitchcock-Hall says.
"I started with one small kettle, and needed another one in five months."
She now has 10 full-time employees and 58 seasonal employees.
Susie's South Forty is made up of the factory, an outlet store and one retail store, and Hitchcock-Hall says she is looking for an additional retail store location.
She also plans to launch a new line of white chocolate products in summer 2003.
Sweet Shop USA, established in 1972 in Fort Worth, is also set to expand.
Sweet Shop USA produces handmade chocolates marketed to high-end department stores and specialty stores, says Anna Parker, with marketing and new product development.
"If you buy the house-brand chocolates at Neiman Marcus, chances are that the Sweet Shop made those chocolates," Parker says.
In July 2000, Sweet Shop USA moved to a 66,000 square-foot facility after its previous facility was destroyed by a tornado.
Parker says the new facility has a larger production area and can produce more than 10,000 pounds of gourmet chocolate daily, but she says the company is looking for an even larger location.
In August 2000, Sweet Shop USA acquired Price's Fine Chocolates and Annaclairs of Kansas City, Mo., and Mrs. Weinsteins's Toffee of Santa Barbara, Calif.
The brands are now produced in Fort Worth.
Virtual candy store Local candy stores are gaining new markets through online sales.
For many small shops, Internet sales are replacing traditional, mail-order sales.
Lammes Candies Since 1885, based in Austin, includes the company's Web site information in its catalogues.
President Pam Teich says that as more people become comfortable with online shopping, they are buying things on the Internet that they used to order through the mail.
The company has nine retail stores located in and around Austin.
So far, the Lammes Candies' mail-order department makes up 10 percent of sales.
"If you take our mail-order department as a whole, it would average in sales to one of our regular retail stores," Teich says.
In 2003, Sweet Shop USA began selling its chocolates online as well.
"It seems to be doing really good," Parker says.
"There are more people getting on the Internet and shopping."
Sweet indulgences Candy consumers may be getting more health-conscious.
Fussell cites recent studies promoting the health benefits of antioxidants found in chocolate and says that requests for sugar-free candies are soaring.
In 2002, sales of sugar-free, non-chocolate candy, also called diet candy, were up 23 percent from 2001, she says.
Hitchcock-Hall is working on a recipe for sugar-free chocolates.
"One in three new customers ask for sugar-free products," she says.
Fussell attributes the sugar-free surge to baby boomers.
"With the soar in the population of baby boomers, there is an increased interest in what kinds of foods make up their diets, and they want to fit sweet indulgences into their lives," Fussell says.
Candy stop
A couple of big names in the candy industry have opened manufacturing facilities in Texas, including M
Russell Stover's Corsicana plant employs at least 900 people and produces 100,000 pounds of candy daily, says Sandra Madison, the Corsicana outlet store manager.
In addition to being a manufacturing facility, the Corsicana outlet store acts as a tourist destination.
"We get people from all over the place; some tour buses even put us on their lists," Madison says.
"In the off season, we get at least 150 visitors a day.
Christmas is our busiest season, and we can get up to 400 visitors a day."
Your corner candy store Though the candy industry seems to be dominated by large candy conglomerates such as Mars and Russell Stover, most communities have a local candy maker, Fussell says.
She says many candy operations, even the larger ones, are privately held companies that have been handed down through generations.
"Ours is a fun business to be in," Teich says.
"Most companies our size and smaller are family owned and operated.
It's almost like an art form being passed down from generation to generation."
