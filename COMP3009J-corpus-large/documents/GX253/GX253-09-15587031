AMENDMENT TO ESEA RELATING TO GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN.
Part B of title X of the Elementary and Secondary

FINDINGS.
``The Congress finds the following: ``(1) While the families or communities of some gifted students can provide private programs with appropriately trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, most high-ability students, especially those from inner cities, rural communities, or low-income families, must rely on the services and personnel provided by public schools.
Therefore, gifted education programs, provided by qualified professionals in the public schools, are needed to provide equal educational opportunities.
``(2) Due to the wide dispersal of students who are gifted and talented and the national interest in

``(3) State and local educational agencies often lack the specialized resources and trained personnel to consistently plan and implement effective programs for the identification of gifted and talented students and for the provision of educational services and programs appropriate for their needs.
``(4) Because gifted and talented students generally are more advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly, and study in more depth and complexity than others their age, their educational needs require opportunities and experiences that are different from those generally available in regular education programs.
``(5) Typical elementary school students who are academically gifted and talented already have mastered 35 to 50 percent of the school year's content in several subject areas before the year begins.
Without an advanced and challenging curriculum,

VÂ­AÂ­3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 they often lose their motivation and develop poor study habits that are difficult to break.
``(6) Elementary and secondary teachers have students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, characteristics, and needs.
Most teachers receive some training to meet the needs of these students, such as students with limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, and students from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds.
However, most teachers do not receive training on meeting the needs of students who are gifted and talented.
