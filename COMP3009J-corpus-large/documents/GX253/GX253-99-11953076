Stress The last booklet discussed how stress can lead to urges for cigarettes.
It ended by suggesting that you look at your lifestyle to see if you can reduce your stress level.
This booklet picks up where the last one left off.
Booklet 6 mentioned two types of stress: "major life events" and "daily hassles."
Most people tend to remember the major events that occur in their lives.
But the daily hassles, the little events of daily life, are often more important causes of stress.
On a day-to-day basis, your mental and physical health is affected by the minor problems of life.
These problems include money concerns, problems with family and friends, hassles at work, and not enough time for rest and sleep, to name a few.
Although these hassles seem minor, they add up each day.
"Shoulds" versus "Wants" One way to think about the causes of stress is to think about the "shoulds" in your daily life.
Shoulds are the demands that you or other people place upon yourself.
These are the things that you feel you "should" do: pay the bills, walk the dog, fix the car, clean the house, go to work, and so on.
People will have different lists of shoulds.
In contrast to the shoulds in your life are the "wants.
These are " things that you really want to do.
These things give you pleasure.
They may be activities such as spending time with your children, reading, dancing, watching TV, and so on.
Once again, each person will have his or her own list of wants.
One person's should (such as walking) may be another person's want.
There is no way to avoid all the daily hassles or all the shoulds in your life.
You could not survive.
But, a healthy lifestyle should be balanced.
It is normal to have both shoulds and wants.
We call this a "balanced lifestyle."
It is easy for a lifestyle to get out of balance over time.
With life come responsibilities, and these responsibilities tend to increase with age.
This is fine, as long as the unpleasant shoulds are balanced with pleasant wants.

Keep a Balance
Shoulds
Wants
However, manyÂ­if not mostÂ­people find that the shoulds slowly replace the wants in their lives.
This may be especially true of smokers.
Often, smokers use cigarettes as their want.
That is, they begin to reward themselves by smoking rather than by doing other activities they enjoy.
Over time, smokers use more cigarettes and do fewer other fun activities.
It is easy to see how this happens.
The nicotine in cigarettes can provide brief pleasure, energy, or even relaxation.
Smoking is a quick and easy way to have a brief want.
Of course, it is also a very poor way to get pleasure.
It is not healthy and can harm you.
What happens after people quit smoking? If they have been using cigarettes to satisfy most of their wants, then they may not remember how to get pleasure.
Instead, their life falls more out of balance.
The hassles and shoulds are still there, but the wants are not.
Now would be a good time to get balance in your life.
On the next pages, list your Daily Hassles and the shoulds in your life.
(You may have listed some of these hassles on page 3 of the last booklet, so that list may help you.)

Now look over your lists.
Your life is in balance if you have a want listed for every hassle and should that you listed.
This is only a rough guide, because a big hassle may need more than one want to balance it out.
In the same way, a strong want activity may balance out many smaller hassles or shoulds.
Is your lifestyle balanced? Do you have enough wants in your life? If not, go back to your wants list and try to add some things that give you pleasure.
Add only those activities that you would be willing to do and can do regularly.
Are you having trouble coming up with wants for your list? If so, do not feel bad.
Many people have an easier time listing shoulds than wants.
But you are in luck! We have included at the end of this booklet a list of "pleasant events."
Read this list to get some ideas.
Once you have created a list of wants that balances out your hassles and shoulds, then the trick is to do the wants.
Keep this booklet handy and try to add wants to your daily life.
But do not put so much pressure on yourself that the wants turn into shoulds!
Positive Addictions Smoking cigarettes was a "negative addiction."
That is, it was a habit that was bad for you and that you wanted to stop.
There are also "positive addictions."
These are habits that are healthy.
They can replace negative addictions, such as smoking, in your life.
Negative addictions often feel good at first, but they have negative effects in the long run.
For example, smoking may seem to get rid of stress, but it is unhealthy.
It can harm you.
Positive addictions may feel bad at first but have positive effects in the long run.
For example, at first running can be unpleasant, but with time, running can make you feel good.
It is also healthy.
A positive addiction (habit) involves an activity that you choose to do and that you can spend about an hour per day doing.
It is easy to do and does not take a lot of mental effort to do well.
You feel it has some value (physical, mental, or spiritual) for you.
And it is an activity that you can do without criticizing yourself.
If you can not accept yourself during this time, the activity will not be addicting.
And once again, you do not want to turn a positive addiction into a should in your life.

One way to change your life is to replace negative addictions (such as smoking) with positive addictions (habits).
In other words, the goal is to change bad habits to good habits.
What kind of activities can become "positive addictions? Here are a few: Â· Exercise (but speak to your doctor before greatly increasing your normal exercise level).
Â· Relaxation.
Â· Meditation.
Â· Prayer.
Â· Hobbies.
There is not room in this booklet to describe each of these positive addictions in detail.
But books can be found at the library and bookstores.
After Jenny quit smoking, she found that she did not seem to be enjoying life as much as she would like.
She had slowly replaced most fun activities with smoking.
Now that she had quit smoking, her life seemed empty.
Jenny made lists of the "shoulds" and "wants" in her life.
The "shoulds" included: taking care of her older parents, getting ahead in her job, keeping the house clean, paying her bills, and so on.
She had trouble coming up with even one "want" for her list.
After reading the Pleasant Events List, she was able to think about the things she had liked to do when she was younger: going to the beach, eating out with friends, reading romance novels, and dancing.
As she made time for putting these activities back into her life, she became more satisfied with her life.
Jenny thought of cigarettes less and less often.
A common concern of people who try to increase the "wants" or "positive addictions" in their lives is that they simply do not have time for more activities.
Work and chores seem to take up every waking moment.
How can you possibly add pleasant events to your busy life? Almost everybody feels this way at first.
The key is to start small, and set time for things you enjoy doing.
If you do not set time aside for the "wants" at first, they tend to be crowded out by the "shoulds."
Perhaps you could begin by setting aside just one half hour per week for doing something fun.
As you get more and more into the habit of doing that activity, you will find that it becomes easier and easier to find the time.
Eventually that activity becomes a "positive addiction," and you find the time to do it, just as you had found the time for smoking and for the "shoulds" in your life.
Give it a try!!!

Summary Most people find that they can reduce their level of stress by making minor changes in their lives.
This often involves increasing the amount of pleasant activities (wants) in their lives, or by developing "positive addictions."
Both ways can help fill the gap that is often felt after quitting smoking.
By quitting smoking, you have improved your health and probably added years to your life.
Now is the right time to make changes to increase your joy of living.
Good luck! 1
