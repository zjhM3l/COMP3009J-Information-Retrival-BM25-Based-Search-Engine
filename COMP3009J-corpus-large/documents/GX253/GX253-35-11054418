11 Biological Agents of Highest Concern Variola major (Smallpox) Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax) Yersinia pestis (Plague) Francisella tularensis (Tularemia) Botulinum toxin (Botulism) Filoviruses and Arenaviruses (Viral hemorrhagic fevers) ALL suspected or confirmed cases should be reported to health authorities immediately 12 Smallpox 13 Parapox 14 Anthrax Advantages of Biologics as Weapons Infectious via aerosol Organisms fairly stable in environment Susceptible civilian populations High morbidity and mortality Person-to-person transmission (smallpox, plague, VHF) Difficult to diagnose and/or treat Previous development for BW 15 Advantages of Biologics as Weapons Easy to obtain Inexpensive to produce Potential for dissemination over large geographic area Creates panic Can overwhelm medical services Perpetrators escape easily 16 How Real is the Threat?
