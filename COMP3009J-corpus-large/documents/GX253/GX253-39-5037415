So you say you want to buy competitive electricity The Basics (101) Â· CICA Â· What is being purchased? Â­ Supply or Service (Utility Services/FAR 41 = subset) Â­ Refrain: Why does it matter? Can't "good minds' differ?
Â· What FAR Part (12, 15, 41, other) is applicable? (Refrain) Â· FAR 19 Â­ What NAICS code should be used? (Refrain) Â­ What Size Standard applies? (What?? + Refrain) Â· Manufactured or Not? Â· But the NAICS . . .
Â­ Application of Set-asides and Preferences (Refrain)
So you say you want to buy competitive electricity (continued) To boldly go . . .
Â· Section 8093 of Public Law 100-202 Â· Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA Â­ DFAR 225.401 - Products subject to trade agreement acts.
Foreign end products subject to the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA are those in the following Federal supply groups (FSG).

Â­ FSG list is pre-restructuring (electricity was not available as a supply) Â­ NAFTA is, however, applicable
Â· Â· Â· Â·
FAR Part 5 - Publicizing Contract Actions Title Transfer: Delivery Point versus Service Point Pricing Mechanisms Â­ what makes sense FAR 12 Invoice Clause (no tailoring permitted!)
Now your ready to engage that emerging market Â­ NOT! Â· 400 pound gorilla or 80 pound weakling? Â­ Ain't aggregation grand? Â· Big dogs, little dogs, and dead dogs Â· Bundling versus Aggregation versus aggregation Â· Cherry Picking?

Competitive Electricity
Utility Service Contracts
Direct Supply Natural Gas
Housing Privatization
Hydrogen ?
Coal Energy Saving Performance Contracts
Utility Infrastructure Privatization
Renewables
Who knows? Facility Fuel Cells
Alternative Fuels
What Else?
Mobility Fuels/ Energy
Â· Some of these are also used for facilities Â· Alternative technologies like fuel Cells and hydrogen blur the distinction Â­ a vehicle fuel cell could also provide electricity for facility use
Lessons Learned Â· FAR Part 12 is your friend - learn it, live it, love it Â­ Many "constraints" are self-imposed Â­ Buy what's being sold Â­ Buy the way it is being bought Â· Understand how sellers sell Â· They will not change to sell the way Uncle Sam usually buys

Lessons Learned

Â· It ain't easy Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Avoidable mistakes usually more than eliminate "savings" It take's "good people" Nothing works as advertised on day one of retail access Restructuring rules not synchronized with RFP process Each state has "unique and innovative" restructuring rules DO NOT even mention billing (I guess I just did)
Lessons Learned Centrally managed program advantages Â­ Government benefits:
(continued)
Â· Reduced costs Â­ less duplication of effort Â· Develop and maintain team of dedicated specialists Â­ Local COs can focus on core responsibilities Â­ Avoid risk of long learning curve for new entrants
Â­ Market prefers "one face" Â· Reduced transaction costs throughout contract life Â· Consistency in RFPs and post-award administration Â· Facilitates establishment of trust/long-term relationships
Â­ Increased competition, better prices Â· Aggregated requirements large enough to generate interest Â· Suppliers accept the resultant commercial practice RFPs
Â­ Team effort with our partners critical Â· Partners in "extended acquisition team" Â· Partners participate in entire process
