-- BATTLE SCENARIOS --
Saturday, March 18 Morgan's Stand Below the Goldsboro Road In the Swamps South of the Road: Having smashed the First Division, Federal XIV Army Corps, Hardee's Confederates surround the Second Division in a desperate attempt to crush Morgan's line.
"For a time it seemed as though all was lost . . . .
A yell of indignation resounded in our ears [and] a tremendous volley cut the air as the rebellious hosts came pressing on.
[They] were met by Such a terrible storm of musketry . . . that for a moment they were checked . . . .
They stood within 25 y[a]rds of our line and fired as fast as they could load their pieces . . . .
Without any joking we came very near taking a trip to Richmond, or some other rebel 'Sea port.'"
--William Kemp, 98th Ohio Infantry, Mitchell's brigade, Morgan's division, on the fighting below the Goldsboro Road, March 19, 1865.
