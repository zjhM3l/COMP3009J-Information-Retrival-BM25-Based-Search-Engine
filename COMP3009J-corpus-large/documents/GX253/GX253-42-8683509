The Clean Marina Initiative is working with the engineering firm of Purdum and Jeschke to help marinas come into compliance with a federal regulation that requires certain facilities to have engineer-certified oil spill prevention, control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans.
Any marina, boatyard or yacht club that stores greater than 660 gallons of oil in a single above ground tank, an aggregate of 1,320 gallons above ground, or greater than 42,000 gallons underground is required to have an SPCC plan.
The term oil refers to all petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, solvents, and waste oil.
The Clean Marina Initiative has developed a template and hired an engineering firm to certify plans at no cost to marinas.
The template is available on the Clean Marina web site (www.dnr.state.md.us/boating) or by calling 410-260-8770.
Submit the completed template to the Clean Marina office along with a current Clean Marina Pledge and a completed Clean Marina Award Checklist.
DNR staff will then authorize contact with Purdum and Jeschke for plan review and certification.
Priority for this service will be given to facilities that meet the Clean Marina criteria in all aspects except the SPCC requirement.
ReminderSPCC Plan Assistance is Available Mar yland Clean Marinas Underway is a quarterly newsletter published by the Waterway and Greenways Division of the Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service, Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
The Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas and recreational boats.

Parris N. Glendening , Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Lt. Governor Sarah Taylor-Rogers, Secretary Elizabeth Fuller Valentine, Editor Donna Morrow, Layout Barbara MacLeod, Copy Editor UNDERW JUNE 2001 4 The Clean Marina Initiative has formed an alliance with a new, online marina reservation and slip management service.
The partnership between the Clean Marina Initiative and Marinalife.com represents another opportunity for certified Clean Marinas to reach potential customers.
Marinalife has developed Internet-based slip management software for marina operators.
The Slip Manager Software allows managers to automate their entire reservation process including managing slip inventory, customers and leases.
The software offers numerous features such as real time slip updates, invoicing capabilities, and customized reports.
Marinalife also hosts a marina locator service through which boaters can search for facilities in particular areas with particular features.
For instance, a boater can search for a marina in Annapolis with a fuel dock and laundry facilities by completing a simple form online.
A list of marinas fitting the search criteria appears within seconds after hitting the send button.
Boaters can then make reservations via the Internet at any Marinalife member marina.
The Maryland Clean Marina logo, with a link to additional information about the program, will be clearly displayed next to every certified Clean Marina that is a Marinalife member.
In addition, Clean Marina certification will soon be one of the criteria boaters can select when using the marina reservation and locator service.
This feature will allow boaters to consciously seek out and patronize facilities that have met the Clean Marina Initiatives high standards.

] Maryland Clean Marinas AY Clean Marina Forms Partnership with Marinalife.com Boating Infrastructure Grant Program The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will inaugurate the new Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program with the first round of awards this summer.
The BIG program will provide $32 million to states and territories to construct, renovate or maintain tie-up facilities for recreational boats 26 feet or more in length.
For Maryland, this means that a minimum of $400,000 will be available for projects such as mooring buoys, day-docks, navigational aids, transient slips, safe harbors, floating docks and fixed piers, floating and fixed breakwaters, dinghy docks, restrooms, retaining walls, bulkheads, dockside utilities, pumpout stations, recycling and trash receptacles, dockside pay telephones, debris deflection booms, and marine fueling stations.
DNRs Waterway Improvement Program solicited proposals from state, county and municipal contacts for the first round of grant funding .
They received requests for $1.5 million.
DNR staff then selected a handful of the proposed projects to submit to USFWS for the $200,000 of funding that is available to Maryland this year.
While private facilities were not asked to apply for this first round of funding , they may be invited to submit proposals in the future.
Decisions on future projects to fund with both BIG monies and Waterway Improvement Funds* will take into consideration the results of a survey of boating infrastructure needs that will be conducted by the University of Baltimore this summer.
University researchers will actually survey four groups: Owners of vessels 26 feet or more in length (generally non-trailerable boats), Owners of vessels less than 26 feet in length (generally trailerable boats), Operators of facilities catering to boats 26 feet or more in length, and Operators of facilities catering to boats under 26 feet in length.
They will investigate boaters current use patterns, compile information about existing tie-up facilities and their conditions, identify boater access needs and preferences, assess factors that inhibit boating in specific areas, and list congested areas.
The survey results will serve as the basis for a statewide plan.
To learn more about the BIG program, contact Beth Fuller Valentine at (410) 260-8776.
] * The Waterway Improvement Fund is supported by boat excise taxes and a small percentage of the state motor fuel tax.
The fund provides money to local, state and federal government agencies for a wide variety of capital projects to serve the boating public.

Over the past three months, six facilities have been certified as Clean Marinas and two others as Clean Marina Partners.
Congratulations to the owners and staff of Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina, Chesapeake Harbour Marina, Mears Marina and Hartge Yacht Services, Mears Point Marina, Spring Cove Marina (Rock Hall), Tidewater Marina, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and Rocky Gap State Park.
Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina is the first noncommercial, community marina to meet the Clean Marina criteria.
It has 116 slips and 8 moorings.
As part of his efforts to achieve Clean Marina certification, Bay Ridge resident and Dockmaster Ken Karsten included clean boating information in the community s monthly newsletter.
Instead of educating just the slip holders, we went the extra mile and trained over 400 households in the practices necessary to meet the Maryland Clean Marina guidelines, Karsten said.
At Chesapeake Harbour Marina in Annapolis, General Manager George Colligan asks his customers not to discharge their sewage treatment systems within the marina basin.
Sewage discharge treated by on-board systems still contains nutrients and possibly toxic chemicals and pathogens.
Within a confined area like a marina these elements can degrade water quality.
There is an obvious connection between clean water and recreational boating , said Colligan.
We need to do our part to protect the Chesapeake Bay.
Mears Marina in Annapolis has over 230 slips and a boatyard that is managed independently of the marina.
Marina Manager Desiree Bell and Louis Hartge of Hartge Yacht Services worked together to meet the Clean Marina award criteria.
Under the guidance of Assistant Marina Manager Nancy Bray, both the marina and the boatyard have refined their pollution prevention measures.
For example, Ms. Bray developed new environmental policies for all marina customers and Mr. Hartge uses filter fabric to prevent particles dislodged by pressure washing from running into the creek
.
Mears Point Marina in Grasonville is a full service marina complete with maintenance facilities, health club, and restaurant.
The managers of Mears Po int Marina have developed comprehensive environmental management regulations.
These rules are incorporated into all contracts: slips rentals, transient dockage, dry land storage, and outside contractors.
One rule is that all boat owners who live aboard their vessels are required to have a contract with a company that provides dockside sewage pumpouts.
We emphasize to our customers that clean water is their responsibility, as well as ours, noted Dockmaster Jay Jones.
By participating in the Clean Marina Initiative we are doing what we can to minimize the impacts of recreational boating on the health of the Bay.
Although she does not sell fuel, Madelyn Reni, owner of Spring Cove Marina in Rock Hall, is prepared for a petroleum spill.
In the event of an accidental spill, say from an onboard fuel leak that is pumped overboard by an automatic bilge pump, she has response equipment on site
.
She keeps oil absorbent pads and booms in a readily accessible container that can easily be taken out to the docks if necessary.

The Safety Council of Maryland will be offering a free Safety Management for Small Business seminar on September 6, 2001.
Workplace safety planning can reduce the number and severity of work-related injuries and illnesses, reduce worker compensation costs, and improve employee morale and productivity.
The seminar will cover topics such as OSHA record keeping requirements, regulatory compliance, and incident reporting and investigations.
For further information or to register, call (410) 298-4770.
The Maryland Occupational, Safety and Health program also offers free seminars, publications, and speakers at locations across the state to provide Maryland employers and employees with information about MOSH safety and health requirements.
A sampling of seminars that may interest marina operators include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Right-to -Know provides employers with an overview of OSHAs Hazard Communication standard, including unique Maryland requirements for compiling a chemical information list.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Personal Protective Equipment assists in indentifying hazards in your workplace and gives guidance in determining appropriate eye, face, head, hand, and foot protection equipment.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Respiratory Protection provides an overview of the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard.
It emphasizes the standards requirements, methods of compliance, and ways to avoid common pitfalls.
For a complete list of seminars and registration information, contact MOSH Training and Education at (410) 880-4970 or (301) 483-8406 or visit www.dllr.state.md.us/labor/mosh.html.]
The operators of facilities that have been certified as Clean Marinas over the past year will be honored at an awards ceremony at 2:00 p.m. on July 9th at Zahnisers Yachting Center in Solomons.
The ceremony will feature remarks by DNR Secretary Sarah Taylor-Rogers and elected officials, light refreshments, and a tour highlighting Zahnisers clean marina practices.
All are welcome to come and applaud the more than twenty marinas that have been certified since last July.
Call (410) 260-8770 for details.
] FREE S AFETY TRAINING from page 2 about the Clean Marina Initiative their eyes light up, said Reni.
They are pleased to be part of the effort to protect the Chesapeake Bay.
Tidewater Marina in Havre de Grace is a full service boating facility.
In addition to wet and dry storage, boat sales, a store and a fuel dock, Tidewater offers a comprehensive line of services including haul-out, bottom painting , blister repair, rigging , engine repair, fiberglass, air conditioning and refrigeration, finish carpentry, electrical, plumbing , and electronics.
With all of this activity going on, Manager Jeff Andrews has to insure that pollutants are not accidentally washed or blown into the water.
As part of his efforts, Andrews requires that all workers use vacuum sanders, tarps, or tents to contain dust from sanding .
Sand blasting must be conducted in an on-site containment stall.
Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels is the first museum to be named a Maryland Clean Marina Partner.
The Clean Marina Partner designation indicates that the museum managers minimize pollution from their own operations and actively promote clean boating habits.
For example, at the counter where transient boaters register for slips there is a display featuring clean boating tips.
Dockmaster Robin Newberg is also prepared for an emergency.
She has compiled two binders of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
One binder is kept in the boat shop and the other is in the museum admissions building .
Additionally, Ms. Newberg has put together a third binder with just the health sections of MSDS sheets so that the most relevant information is readily available in case of overexposure to any chemical kept on-site.
Rocky Gap State Park in Flintstone operates two boat ramps on a lake.
The only two gasoline engines allowed on the lake are both on DNR vessels: one a rescue boat and the other a pontoon tour boat.
The pontoon boat is equipped with a low-emission four-stroke engine.
Compared to twostroke engines that may discharge a quarter of their fuel unburnt, four-stroke engines operate much more efficiently; generate substantially less smoke, fumes, and noise; and have easier starting , faster acceleration, and quicker throttle response.
All of these facilities are truly making a difference and helping to protect the health of Marylands waterways.
