A Addition In computerized page layout, a small third-party add-on program to the PageMaker page layout program--known as a XTension for QuarkXpress and as a plug-in for Photoshop or Illustrator.
Red, green, and blue used for transmitted light as in a computer monitor.
See also Subtractive Primary Colors.
A computer program that automatically scales fonts for the computer screen as they are needed and thus provides a greater variety of sizes and eliminates jagged edges on the fonts shown on the monitor.
The version of ATM current of 1/98 is ATM Deluxe.
ATM or similar programs are recommended for DTP producers.
They provide exact font size and page layout on the screen, thereby matching the word-wrap and page layout provided later by a high-end imagesetter, and thus avoid output surprises, additional expenses, and delays A program from the Adobe Corporation that can be used to view files of formatted pages from page layout programs (e.g., from QuarkXPress or PageMaker) on computers that do not have these programs, nor even the fonts required--even across platforms.
PDF files from Acrobat can be directly used as input by some imagesetters.

See Adobe Type Manager.
A process in a Color Electronic Prepress System (CEPS) used to replace a lowresolution graphics file by a high-resolution image.
See also OPI.
A high-resolution scan is made in the CEPS, then a low-resolution version is provided by the CEPS for the desktop system, where it can be scaled, rotated, cropped and placed in the electronic mechanical.
When the electronic mechanical comes to the CEPS system for film output, the manipulated, lowresolution image is then replaced by a similarly scaled, cropped, rotated, highresolution image.
Image manipulation other than cropping, rotating, and scaling done on the lowresolution file in the DTP environment (color correction, image combining, etc.) will not be automatically done in the CEPS and should be discussed ahead of time with the service provider.
The process of tracing a bitmapped graphic into a vector format to allow for size changes.
See also Bezier Curve.
If an auto traced graphic has too many anchor points and will not printout on a laser printer, it most likely will not output successfully on an imagesetter.
One way to solve this is to lessen the number of line segments used by adjusting the "flatness setting" in the tracing program or in an image-editing program.
Auto Tracing
B Banding Bezier Curve Bit Bit Depth An undesired, visible, stepped-changes in image density, in a desired smooth tint gradient.
Also known as stair stepping.
See also Graduated Screen.

See also Object Oriented Graphics.
An acronym for binary digit.
This smallest unit of information is defined by an on or off condition.
The number of units of digital information (binary digits) in each pixel.
Eight-bit color can record 256 grey or color values; 24-bit color can record 16.8 million colors.
An image made using a grid of dots (pixels).
Also known as paint or raster format.
See also Vector Graphics.
An image that has been read and digitized into color and density values for each spot in the image (a bitmap).
This type of image is in contrast to a digitized image that is in drawing instruction (vector) form.
See also Bit Map.
A pattern of dots that describes a letter or number.
A separate pattern is required for each size of the letter or number as opposed to outline fonts that can be changed in size as needed.
See also Outline Font and also Scalable Font.
Bit Map Bit Map Scan
Bitmapped Font
Glossary for "Getting The Best From Desktop Publishing"
Bitmapped Graphic
Bleed Blend
An image made using a grid of pixels.
Also known as paint format or raster graphic.
See also Object Oriented Graphics.
A bitmapped image has a fixed resolution; therefore enlarging the graphic causes it to become coarser.
In printing, ink that extends to the edge of the page after trimming.
1) A graphic that contains two or more merging colors whose densities may or may not vary as the colors merge.
2) Used by some people as an alternate term for graduated tint screen, thus including single-color graduated blends.
The trick in gradient blends is to produce gradients that vary gradually, without visible stair stepping of different density blocks.
See also Banding, Calculated Blend and also Formulated Blend.
A color made by using screen tints of two or more process colors (CMYK).
For example, green using dots of yellow and cyan (process blue).
See also Pantone Color and also Spot Color.
Many spot colors cannot be accurately reproduced as built colors.
If a spot color must be reproduced very closely when using process inks, a fifth color (the spot color) may be required along with the four process inks.
The registration of two images of different colors against each other without any overlap.
See also Choke and also Trapping.
Built Color
Butt Fit
C Calculated Blend Calibration Capstan-Drive A graduated screen of one or more colors created from a series of objects (e.g., lines or rectangles) in a set number of steps, creating a predictable blended effect.
See also Banding.
The number of steps in a calculated blend should not exceed 256.
The operation of testing, measuring, and adjusting equipment to a standard or for two or more pieces of equipment, to each other.
DTP color management requires that scanners, monitors, and output devices be calibrated regularly.
A means of moving paper or film in an imagesetter by pulling the media with a geared cylinder (the capstan).
In older capstan-driven imagesetters the film or paper and the exposing light both move at the time of exposure, thus image placement and registration are not as precise as with drum based imagesetters, where the stationary film is wrapped around (or placed in) a drum and only the light moves.
Correcting an image for an overall color.
See Color Electronic Prepress System.
In negative preparation, the technique of slightly shrinking an image to provide for the slight image overlap needed in trapping different colors that touch each other.
See also Spread and Trapping.
In traditional image assembly, images that have been made thinner (chokes) or fatter (spreads) through the use of a camera or film contacting process.
This process (trapping) is done without changing image-shape or position in order to provide a slight printing overlap between abutting different colored images.
Also known as skinnies and fatties.
See also Trapping.
Some page layout programs contain rudimentary trapping capabilities.
However, trapping is dependent on a number of printing company variables, including, paper, press, and company preference.
Therefore, when supplying electronic mechanicals, it is recommended that trapping be left to the printer.

Color-Split Proof Composite Proof Compression
Concept Proof
A separate visual for each color in the product to be printed.
One visual showing all elements and colors in the product.
A means to reduce file size to allow quicker data handling, easier storage and faster data transfer.
See also JPEG and also Self-Extracting Archive.
Files compressed with the DOS command "Backup" must be decompressed with the exact version that they were compressed with (e.g., 3.1a).
Submitting DTP projects compressed this way may cause extra expense and delay if that exact version is not current and readily available to the contractor (most other compression software is backwards compatible).
Therefore, it is recommended that readily available, backward compatible, compression programs be used to compress DTP projects, and that files be compressed into a self-extracting archive.
A visual (usually made by the designer) as a mock-up of the final printed product.
See also Contract Proof.
Concept proofs are often made from digital information and often are made on wax thermal or similar systems that are not true indicators of the color and sharpness of the final product.
Continuous Tone
Marking concept proofs to show that they are not a good indication of the color to be printed (or attaching an ink chip for spot colors) can avoid undue client expectations.
An image that actually contains gradient tones.
See also Line Art.
For example; a photoprint with actual tones from white through grey to black, as opposed to a halftone made of dots of black to simulate tonality.
A proof made as a true indicator of the final printed productÂ­in essence, a contract.
Contract proofs are usually made from the negatives to be used for printing but may be made from digital information or even printing plates.
See also Concept Proof.

Submitting files in document format will facilitate corrections or changes.
1) In offset printing, the smallest unit of ink printed for a screened image.
For offset printing, dots are measured in lines per inch (LPI).
The LPI used (line screen value) varies according to the type of paper (newsprint, coated, etc.) and the method of reproduction (screen printing, sheet-fed offset, web offset, etc.)
For sheet-fed offset, typical LPI's used are 133 to 175.
If a halftone is produced electronically, each halftone dot will be made up of "laser dots."
Also known as halftone dot.
2) In digital imaging, the smallest unit that can be scanned, displayed, or output.
Typical dots per inch (DPI) range from 300 to 2400.
Also known as laser dot.
See also Resolution.
The spreading of the dots used in printing, that naturally occurs from copy to film, film to plate, and plate to paper.
Dot growth can cause screens and images to appear darker and can change process colors.
Dot gain must be kept in mind when choosing a line screen (e.g. 133, 150 or 175) for scanning or for tint screens.
1) In desktop production terms, a measure of the resolution of an image on a Monitor, or more typically, on the output page.

The use of computers and the other elements of desktop publishing to design publications in contrast to the traditional use of pen or pencil directly on paper.
One or more electronic files containing the elements required (type, illustrations, and design) to produce the paper or film output needed as a publication-master.
This term is in contrast to a paste-up of type, illustrations, and design elements made for the printer's camera (the mechanical).
See Color Electronic Prepress System.
Graphics produced in one program and then placed into another program.
Also known as nested graphics.
See also Linked Graphics.
When embedded graphics are placed in a page layout program, automatic trapping programs applied to the page layout file may not be able to work within the graphic.
Furthermore, the contractor may not be able to make any changes or corrections in the embedded graphic.
Therefore, it is suggested that a copy of the graphic in native format also be supplied along with the electronic mechanical.
A file format for graphics in which a graphic is described in terms of the PostScript page description language.
EPS files may contain bitmapped or object oriented graphics, and may contain a low-resolution bit-mapped image of the file to be used for screen viewing only.
EPS files can contain embedded special information such as: spot colors, clipping paths, line screen values, and transfer functions.
Encapsulated PostScriptTM (EPS)
EPS EPSF Extension
EPS files of graphics (without the native format built-in) cannot easily be corrected or changed by the contractor.
Therefore, it is suggested that a copy of the graphic in native format also be supplied.
See Encapsulated PostScript.

The manner in which digital information is stored by a program, including codes for character representation, text style, and image description.
See also Image File Format.
Many programs use their own way of storing data or graphics (their native file format), but are also able to input or output text or graphics in selected other generic or common formats.
For text.
ASCII is a generic format that contains text only, not formatting.
For graphics, there are many common formats, including two that are used most often for DTP, TIFF for bitmapped graphics and EPS for vector graphics.
Not all common graphic file formats are suitable for DTP; e.g., PICT is a lowresolution format designed for monitors.
Numerous presentation graphic file formats are also not suitable for DTP output.

City-named fonts, such as New York and Geneva, (generally supplied with the System for MACs) are available basically as TrueType or bitmapped fonts and thus are generally not used for professional typesetting that will be output on an imagesetter.
A method of identifying fonts between devices (e.g., from computer to computer or computer to imagesetter).
This system was set up to supply unique font identifying numbers from a block of numbers assigned to specific manufacturers by the Adobe Corporation.
In the past, for various reasons, this system often caused font ID conflicts (outputting the wrong font).
Use a font management utility, and do not change the names or numbers of fonts in your computer without experience in font manipulation.
A file that contains the width and height information for each character in a font.
In the MAC world, font metrics are contained in the screen font file.
In the IBM and PC clone world, for PostScript fonts, the font metrics are contained in the PFM file, and for TrueType fonts are stored in the font file itself.
See also PFM File.
Sending the proper font files as part of an electronic mechanical will assist in keeping undesired word wrapping and other font surprises from showing up in imagesetter file output.

H Hairline Rule A fine line the thickness of a human hair.
Different organizations and groups define it differently: The U.S. Postal Service as 1/2 a point; GATF as 3/1,000 inch; some printers and designers as 1/100 inch.
In many DTP programs the hairline rule default setting produces a line that is set so fine that while it is visible on a laser printer it is almost invisible on final output from a higher resolution device.
Therefore, for hairlines a minimum rule thickness of .25 point, rather than the default setting is recommended.
The reproduction of a continuous tone image through the use of dots of equal density but varying size, to simulate the tonality of the original.
DTP users who scan halftones for inclusion in electronic mechanicals as live copy should become aware of, and proficient in, adjusting tone compression and the other variables that need to be adjusted to make digital halftones print well.

Image Editing Program
Image File Format Image Manipulatzion Program Imagesetter
The process of placing formatted pages and other images in place for reproduction by a press, including color breaks and registration.
Also known as stripping.
See also Imposition.
Image assembly traditionally was done with film negatives, by knife and tape onto carrier sheets known as flats.
While much of the DTP-produced, imagesetter-output, page and graphics films are still traditionally stripped, more and more digital files are assembled into press size flats on the computer and then output as assembled film, ready for plate making.
Programs made to adjust, combine, retouch, or otherwise change, bitmapped (often scanned) graphics.
Also known as image manipulation or image processing programs.
Examples include Adobe Photoshop and Aldus Photostyler, Color Studio, and Canvas.
The form of coding used to represent an image in an electronic file.
Unlike text, various DTP programs use numerous different formats for graphics.
See also GIF, Document File Format, PostScript, and see also TIFF.
See Image Editing Program.
Imbedded Commands Imported Graphic Â®

See also Resolution, see also Output Resolution, and see also Scanning.
It is a popular misconception that the input resolution for scanning must equal the output resolution.
For continuous tone originals, scanning resolution beyond twice the line screen to be used in printing is most often unnecessary and counterproductive.

These devices typically have a resolution of 300 to 600 DPI.
A concept proof made on a printer attached to a personal computer.
See also Contract Proof and see also Color-Split Proof.
Color laser proofs shown to clients should be marked to indicate that the are not an exact representation of the color of the final printed item.
Among the reasons they usually are not an exact representation, is that many laser printers use colorants that are not representative of ink and that most laser printers represent spot colors by using process color (CMYK) dyes, waxes, etc.
Some people use a stamp indicating "Concept Proof, Not for Final Color"--this avoids unfulfilled client expectations.
In page layout or illustration programs, transparent strata that can contain separate elements of a page or illustration.
See also Alpha Channel.
Using layers allows for independent editing of the portions of the image on different strata (including transparency and opacity).
Copy of equal density of color throughout, without gradation of tone.
Line art can be reproduced by the offset process without being converted to a halftone.
While printed line art will not contain printer's dots, the solid appearing areas will, if digitally produced, contain digital dots (e.g., 600 or more DPI--not visible to the naked eye).

Over Scanning
Some page layout programs automatically knockout any color printing over another color, even black type printing over a light screen of a light color (e.g., a 10% screen of yellow).
In a case such as this, (black over a light yellow screen) it is not necessary to knock the black out of the yellow, since black is opaque.
In fact, reversing the black out of the yellow causes extra expense and the possibility of misregister.
Programs should be checked for this feature and DTP projects adjusted accordingly.

PostScriptTM Printer
A desktop (laser) printer that can output pages in the PostScript page description language.
PostScript capability is built into some printers and can be added to many others by font cartridge or software.
Â® DTP projects that are going to be output for printing on an imagesetter from electronic files, should be setup for, and checked by, the user on a PostScript printer, because PostScript output usually will not have the same text word-wrap and other layout as that shown with a desktop printer using it's own printer command language.
Thus, using a non-PostScript device to print and check jobs that will be ultimately output on a PostScript imagesetter will often cause expensive, time-delaying surprises at the printing proof stage.
PostScript printer description file.
A text file specific to a printer or imagesetter model that speaks to it specifically, re: paper size, paper draw, printer resident fonts, memory, etc.
While PostScript is described as a "Universal Page Description Language" and any PostScript compatible printer will output the data portion of the file, the first part of a PPD file provides brand and model specific information.
Therefore, if you are producing a PostScript printer file and do not know the model and type of output device, the file should be made for a generic PostScript device such as the Linotronic 330, or even more generic, an Apple Laser Writer.
However, these settings may not work exactly right on all machines so it is still recommended that you also include the original document files.
The process of checking DTP files before output by the output provider, in order to check if the files will run successfully on the imagesetter.

A numbering system to keep track of successive releases of a software program.
Major releases are indicated by whole numbers (e.g., ver. 2.0 or 3.0).
Minor intermediate updates are usually indicated by tenths (e.g., ver. 2.1 and 2.2), or even a lower case letter (e.g., 2.1 and 2.1a).
Â® While many upgrades are backwards compatible (can handle files made on earlier versions) a feature of a program important to your project may not be able to be correctly output by a later version, and usually will not be able to be handled by earlier versions.
Thus it is imperative that you provide information on the versions of all programs used in preparing projects submitted as electronic mechanicals (use GPO Form 952).
Not providing this information, or providing it after the fact often causes delays and additional costs.

Scanners can be used for line or halftone originals and with appropriate software for optical character recognition.
The process of converting a two dimensional image into digital data that can be manipulated and stored on a computer.
See also Sampling.
Continuous tone graphics being converted to halftones, should be scanned at a resolution between 1.5 and 2 times the line screen to be used (according to the quality required), multiplied by the % of enlargement or reduction of the graphic being scanned.
For example, scanning a 4"x5" b/w photoprint to be used at 8"x10", printed using a 150 line per inch screen: 2(quality factor) x 150(line screen) x 2(enlargement) = 650 DPI (input resolution.)
