("Licensee") appeals from the Adjudication and Order of Administrative Law Judge Robert F. Skwaryk ("ALJ"), wherein the ALJ sustained the citation, imposing a fine of $600.00 and a three day suspension of Licensee's license.
The citation charged Licensee with violating section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on March 10, 1998, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on its licensed premises.
Pursuant to section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471], the appeal in this case must be based solely on the record before the ALJ.
Where the decision of the ALJ is based upon substantial evidence, the Board must affirm the decision.
The Commonwealth Court defined "substantial evidence" to be such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion requiring something more than a scintilla creating mere suspicion of the fact to be established.

Cmwlth.
1998); Chapman vs. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 86 Pa.
Cmwlth.
49, 484 A.2d 413 (1984).
In its appeal, Licensee alleges that Finding of Fact No. 12 and the Conclusions of Law of the ALJ are not supported by substantial evidence and constitute errors of law.
Specifically, Licensee contends that neither Officer Ceh nor Officer Cozzoli checked any accounting or "double-up" features on any of the seized machines.
In addition, Licensee contends that Officer West testified that he did not know if a player could win 200 credits or more with a single play of one dollar.
Licensee further argues that the ALJ improperly distinguished the case of Commonwealth vs. Irwin , 535 Pa. 524, 626 A.2d 1106 (1993) without an evidentiary foundation.
Moreover, Licensee contends that its seized machines lacked the element of reward necessary for a gambling device per se.
Finally, Licensee argues, based on the case of Commonwealth vs. Kratsas, No.
CC-9412380 (Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas February 26, 1997), aff'd, 1998 Pa.
Super.
Lexis 2885 (September 21, 1998), that the ALJ committed an error of law in concluding that Licensee had any duty to come forward with an affirmative defense as to whether it was misled into believing that the video slot machines in question were legal.
The testimony revealed that on March 10, 1998 at 2:20 p.m., Officer West, Officer Ceh and Officer Cozzoli with the Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement ("Bureau") visited the licensed premises to investigate a complaint of gambling.
(N.T. 7-8, 32-33, 41).
Present on the licensed premises were two identical Dyna Cherrymaster video slot machines that were plugged-in and operational.
(N.T. 10, 12, 33-34, 42-43).
Officers Ceh and Cozzoli examined both machines.
(N.T. 8-9, 33-34, 42-43).
The officers did not observe any patrons playing the machines on the licensed premises.
(N.T. 18, 20, 37, 45, 51).
Officers Ceh and Cozzoli placed one dollar in United States currency into each machine in order to activate it.
(N.T. 33-44, 39-40, 43).
For one dollar, each officer received 20 credits which equated to five cents per credit.
(N.T. 33-34, 43, 84-85).
Each machine had a nine square grid screen that displayed different symbols, fruits, bars and numbers, which rolled as if on a drum.
(N.T. 14, 34, 43-44, 84, 89).
Once 200 or more credits were obtained through play, the officers were able to press the "print ticket" button on the machine which dispensed a ticket from the machine and reduced the number of credits to zero.
(N.T. 13, 16, 34-35, 42, 47, 51, 75-76; Ex. C-3).
Both officers determined that the two machines simulated mechanical slot machines and that no skill was required to play the machines.
(N.T. 34-35, 44).
Based on their play, the officers determined that there was probable cause to seize both machines.
(N.T. 9-10, 35, 45, 47).
The officers then confiscated the machines and departed the licensed premises.
(N.T. 10, 45).
After obtaining a search warrant for the two video slot machines, Officer West opened both machines on March 12, 1998.
(N.T. 10-11).
Both machines possessed double-up features and had power interrupt circuits so that the machines would retain their credits should the machines lose power.
(N.T. 12).
In addition, both machines possessed an internal accounting mechanism which showed the number of points that were knocked off.
(N.T. 12).
Officer West also played both machines.
(N.T. 13-17).
Upon pressing the play button, Officer West observed a nine-square grid appear on the screen which revolved in the same manner as a mechanical slot machine.
(N.T. 14).
The minimum bet on each machine was 8 credits.
(N.T. 14-15).
The double-up feature of the machines allowed Officer West to risk or lose the points accrued.
(N.T. 15).
Each play on the machines lasted between five and ten seconds.
(N.T. 17).
The machines would not operate without inserting U.S. currency.
(N.T. 16).
The accrual of 200 or more credits caused tickets to be printed from the machines.
(N.T. 13; Ex. C-3).
Officer West agreed with his fellow officers that no skill was involved in playing the machines and that both machines resembled mechanical slot machines.
(N.T. 13, 16).
While on the premises on March 10, 1998, a sign was posted behind the bar which read as follows: "Only 200 points for a Winning Ticket! ! ! Win a T-shirt per Ticket! ! Two Tickets will win you a Sweat Shirt! ! !" (N.T. 9, 18, 37, 49-50, 67; Ex. L-3).
In addition, the officers viewed T-shirts and sweat shirts advertising Licensee's trade name that were displayed behind the bar.
(N.T. 9-10, 38, 50; Ex. L-2).
One of Licensee's witnesses testified that each T-shirt cost Licensee $5.00 and each sweat shirt cost Licensee $10.00.
(N.T. 58; Ex. L-1).
In addition, Licensee's witnesses confirmed the officers' testimony as to how the machines were played, and that the machines dispensed tickets.
(N.T. 58-89; Ex. C-3).
Finding of Fact No. 12, which is specifically disputed by Licensee, reads as follows:
On March 12, 1998 Officer West examined the two Dyna Cherry Master video slot machines and found that each accepted $1.00, $5.00, $10.00 and $20.00 bills to play, operated at five cents per credit, had a very short playing time per play, had double up features for betting more than the initial bet on each machine, contained power interrupt circuits, internal accounting for the number of points in and points knocked off, and knock-off devices, which could be activated by pressing a print ticket button located on the front panel of the machine.
(N.T. 12, 14-15, 17, 24, 39).
(Adjudication and Order of ALJ, November 20, 1998, p. 3).
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he/she intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
[18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513].
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that whether a machine is a gambling device per se turns on the characteristics of the machine when read against the three elements necessary to gambling: consideration, a result determined by chance rather than skill, and a reward.
Commonwealth vs. Two Electronic Poker Game Machines , 502 Pa. 186, 465 A.2d 973 (1983).
If the machine displays all three elements, it is considered to be a gambling device per se.
Id.
Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that proof of a gambling payout made on a video poker machine is not necessary when the machine is determined to be a gambling device per se at the time it is seized.
Commonwealth vs. Twelve Dodge City Video Poker Machines, 517 Pa. 367, 537 A.2d 812 (1988).
It is clear from the testimony that U.S. currency had to be inserted into the machines in order to activate them.
This satisfied the element of consideration.
The Bureau officers, who were experts on gambling devices, opined that there was no skill involved in playing the games on the machine.
Therefore, the second element has been met since the result of the games were determined by chance, rather than skill.
It appears that Licensee's main contention on appeal is that the machines lacked the last element, reward.
The case advanced by Licensee in support of its contention is Commonwealth vs. Irwin , 535 Pa. 524, 636 A.2d 1106 (1993), wherein the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that there was no reward for gambling purposes if the player is not able to win something of equal or greater value than the amount required to play.
Having reviewed the Irwin case and the ALJ's decision, the Board finds that the ALJ properly distinguished this matter.
Because the machines at issue possessed a double-up feature, a player could bet more than the amount of consideration that was initially deposited into the machine.
As a result, the player could win and receive tickets which are worth more than the consideration that was initially required to play the machine.
It is conceivable that the player could deposit only a dollar and yet, through the use of this double-up feature, win a T-shirt that is worth $5.00.
As the ALJ correctly noted in his opinion, "[t]he machines in Irwin had internal controls to keep the value of the prize less than the cost of playing the games needed to win."
(Adjudication and Order of ALJ, November 20, 1998, p. 4).
There was no evidence that the machines in the instant case possessed such internal controls.
Instead, the machines in this matter manifested all three elements necessary to be classified as gambling devices per se.
