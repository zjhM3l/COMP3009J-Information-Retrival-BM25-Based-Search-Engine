*Expressed in Full Time Equivalents.
**G/T expenditures include Instruction and Instructional Leadership.
The 2001 evaluation of the G/T program by a KISD evaluation team identified the need for more resources.
While the differentiated curriculum approach the district has been using is low cost, evaluation results indicated that the program implementation among the elementary campuses varied and was not consistent.
The evaluators recommended that the district use an itinerant G/T teacher to serve all elementary schools.
This teacher could spend one or more days each week at every campus in pull-out programs to provide more consistency across campuses and grade levels and increase G/T program knowledge and awareness among regular elementary school teachers.
The evaluation team also recommended that the district provide a stipend to G/T teachers in pull-out programs and that principals give G/T teachers a release day to gather resources at the Region 20 education service center.
The evaluation also suggested more clearly defining the G/T program at the secondary level.
Because the AP program in KISD is open enrollment, one-half of the teachers did not know which students were G/T and whether these students were sufficiently challenged.
Students enrolled in AP classes were not sure whether or not they were G/T students.
Some of the students and their parents wanted additional activities at the secondary level in addition to AP classes.
Recommendation 7:
Increase resources allocated to the gifted and talented program.
KISD should increase the resources it allocates to the G/T program by implementing the recommendations of its 2000-01 evaluation team.
The program should assign an itinerant teacher to the elementary schools, give teachers of G/T students a release day to gather resources and plan and provide G/T teachers in pullout programs with stipends.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The assistant superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction and the G/T coordinator review the 2000-01 evaluation results, develop a plan to implement the recommendations and specify resources needed for implementation.
October 2002 2.
The assistant superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction presents the plan to the superintendent.
November 2002 3.
The G/T coordinator and the director of Human Resources interview teachers interested in the position of itinerant G/T teacher for the elementary level and select one of the teachers.
December 2002 - January 2003 4.
The district gives G/T teachers a day off for planning or gathering resources.
January 2003 5.
The district gives stipends to G/T teachers in pull-out programs.
January 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
The fiscal impact is based on the assumption that the district will reassign one teacher as an itinerant G/T teacher for an annual stipend of $1,000.
The district will offer $500 stipends to four trained G/T teachers at each of the three elementary schools and at the upper elementary: 16 x $500 = $8,000.
The G/T teachers will receive one additional day off for planning or resource gathering (138 teachers have G/T training x $70/day for certified teacher substitutes = $9,660).
Costs for 2002-03 are projected as half that of other years since the recommendation will not be implemented until January 2003.

FINDING
G/T programs should represent the composition of the general student population.
Minority students are underrepresented in the KISD gifted and talented programs.
Although KISD has 40 percent minority students, only 12 percent (28 students) of KISD's 234 G/T students are minority students.
In 2001-02, the KISD gifted and talented programs had nine percent Hispanic students and three percent African American, Asian-Pacific and Native American students (Exhibit 2-20).

In an effort to increase minority students in the G/T programs, KISD sends a reminder to teachers every January asking them to look closely at minority students as they nominate students for the G/T program.
Levelland 16.2% 16.7% 20.6% 21.7%
KISD identifies gifted and talented students through a three-step process of nomination, screening and selection.
Administrators, teachers, G/T facilitators, counselors, parents, or community members can nominate students for the G/T program or they can self-nominate.
The G/T facilitators distribute and collect the nomination forms.
Identification of G/T students involves multiple criteria including IQ test scores, achievement test scores, student product portfolios and teacher ratings.
A committee composed of the principal or assistant principal, the G/T facilitator, the G/T coordinator and a counselor selects students for the program.
FINDING
KISD ensures the quality of its G/T teachers by developing specific criteria for their G/T teachers.
The district profiles the characteristics of a G/T teacher and specifies guidelines for professional development.
KISD has specific criteria for the selection of G/T teachers.
A KISD principal must recommend a teacher for the G/T program.
Teachers who participate in the KISD G/T program must have completed at least two years of successful teaching experience or specialized experience in G/T education, expressed interest in teaching G/T students, demonstrated their interest by attending local workshops, completed self-instructional training modules or undertaken self-selected professional growth.
The teachers also must have expressed willingness to undertake a minimum of 30 hours of special G/T training and be familiar with the curriculum in the grade levels of G/T students they will teach.
KISD has recognized that teaching G/T students requires special skills and attributes.
KISD formalized these skills and attributes as part of their G/T plan.
KISD has identified four areas of skills and attributes necessary for teaching G/T students: * Relative to self: the G/T teacher has nine attributes such as personal confidence in ability to work with gifted students, enthusiasm for learning, flexibility and ability to evaluate student progress.
* Relative to students: the G/T teacher has six attributes such as perceiving and responding positively to individual differences and providing appropriate differentiated activities based on different styles.
* Relative to other people: the teacher possesses three attributes including the ability to work well with others.
* Relative to the learning environment: the teacher possesses four attributes including the identification and use of community resources such as people, field trip sites and real life situations.
KISD has set specific guidelines for staff development of G/T teachers.
In addition to the minimum of 30 hours of training for new program staff, KISD G/T guidelines require a minimum of six training hours annually for program staff.
The district also requires administrators with G/T program responsibility to have six hours of training and encourages them to attend update trainings.
In addition, G/T teachers and administrators receive time off to attend professional conferences and workshops.
KISD's G/T program has 60 elementary teachers, 29 upper elementary teachers, 30 middle school teachers and 19 high school teachers.
COMMENDATION
KISD supports the quality of its G/T program through teacher selection criteria and staff development guidelines.
FINDING
The KISD G/T program uses a comprehensive program evaluation model.
The G/T program evaluation model, based on the District Model Evaluation, has a defined purpose, expected outcomes, quantitative and qualitative measures and stated concerns.
The 2001 program evaluation focused on whether the program functions existed at or above the acceptable level in each of the five sections of the state plan for gifted education.
Concerns guiding the evaluation addressed whether the curriculum and instruction were appropriate, whether G/T teachers receive adequate support and whether program options meet G/T students' needs.
The evaluation set five expected outcomes: * Instruments and procedures used to assess students for program services measure diverse abilities and intelligences and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their talents and strengths.
* A flexible system of viable program options that provide a learning continuum district-wide that reinforces the strengths, needs and interests of G/T students.
* Curriculum and instruction meet the needs of G/T students by modifying the depth, complexity and pacing of the general school program.
* All program personnel have knowledge to offer appropriate options and curricula for G/T students.
* The district regularly encourages community and family participation.
The quantitative measures consisted of a comparison between actual and expected program results and a review of student achievement data.
The qualitative measures focused on views of program staff, evaluation of instructional materials, evaluation of new materials under consideration and assessing student efforts toward learning.
The KISD G/T evaluation model also specified the evaluation methodology associated with each expected outcome and the sample of parents, students, teachers and principals by school.
It states how evaluation instruments will be distributed and collected, the person responsible for each, and the timeline for the distribution, collection/compilation, analysis and report.
The evaluation report summarizes results overall and by grade levels (3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-12), shows the extent to which each expected outcome has been met, includes a cost-benefit analysis and makes recommendations.
The recommendations fall into three categories: overall program recommendations, solutions to remedy known weaknesses; and perpetuation of strengths.
The G/T program also conducts more limited, annual evaluations that are based on teacher, parent and student surveys.
The surveys are tailored to each school and grade level.
COMMENDATION
KISD uses an effective program evaluation model to determine program strengths and weaknesses and identify modifications.
FINDING
KISD resources allocated to the G/T program in 2001-02 are significantly below the state average.
In 2001-02 KISD allocated 0.1 percent of its budget to G/T compared with a state average of 1.7 percent.
KISD's expenditures, at $40 per G/T student, are 4.2 percent of the state average of $959.
KISD also has the lowest percent of G/T expenditures and expenditures per student among its peer districts, which have allocated 1.3 to 3.3 percent of total budgeted expenditures to their G/T programs (Exhibit 2-19).

In an effort to increase minority students in the G/T programs, KISD sends a reminder to teachers every January asking them to look closely at minority students as they nominate students for the G/T program.
At Daniels Elementary School, where the KISD Bilingual/ESL program is located, notices are sent out to parents in both English and Spanish.
The G/T coordinator asks teachers to inform parents about the program through their school newsletters and to collect samples throughout the year of minority students who show exceptional ability.
The G/T coordinator encourages the G/T Advisory Committees to give consideration to minority students during its annual August selection process.
In addition, KISD uses different screening instruments, including the non-verbal Sages Reasoning Test and student portfolios, to identify gifted minority students.
Socorro ISD succeeded in increasing the representation of Hispanic students in its G/T program to a level approaching their overall district representation by aggressively identifying G/T students from ethnically and linguistically diverse backgrounds.
Socorro ISD students are 89 percent Hispanic and 52 percent limited English proficient (LEP); 87 percent of the district's G/T students are Hispanic.
Socorro ISD identified tests, measures and expertise that best suited its student population.
Socorro ISD uses Raven, a reasoning ability instrument that uses no language, combined with Spanish Assessment of Basic Education, an achievement measure in Spanish and the expertise of its LEP director in the G/T identification and screening process.
Recommendation 8:
Ensure all gifted and talented students are identified and served.
The district should increase the participation of Hispanic and other minority students in the gifted and talented program.
KISD should make all school administrators and gifted and talented program facilitators aware of the under-representation of Hispanic and other minority students in the program.
The district should review strategies used by other districts like Socorro that succeeded in making their G/T programs more ethnically and linguistically diverse.

FINDING
In 2000-01 KISD ranked below the state average in percent of KISD students taking AP courses, percent taking AP exams and percent of scores exceeding criterion.
KISD uses a number of strategies to encourage students to take AP courses.
The high school counselor gives presentations to parents at the pre-registration meetings about the AP program and its benefits.
The district also offers financial assistance to low-income students who take AP exams; these students only have to pay $5.
KISD offers dual enrollment classes with Schreiner University and San Antonio College in English IV, Government, U.S. History and Calculus.
The district received a grant this year to pay tuition for students who take dual-credit courses on the campus of the college.
Exhibit 2-21 shows the percent of students taking AP courses in KISD, peer districts and the state.

*Meeting minimum score to receive course credit.
Although KISD students who took the AP exams performed better than students in the peer districts and the state, the district ranked fourth among peer districts in the percent of students taking AP exams.
The concept behind the AP program is to provide college-level courses to high school students to ease the transition to college.
The percent of advanced courses that a student completes, according to the College Board, the entity that manages the SAT, is one of the best predictors of success on the SAT and in college.
To encourage more students to participate in its program, Hamilton ISD increased the number of subjects in which students can take advanced placement courses.
Hamilton ISD also encouraged students to participate in AP course and to take placement exams.
As a result of these strategies, Hamilton ISD increased the percent of students taking advanced courses and AP exams above its peer districts, the region and the state.
Hamilton ISD students' AP scores of "3" or higher, scores that colleges and universities use for credit, also increased to 76.2 percent.
Recommendation 9:
Develop and implement a plan to increase the number of students taking Advanced Placement courses and exams.
KISD should develop a plan to increase the number of students taking AP courses and exams that incorporate a staff development schedule, staff development for teachers of AP courses, and compensation methods such as paying stipends to teachers teaching AP courses to motivate these teachers to recruit students for AP courses.
Teachers and administrators should begin informing parents and students in middle school about the AP program and its academic and financial benefits, such as getting college credit and reducing college costs.
The district should increase community awareness of the program through advertisements in its newsletters and articles in the local newspaper.
School and district administration should recruit parent organizations and school improvement teams to advocate for the program.
The middle and high school should invite representatives of local colleges and universities to speak about the benefits of having college credit through the AP program.
The district should apply for a grant from a local foundation such as the Peterson Foundation to assist students in paying for AP tests.

The KISD G/T coordinator said that the district recognizes the need to increase the participation of minority students in AP courses and AP exams but the district's efforts have not been effective.
The G/T coordinator makes presentations to parents about the AP program during pre-registration meetings.
Administrators and teachers also encourage students to take AP or dual credit courses.
Recommendation 10:
Increase participation of all minority students in AP courses and AP exams.
The district should tailor its overall campaign to increase the participation of all minority students in the AP program by stressing to minority students and parents the educational and financial benefits of taking AP courses and exams.
The district should explain the low cost opportunities to take the exams.
To increase community awareness, the district should advertise the AP program in its newsletters and include articles in the local newspaper.
School and district administration should recruit minority representatives of parent organizations and school improvement teams to advocate the program to minority parents and students.
The middle and high school should invite former minority students to discuss how participation in the AP program has helped them in college.
The district should also invite minority representatives of local colleges and universities to speak about the benefits of having college credit through the AP program.
