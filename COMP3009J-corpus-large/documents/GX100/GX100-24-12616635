Porker Award October 31, 1997 ENCORE PORKER FOR "BIG DIG" WASHINGTON -- For turning a highway project into a costly opportunity for Boston, Massachusetts' utilities to upgrade their infrastructures at no charge to them, the managers of Boston's Central Artery project have won Rep. Tom Petri's latest Porker Award.
Petri explained that Federal taxpayers are paying 85 percent of the cost of the project, also known as "The Big Dig."
At a projected cost of $11.6 billion to build two highway tunnels, the Big Dig is the most expensive highway project in the nation's history.
"I fought the Big Dig when it was approved in the early 1980s, but I was only a junior congressman at the time, and the Big Dig had the strong support of Senator Ted Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill, who was from Boston," Petri said.
"The Big Dig requires major disruptions during construction.
So, to keep everybody happy and quiet, the administrators of the project have been spreading money around to all sorts of local government agencies, businesses, and educational institutions," Petri said.
His latest case in point: Big Dig engineers have spent more than $400 million over the last decade to relocate electric, gas, water and telecommunications lines from the path of the underground expressway, its ramps and interchanges.
But they haven't simply relocated the lines.
The sprawling web of underground pipes, electric and telephone lines, some of them decades old, is being replaced with vastly improved, modern lines: fiber-optic telephone lines, $44 million to replace a Boston Edison electric substation built in 1915, new and improved sewage lines.
And, as John P. Sullivan Jr., chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission put it, "You now have this golden opportunity to make improvements, and to date, we haven't put in a penny
