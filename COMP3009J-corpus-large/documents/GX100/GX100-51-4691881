Garden State farms are diverse, raising livestock, poultry and produce, and yielding dairy products, field crops, sod, nursery stock and many specialty items.
Horse farms give an important boost to our agriculture industry and afford equine enthusiasts hours of enjoyment.
Vineyards develop wines unique to our state.
New Jersey farmland generates an impressive variety of more than 100 types of "Jersey Fresh" grown fruits and vegetables.
New Jersey farms are major producers of, for example, cranberries, blueberries, peaches, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes.
Fruit and vegetable pick-your-own operations are ever popular.
[sunvalley.gif] Sustaining New Jersey farms yields multiple benefits, including: * the state's agriculture industry contributes to local economies directly through sales, job creation and maintenance, support services and businesses, and also by supplying lucrative secondary markets such as food processing; * products produced in-state have a shorter distance to travel to New Jersey consumers than do out-of-state products, thus reducing transportation costs and maximizing freshness; * restaurants advertising the use of fresh and/or organic New Jersey produce often reap the benefits of supportive consumers; * access to local farms reduces the state's dependence on producers throughout the country, thus operating as a hedge against future food scarcity and increasing the security of our food supply in the event of natural and unforeseen disasters elsewhere, including frost, drought, or flooding; * without locally-producing New Jersey farms, costs of agricultural products could rise 11 There are losses of more than 10,000 acres of farmland each year.
In 1950, New Jersey had 26,900 farms covering 1.8 million acres; in 2000, there were 9,600 farms totaling 830,000 acres.
