Unit 6: Similarity
Abstract
In this unit student study the concept of (figures are similar when they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size).
Similar figures are shown to be related by constant ratios.
Ratio and proportion are used in math scales and to make scale drawings.
Important theorems involving similarity are proved.
The unit culminates with a study of right triangles, trigonometric functions, (relationships among sides and angles in right triangles), and the Pythagorean Theorem (a geometric theorem expressing a relationship among the sides of a right triangle).
Unit Title: Similarity
Grade Level/Course Title: Tenth Grade/Geometry
Focus Questions:
1.
How are lengths, areas, and angle measures of similar figures related?
2.
What are the connections between similarity, right triangles, and trigonometric functions?

Benchmarks
Students will:
* understand size transformations of shapes (II.1.HS.5). * use proportional reasoning and indirect measurements, including trigonometric ratios, in practical applications (II.3.HS.5). * express numerical comparisons as ratios and rates (IV.3.HS.2).

Assessment Tasks
Determine how a copy machine which will shrink up to 50% of original size can be used to produce a copy still smaller.
Also determine whether any sizes are impossible to reproduce (II.1.HS.5, IV.3.HS.2).
Determine a method to measure the height of something that cannot be measured directly.
Use the method and comment on its accuracy (II.3.HS.5).

Connections
Arts
While studying similarity, students can consider the aesthetic appeal of the golden rectangle in art and architecture.
Science
When studying similarity, students connect ratios to scale drawings.
Social Studies
When studying similarity and proportionality, students can use ratios with maps.
