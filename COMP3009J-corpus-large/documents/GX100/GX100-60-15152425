Porker Award September 5, 1997 "BIG DIG" WINS PORKER WASHINGTON -- For saddling taxpayers with the most expensive road ever built at $1 billion per mile, Sen. Ted Kennedy, the late House Speaker Tip O'Neill, and the Massachusetts government have won Rep. Tom Petri's latest Porker Award.
Petri explained that in the early 1980s he fought against the gold plating of Boston, Massachusetts' huge proposed Central Artery project to build two highway tunnels.
"You can check the Fond du Lac Reporter, the Boston Globe and other papers to see the fight I put up.
But I was only a junior representative back then, and the project was a high priority for Sen. Kennedy and for Boston Rep. O'Neill, who was the Speaker of the House at the time," he said.
Originally, the "Big Dig," as it's sometimes called, was supposed to cost $2.5 billion.
But the latest estimate is $10 billion -- with 85 percent coming from the federal taxpayer, Petri said.
"What's more, one third of the cost has little or nothing to do with the roadway itself.
Billions are being spent to mollify local business and community groups.
Take one example: The old Boston Garden -- the local sports arena -- got $15 million because the Big Dig took away storage space where the Boston Celtics had kept their famous parquet floor and other equipment.
$15 million -- even though appraisers said they could have replaced the storage space for $3 million," he said, adding, "At least I can finally report that Congress is in the process of turning off the money spigot, and turning remaining costs over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
."
