A CALL FOR EXCELLENCE:
RAISING THE BAR
FOR GIFTED STUDENTS

A Call for Excellence: Raising the Bar for Gifted Students
Building on the past.
Throughout the United States, there has been a call for America's students to master more complex skills and to demonstrate understanding of more sophisticated content.
In response, states throughout the country have increased their expectations for student performance.
However, while basic competencies are being raised, often there is little done to enhance services for more advanced learners.
National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent, published by the United States Department of Education in 1993, notes that, "Most American students are encouraged to finish high school and earn good grades.
But students are not asked to work hard or master a body of challenging knowledge or skills.
The message society often sends to students is to aim for academic adequacy, not academic excellence (p.1)."
In 1995 when the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 1, it created a new education code with a new set of expectations for children that met the challenge implied in National Excellence.
The law required that a new curriculum be developed that established what knowledge and skills all students should achieve at each grade level.
It also established a new set of "Public Education Academic Goals" for the state.
These goals mandate that students should perform at exemplary levels in language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science (Section 4.002, TEC).
Taken together, the new curriculum and the new goals promised that all students would receive a more challenging educational program.
Senate Bill 1 did not stop there.
It also redrafted the laws relating to the state-mandated program for gifted students.
The Texas Legislature had provided funding for programs to gifted students on a voluntary basis since 1979.
In 1987 it had mandated that all districts must provide services to gifted students by the beginning of the 1990 school year.
Prior to 1995, however, although services for advanced students were required in all districts, there was no oversight provided by the Texas Education Agency.
According to Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code, the State Board of Education now is charged with developing and updating "a state plan for the education of gifted and talented students to guide school districts in establishing and improving programs for identified students."
Additionally, and most importantly, the plan is to "be used for accountability purposes to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented (29.123, TEC)."
The new plan, which was adopted in November 1996, was designed to meet the two charges included in the law-it created criteria to be used for accountability of services for gifted students, and it provided guidance on how to improve those services.
The plan provided an acceptable level of services that all districts must meet.
At the same time, it also established criteria that districts could strive to attain at a "recognized" and "exemplary" level that raised the bar both for the expansiveness of services provided to/for gifted students and on the level of student performance.
In keeping with Senate Bill 1, which encourages local control, the additional levels above acceptable are voluntary on the part of districts and not a requirement of state law or rule.
Each level of the plan builds on the previous one-districts must meet the acceptable level in order to adequately address the recognized level, which, in turn, must be met if a district is to meet the standards at the exemplary level.
As an example of this, at the acceptable level, all teachers who provide services in the gifted program must receive a minimum of 30 clock hours of professional development in the field (indicator 4.1A).
Indicator 4.1.1R states that teachers are encouraged to pursue advanced degrees in their teaching discipline.
The exemplary indicator, 4.1E, requires that districts provide support for teachers to receive their endorsement in the area of gifted education.
A copy of the state plan is included in Appendix A.
Even at the acceptable level, which is a requirement of all districts, the new plan expanded services in the following ways.
It requires that all districts offer services that emphasize content in the four foundation areas of the curriculum.
In the past, districts could select to serve students in one area-language arts for example-and ignore other areas of the curriculum.
Because the academic goals for public education outlined in Section 4.002 of the Texas Education Code state that students perform at exemplary levels in language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science, it is critical that services to gifted students support these goals by addressing the four foundation areas.
At the recognized and exemplary level, the state plan encourages districts to expand their services to areas of the arts, leadership, and creative endeavors.
The plan requires that districts provide a continuum of learning experiences that lead to the development of advanced-level products/performances.
Prior to the adoption of the plan in 1996, there were no requirements related to student performance for those who participated in services for gifted students.
Too often, detractors of services for gifted students could turn to programs that did not have rigor, did not require effort, and did not set high expectations for students.
Even those who actively support gifted education have admitted that the effort to get into gifted programs far exceeds, in some cases, the effort needed to participate in those programs.
The plan's goal focuses on student performance by stating that students who participate in services that are part of the gifted program will develop "innovative products and performances that reflect individuality and creativity and are advanced in relation to students of similar age, experience, or environment.
High school students who have participated in services for gifted students will have produced products and performance of professional quality as part of their program services (p.1)."
This goal clearly focuses district efforts on what students are learning and accomplishing, thereby addressing a major concern related to gifted education.
The concept of high school students producing products of professional quality may seem beyond the reach of most students, and, indeed, it may be.
However, it should be the goal of those who either teach or are taught at an advanced level.
The purpose of gifted programs is not simply to get in them but to provide challenging curricular options that demand effort and high performance.
National Excellence suggested that there is a pervasive ambivalence in America toward high intellectual achievement.
The report notes that high-ability students receive mixed messages.
"Negative stereotypes of high-achieving students have created an atmosphere in which students do not want to be identified as very smart...Students say they want to do well, but not exceptionally well, because it is more important to be accepted by the popular students than it is to be considered a 'brain'." (p. 13).
The new state plan removes this ambiguity and emphasizes to both educators and students that high performance is not only applauded, but expected.
The plan requires that districts offer gifted students a variety of curricular options.
In working with students who need remedial services, it is a given that a variety of educational techniques and options should be employed.
The same need for variety exists for all students.
This requirement suggests that gifted students would not only have the option of, for example, Advanced Placement at the high school level, but also would be able to select from independent study courses or mentorships that enable them to delve into an area of strength.
Middle school students would not only have algebra as an eighth grade mathematics option, but would participate in specially designed mini-seminars or research projects that enable them to use their talents in specific applications.
Diversity of services assure that more advanced students will be served appropriately and will meet the state goal of developing sophisticated products.
Inclusion of the "recognized" and "exemplary" levels of the state plan emphasizes increasingly individualized services for highly gifted students.
At the "acceptable" level of the Texas state plan, districts are required to develop general services that address advanced learners.
As the plan moves to more advanced degrees of implementation at the "recognized" and "exemplary" levels, more individualized services are expected.
As an example, in the curriculum section of the plan, all districts are expected to provide students with opportunities "to accelerate in areas of student strengths (3.3A)."
At the recognized level, to meet criteria 3.3R, districts need to assure that "Flexible pacing is employed, allowing students to learn at the pace and level appropriate to their abilities and skills."
At the exemplary level, 3.3E requires that "Scheduling modifications are implemented in order to meet the needs of individual students."
Administrators and counselors must receive a one-time overview on gifted education.
Teacher training in the area of gifted education typically has been widely supported.
However, many times teachers' efforts to implement appropriate services are not supported because of a lack of understanding on the part of administrators or counselors who must balance the diverse needs of all students.
The new state plan requires all administrators and counselors with decision-making responsibilities for the program to receive a minimum of six hours of professional development on the nature and needs of and program options for gifted students.
At the recognized level, local boards of trustees also would receive minimal training on the state plan.
At the exemplary level, administrators and counselors would receive annual updates in the field.
Senate Bill 1 mandates that the state plan measure the performance of districts.
The District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) monitoring system established by the Texas Education Agency determines whether or not districts are addressing the criteria required for acceptable performance.
Beginning in the spring of 1999, the Division of Advanced Academic Services will pilot a process to recognize districts that exceed this level of performance.
Even with this system in place, no standard for student performance has been adopted for students who participate in advanced level services.
This is the next challenge that faces Texas public schools.
The Status of Statewide Accountability of Performance of Gifted Students throughout the Nation.
In 1998, the Texas Education Agency investigated current practices to determine how states assess the performance of students participating in services for gifted students.
Appendix B contains an analysis of state assessment systems and explains if and how they address advanced student performance.
While some states recognize advanced level performance, no state sets standards for performance of students served in gifted programs.
In part, this is due to the nature of the children themselves.
Even when a group of gifted students is identified, the group still consists of unique individuals whose gifts and talents may be in different areas.
For example, some students may be gifted in the area of language arts, others in mathematics, some in leadership ability, others in intellectual ability.
This poses a dilemma when developing accountability of services.
Another factor in objective accountability of gifted student performance is that standardized tests are simply not designed to measure this population.
Even norm-referenced assessments, the purpose of which is to describe the relative rank among students, do not discriminate among gifted students.
For example, a 40-item norm-referenced exam may include 5 items that will challenge gifted students.
This five-item test will not differentiate the achievement of these students to any degree useful for accountability.
Criterion-referenced standardized exams could be developed for this population.
Development of such tests at the state level, however, could counteract the goals of the state plan, which encourages more individualized services for gifted students that would better meet student needs.
TEKS, TAAS, and Gifted Education.
Services to gifted students rest on the foundation developed for the general school program.
When Senate Bill 1 required that Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) be developed for each content included in the core and foundation areas of the curriculum, it provided the opportunity to increase standards for all students.
During the passage of the TEKS, which included input and discussion from all segments of the educational community, each new draft provided a higher level of sophistication than the previous one.
In most cases, the TEKS provide strong support for services to gifted students.
This foundation is intended to be enhanced as indicated by the curriculum standard included in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted Students.
That standard, "Curriculum and instruction meet the needs of gifted students by modifying the depth, complexity, and pacing of the general school program," requires that the TEKS be taught at a more sophisticated level and not necessarily rewritten when serving gifted students.
Before providing an example of this, it will be helpful to elaborate on what is meant by pacing, depth, and complexity.
Depth, Complexity, and Pacing.
It is best to begin by stating that enhanced depth and complexity are appropriate for all students at certain times.
Most students would be better served if the pacing of their classes were adjusted to specifically meet their needs.
However, in the case of advanced level students, these needs are more consistent, and differentiated services are required for a greater proportion of the student's school career.
The services must be planned and educators need to develop a continuum that reinforces already existing student strengths.
Modifications in pacing suggest that the curriculum is presented either more quickly or more slowly than it might be in the general classroom.
Many educators are familiar with advanced students who frequently prove mastery of many of the basic skills of a particular unit through a pre-test.
In these cases, the students' progress might be accelerated.
An example of this might be those students who take algebra in the seventh or eighth grade rather than taking the traditional mathematics courses taught at those grade levels.
However, it also is important to remember that gifted students sometimes have very deep interests in certain areas and might need to spend more time exploring and developing products in these areas.
Adjusting the pacing of instruction was one recommendation included in Prisoners of Time (1994), a report developed by the National Education Commission on Time and Learning.
The report notes that advanced students are often "forced to spend more time than they need on a curriculum developed for students of moderate ability.
Many become bored, unmotivated, and frustrated (p. 15)."
It further recommends, "(T)ime should be adjusted to meet the individual needs of learners, rather than the administrative convenience of adults...The flexible use of time can permit more individualized instruction."
This is where enhancement of the TEKS through enrichment may be meaningfully employed.
The term "enrichment" has been overused and misused very often.
However, frequently students possess the basic skills in subjects in which they are interested.
They can "buy" time--collapse the basic skills part of the subject--that enables them to delve deeper into other areas of the subject that will use and develop those basic skills.
This is where depth and complexity come into play.
As used by Dr. Sandra Kaplan, the term "depth" refers to exploration within a discipline.
How do teachers and students dig deeper into the curriculum? There are a number of attributes that are critical, both for building academic awareness of a discipline and for assuring that the needs of motivated and advanced students are met.
First, teachers can introduce students to the language of the discipline.
What does it mean to hold "revisionist" views of history? What does it mean when a literary work is a "revision?" Many times, teachers and parents unwittingly talk down to students, thinking that is the best way to be understood.
However, students with deep interest in a discipline want to know, and need to know, how professionals in that field talk to one another.
This can start as early as elementary school, with the vocabulary building from one year to the next.
Another way of adding depth to a discipline is to emphasize its details--those things that make it unique from other subject areas.
As an example, teachers can discuss the parts of a fairy tale with young children, the common characteristics of myths from various countries with elementary and middle school students, and the distinctions between legal systems with high school government students.
It also is important for students to understand the rules that govern a specific discipline.
This covers areas as diverse as developing a thorough understanding of how the parts of government interact with one another to the way in which scientific experiments are carried out.
Sometimes educators overlook the importance of "just the facts," but these details will be critical building blocks in more fully developing the other dimensions of depth.
Two of these dimensions, patterns and trends, can be established only if the student has a good grasp on the details and rules of the disciplines.
By studying patterns, students will become more aware of recurring events, elements, and ideas that are repeated over time.
Emphasizing trends enable students to identify the various factors that affect and influence major concepts and ideas within a discipline.
One reason why it is important for students to understand the patterns and trends of a discipline is because these dimensions allow students to speculate knowledgeably on the final three dimensions of depth-- the big ideas, which define the principles, theories and generalizations of an area of study, the ethical issues and the unanswered questions of a discipline.
These last components of depth are not to be viewed as topics to be presented late in a student's school career.
Students at all grade levels often are asked to comment on ethical considerations in the stories they read or in historical and scientific events.
However, only by offering students the opportunity to consider the details, patterns, and trends of a discipline can students be provided with the evidence they need to present their viewpoints.
And only by encouraging them to use the language of a discipline can their viewpoints be offered in a knowledgeable manner.
Just as depth provides a firm foundation within a discipline, complexity focuses on building understanding within and across disciplines.
As students look at subjects over time, across disciplines, and from multiple perspectives, those subjects become richer and more complex.
When high school students study primary sources written at the time World War I was fought as opposed to a television documentary created in the 1990's, they see how interpretations of events have changed over time.
When students study the Civil War by reading speeches made in the Confederate Congress and the U.S. Congress, they begin to understand the different perspectives in which the war was viewed.
Students use the knowledge they have gained to begin to draw more sophisticated conclusions about issues, concepts, and events within disciplines.
While this overview provides only a brief picture of what is implied by depth, complexity, and pacing, it is intended to offer some idea of what is expected of teachers and students who participate in services designed as part of the program for gifted students.
The task of developing these services, which are increasingly individualized to address student strengths and interests, is extremely demanding.
However, the TEKS that were adopted in 1997 provide a powerful base from which to begin the process.
As an example, one of the history TEKS for fourth grade students states that students should "understand the causes and effects of the Texas Revolution, the Republic of Texas, and the annexation of Texas to the United States (113.4.3 TAC)."
The student is to accomplish this, in part by analyzing "the causes, major events, and effects of the Texas Revolution, including battles of the Alamo and San Jacinto" and to "describe the successes and problems of the Republic of Texas."
(113.4.3 [A] and [B]
Students with a deep interest in social studies might read some passages on the American Revolution and then be asked to draw some conclusions about patterns they observe on how such conflicts begin.
The same might be done regarding the first years of the United States as opposed to the Republic of Texas.
Teachers might discuss with students how historical research is done and have them read diaries published from the days of the early Republic, so they begin to understand the rules of studying history by using primary sources and observing how these resources are used in secondary sources.
Another approach might be to have students read letters from soldiers on both sides of the Texas Revolution and to guide a discussion on how each side viewed the conflict.
While these activities may be too detailed and sophisticated for some students, highly advanced students will welcome the opportunity to participate in such in-depth analysis.
In all cases, the activities build on the TEKS that are used for all students, but provide more rigor and challenge for those students who are able to go further.
Additional examples in the four foundation areas of the curriculum are included in Appendix C.
Even though the enhanced activities are based on existing TEKS, some educators might suggest that they take away time that might better be spent on study of TAAS objectives.
All of the activities included above re-enforce and support a more sophisticated approach to instruction designed to ensure mastery of TAAS objectives.
To adequately explore the patterns and trends of newly created republics, students will need to understand how to interpret graphs, maps, and timelines, explain how their various readings support conclusions they have drawn, and make generalizations based on comparisons of various texts.
These objectives are required TAAS reading objectives for the fourth grade.
Rather than using elementary, transparent material for "TAAS review," students instead hone their skills on challenging material and assignments that are commensurate with their abilities and reflect a sophisticated mastery of TAAS objectives.
The Future for Texas.
Texas is a national leader in the area of gifted education.
The new state plan, as indicated in Texas state law, emphasizes district accountability.
It sets in place a structure that can, like the TEKS, be used as a starting point for establishing exemplary services that require both high degrees of effort and performance from gifted students.
As districts establish their acceptable levels of services, it is time for gifted students who participate in the services also to meet a certain level of performance.
Just as the current Texas State plan for gifted students is unique in its approach because it recognizes districts that exceed state requirements, an innovative approach is needed to assure that gifted students are offered services at a level commensurate with their abilities.
The "test" of this must be in the effort and skill exhibited in the products developed by students who participate in the services.
Because of the inadequacy of test data to address the performance of gifted students, because of the individualized nature of gifted students' talents and abilities, because the state of Texas is committed to supporting services to gifted students by providing a mandate and funding, it is necessary to establish both standards and methods of assessing products and performances.
Report after report emphasizes that high school students are doing less and less to obtain both good grades in high school and acceptance into colleges of their choice.
In Hard Work and High Expectations: Motivating Students to Learn (1990), Tommy Tomlinson notes, "By any calculation, American students do not take much time from their day to study.
But then, as it turns out, so long as they graduate, they have little reason to do so.
Traditional sources of motivation-college admission, workplace requirements, and parental pressure-have all accommodated to the situation; indeed, students have learned that, beyond the diploma, few doors are opened or closed to them by their record of high school achievement or their academic work ethic (4)."
The report further notes that more and more college professors, even at elite institutions, complain about the level of preparedness of incoming college freshmen.
There has been little change in these concerns in the eight years since the report was published.
In 1998, 47% of Texas students who took the SAT-I reported having an "A" average, a percentage significantly higher than the national average of 38%.
Students believe they are doing well and therefore may be avoiding testing themselves against other students participating in high level learning opportunities.
According to the College Board, less than half of the Texas students who take an Advanced Placement class take the examination that would assess them on their learning of the material.
Many Texas students, including those who are high achieving and college bound, are not being assessed by high criteria commensurate with their abilities.
Students have become adept at determining what is required and doing just enough to get by.
Students in services that are part of the gifted program should be working with more complex content and participating in more challenging opportunities.
In turn, this premise suggests that the students will be putting forth more effort and producing more sophisticated products that reflect the advanced level instruction they have received.
Participation in a program for gifted students is not a reward or an entitlement-it comes with the expectation that increased levels of rigor will be followed by increased levels of performance.
Campus and district performance improved when the expectations for accountability were clearly established.
If more sophisticated instruction is desired in classrooms, and if more sophisticated products are desired of students who are capable of producing them, the same formula of clear expectations tied to accountability will need to be developed.
The following recommendations are designed to support district efforts by providing standards for student products/performances and to provide incentives for districts whose students attain those standards.
Recommendation 1: Legislation will be adopted requiring that the Texas Education Agency develop standards of performance in language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies for products developed by students participating in programs for the gifted in grades four, eight, and eleven.
These standards will be used by all Texas districts to determine the effectiveness of their services to gifted students and will form the basis of program modification.
Student performance indicators such as TAAS currently in place in Texas assess skills for all students.
TAAS does not include advanced levels that would be appropriate for gifted students.
At the secondary level, indicators such as performance on Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate examinations could be used for assessment; however, all school districts do not offer these courses and there is debate as to whether or not they are effective measures of gifted/talented student performance.
There are no equivalent measures to be used at the elementary or middle school levels.
Although the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students provides school-based indicators that lead to recognized and exemplary levels of school performance, currently, there are no specific student performance indicators.
Student performance is addressed in increasing increments moving from acceptable to recognized and on to exemplary.
To attain recognized designation, districts must have gifted students at all grade levels involved in experiences that result in the development of sophisticated products and/or performances.
Student progress/performance in programs for the gifted must be assessed periodically and information communicated to parents.
To achieve an exemplary rating, districts must assess student performance by standards developed by experts.
This recommendation would enable the agency to collaborate with experts and provide benchmarks for districts assessing the level of sophistication of student products.
The recommendation would provide more specificity related to expectations of student performance and give districts guidance on modifying the depth, complexity, and pacing of curriculum and instruction.
Provided clear, unambiguous targets, students would recognize the need for hard work and effort in order to be successful in the challenging services that were offered.
Recommendation 2: Legislation will be adopted requiring that district personnel present annual reports to local boards of trustees on the level of attainment of students participating in gifted programs.
This recommendation builds on the previous one and would require that a report be provided by district personnel annually to the local board of trustees on the achievement of gifted students according to standards established by the agency.
Exemplary designation in the state plan requires that ongoing formative and summative evaluation strategies be used for substantive program improvement and reviewed by the school board.
This recommendation would require formal reports that would be made public at board meetings and would enable the community and parents to determine the progress that was being made to address the state standards for student performance.
Recommendation 3: Legislation will be adopted amending TEC 42.156 (f) to increase the $500,000 set-aside to be used to train personnel and provide program services to up to $1,000,000 so that the Texas Education Agency can provide training and develop a system to financially reward districts that attain recognized or exemplary levels of performance in services to gifted students.
Section 42.156 of the TEC states that legislative set-aside money be used to provide services that are effective and consistent with the state plan.
Districts must put local monies into services in order to attain recognized and exemplary designation.
The increased funding would be used to develop both student standards and a system of financial remuneration, and to provide the actual financial awards.
