May 13, Reuters -- NYC Mayor opposes plan for Brooklyn power plant.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg opposes a plan to build a big power plant in Brooklyn, a plant proponents say would help supply the city with much-needed electricity, City Hall said Tuesday.
"At this time, the Administration does not feel that a power plant fits within the context of ... a plan to rezone a 1.6 mile stretch of the Brooklyn waterfront," said Jennifer Falk in a statement from the mayor's office.
A private energy firm, wants to build a 1,100 megawatt natural gas-fired plant, which could supply enough power for about 1.1 million homes, on an eight-acre site with sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline between the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint.
The site is now used as fuel oil depot.
Power supplies in New York City are some of the tightest in the nation, due in part to the city's increased population and growing usage of electronic devices, like cell phones and computers.
City Hall's opposition will not necessarily halt the project, since the state controls the location of new power plants.
But the support or opposition of the local population is one factor given weight by the state siting board.
"The mayor has been working hard with the state to make sure the city has enough power," Falk said, noting the mayor is expected to make a statement in June on how the city will meet its power needs over the next decade.

May 13, The Providence Journal -- Forecast for the summer: plenty of power .
ISO-New England, the region's electricity grid operator, said yesterday that power supplies will be adequate for the peak air- conditioning and lighting season this summer.
The area with the tightest margin is southwestern Connecticut, where transmission constraints limit the flow of power, the Holyoke, MA-based group said in its annual summer-supply forecast.
"Rhode Island should have a plentiful supply to meet demand," said Ellen Foley, a spokeswoman for ISO-New England.
New England's total power-generating capacity of 31,000 megawatts provides about a 22-percent margin over the projected peak demand of 25,120 megawatts, said Stephen Whitley, ISO-New England senior vice president and chief operating officer.
"Our supply situation is the best it's been in years," Whitley said.
"In 1999 we had about 24,000 megawatts of installed capacity, compared with 31,000 megawatts now."

May 14, Atlanta Journal-Constitution -- Hacker may sit in next cubicle.
The computer hacker wasn't a devious competitor or some brainy teenager sitting at his home PC.
Instead, it was a Coca-Cola employee who slipped into the company's computer system without authorization and downloaded salary information and Social Security numbers of about 450 co-workers.
A recent computer scare at the world's largest soft-drink maker worried it enough to send an e-mail advising employees to check bank accounts and credit card balances for anything unusual, but not enough to notify police.
What may sound unusual is, in fact, business as usual when it comes to computer crime in corporate America, say experts.
The hacker who just stole your records is just as likely to be an insider as an outsider, and companies are usually reluctant to go to the police.
"There's the notoriety, bad press and Wall Street doesn't like it," said Patrick Gray, a computer security expert at Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems.

May 14, IDG News Service -- Fake bank Web site scam reaches U.S. Bank of America Corp. has warned its customers to be aware of an e-mail scam similar to ones recently perpetrated in Australia on Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Bank, and Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank.
The fraud works by sending a spoof e-mail to bank customers asking them to click on a link to a fake site resembling the real bank site, where customers are asked for their account name and password.
Fewer than 75 customer accounts were compromised in the Bank of America scam, and the bank has helped those customers change their passwords and protect their accounts.
The fraudulent site was shut down within 13 hours, and details about the e-mail distribution and its source are under investigation, Bank of America said.

May 14, Associated Press -- 16 found dead inside Texas 18-wheeler.
Sheriff's deputies searching a tractor-trailer rig in South Texas early Wednesday found 16 people dead inside.
Victoria County Sheriff's deputies made the discovery about 2 a.m. after a reported disturbance inside a trailer at a truck stop near Victoria, said Stuart Posey, an investigator with the sheriff's department.
It wasn't immediately clear how many people were in the back of the tractor-trailer when it was opened or how long they had been there, Posey said.
Victoria radio station KTXN reported that about 50 people were inside and 12 were hospitalized, including two in intensive care.
Federal immigration agents were headed to the scene, Posey said.
The truck stop is along Highway 77, about 230 miles from the Mexican border.

May 14, Washington Post -- Congress could add 36 flights at National.
Congress is considering adding as many as 36 daily flights at Reagan National Airport, a move that the airports authority and Northern Virginia officials say would create more noise over neighborhoods, crowd runways and divert growth intended for Dulles International Airport.
Local officials say attempts to add takeoffs and landings, coming three years after Congress added 24 flights at National, confirmed their worries that legislators would continue to meddle in the operations of the airport closest to Washington.
One of the most recent proposals, which is to be considered by a House subcommittee today, would add 12 shorter flights -- within 1,250 miles of the airport -- and 24 long-distance flights.
Adding 36 flights would mean two to three more takeoffs and landings every hour, airport officials said.
National is now limited to 60 takeoffs and landings per hour.
A second proposal, which passed the Senate Commerce Committee last week, would add 12 flights, all cross-country.
The issue of flights at National has resurfaced in a reauthorization bill for the Federal Aviation Administration.
However, airport officials say they've always run National and Dulles as a balancing act, with National intended for shorter flights and Dulles built to accommodate growth as well as cross-country and international flights.

May 14, Boston Globe -- Logan considers infrared security.
Logan International Airport could be one of the first airports in the country to adopt a heat-sensitive surveillance system to guard against intruders, if a system now being tested is adopted, officials said yesterday.
The system is designed to detect, locate, and track threats to the airport using infrared cameras and satellite-mapping technology.
Two video cameras mounted on Logan's control tower focus on sources of heat using infrared technology.
The larger camera is 22 inches long and 6.5 inches in diameter, weighs 22 pounds, and can track a vehicle through smoke, fog, or poor weather at a distance of more than five miles.
The smaller camera, about 10 inches tall and 16 inches long, is used for closer-range surveillance.
The cameras, which can function in the dark, zap images to a monitor in Massport's operations center inside the tower and to handheld computers carried by State Police on the ground.
Software checks for potential threats, such as a boat approaching the airport, and then pinpoints its location on a satellite image and alerts State Police.
During a demonstration yesterday, a passing fuel tanker in the waters off Logan triggered an alert.

May 14, Associated Press -- Judge orders transit fares rolled back.
A Manhattan judge ordered the nation's largest transit agency to roll back fare increases for millions of commuters, responding to a commuter group's lawsuit that the agency misled the public about its finances.
State Supreme Court Justice Louis York's order applies to more than 7 million daily riders who began paying a 50-cent fare increase on subways and buses as of May 4 and to more than 400,000 daily commuters on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road suburban trains.
His ruling followed a lawsuit by the Straphangers Campaign, a commuter group that charged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) violated the law by failing to make its financial situation clear before scheduling public hearings on the fare increase.
The judge said the MTA should put the rollback into place within two weeks.
He said the March 6 decision to raise fares an average 33.3 percent on buses and subways "should be vacated because the determination was reached in violation of lawful 4 procedure and not rationally based."
The MTA said the procedure would cost $2 million and cost the agency $1.2 million a day in lost revenue.

May 14, Wisconsin Ag Connection -- Fawns test positive for CWD near Mount Horeb.
State natural resource officials say six wild whitetail fawns have tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in Southern Wisconsin.
According to the Department of Natural Resources, two of the six fawns were 5 to 6 months old.
All of the young animals were shot in the area near Mount Horeb where CWD has infected the majority of the state's deer herd.

May 13, Indiana Ag Connection -- Import moratorium on cervids extended.
Indiana's moratorium on the importation of cervids, the family including white-tailed deer and elk, has been extended through July 29.
The original moratorium, adopted by the members of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health one year ago, was put into place to protect the state against the unintentional importation of cervids infected with chronic wasting disease.
The only means of testing for the disease requires brain tissue samples, which cannot be collected from a live animal.
Therefore, no reliable means of preventing entry of an infected animal exists under current science.
"The hope, when the board took this step one year ago, was to provide time for researchers to develop a live-animal test," said Indiana State Veterinarian Bret Marsh.
"Unfortunately, current science has not provided that much-needed option for the farmed cervid industry."

May 14, Associated Press -- Louisiana Senate grants final approval for new water conservation office.
The conservation and management of Louisiana's underground water supply would be handled by an office in the natural resources department, under legislation given final legislative approval Tuesday by the Senate.
The commissioner of conservation, who now oversees oil and gas regulation, would pick up the duties of groundwater management.
The commissioner would work with a Ground Water Management Commission to develop an emergency water use and contingency plan for large wells used by farms, municipalities and businesses and any wells that tap into aquifers deemed to be "critical groundwater areas."

May 14, Reuters -- New SARS outbreaks feared in Taiwan, Singapore.
Singapore reported a possible outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at its biggest mental hospital and Taiwan said the disease may have spread to the island's south, threatening hopes that the deadly virus was slowly coming under control.
Governments around the world have been battling to stem the spread of SARS, isolating those infected, confining anyone believed to have been exposed to the virus in quarantine and implementing stringent checks at air and sea ports.
Those moves appear to have worked in Vietnam, where five people died earlier this year, and last month the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the country SARS-free.
Singapore, with some of the world's strictest anti-SARS measures, looked to be headed in the same direction.
But the Singapore government said on Wednesday 27 patients and 10 workers at its Institute of Mental Health had been isolated with possible SARS, a slight rise from a total of 30 possible cases detected at the facility the day before.
It was unclear how they might have contracted SARS.
With the world's fourth-highest SARS death toll, Singapore had gone 15 days without a new infection, five days short of the WHO's target for being taken off a list of SARS-affected regions.

May 14, Associated Press -- FDA criticized for delays in regulating tissue transplants.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was criticized Wednesday for failing to issue regulations governing hundreds of tissue banks despite at least one death linked to infected tissue and investigations that have found widespread problems.
Senator Susan Collins, chairwoman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said she has repeatedly pressed the FDA to issue rules regulating the industry that have been pending for more than six years.
"The FDA still has not kept its commitment to addressing this public health risk," said Collins.
The regulations that have been proposed, but not finalized, would require more stringent testing of tissue before it is given to patients and would add controls for the processing of human tissue.
In prepared testimony submitted to the committee, Dr. Jesse Goodman, a top FDA official, said the agency was working to oversee the industry and was still reviewing comments on the proposed regulations.

May 14, McGill University -- Gene that controls susceptibility to tuberculosis discovered.
Investigators at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) have identified a gene that regulates the susceptibility to tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affects approximately 1.9 billion people worldwide.
However, a large proportion of these individuals do not develop tuberculosis symptoms.
Their body defense systems, or immune systems, are capable of controlling the growth of the bacteria.
"We have identified a gene that controls Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in the lung," says MUHC microbiologist and senior author Dr. Philippe Gros.
"This is an important step toward understanding why some infected individuals are able to fight off the infection and others are not.
This discovery may lead to innovative prevention and treatment strategies for the 2 million patients who die from tuberculosis yearly."

May 14, USA Today -- Terror task forces ill-prepared for job, report says.
Critical aspects of the nation's anti-terrorism strategy lack necessary resources, and law enforcement officials believe the centerpiece of the effort - a network of 66 federally managed anti-terrorism units - is "inadequate" to investigate threats, a new report concludes.
The 102-page report from the Justice Department and the Police Executive Research Forum found that the government's joint terrorism task forces are understaffed and need important analytical expertise to conduct terrorism investigations.
State and local law enforcement officials also raised long-standing concerns that they still were not being fully briefed by federal authorities about terrorist threats.
"We are more than a year past the terrorist attacks, and I'm not alone when I say that local law enforcement executives do not feel like they are in the game," said Massachusetts Public Safety Secretary Edward Flynn, one of six co-authors of the report now being circulated among law enforcement authorities.

May 14, New York Times -- Tests found fake papers helped agents enter country.
Undercover agents testing security measures at the country's airports and border crossings were repeatedly allowed to enter the country after showing customs inspectors counterfeit driver's licenses and birth certificates, Congressional officials said today.
Some of the agents, who were posing as American citizens returning to the United States from the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico, were allowed to enter without showing any documentation, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
American citizens traveling from countries in the Western Hemisphere are not required to show a passport when they return to the United States.
They must prove that they are citizens, and inspectors typically accept birth certificates, driver's licenses or baptismal records.
But citizens are not required to provide documents and they can also offer oral evidence like their home addresses and places of birth.
At a House immigration subcommittee hearing today, a senior Congressional investigator warned that terrorists and others could easily take advantage of the law by providing false documents or simply lying to inspectors about their identity.
Some Congressional officials suggested that the law should be changed to require American citizens to provide passports -- as opposed to driver's licenses or other documents -- upon their return to the United States from Latin America and Canada.

May 14, New York Times -- Tougher measures appear to be paying off.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, in remarks at a City Council hearing and to reporters afterward, said that several weeks ago, the department learned from the FBI that suspects had said that terrorist operatives now considered New York City a much more difficult environment in which to function.
"We believe a lot of things we've done, including our Operation Atlas, have acted as a deterrent," he said after testifying before the council's Public Safety Committee about the department's budget.
"That's what it's all about: prevention and deterrence.
This is feedback from the FBI indicating that potential terrorists see this as a much more difficult environment to operate in as a result of the things we've been doing."
Kelly added, however, that the city remained a high-profile target and that many law enforcement and intelligence officials believed it was a question of when, not if, New York City would be attacked again.

May 13, CNET News -- Security flaws exposed in virtual machines.
Princeton University student Sudhakar Govindavajhala has found security flaws in Java and .Net virtual machines.
The technique relies on the ability of energy to "flip bits" in memory.
While cosmic rays can very occasionally cause a random bit in memory to change value, from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, Govindavajhala decided not to wait.
He used a lamp to heat up the chips inside a computer and cause one or more bits of memory to change.
By doing so, the researcher broke the security model that virtual machine's rely on--that the computer faithfully executes its instruction set.
An attack requires physical access to the computer, so the technique poses little threat to virtual machines running on PCs and servers.
But it could be used to steal data from smart cards, Govindavajhala said Tuesday at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Symposium on Security and Privacy in Berkeley, CA.
He also pointed out that as processors and memory get faster, the energy needed to induce bit flips becomes smaller, suggesting that his technique will only become more effective.

May 13, SecurityFocus -- Security research exemption to DMCA considered.
Computer security researchers would be allowed to hack through copy protection schemes under a proposed exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) being debated in official hearings this week.
The DMCA's anti-circumvention provision generally makes it unlawful for anyone to "circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access" to DVD movies, digital music, electronic books, computer programs, or any other copyrighted work.
However, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) would like an exemption permitting white hat hackers to crack copy protection schemes "that fail to permit access to recognize shortcomings in security systems, to defend patents and copyrights, to discover and fix dangerous bugs in code, or to conduct forms of desired educational activities."

May 14, Washington Post -- Russian leader escapes Chechnya suicide attack.
At least one female bomber blew herself up in a village outside Gudermes, Chechnya, killing at least 14 people and wounding dozens.
An estimated 15,000 people were gathered to hear Akhmad Kadryov, the Moscow-appointed head of the Chechen government, and the republic's top religious leaders pray for peace and unification with Russia.
The woman managed to get within six feet of Kadryov before she detonated the bomb, according to Akhmed Abastov, who heads the region of Gudermes.
Kadryov escaped harm but several of his bodyguards were reported to be seriously wounded or dead.
The attack followed a massive explosion Monday at a government compound in northern Chechnya that killed 59 people and seriously wounded more than 100 others.
The back-to-back bombings are the worst acts of violence in the southern republic in five months.
Law-enforcement officials identified the suicide bomber as a local Chechen with ties to a rebel unit led by Shamil Basayev, Chechnya's best-known militant commander.

May 14, Los Angeles Times -- Precision timing marks bombers' attack.
The Vinnell compound was the last of three bombings that shook Riyadh on Monday night.
Within about a five-minute time frame, the explosions ripped through Vinnell and two other compounds for foreigners, killing at least 29 people - including the bombers - and injuring almost 200 others, according to U.S. military and Saudi officials.
The tight sequence of events, timed so no one attack might lead to alerts and lockdowns elsewhere in the capital, was meticulously planned, U.S. military and Saudi officials said.
The attacks involved extensive intelligence and almost certainly information from people who had been inside, because the target was the most populated building in the compound run by Vinnell, a Virginia-based company that has operated in Saudi Arabia for 29 years.
Vinnell was hit harder than either of the other two compounds in northeast Riyadh, the Al Hamra Oasis Village and Jadawel, U.S. officials said.
"In terms of the physical damage and casualties, this was the worst, in part because this was much older architecture and construction.
So the blast effect had much greater impact," said the U.S. general who is assigned to assist the Saudi military.

May 14, Associated Press -- Bomb injures several in Yemeni court.
A bomb exploded Wednesday in a Yemeni court, wounding several people in the same place where a suspected al-Qaeda militant was condemned to death last week for killing three U.S. missionaries, security officials said.
The explosion ripped through the courtroom in Jibla, 125 miles south of the Yemeni capital of San'a, officials said.
Police said a judge was injured but he 11 was not the one who had sentenced the militant.
Witnesses said they saw victims being taken away in ambulances.
It was not immediately clear if anybody was killed.
Security officials surrounded the court building Wednesday and cordoned it off.
Police said they detained a suspect in the courtyard.
On Saturday, the court condemned to death Abed Abdul Razak Kamel, 30, after convicting him of the Dec. 30 shooting deaths of Kathleen A. Gariety of Wauwatosa, Wis., Martha C. Myers of Montgomery, Ala., and William E. Koehn of Kansas.
The killings took place at the Southern Baptist-run hospital in Jibla.

May 14, Associated Press -- Japanese police raid cult's facilities.
Police on Wednesday raided several facilities and searched two dozen vehicles owned by a cult whose members have riveted Japan as they travel across the country in an all-white caravan, warning the end of the world is near.
Dozens of investigators searched the Pana Wave Laboratory cult's main facility in Fukui, western Japan, and its dome-shaped shelters at a mountain village north of Tokyo on suspicion the group falsified vehicle registrations, police said.
Clad in white robes, headscarves and boots, the cult followers are suspected of nothing more serious than traffic violations.
But their doomsday warnings and eccentric behavior have unnerved many Japanese, reminding them of the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which started out as a small yoga class and later carried out a deadly nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways in 1995.

May 09, American National Standards Institute -- Charter agreed and initial priorities set for ANSI homeland security standards panel.
Planning for the work of the ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel (ANSI-HSSP) continued this week as members of an Interim Steering Committee (ISC) agreed on a charter and the formation of four coordinating committees.
The May 7 meeting was the second time members of the ISC gathered to lay the groundwork for the Panel and prepare for the first full ANSI-HSSP meeting at the Gaithersburg, Maryland campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology on June 9 and 10, 2003.
According to Dr. Bert Coursey, a DHS spokesperson, key among immediate needs is the coordination of standards and evaluation methods for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) detection technologies, including those used for chemical, radiological, nuclear and biological weapons.
Coursey reports that the DHS is already engaging with other U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, to advance work that is underway or completed in the WMD arena.
