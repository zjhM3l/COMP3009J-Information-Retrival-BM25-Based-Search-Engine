Amendment No. 6 (H.J.R. No. 23)
Wording of Ballot Proposition:
The constitutional amendment permitting refinancing of a home equity loan with a reverse mortgage.
Analysis of Proposed Amendment:
The proposed constitutional amendment amends Section 50(f), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, by providing that a home equity loan may be refinanced in a manner that converts the loan into a reverse mortgage.
Background
In 1997 the legislature proposed and the voters approved a constitutional amendment broadening the states long-standing limitations on the situations in which a persons homestead may be taken for payment of the persons debts.
That amendment allowed for two new types of loans that could be secured using a homestead as collateral.
One of these is a home equity loan, under which a borrower is advanced money, which may be used for any purpose the borrower wishes, and the lender is allowed to foreclose on the borrowers homestead if the borrower fails to repay the loan.
The other type of loan is a reverse mortgage, another loan of money that may be used for any purpose but under which the borrower is generally not required to repay the money or interest on the money until the borrower dies or moves out of the home.
Under current law, a reverse mortgage may be made only to a borrower 62 years of age or older.
A reverse mortgage allows an older borrower to convert the equity accumulated in the borrowers home into money that may be used for current expenses.
Both types of loans have restrictions on how the loans must be made, repaid, and collected, although the restrictions on home equity loans are more extensive than those on reverse mortgages.
One of the restrictions, which the proposed constitutional amendment would remove, requires that a home equity loan that is refinanced must be refinanced only with another home equity loan and may not be converted to a reverse mortgage.
Home equity loans became available reasonably soon after the adoption of the 1997 amendment.
Because the amendment contained provisions relating to reverse mortgages that did not conform to federal law, however, reverse mortgages did not become available until several years later.
The same change proposed by this constitutional amendment is also being proposed, among other constitutional changes, by Proposition 16 (S.J.R. No. 42), which is being submitted to the voters at this election.
Argument For:
Reverse mortgages are a very popular means for seniors to supplement their income by tapping the equity in their homes.
Beginning in 1998, there were several years when home equity loans were available but reverse mortgages were not offered.
During this period many persons who would have preferred reverse mortgages obtained home equity loans instead.
The proposed amendment would allow those borrowers to convert their existing home equity loans into reverse mortgages.
Argument Against:
Reverse mortgages are not subject to all the extensive safeguards that home equity loans are.
Elderly persons, who may tend to be more susceptible to unscrupulous or uncaring lending practices, may be victimized by lenders who would use such practices to convince elderly borrowers under home equity loans to convert those loans to reverse mortgages under terms unfairly favorable to the lender.
