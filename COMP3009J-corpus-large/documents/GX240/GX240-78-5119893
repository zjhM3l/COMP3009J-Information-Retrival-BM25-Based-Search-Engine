T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF NORTH CAROLINA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the North Carolina Geological Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
In 1999, the preliminary estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for North Carolina was $761 million, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
This was about a 1% increase from that of 19982 and followed a 1.1% increase from 1997 to 1998.
The State increased to 18th from 19th in rank among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which North Carolina accounted for about 2% of the U.S. total.
In 1999, the increased value of crushed stone, and less so dimension stone, accounted for most of the State's rise in value.
These gains were offset somewhat by decreases in phosphate rock, construction sand and gravel, and lithium minerals, in descending order of change (table 1).
In 1998, increases in the values of crushed stone and phosphate rock significantly offset a substantial decrease in the value of lithium minerals and smaller decreases in construction and industrial sand and gravel and feldspar.
Lithium mineral production ceased with the 1998 closure of FMC Corp., Lithium Division's, spodumene mine and lithium carbonate plant at Cherryville near Bessemer City, NC. _____________ 1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1999 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of May 2000, and are expected to change.
For some mineral commodities, such as, construction sand and gravel and crushed stone, estimates are updated periodically.
To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.
A telephone listing for the specialists may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/contacts/comdir.html, by using MINES FaxBack at (703) 648-4999 from a fax machine with a touch-tone handset (request Document #1000 for a telephone listing of all mineral commodity specialists), or by calling USGS information at (703) 648-4000 for the specialist's name and number.
All Mineral Industry Surveys--mineral commodity, State, and country--also may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals; facsimile copies may be obtained from MINES FaxBack.
2 Values, percentage calculations, and rankings for 1998 may vary from the Minerals Yearbook, Area Reports: Domestic 1998, Volume II, owing to the revision of preliminary 1998 to final 1998 data.
Data for 1999 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also be subject to change.
Based upon 1999 USGS estimates of the quantities of minerals produced in the 50 States, North Carolina continued as the leading State in feldspar, mica, and pyrophyllite; second in common clays and second of 2 States that produced olivine; and seventh in industrial sand and gravel and peat.
Whereas the State rose to 3d from 5th in the production of gemstones and to 9th from 13th in dimension stone, it decreased to 3d from 2d of four States that produce phosphate rock and to 8th from 7th in crushed stone.
North Carolina mines exclusively have produced industrial minerals since the early 1970's, particularly since the 1971 closing of the Tungsten Queen Mine, an underground tungsten mine in Vance County.
Metal production in the State, especially that of primary aluminum, resulted from the processing of recycled materials or raw materials received from other domestic and foreign sources.
The North Carolina Geological Survey3 (NCGS) expanded the "Minerals Information" portion of its Internet site.
The additions include (1) information about permitted active and inactive mines (including regional mine location maps, contacts, and other data); (2) geochemistry data and information (stream sediment and domestic well and stream water geochemical data for North Carolina from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation Program); (3) listings of historic North Carolina mineral commodity data and geologic information (located at the NCGS Raleigh (Archdale Building) and Asheville offices); (4) information about obtaining mining permits; (5) a list of reports (primarily on industrial minerals) by the North Carolina State University Minerals Research Laboratory, Asheville (URL http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/mrl); and (6) links to other sites of interest.
There is a renewed focus by the NCGS on Geographic Information System (GIS) geologic map making, data base acquisition and preparation, and mineral-resource studies.
In 1999, work began on data entry for the National Geologic Mapping Database.
Additional information about NCGS activities can be found on the Internet at URL http://www. geology.enr.state.nc.us.
