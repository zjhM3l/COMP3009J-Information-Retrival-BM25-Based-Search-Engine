A GUIDE T O VIRGINIA PR O T OCOL AND TRADITIONS FOREW ORD he Practical Protocol Guide was first compiled and published in 1977.
The many visiting dignitaries and official functions encountered during the 1976 bicentennial year in Virginia brought about many questions regarding protocol and procedure.
The Guide was developed for use by the Governor's Office and those directly associated with the office and its activities.
It was intended as a concise reference outlining recommended, acceptable practices consistent with modern lifestyle and approved social usage.
It was not meant to address all contingencies but to set forth some rules that could be applied and lead to logical solutions.
There were many people and agencies involved in the original Guide, including personnel in the Governor's Office, the Department of Military Affairs, the Military District of Washington, the Department of Planning and Budget, the Virginia House of Delegates, the Virginia Senate, the Division of Capitol Police, the Department of General Services, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Special Events Office of Colonial Williamsburg.
Anne Geddy Cross and Trudy E. Norf leet performed in-depth and wideranging research and Martha U. Pritchard and Robert H. Kirby contributed significantly through extensive review and suggestions to content.
Additional questions arose and subsequent expanded editions of the Guide were produced in 1987 and 1989.
In 2002, copies were no longer available and Bruce F. Jamerson, Clerk of the House of Delegates; Susan Clarke Schaar, Clerk of the Senate; and William H. Leighty, Chief of Staff to the Governor, organized a group of knowledgeable state employees along with Anne Cross and Trudy Norf leet to produce this publication.
Personnel from most of the original agencies supported this project.
Assistance also came from staff at the Supreme Court of Virginia, the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the Library of Virginia, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Executive Mansion.
It is hoped that the procedures and guidelines suggested in this publication will assist users in formulating answers to their questions based on accepted practices and common sense.

52 ii 1 PR O T OCOL Precedence General Rules Another rule of precedence to remember is that in a limousine the right rear seat is the seat of honor.
It is impossible to address individual situations in a publication of this nature.
Sound reasoning and practical application of established precedence should be applied to determine appropriate ranking at a specific event.
Two events with guest rankings are provided as examples at the end of this section.
W e bster's Dictionary defines "precedence" as "the right to superior honor on a ceremonial or formal occasion" or "the order of ceremonial or formal preference."
Precedence is still determined by basic principles first set forth in the Eight Articles adopted by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
These principles resulted in the official precedence used today which is firmly set in Washington, D.C. and in all foreign capitals.
Despite established rules, there are many situations which can alter the order of precedence; therefore, the U.S. Department of State does not publish its complete precedence list.
Those wishing to obser ve str ict protocol may send names and titles to the U.S. Department of State for suggested precedence.
Unlike the federal government, there is no fixed order of precedence for state and local government officials.
Generally, state precedence follows the same order as federal precedence.
When several state officials of the same rank from different states are present, their ranking is determined by their state's admission to the Union.
A listing of these dates is found on page 31.
When dealing with the American precedence, there are several rules which always hold true and which may differ from what one would assume the order of precedence to be.
First, no one outranks a governor in his own state except the President or Vice President of the United States.
Secondly, no one outranks a mayor in his own city or town or the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors in his own county except the Governor of the state or the President or Vice President of the United States.
Federal Order The following unofficial list of precedence indicates the most usual order for various dignitaries: The President of the United States The Vice President of the United States The Speaker of the House of Representatives The Chief Justice of the United States Former Presidents of the United States The Secretary of State The Secretary General of the United Nations Ambassadors of Foreign Powers Widows of former Presidents of the United States Ministers of Foreign Powers (Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions) Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States The Cabinet Chief of Staff for the President Director of the Office of Management and Budget United States Representative to the United Nations The Senate Governors of States Former Vice Presidents of the United States The House of Representatives Charges d'affaires of Foreign Powers The Under Secretaries of the Executive Departments and the Deputy Secretaries Administrator of the Agency for International Development Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors It is important to remember that for purposes such as seating the spouses of officials take on the rank of their spouses.
They do not have their own rank unless they also hold an office.
One exception to this is widows of former presidents who do have official standing.
At a public dinner to which the President of the United States has been invited and sends his or her spouse as representative, that representative is accorded the same rank as the President.
This could also be true of governors in their own state, but not other federal or state government officials.
1 1 PR O T OCOL Chairman of the Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chiefs of Staff of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force (ranked according to date of appointment) Commandant of the Marine Corps (5 Star) Generals of the Army and Fleet Admirals The Secretary General of the Organization of American States Representatives of the Organization of American States Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Administrator of the General Services Administration Director of the U.S. Information Agency Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Chairman of the Civil Service Commission Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness Director of the Peace Corps Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity Special Assistants to the President Deputy Under Secretaries of State Assistant Secretaries of the Executive Departments Chief of Protocol of the United States Members of the Council of Economic Advisers Active or Designate United States Ambassadors and Ministers (career rank, when in the United States) Under Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force (4 Star) Generals and Admirals Assistant Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force (3 Star) Lieutenant Generals and Vice Admirals Former United States Ambassadors and Ministers to Foreign Countries Ministers of Foreign Powers (serving in Embassies, not accredited) Deputy Assistant Secretaries of the Executive Departments Deputy Chief of Protocol Counselors of Embassies or Legations of Foreign Powers (2 Star) Major Generals and Rear Admirals (1 Star) Brigadier Generals and Commodores Assistant Chiefs of Protocol Virginia Order Directed by previous practice, similarities on the Federal list, and established relationships, the following list is suggested as a guide to Virginia's precedence: Governor Lieutenant Governor Attorney General U.S. Senators for Virginia U.S. Representatives for Virginia Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia President Pro Tempore of the Senate of Virginia Former Governors Active and retired Justices of the Supreme Court of Virginia Federal Judges Governor's Secretaries Secretary of the Commonwealth Widows of former Governors Members of the Senate of Virginia * Members of the Virginia House of Delegates * Judges of the Court of Appeals of Virginia Judges of Courts of Record Mayors of Cities ** Chairmen of Boards of Supervisors ** Mayors of Towns ** Former Lieutenant Governors Former Attorney Generals Appointed Heads of State Departments and Institutions Chairmen of Boards of Departments and Institutions Executive Assistants to the Governor * Within the House of Delegates and the Senate, members are ranked according to their seniority.
** This order of precedence changes when in own jurisdiction; see Precedence, page 1.
One of the important factors in establishing their precedence is the size and importance of the jurisdiction.
2 1 PR O T OCOL Armed Forces The order of precedence for members of the armed forces follows the order of precedence of the services: Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
As an example, a Marine Captain has equal rank with an Army Captain but is seated below him at the table.
If a foreign dignitary is arriving on a military base, a conf lict may arise between the ranking local official and the base commander.
Generally speaking, if the base is Army Marine Corps just being used for transportation and will not be toured, the local official should take precedence and head the receiving line at the arrival ceremony.
The Protocol Officer on the military base should be consulted for appropriate procedure.
When considering the ranking of military personnel at a social event, the following order of precedence, prepared by the Department of Defense, may be helpful: Navy Air Force Commissioned Personnel General (5 Stars) General (4 Stars) Lieutenant General (3 Stars) Major General (2 Stars) Brigadier General (1 Star) Colonel Lieutenant Colonel Major Captain First Lieutenant Second Lieutenant (no equivalent) General (4 Stars) Lieutenant General (3 Stars) Major General (2 Stars) Brigadier General (1 Star) Colonel Lieutenant Colonel Major Captain First Lieutenant Second Lieutenant Fleet Admiral Admiral Vice Admiral General (5 Stars) General (4 Stars) Lieutenant General (3 Stars) Major General (2 Stars) Brigadier General (1 Star) Colonel Lieutenant Colonel Major Captain First Lieutenant Second Lieutenant Rear Admiral Commodore Captain Commander Lieutenant Commander Lieutenant Lieutenant Junior Grade Ensign Warrant Personnel Chief Warrant Officer W-4 Chief Warrant Officer W-3 Chief Warrant Officer W-2 Chief Warrant Officer W-1 Chief Warrant Officer W-4 Chief Warrant Officer W-3 Chief Warrant Officer W-2 Chief Warrant Officer W-1 Chief Warrant Officer W-4 Chief Warrant Officer W-3 Chief Warrant Officer W-2 Chief Warrant Officer W-1 The Air Force no longer has Warrant Officers.
3 1 PR O T OCOL Marine Corps Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Sergeant Major or Master Gunnery Sergeant Navy Enlisted Personnel Army Sergeant Major of Army Air Force Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Chief Master Sergeant or Command Chief Master Sergeant Senior Master Sergeant or First Sergeant Master Sergeant or First Sergeant Technical Sergeant Master Chief Petty Officer of Navy Command Sergeant Major or Sergeant Major Master Chief Petty Officer or Fleet Command Master Chief Petty Officer Senior Chief Petty Officer First Sergeant or Master Sergeant First Sergeant or Master Sergeant Platoon Sergeant or Sergeant First Class Staff Sergeant Gunnery Sergeant Chief Petty Officer Staff Sergeant Petty Officer First Class Petty Officer Second Class Petty Officer Third Class Seaman Seaman Apprentice Seaman Recruit Sergeant Sergeant Staff Sergeant Corporal or Specialist Private First Class Private E-2 Private E-1 Corporal Sergeant Lance Corporal Private First Class Private Airman First Class Airman Airman Basic Coast Guard personnel are ranked as the Navy.
Virginia National Guard personnel are ranked as the Army (Army National Guard) and Air Force (Air National Guard).
4 1 PR O T OCOL Forms of Address The Honorable In the federal government, The Honorable is used to address, by name, high officials and former high officials of the American government (this includes officials who have held a commission), foreign ministers, and heads of international organizations.
A person once entitled to The Honorable continues to be so addressed.
A wife or husband does not share the other's official title.
Your Honor is never used, nor is The Honorable used with militar y or scholastic rank.
The Honorable is used in addressing, by name: American Ambassadors American Ministers (as a diplomatic title, not a religious title) American Representatives in international organizations Assistant Heads of independent federal agencies Assistant Secretaries of executive departments and officers of comparable rank Assistants to the President Cabinet officers Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives Commissioners Commissioners of Washington D.C.
Counselor of the Department of State Foreign Ministers (as a diplomatic title, not a religious title) Heads of major organizations in federal agencies Heads of international organizations (unless entitled to "His Excellency" by reason of a position previously held), alternates, deputies, and assistant heads High Commissioners Judges (Justices of the Supreme Court excepted) Legal Advisor of the Department of State President of the United States (if addressed by name) Public Printer Members of the U.S. House of Representatives Secretary of the U.S. Senate Secretary to the President United States Senators Sergeants at Arms of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives Under Secretaries of executive departments U.S. Representatives, alternates, and deputies to international organizations Vice President of the United States In state and local government, the practice of conferring The Honorable should not be overused to the extent that it becomes less meaningful.
It is recommended that the following list be used as a guide in conferring The Honorable to state and local government officials: Governor Lieutenant Governor Attorney General Justices of the Supreme Court Judges Mayors Governor's Chief of Staff Governor's Secretaries (such as Secretary of Administration) Commissioners of the State Corporation Commission and Workers' Compensation Commission State Legislators Clerks of the Senate and House of Delegates Elected Members of County Boards of Supervisors, City Councils and Town Councils Secretary of the Commonwealth Elected Constitutional Officers Excellency Only three states, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and South Carolina have written into their laws that the title Excellency is to be used for their governor.
In other states the use of this title is only a courtesy.
Etiquette books disagree on whether or not the term should be used and, if so, when it should be employed.
Historically, Excellency has been strictly a title reserved for foreign ambassadors.
Its use in America probably derived from colonial times when the British Royal Governors were addressed as "Your Excellency."
It seems more American to address governors of states as The Honorable rather than in the same manner as their British counterparts.
This preserves the dignity of the Governor's title without being overly pretentious.
If one wishes to use the term Excellency on occasion, perhaps the most appropriate time would be when announcing the Governor at a formal occasion, as in: "His Excellency, John H. Doe, Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia."
5 1 PR O T OCOL Esquire Esquire is a complimentary title.
It is correct only when addressing an envelope and is always proper form to a lawyer and a clerk of court.
On social correspondence the abbreviation is correct but is generally written in full in writing to a diplomat.
The title of Esquire is of British origin and was once used to denote the eldest son of a knight or members of a younger branch of a noble house.
Later, all graduates of universities, professionals, literary men, and important landholders were given the right to this title, which even today denotes a man of education.
All formally engraved invitations are addressed to Mr. Stanley Smith; written invitations and other personal letters may be addressed to Stanley Smith, Esquire.
Mr. and Esquire are never used in the same address.
Federal Officials President of the United States Address The President The White House* Salutation Dear Mr. President Dear Madam President Conversation Mr. President Madam President On a Place Card The President * The address is to be indented two spaces on each line.
This style should be applied throughout this section.
Former President of the United States Address The Honorable John/Jane Dodd Salutation Dear Mr./Mrs./Miss Dodd Conversation Mr./Mrs./Miss Dodd On a Place Card Mr./Mrs./Miss Dodd Vice President of the United States Address The Vice President United States Senate Salutation Dear Mr./Madam Vice President Conversation Mr./Madam Vice President On a Place Card The Vice President Assistant to the President Address The Honorable John/Jane Smith Assistant to the President Salutation Dear Mr./Mrs./Miss Smith Conversation Mr./Mrs./Miss Smith On a Place Card Mr./Mrs./Miss Smith Courtesy Titles In official and social usage, every individual's name is preceded by a courtesy title such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., The Honorable, etc.
Ms. is sometimes used when the marital status of a woman is unknown or she prefers that title.
Ms. is not used in diplomatic or official correspondence.
In those cases, Miss is used rather than Mrs. when the marital status is not known.
Salutation and Complimentary Close There are many optional variations, both formal and informal, in forms of address, especially in the salutation and complimentar y close.
For example, to the Vice President: Salutation: Sir: or Madam: (formal) Complimentary Close: Very truly yours, (formal) Sincerely yours, (informal) The U.S. Department of State has adopted the informal style of address for American officials.
This is a matter of personal preference and relates to how well the addressee is known to the addresser as well as the content of the letter.
The following official forms of address seem most consistent with common practice in Virginia.
The complimentary close has been omitted as the individual writing the letter best decides this.
Forms of address for purely social correspondence are discussed on page 13.

Below are general rules that may serve as guidelines for individual situations.
The full rank is usually used as a title when addressing letters and in formal introductions.
When used in the greeting, the full rank is usually shortened.
For instance, the salutation for a Lieutenant Colonel would be "Colonel."
The address or formal introduction for a first sergeant would include the full title.
The salutation for correspondence to a first sergeant would be "Sergeant."
A chief petty officer would be greeted as "Chief."
To assist in addressing letters or invitations when spouses are included, some of these examples include a spouse with the same name and a spouse with a different name.

12 1 PR O T OCOL Social Correspondence Envelopes for social correspondence of top government officials, e.g.
The President, The Governor, Vice President, Lieutenant Governor, Chief Justice, and Attorney General, do not include the surname with the title.
The title stands alone as follows: The President The White House The Chief Justice The Supreme Court When a spouse is included, the envelope would be addressed as follows: The President and Mrs. Doe The White House If the spouse of an official has his or her own title, it should be addressed as follows: The President and Dr. Doe If the spouse of an official uses a different surname, it should be addressed as follows: The President and Ms. Jane Smith ("First Lady" is an unofficial title and should never be used except in informal introductions.)
The Chief Justice and Mrs. Winston The Supreme Court (or a home address) The social address for an Associate Justice differs slightly and includes the surname of the Justice.
Mr. Justice Randolph and Mrs. Randolph The Supreme Court (or a home address) (On social correspondence for other officials when an honorific such as "The Honorable" is used and a spouse is included, neither the honorific nor the title of the addressee should apply to the spouse.
In fact, the title could be omitted if desired.)

Many invitations include a reply card of some kind.
The use of reply cards has become more casual.
They are an expedience for guests and an efficient way for the host group to sort and handle a large number of replies.
Even the White House often uses reply cards in various sizes so that the responses to different events may be handled quickly.
When reply cards are included with invitations, it is recommended that they be used.
If a telephone number or e-mail address is given for response, the reply may be made by telephone or e-mail and a record maintained of the details of the call for file purposes.
Formal Invitations All formal invitations are worded in the third person and their acceptances and regrets are answered in the same form and by hand.
Formal invitations may be engraved, partially engraved, or handwritten.
If partially engraved, all information to be added should be handwritten, preferably in black ink.
Reply to Formal Invitations A reply to a formal invitation should be written in long hand on fine quality white or off-white double-fold stationer y.
The only exception to this is when an invitation is sent to a man or woman at an office address.
In this case, the reply may be on personal or business stationary.
Replies are handwritten in the same form and wording as the invitation.
Mr., Mrs., Ms., and Dr. are the only abbreviations that should be used in any sort of reply, and the name of each sender should be mentioned.
Courtesy titles should never be used when referring to oneself.
An acceptance to an invitation should specify the date, hour, and place and always say "the kind invitation."
A regret to an invitation should refer only to the date, not the hour (the year should not be used in any type of response).
One should speak of "the kind invitation" or "very kind invitation" when writing a regret.
It is a courtesy to give a reason for regretting an invitation.
The formal excuses are standardized and the only ones considered valid are illness, a previous engagement, or absence from the city.
(An invitation to the White House is a valid and necessary reason for regretting all other, even previously accepted, invitations.)
If the invitation is from the White House, a reason for not accepting is always given.
The four valid reasons for regretting an invitation from the White House are severe illness, absence in some distant place from which return is obviously impossible, the death of a very close relative, or a family wedding.
No matter what form an invitation takes or what manner is used for reply, invitations should always receive a timely response.
If circumstances prevent a timely reply, it is still courteous to reply after the requested time and before the event.
Informal Invitations Informal invitations are issued to state officials in various forms and ways.
In addition to the above general recommendations, below is a suggested response to informal printed invitations from individuals, groups, or organizations without a reply card, or when a card is only for acceptances or contributions.
For invitations extended by letter, with or without a printed invitation accompanying it, responses should be made by letter with the official's signature.

On many invitations the dress is indicated as white tie, informal, casual, etc., but even then uncer tainty often exists as to the meaning of the terms.
As one of the purposes of this book is to address practices as clearly as possible, the following dress definitions are offered.
Informal or Semi-formal Men: Business suits Women: Dresses, short or long informal Casual Men and Women: Sports clothes to fit the activities planned; no coats or ties for men.
Military Civilian terms often do not properly describe militar y attire.
When the function is primarily a militar y affair, the armed services involved should be contacted for the best terminology to describe what the appropriate attire will be.
Formal White tie means full evening dress tailcoats and white ties for men; long evening dresses for women.
Black tie means tuxedos or dinner jackets for men; f loor length or short evening dresses for women.
For the Inauguration of the Governor of Virginia, males in the official party wear morning coats and women wear dark suits.
18 1 PR O T OCOL Receiving Line A receiving line should be as short as possible, and the order of persons depends upon the formality of the occasion.
In an official function for high-ranking dignitaries, the Department of State follows this sequence: host/hostess, guest of honor, guest of honor's spouse, host's/hostess' spouse.
(If the last person in line is female, a man should be added so a woman will not be left at the end of the line.)
An alternate order, equally appropriate, is: host, hostess, guest of honor, and spouse of guest of honor.
When the guest of honor is a head of state or government, the host and hostess relinquish their positions.
The sequence is: Chief of State, spouse of Chief of State, host, hostess, and possibly another man.
At an unofficial function, the hostess is first in the receiving line, then the guest of honor, the host, and the spouse of the guest of honor.
For a Governor's formal reception, it is customary for the Adjutant General of Virginia or his designee to stand at the entrance of the reception room to receive the names of the guests and convey them to the Governor by merely turning to him and saying "Mr. Johnson."
Guests do not shake hands with the Adjutant General, military designee or military aide and, in case of couples, give only the last name(s).
A military aide may be placed at the end of the line to facilitate movement of the guests and to prevent a woman from being at the end of the receiving line.

Lt. of General Spouse Spouse Chief Speaker The of Spouse Adjutant 19 Spouse of of Chief or of of Aide 1 PR O T OCOL Dinners and Luncheons Seating Head Table Seating arrangements for a head table often cause unnecessary concern.
As in other matters of protocol, courtesy and sound reasoning are the best guides, for many factors can alter established procedure.
The following guide is to be considered in this light.
At a formal occasion, the head table is arranged in order of precedence.
If the guest of honor is to make an address, he sits to the right of the master of ceremonies at the center of the table.
The second ranking guest sits at the left of the master of ceremonies and so on in alternating fashion.
If at all possible, two women should not be seated together and a woman should not be left at the end of the table.
A woman (or man) always takes the rank of her husband (or wife).
Spouse of The Former Governor Spouse of The Speaker of The House When space permits, places are set along only one side of the table so the guests of honor face the tables at which the other guests are seated.
The following is an example of seating for state functions where the Speaker of the House of Delegates is the Master of Ceremonies and the Governor is the Guest of Honor.
Seated at the head table are: The Governor and spouse The Speaker of the House of Delegates and spouse A former Governor and spouse A State Senator and spouse The local Mayor and spouse A city official The Local Mayor State Senator The Governor Spouse of Spouse of The Spouse of The The A Speaker of The Former State Local City The House Governor Governor Senator Mayor Official Lectern 20 1 Tables of Eight At official functions, it is difficult to observe strict protocol when seating a table of eight.
It may be easier to increase the number to ten.
If not, either the correct order of precedence or the alternate seating of men and women must be sacrificed as shown below.

Governor Spouse of Former Lt. Governor Spouse of State Delegate 23 1 PR O T OCOL Example 2 A corporation located in Richmond hosts a dinner held in Richmond, Virginia.
Attendees are: the Mayor of Richmond, the Mayor of Norfolk, the U.S. Secretary of Education (the guest speaker), the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, a Virginia Congressman (not from Richmond), a member of the Richmond City Council, a member of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, and the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County.
Their ranking would be: Mayor of Richmond U.S. Secretary of Education Virginia Congressman Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Mayor of Norfolk/Fairfax County Board Chairman Member of Richmond City Council/Member of Prince William County Board of Supervisors (If the dinner were in honor of the Norfolk Mayor or if he were the host, he would be seated in a higher position at the table.
The Mayor and the Chairman are ranked equally.
The Council Member and the Board Member are also ranked equally.)
Special Events When mixing federal, state, and local officials, official rank and sound reasoning determine precedence.
The purpose of the function must also be taken into consideration.
If the order of precedence is being used to make table arrangements, the host and hostess assume a new position in seating.
A mayor of a large city might be placed after a U.S. Senator or member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
However, if the event were being held in the Mayor's city, only the Governor, the U.S. President, or the U.S. Vice President would outrank him.
One protocol book suggests that Lieutenant Governors in their own states equate to a Deputy or Under Secretary of an executive department on the federal level.
Example 1 The Governor of Virginia is hosting a dinner at a Governor's Conference in Williamsburg, Virginia.
An event of this nature is generally considered more of a national event than a state event, and federal precedence is applied.
Attending are: a member of the U.S. Senate from Virginia, 12 other southern governors, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, a Virginia State Senator, two members of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Mayor of Williamsburg, and a member of the Williamsburg City Council.
Their ranking would be: Governor of Virginia Mayor of Williamsburg Member of the U.S. Senate from Virginia Governors in order of states' admission to the Union Virginia Lieutenant Governor Virginia State Senator Members of the Virginia House of Delegates* Member of Williamsburg City Council Place Cards For seated occasions of more than eight people, place cards eliminate confusion and provide identification.
Place cards should be simple, as they are not intended to be a decoration but to serve a practical purpose.
Names should be clearly legible.
The names are usually written as you would introduce one guest to another, e.g.
Mr. Randolph, Commander Brown, or Mrs. Williams.
However, certain dignitaries are so important that their place cards are written by title alone.
Their position is usually of the sort that only one person at a time can hold, e.g.
The President, The Vice President, The Attorney General, The American Ambassador, The Governor, etc.
Other notables have their names in addition to titles, e.g. Justice Fair, Senator Essex, etc.
For spouses of officials, the place cards are simply written Mrs. (or Mr.) Tait; titled women are given their titles, as "Duchess of Windsor" or "Lady Gloria Glover."
(See also Forms of Address) * If two members of a house of the Virginia General Assembly rank equally, they may be seated alphabetically.
The highest-ranking man usually sits at the right of the hostess and the wife of the highest-ranking man sits at the right of the host for unofficial occasions.
However, when seating according to true precedence, the highestranking man is seated at the right of the hostess and the highest-ranking woman (who may not be the wife of the highest-ranking man) is seated at the right of the host.
The second ranking man is seated at the left of the hostess and the second ranking woman at the left of the host.
24 1 PR O T OCOL Precedence to Dining Room At a formal dinner at the Executive Mansion, the Governor leads the way into the dining room, escorting the highest-ranking guest of the opposite sex.
The Governor's spouse and his or her escort enter last.
At a large, public, official function, the host escorts the highest-ranking female guest, followed by the hostess and the guest of honor.
These two couples lead the way to dinner.
If the guest of honor is a woman, the host escorts her to dinner first.
They are followed by the hostess and the highest-ranking male guest.
The hostess and the guest of honor lead the way only if the guest of honor is extremely high ranking.
subject and sequence should be made known to the ranking foreign guest who will respond to them.
Some reference to the guest's country is usually made.
Toasts are usually offered with champagne or dessert wine during or after the dessert course.
A guest being toasted does not drink and remains seated.
Everyone present, without rising, drinks the general toast "To your health."
The general format for a toast to a chief of state is "His Excellency, The President of the French Republic."
Toastmaster The chairman, toastmaster, or master of ceremonies sits at the center of the most prominent table.
After the dessert is served, the toastmaster rises makes a few remarks ending with a reference to first speaker.
The toastmaster then introduces speaker by saying, "It gives me great pleasure introduce Dr. Marvin Blackburn." and the the to Toasts Ceremonial toasts require advance planning by the host who should consider the occasion, the guest of honor, and the country of the latter.
There are times when toasts are expected and other times when a short welcoming speech to the honored guest is more appropriate.
When ceremonial toasting is to occur, the 25 1 PR O T OCOL Foreign Visitors Many foreign visitors come to Virginia to meet with the Governor and state officials or to attend various conferences or special events.
It is important that the host is familiar with the customs of the visitor's particular country; what gifts, food, and activities are appropriate; the proper form of address; what gestures that are common to an American really mean in the visitor's country; and any other bits of information that will make both the host and the visitor more comfortable during the visit.
It would entail extensive narration to address these aspects for the many countries represented by visitors to Virginia.
It is more practical to provide several resources that the host could use to determine the best way to conduct business and entertain a guest from a particular foreign country.

26 2 IN A UGURA TION Ã¯Â¿Â½ At the request of the Commonwealth Inaugural Committee, the Department of Military Affairs arranges for placement and firing of the cannon to honor the newly sworn in Governor with a 19-gun salute.
It is traditional that the casing of the first shot fired be presented to the Governor.
They also provide the jet flyby, if one is scheduled.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Since the Speaker of the House of Delegates presides over the swearing-in ceremony, the Clerk of the House provides valuable information on the procedures, the finances, the traditions, and the many details of the day's activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Capitol Police provide security for the day's activities within the Capitol building and Capitol Square and transportation for members of the General Assembly, when requested.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Virginia State Police provide security for the dignitaries and the general areas surrounding the Capitol Square as well as transportation for the principals where needed.
The schedule of activities on the day of Inauguration may var y somewhat.
Some incoming officials have requested a service at a downtown church.
Some have had a Prayer Breakfast or an early morning reception for General Assembly members and invited guests.
No matter what activity is chosen, the public swearing-in ceremony traditionally begins at 12 noon.
Participants gather in different parts of the Capitol to organize for their entry onto the inaugural platform.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Ceremonial Inaugural Committee, dressed in formal attire, assembles in a House Room.
The Committee proceeds by motorcade to where the Governor-elect, the Lieutenant Governor-elect, and the Attorney General-elect and their families have gathered and escorts them to the Capitol.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Distinguished guests gather in the Old House Chamber.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The members of the House and the Senate meet in their respective chambers and then the Senate joins the House of Delegates to convene a joint session in the House Chamber.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The outgoing state officials and their family members assemble in the Old Senate Chamber.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The incoming state officials, dressed in formal attire, and their families gather in a House Room and then move to the Old Senate Chamber.
27 he inauguration of a new Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General is held on the first Saturday after the General Assembly Session begins in January of the year following the statewide election.
The inaugural activities on that day are prescribed by statute and tradition but also allow for some special requests by the Governor-elect.
Until 1982, the swearingin ceremony and parade reviewing stands were located on the South Portico of the Capitol Building.
The ceremony was moved to the north side of the building in 1982 where more space was available for reviewing stands and spectators.
Since that time, the Governorelect has chosen whether to use the South Portico or north side of the Capitol for the ceremony.
On one occasion, to allow more seating for the swearing-in ceremony, the swearing-in took place on the South Portico and the parade was reviewed on the north side of the building.
The Commonwealth Inaugural Committee appointed by the Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor-elect, and Attorney General-elect is charged with planning the inaugural day activities.
This includes: (1) developing and issuing the invitations and the programs, (2) choosing the participants in the parade, (3) developing a budget within the appropriation provided by the House of Delegates, (4) managing the guest lists for the activities of the day and evening, and (5) coordinating with state officials throughout the process.
Many executive, legislative, and judicial staff assist the staff of the Commonwealth Inaugural Committee to plan and execute inaugural activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The House of Delegates and Senate appoint members just prior to the inauguration to serve on a Ceremonial Inaugural Committee to escort the incoming officials and their families to and during the day's activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Department of General Services installs the Official Party reviewing platform and stands for the public and news media, secures and sets up the sound system, provides sanitar y facilities, and coordinates parking.
They prepare the Governor's Office for the new Governor and his staff beginning at noon on the day of the inauguration to be ready for use the following day.
They move the outgoing Governor and his family from the Executive Mansion and move the incoming Governor and his family into the Executive Mansion over that weekend.
T 2 IN A UGURA TION The oaths of office are administered to the Attorney General-elect first, then to the Lieutenant Governorelect, and finally to the Governor-elect.
At the conclusion of the oaths, there is a 19-gun salute by the National Guard and a jet f lyby, if that has been requested.
After the salute, the previous Governor and his family retire from the platform.
The newly sworn Governor addresses the assembled guests and signs procedural Executive Orders.
The Joint Session of the General Assembly is adjourned and the parade begins.
After the parade, the First Family proceeds to the Executive Mansion.
Some Governors have chosen to have public events at the Executive Mansion or in the Capitol on the afternoon of the inauguration or the following day.
An Inaugural Ball is traditionally held in the evening.
To accommodate the large number of people of various ages who wish to celebrate with the new Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General, officials have requested that additional balls be held.
Prior to any movement to the inaugural platform, it is traditional that the outgoing Governor meet with and present to the incoming Governor the keys to the Executive Mansion.
At the appointed time, the distinguished guests move to the platform followed by the outgoing state officials and their families.
The Sergeant at Arms announces the arrival on the platform of the outgoing Governor and his family, the members of the Ceremonial Inaugural Committee, the Attorney General-elect, Lieutenant Governor-elect, and Governor-elect with their families and in that order.
When everyone is in place, the Speaker of the House begins the ceremony which is orchestrated by the Clerk of the House.
The Governor-elect chooses the minister(s) to deliver the invocation and the benediction and any musical performer (singer or reader) or performance (band or orchestra) that is part of the ceremony.
Each of the incoming officials selects the person who will administer his oath of office.
It is required by statute that the person administering each oath be a member of the Virginia judiciary.
28 3 PLANNING FOR A VISIT TO OR FROM THE GOVERNOR Ã¯Â¿Â½ Information on whether the First Lady is included and what she is to do (required or optional) if she is included.
When the Governor accepts the invitation, the following information should be provided at least one week prior to the event: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Directions to area (including any special entrance and parking designated for Governor's car).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Name and title of person meeting the Governor and the exact place of meeting.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A copy of the distributed invitation to the event, if applicable.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Name and title of person introducing the Governor.
(It is customary in Virginia for everyone to stand when the Governor enters a room or when he rises to speak, as a show of respect for the Office.)
In the Governor's Office e quests for office appointments with the Governor should be made in writing on letterhead, if applicable.
Requests should be mailed, e-mailed, or faxed to the Governor's Office and should include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Subject to be discussed Ã¯Â¿Â½ Those attending Ã¯Â¿Â½ Time requirement Ã¯Â¿Â½ Contact person and phone number The Governor's Office confirms the time of the appointment and states any time constraints.
Generally, confirmation of the appointment and any subsequent adjustments are made by telephone.
Should the Governor request the presence of additional people at the meeting and lead time allows, the visitor will be notified by phone of the Governor's decision.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ All invitations to the Governor should be made in writing, using letterhead of the individual or organization, if applicable.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Although an immediate acceptance or decline may not be possible, invitations are acknowledged as soon as possible.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ All arrangements for a visit are confirmed one to two days before the event.
Office Responsibility When the Governor accepts an invitation, the Governor's Office provides the person in charge of the event with as much information regarding the Governor's plans and needs as possible.

The size and quality of the picture requested will determine if the picture is free of charge or must be acquired through a private vendor.
A Leaving Office A House Joint Resolution appoints a committee to contract for a portrait of each outgoing governor, to have it painted, appropriately framed, and hung in the Capitol.
The committee consists of the Governor or his designee, the Speaker of the House of Delegates, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Delegates, and the Clerk of the Senate.
The Governor selects the artist to paint his portrait and works with the artist to have it completed.
The General Assembly appropriates a sum sufficient for the costs of the artist, the frame, and the framing.
The portrait is viewed by the Art and Architectural Review Board for their official review.
This Board is charged with review of art that will become part of the state's art collection and will be displayed in buildings of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
An unveiling ceremony is arranged by the Governor's Office in concert with the Department of General Services.
The portrait is hung just outside the entrance to the Governor's Office, draped, and unveiled to a group of staff, media, and special guests of the Governor.
Traditionally, portraits of the more recent governors are displayed along the balcony of the third f loor of the Capitol building.
When a portrait is rotated off the balcony, it usually is displayed in another part of the Capitol, the Executive Mansion, another state building, or housed with the state's art collection in The Library of Virginia.
President of the Senate A Senate Resolution authorizes the current President of the Senate to appoint a committee of Senators and the Clerk of the Senate to select an artist and supervise the painting of the former President's portrait.
The committee consults with the former President to determine his choice of artist.
The Senate appropriates funding for the cost of the artist, the frame, and the framing.
The portrait is hung in the Senate Chamber, and the oldest portrait is moved to another part of the Capitol, another state building, or housed with the state's art collection in The Library of Virginia.
An unveiling ceremony is held prior to the beginning of the next Senate session, attended by the former President, his invited guests, Senate members, and the media.
44 12 OFFICIAL MOURNING FOR ST A TE OFFICIALS Ã¯Â¿Â½ At 9:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, the Capitol was closed to the public.
At 10:00 a.m. a service was held for invited guests of the family.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor, a close friend in the Virginia Senate, and the pastor of the church of the family participated in the services which concluded at 10:30 a.m.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Speakers were set up to broadcast the service to the public assembled on the Capitol Square lawn at the South Portico.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Following the memorial service, the body was moved to the church for the funeral service.
n Virginia there is no official procedure for the period of mourning for state officials who die while in office.
In such instances, matters have been handled in accordance with the wishes of those most concerned.
I Statewide Elected Official As records are sometimes urgently searched to determine how matters were handled in the past, the following summary of events for a period of mourning for a Lieutenant Governor who died in office may serve as a guide: Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor proclaimed one week of mourning.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ All state f lags were f lown at half-staff during the period and all U.S. f lags on state buildings were also flown at half-staff (also see f lag ceremonies).
The period of mourning was modified in 1974.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ All state offices were closed from 9:30 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. on the day of the funeral.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ On the day before the funeral, the body lay in state in the Rotunda of the State Capitol which was open to the public.
Member of the General Assembly The House of Delegates and Senate have established a practice of draping in black for 30 days the desk of a member who died while in office and for 7 days the portrait of a former Lieutenant Governor.
If the respective chamber is not in session, a memorial message is displayed on the voting board during the same period.
45 13 ELECTR ONIC COMMUNICA TION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Include your printed name, title, and contact information at the end of your message if the recipient does not know you well.
The way e-mail addresses are written does not necessarily make it clear who is sending the message.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ If you get an e-mail response and wish to keep the conversation f lowing, do not start a new e-mail message since this will lose the connectivity of the conversation.
Simply reply and keep the exchanges together in the same message.
However, you eliminate the need for the correspondents to review the entire exchange by using the symbol 
Ã¯Â¿Â½ One of the advantages of e-mail is that it can save paper if one does not print every message.
Make an effort to save electronic messages on your computer system and print only those that must be in print.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Remember that no e-mail is private.
Someone, somewhere probably has the ability to read every email that is sent.
E-mail system administrators, company monitors, and hackers can view the messages, and some messages could get misdirected.
You have no control over what the recipient of your e-mail does with your message.
Do not send an e-mail that you would not want to read in tomorrow's paper.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ E-mail messages are permanent even though you delete them from your computer.
Someone with skill and knowledge can retrieve them from the system.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ E-mail is designed for convenience.
Do not expect an immediate response.
Before electronic mail, correspondence, reports, and information were written on paper and were readily available to file and to create a historical recording on a subject.
That historical recording is not assured with the proliferation of e-mail.
Freedom of Information statutes should be followed to properly maintain and retain e-mail correspondence.
Correspondents using email for government business should consider this information from the Office of the Attorney General.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A public record includes all writings and recordings... set down by mechanical or electronic recording... regardless of physical form or characteristics prepared or owned by, or in the possession of a public body or its officers, employees, or agents in the transaction of public business.
46 W i th the proliferation of computers and electronic communication, questions arise regarding proper etiquette for electronic mail.
Here are some aspects to consider when composing, sending, and replying to e-mail messages.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The subject line should be brief and provide a clue to the contents of the message.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Messages should be concise and to the point.
Try to keep your messages to 25 lines or less.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Text wrapping is not available to some people.
Try to keep each line to 70 characters or less.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ If you include a salutation in the message, use one you would normally use in traditional written correspondence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ E-mail is more conversational than traditional paperbased correspondence.
However, people who do not know you will form an impression of you by reading your message.
Think about what you need to say.
Phrase it properly with acceptable grammar usage.
Use punctuation only where it is necessary rather than scattering it about for emphasis.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep your intended audience in mind and construct your message accordingly.
Reread the message to make sure it is clear before you send it.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Special characters, fancy fonts, and colors are not read the same by all machines.
Avoid using them if possible.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some systems cannot accept attachments.
Some systems cannot read non-text files.
It might be wise to determine the capabilities of the recipient's system before sending attachments.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoid abbreviations, jargon, and acronyms unless you are certain those in the e-mail conversation will understand what they are.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Using symbols known as "smilies" or "emoticons" to express emotion is not recommended, as many people may not be able to interpret their usage.
These symbols are read by turning one's head to the side, i.e. : - ( for a frown.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ If you must add emphasis, you can (1) put an asterisk (*) before and after a word or short phrase, (2) capitalize the first letter of a word or the whole word (using uppercase letters is equivalent to shouting in e-mail messages so use them sparingly), or (3) add extra exclamation marks.
13 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Using e-mail creates a record that will be available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ E-mails need to be retained according to the Public Records Act administered by The Library of Virginia.
This Act sets forth records retention and management guidelines.
You cannot automatically delete e-mail messages when your conversation is completed.
Answers to specific questions and subject information may be obtained from The Library of Virginia.
Electronic meetings are another means of communication that require guidelines.
Electronic meetings are those transacted through telephonic, video, or other means of electronic communication.
Only state governing bodies may hold electronic meetings.
Political subdivisions and local governing bodies may not meet electronically under any circumstances.
The Code electronic Information of a public of Virginia, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-3708, sets procedures for meetings, defined by the Freedom of Act as a gathering of three or more members body while sitting physically.
ELECTR ONIC COMMUNICA TION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Minutes must be taken at all electronic meetings.
In addition, an audio recording of a telephone meeting and an audio/visual recording of a video meeting must be made.
The recording must be preserved for three years and be made available to the public.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Attorney General of Virginia has written an opinion that the use of e-mail by members of a public body does not constitute a meeting, and is thus permissible under the Freedom of Information Act, as it defines a meeting.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.2-3710 of the Freedom of Information Act was amended in the 2001 General Assembly Session to state that a member of a public body may separately contact other members of that same body in person, over the phone, or by e-mail as long as the contact does not constitute a meeting as defined by the Freedom of Information Act.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Freedom of Information Advisory Council issued an opinion that use of a listserve by members of a public body does constitute a meeting if used to discuss or transact public business.
A "listserve" is defined as a list of e-mail addresses of people who subscribe to participate on the listserve.
When an email message is sent to the listserve, it is automatically delivered to the electronic mailbox of every user on the list.
Questions on the Freedom of Information Act and how it applies to the use of electronic communication may be directed to the Virginia Freedom of Information Advisory Council at 1-866-448-4100.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ No closed meetings may be conducted electronically.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A quorum of the public body must be physically assembled at one location.
Other members may participate from remote locations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Notice must be provided at least 30 days in advance, unless it is an emergency meeting.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ All locations must be made available to members of the public, and all persons attending the meeting must have equal opportunity to address the public body.
47 14 Q UESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q.
I would like to have a Virginia flag that has been flown over the State Capitol.
How should I accomplish this? My son was a Page for the General Assembly, and I would like to secure a Virginia flag that has been flown over the Capitol to display at our home.
How can I accomplish this? A. Anyone may purchase a Virginia f lag that has been flown over the Capitol by contacting the Governor's Office, a member of the General Assembly, or the Virginia Department of General Services.
It is recommended that a Page make the request through a member of the General Assembly or the Clerk's Office of the legislative chamber in which he or she served.
Q.
How can a military installation in Virginia get a Virginia flag to fly on its base? A.
An official on the militar y installation base may request a Virginia f lag for use at that installation by contacting the Governor's Office.
Q.
Is it appropriate for a military person in uniform or civilian clothes to salute the Governor? What response is expected from the Governor? A. Members of the Virginia National Guard in uniform or civilian clothes and on duty would salute the Governor since he is their Commander in Chief.
Personnel in the United States Armed Forces are not obligated to salute the Governor but might do so as a sign of respect.
The Governor may return the military salute to acknowledge the respect shown to him, but the action is not required of him.
However, the Governor should acknowledge the salute in some manner.
Q.
Can anyone fly the Virginia flag or the United States flag at half-staff? When the flags over the State Capitol are flown at half-staff, should all Virginia and United States flags across the Commonwealth be lowered? Can the Virginia flag be flown at half-staff at the death of my grandfather who was in the army? If either the United States or the Virginia flag is lowered, how long does it stay down? Do the governing officials of a locality (i.e. mayor, board of supervisors) have authority to lower either the United States or the Virginia flags in their locality? A. Only the Governor has the authority to order Virginia flags on public buildings be f lown at half-staff.
The President of the United States or the Governor of Virginia can authorize the United States f lag be flown at half-staff on public buildings.
The orders will indicate how long the f lag(s) should remain at halfstaff.
When the United States and Virginia f lags are at half-staff over the Capitol, it is because either the President of the United States or the Governor has authorized it.
Flags over other public buildings in Virginia should be f lown in the same manner.
Local officials have the authority to lower their jurisdictional flags but not the United States and Virginia f lags.
Neither the President nor the Governor has authority over f lags f lown on private property.
Therefore, it is up to the property owner when and if he/she lowers the f lag(s).
