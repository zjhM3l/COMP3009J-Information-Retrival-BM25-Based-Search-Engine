Skip Navigation Texas Workforce Logo home | site index | about us | contact information Navigational Tabs Search _____________ Go! Welcome to TWC's Welfare Reform Initiatives Division The Texas Workforce Network was first envisioned in 1995 with the passage of House Bill 1863.
This legislation consolidated 28 workforce-related programs from 10 different state agencies and created a new agency, the Texas Workforce Commission.
It is the establishment of local control over large block-granted programs for employment assistance and self-sufficiency that stands as the cornerstone of the new workforce system.
Coupled with this is the belief that local planning based on the economy and labor market needs of each area will produce results that in the end help Texans achieve and sustain economic prosperity.
TWC, the 28 workforce development boards and their service providers, whether community based, faith based or private entities, are all part of the Texas Workforce Network.
The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) administers a variety of programs to help adults and youth transition from a life of dependency to one of self-sufficiency.
The Commission works closely with communities and businesses to enable families to become self-sufficient.
State welfare reform legislation mandated the implementation of a work first delivery model, based on the expectation that Texans support themselves and their families.
Both state and federal reform legislation emphasize personal responsibility, time limited cash benefits, and the goal of work instead of welfare.
To support these philosophies the TWC and Local Workforce Development Boards have developed a service delivery model with primary emphasis on the goal of employment at the earliest opportunity for applicants and recipients of cash assistance.
The Texas Workforce Commission goal for all welfare recipients and applicants is to get a job, find a better job, and then develop a career.
What We Do
For more than four years, Texas' and the nation's welfare systems have been undergoing a major strategic transformation.
Although welfare recipients are only a small percentage of the Workforce Network's total customer base, assisting people from welfare to work has been a special challenge for the Welfare Reform Initiatives Division.
Based on the concept that individuals are ultimately responsible for their future and that of their family, Texas' welfare to work plan helps eliminate the barriers to employment that these Texans face.
Eligible recipients are provided with services such as subsidized childcare and transportation.
To encourage businesses to hire recipients, there are tax credits, subsidized wages and other financial incentives.
There's no question that we continue to face tough challenges in assisting more Texans to self-sufficiency.
TWC and our workforce board partners, through a lot of hard work, have reduced the welfare caseload in Texas by more than 135, 000 families since September 1995.
The Welfare Reform Initiatives Division remains focused on meeting and exceeding all federal work participation rates.
Historical Perspective
In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).
Under this legislation AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children), JOBS (work related training) and the Emergency Assistance Program were combined into one block grant entitled Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).
PRWORA promotes self-sufficiency and independence by expanding work opportunities for welfare recipients' while holding individuals to a high standard of personal responsibility for the support of their children.
To view the TANF regulations and PRWORA, go to the Administration for Children and Families Web site and select the Welfare Reform category.
Prior to PRWORA, the federal government granted states waivers to undertake their own welfare reform initiatives.
Texas became one of the waiver states after the passage of HB 1863 in 1995, which mandated a new service delivery system administered by local workforce development boards.
Texas will operate its waiver-based program until the March 2002 expiration date.
Upon expiration, Texas will operate its welfare reform in accordance with PRWORA.
Texas Welfare Program
House Bill (HB) 1863, enacted by the 74^th Texas Legislation and signed into law by Governor George W. Bush in June of 1995, dramatically changed the welfare system in Texas, making work an immediate priority for low-income families receiving TANF.
Texas received federal authority to implement Achieving Change for Texans (ACT) its waiver-based welfare reform initiative.
Implementation of ACT began in May of 1996.
The federal waiver will expire in March 2002; upon expiration Texas will operate its welfare reform in accordance with PRWORA.
Under ACT, adults are limited to 12, 24, or 36 months of cash assistance, and nonexempt clients must work or participate in approved activities that can enable them to become self-sufficient.
ACT embodies the same principles as the federal welfare reform law by enforcing the importance of working, emphasizing the temporary nature of public assistance, and the belief that parents are responsible for the care and well being of their families.
During the 1999 Legislative Session, measures increasing incentives and post-employment services for those on welfare finding employment were passed.
This legislation allows recipients who become employed to retain their welfare benefits during the first four months of work, thus providing an easier transition from welfare to the workforce.
To view this and other welfare related legislation go to Federal and State Welfare Related Bills and Regulations page.
Texas Welfare Caseload Issues
Across the country the number of families receiving cash assistance has declined significantly over the past several years.
In Texas, the caseload has dropped from 263,455 families in September 1995 to 127,774 in May 1999, over a 50% reduction in caseload.
Choices program (formerly known as JOBS) participation information collected through October 1999: * Unduplicated count of TANF clients in the Choices program: 61,704 * Unduplicated number of TANF clients in the Choices program who entered employment: 27,640 * The average TANF clients per month in the Choices program: 21,014
