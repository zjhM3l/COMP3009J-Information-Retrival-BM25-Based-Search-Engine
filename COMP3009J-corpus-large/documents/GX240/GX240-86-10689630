Interactions
Between Nesting Pileated Woodpeckers and Wood Ducks
Richard N. Conner.`,' Clifford E. Shackelford,' Daniel Saenz,' and Richard R Schaefer' ABSTRACT-We observed interactions between a nesting pair of Pileated Woodpeckers (i3ryoco~1u.s pi1eatu.s) and what appeared to be four pairs of Wood Ducks (Aix .spon.sa).
Wood Ducks regularly approached and attempted to enter an active Pileated Woodpecker nest cavity that contained three fully feathered young Pileated Woodpeckers.
The male Pileated Woodpecker often perched on a snag near their nest cavity to guard the entrance from Wood Ducks.
Female Wood Ducks attempted to enter the Pilented Woodpecker nest cavity on at least 12 occasions and typically were intercepted by the male Pileated Woodpecker before they reached the lip of the nest cavity.
On two occasions the male Pileated Woodpecker cntered his nest cavity and forcibly evicted female Wood Ducks that had slipped into the cavity.
These incidents suggest that large cavities in snags may be in high ' Wildlife Habitat and Silviculture Laboratory, Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service, Stephen E Austin State Univ., Nacogdochcs, TX 75962 USA. ? Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept., Austin, TX 78704 USA.

Our observations suggest that some Pileated Woodpcckers may be able to resist attempts by Wood Ducks to usurp nesl cavities during the breeding season.

Pileated Woodpeckers (Dtyocc~pu.s pileatus) are unique among North American woodpeckers because they are the only extant species that excavates large (
Their large cavities are used by a wide variety of both small and large birds and mammals that are primary and secondary cavity users throughout the species range (Hoyt 1948, Hoyt 1957, Conner 1978, Evans and Conner 1979, McClelland 1979, Bonar 2000).
Historically, Ivory-billed Woodpeckers (Cumnpphihs principdis) also provided large cavities (Tanner 1942) for secondary cavity users in the southern U.S., particularly in hardwood forests within and adjacent to wel-

lands.
Ivory-billed Woodpeckers, however, probably now are extinct (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1980, Lammertink and Estrada 1995).
Demand for large cavities has the potential to cause secondary cavity users to compete with Pileated Woodpeckers for the cavities the woodpeckers excavate.
Conner (1973) observed an interaction where an Eastern Screech-Owl (Otus LI.+) displaced a pair of Pileatcd Woodpeckers that were attempting to nest in a snag in Virginia.
Pileated Woodpeckers appear to tolerate the presence of some potential cavity competitors, particularly smaller species, and there are reports of Northern Flickers (Coluptc~s aurutus), Redbreasted Nuthatches (Sittcl canrrd~nsis), and Mountain Chickadees (Poccile gamheli) simultaneously nesting in the same snags as Pileated Woodpeckers, but in different cavities (Hoyt 1948, McClelland and McClelland 1999).
However, a Pileated Woodpecker was observed driving a Northern Flicker away from its nest cavity (J. 7: Tanner in Hoyt 1957).
Pileated Woodpeckers also have been reported to remove young and nest material of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialiu siulis) from a cavity the woodpeckers used during a previous breeding season, further enlarge the cavity chamber, and subsequently use the cavity for a second nesting season (Baird et al. 1875).
The Wood Duck (Aix .sponsu), a large secondary cavity user, requires large cavities for nesting (Bellrose et al. 1964, Ryan et al. 1998) and regularly uses Pileated Woodpecker cavities (Kilham 1979, Bull and Jackson 1995).
Bellrose et al. (1964) and Ryan ct al. (199X) noted that Wood Ducks achieve higher nest success in cavities that are high above the ground, likely because of lower predation risk.
Pi
Wood Ducks also are known to nest in Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoicks horcwlis) cavities that have been enlarged by Pileated Woodpeckers (Conner et al. 1997).
Observations of potentially competitive interactions between Pileated Woodpcckcrs and other cavity users are rare, likely because of the wariness of the large woodpeckers around their nest site (RNC pcrs. obs.).
During 20 h of observation over seven separate days between 24 April and 5 May 1996, we observed Wood Ducks (four male and four female Wood Ducks were present) attempting to usurp a Pileated Woodpecker nest cavity that contained three woodpecker nestlings.
The cavity was located in a 60-cm dbh, 25-m loblolly pine (Pinus turd(z) snag within a nearly pure stand of loblolly pines on the Stephen E Austin Experimental Forest (3 I" 29' N, 94" 47' W) in southern Nacogdoches County, Texas.
Most major limbs were still present WI the snag and the nest cavity had been excavated about 10 m above the ground, where the bole was 52 cm in diameter.
The Pileated Woodpecker nest tree was 450 m from relatively permanent water in a small stream.
Other ephemeral streams were about 300 m from the nest tree.
During our observations female Wood Ducks typically perched with their mates in the vicinity (50 m) of the Pileated Woodpecker nest tree, and flew toward the woodpecker nest cavity as the Pileated Woodpeckers left to obtain food to provision their nestlings.
In 10 of I 1 instances, as a female Wood Duck approached the nest cavity, the male Pileated Woodpecker intercepted the Wood Duck within 1 m of the cavity entrance, before it could enter the cavity.
When intercepting female Wood Ducks, the male Pileated Woodpecker often vocalized a short duration "kuk, kuk, kuk, kuk, kuk" (High call, Kilham 1959; "Wok" call, Short 1982) that decreased in volume and frequency as the call ended.
This vocalization usually is associated with excitement or alarm (Kilham 1959).
During one instance, both the male and female woodpecker simultaneously intercepted a female Wood Duck and prevented her from entering the cavity.
On two other occasions the male Pileated Woodpecker, while inside the nest cavity, pecked at an approaching female Wood Duck as it flew to within S-IO cm of the entrance.
During 4 h of our observations, the male Pi
It was from this perch that he typically flew to intercept an approaching Wood Duck.

tempts to usurp the cavity appeared to intensify and the male Pileated Woodpecker often guarded the nest from inside the nest cavity.
On two occasions a fetnale Wood Duck successfully entered the Pileated Woodpecker nest cavity while it contained three Pileated Woodpecker nestlings.
We did not see the Wood Duck enter the cavity in the first instance.
We had been observing the cavity for approximately 1 h on 26 April 1996 without seeing any adult Pilcated Woodpeckers around the nest cavity.
Five Wood Ducks wet-e perched in live pines within 40 m of the cavity tree.
When the tnale Pileated Woodpecker returned to the nest cavity to feed the three nestlings, it appeared very agitaled while pcrching at the cavity entrance.
The male fanned its tail feathers and erected its red crest feathers and repeatedly peered inlo the cavity by quickly insct-ting its head and withdrawing it.
After 5 min of peering into the cavily, the tnale Pileated Woodpecker entered the cavity and we heard what we interpreted as sounds of him pecking something in the cavity, with his bill occasionally striking the side of the nest chamber.
After S-1 0 s of scuffling and pecking sounds frotn within the cavity, a female Wood Duck emerged at the entrance and flew away.
The female Wood Duck had been in the Pilcated Woodpecker cavity with three fully feathered Pileatcd Woodpecker nestlings for at least 1 h prior to the tnale woodpecker's return.
On the morning of 27 April 1996, a fetnale Wood Duck again successfully entered the Pileated Woodpecker nest cavity as we watched.
She flew inside the cavity so quickly that the male Pileated Woodpecker, perched on his "guard snag," was unable lo intercept the Wood Duck before she altered Ihe cavity.
This time the male Pilcatcd Woodpecker entered the nest cavily within 2 s of the Wood Duck's entrance and we again heard scuffling and pecking sounds for about IO s 
The malt Pilcated remained in the cavity for scvera1 tninutcs before he emerged and flew to his guard position on the nearby snag.
Between 2 and 4 May 1996, IIIC three young Pilcatcd Woodpeckers succcssl`ully fledged from the nest cavity.
On 5 May 1996, four pairs of Wood Ducks were still in the vicinity of the Pilenlcd Woodpecker cavity.
One female Wood Duck repeatedly flew to the cavity entrance and perched OII the entrance lip for approximately I tnin while she peered into the cavity every 3-4 s.
A tnale Wood Duck remained perched above the cavity on a lateral branch of the cavity tree while the fetnale examined the cavity.
After 20 min of repeated brief visits to peer into the cavity, the fetnale Wood Duck entered and remained in the cavity for 1 h, after which our observation ceased.
These incidents suggest that large cavities in snags on our study area may be in high
demand by Wood Ducks during the nesting season.
Our observations suggest that some Pileatcd Woodpeckers tnay be able to resist attetnpts by Wood Ducks to usurp nest cavities during the breeding season.
