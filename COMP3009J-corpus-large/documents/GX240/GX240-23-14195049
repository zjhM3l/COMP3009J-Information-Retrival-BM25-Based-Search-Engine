1.
Are districts required to identify students in each of the four core academic areas?
Students may be identified in all four core areas of the curriculum; however, students may be identified in the area of general intellectual ability, or even creativity, and then be offered services that emphasize content in all four areas.
If the services are specific classes in the four core areas, students should participate only in areas of their particular strength or talent.
For example, one student identified in the area of general intellectual ability may be in classes for all four areas and another student may be in only a math and science class.
(Ref: TEC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 29.121; TSP Section 1, 1.5.1A)
2.
Please clarify when both qualitative and quantitative measures must be used in identification procedures.
Both qualitative and quantitative measures must be used to identify students in grades 1 - 12 in general intellectual ability and/or specific academic subjects.
In kindergarten identification, a district may choose to use both qualitative and quantitative measures or all measures may be qualitative.
Because some educators do not wish to use standardized tests with young children, it is acceptable to use only qualitative measures at the kindergarten level.
Additionally, if a district identifies and serves students in leadership, artistic areas, or creativity, the district may use all qualitative measures if it chooses to do so.
(Ref: TSP Ã¯Â¿Â½ Section 1, 1.5.3A; 1.5.4A; 1.5.5A)
3.
What is the timeline or deadline for kindergarten identification?
Kindergarten students must be identified and receiving services by March 1.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.1(3); TSP Section 1, 1.4A)
4.
The state plan requires school districts to include provisions regarding reassessment in local board policy.
Must school districts reassess students for services in the gifted/talented program?
No, you are not required to reassess students.
Your local board policy could state that once students are identified for services in the gifted/talented program, they remain in the program unless they are exited.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.1(5); TSP Section 1, 1.2A)
5.
Should there be special provisions in identification procedures for students who have special needs such as learning disabilities or other handicaps?
Yes, section 1.6A of the Texas State Plan states, "data and procedures assure that all populations of the district have access to assessment...."
This includes students in special populations.
The assessments used should be appropriate for them.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.1(4); TSP Section 1, 1.6A)
6.
How may we insure that these students are genuinely considered for services in gifted education?
Because of lack of understanding by educators, there are students with special needs who are never nominated for services in gifted education even though the procedures contain appropriate assessments or modifications.
One key to insuring that these students are genuinely considered for G/T program services lies in the area of professional development.
All educators, including special education, bilingual, ESL, and migrant teachers should be aware of characteristics and needs of gifted learners and how those characteristics may be manifested in all populations.
Further, the terms "learning disabled (LD)" and "gifted/talented" are not mutually exclusive.
The dilemma is how educators address this unique learning situation.
Often the LD gifted student goes unrecognized because the disability overshadows the abilities.
To assure services are appropriate for these students, the ARD committee must be consulted.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.1(4); TSP Section 1, 1.6A)
II.
Curriculum and Services
7.
Please clarify the meaning of emphasizing content from the four core academic areas.
The intent is to make certain that regardless of the program design used to deliver services to gifted/talented students, content modifications of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) are offered in the four core areas of language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies.
And array of learning opportunities should allow students who are advanced in any of the core content areas to do advanced work reflecting depth and complexity of the general school curriculum (TEKS).
There are many ways services can be designed to meet these indicators.
Examples of learning opportunities that emphasize content from the four core areas and are included in the regular school day may include a combination of the following:
Interdisciplinary curriculum
Special units from each of the core areas
Differentiation of each of the core areas in regular or self-contained classes
Acceleration in a discipline that is a particular area of strength
Advanced Placement (AP) classes with appropriate modifications for g/t students
Pre-AP classes with appropriate modifications for g/t students
International Baccalaureate classes with appropriate modifications for g/t students
Independent study courses (At the elementary level, students may be allowed to pursue specific areas of interest through independent study even though there is not a specific course.)
Dual/concurrent enrollment
Mentorship programs
Education Service Center (ESC) seminars (may also be in-school or out-of- school)
While it is true that any one of the above learning opportunities may not constitute a gifted program, it may be one activity in the "array" or "menu" of options that are available.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.3(3); TSP Section 2, 2.1A, 3.1A)
8.
Sometimes "non-examples" are helpful to understanding.
What would be considered "non-examples" and be unacceptable in emphasizing content from the four core areas?
One of the best "non-examples" is a school that offers services only in language arts.
This program would need to be expanded.
Another "non-example" would be offering science at one grade level, math at the next grade level, social studies next, etc.
Opportunities in all four core content areas should be available at each grade level.
Students should be served based on individual strengths, and should not be required to participate in all four core areas.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.3; TSP Section 3, 3.1A)
9.
May gifted/talented students be served in the regular classroom or are you required to have special classes for them?
Gifted/talented students may be served in the regular classroom.
If this is the program design that is used to deliver services, the regular classroom teacher must have the 30 hours of professional development in gifted education as delineated in 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½89.2(1) and an annual update of six hours of professional development in gifted education [19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½89.2(2)].
One of the key issues or question becomes whether or not the teacher has the time and/or resources to provide instruction and guidance for gifted/talented students at an appropriately challenging level.
Campuses need to remember that students served in the general classroom still need to work together with groups (minimum of 3) of gifted students, work independently, and work with other students during the school day and entire school year.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.3(1, 3); TSP Section 2, 2.1A, 2.2A)
10.
What are some out-of-school options that would meet the requirement of having out-of-school options when possible?
Examples of out-of-school options that could supplement the required in-school options are:
Future Problem Solving
Odyssey of the Mind/Destination Imagination
MATHCOUNTS
UIL Academic Activities
Academic Decathlon
Science Clubs, History Clubs, Math Clubs, Book Clubs
Summer or Weekend Seminars/Classes
After School Enrichment
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.3(3); TSP Section 2, 2.3A)
11.
How should teachers document differentiation of curriculum for gifted/talented students
There are a variety of ways that teachers can document differentiation.
It may be done in the lesson plans where the teacher would indicate instruction and/or assignments that differ for gifted students.
Differentiation may be included in curriculum guides or documents.
Classroom schedules may also indicate flexible grouping with differentiated instruction.
Copies of assignments or handouts given to students that indicate students have options in reading assignments, projects, etc. may also be used.
III.
Professional Development
12.
Who must have professional development in gifted education? Which teachers? Which administrators? Which counselors?
Prior to assignment, teachers who provide instruction and services that are part of the program for gifted students should receive the required minimum 30 hours of training and six hours annually.
Administrators and counselors who are responsible for programming decisions for gifted/talented students are required to receive six hours of professional development that includes nature and needs of gifted/talented students and program options for those students.
Any campus or district level administrator (including the superintendent) or counselor who has authority to make scheduling, hiring, and/or program decisions should have the six hours.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.2(1); TSP Section 4, 4.1A; 4.3A)
13.
What should be offered to teachers in the required six-hour annual update?
The decision not to mandate what should be offered as six-hour update training was deliberate.
It was the intent of the law that this on-going professional development for teachers who provide instruction and services for gifted students is individualized for each teacher.
The annual update should be based on individual teacher needs related to the objectives of the gifted program.
The teacher and his/her supervisor should collaboratively make this decision.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.2(3); TSP Section 4, 4.2A)
14.
What if I hire a new teacher for the G/T program and do not have time to train her before his/her assignment to the program?
TSP rule 4.1.2A enables districts to take up to one semester for a teacher to complete the 30-hour training.
However, this should be used only in extenuating circumstances, such as the necessity of hiring a new teacher for the G/T program late in the summer or during the school year because no other trained teacher is available.
(Ref: 19 TAC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 89.2(2); TSP Section 4, 4.1.2A)
15.
Who may offer the 30 hours of professional development required for G/T teachers?
Teachers may obtain the 30 hours from a variety of sources.
Regional education service centers, local education agencies, university classes and institutes, and professional consultants are some of the resources available to educators.
The Texas Association for the Gifted and Talented (TAGT) offers annual conferences where training may be obtained.
It is a local school district decision as to who will provide the training for the district's teachers.
16.
How much time do each of the three required areas (nature and needs of gifted students, assessing student needs and curriculum and instruction for gifted students) have to have as part of the 30-hour minimum?
The amount of time for each of the areas needed in professional development is not dictated in the Texas Administrative Code.
This is a local district decision.
Many of the regional education service centers use modules that were developed with the assistance of the agency for needs and characteristics of gifted students; assessing student needs; and curriculum and instruction for gifted students.
These modules have a suggested minimum time of six clock hours each.
IV.
Pre-Advanced Placement/Advanced Placement
17.
If districts serve high school gifted/talented students through Advanced Placement (AP) courses and students who are not identified gifted are in the class, must the AP teacher differentiate the curriculum for the gifted students?
Yes.
Teachers that are using flexible grouping for instruction and product development, giving choices in assignments, and establishing a student centered classroom with lots of student-to-student interaction are providing differentiated instruction.
One of the reasons for requiring AP teachers to have professional development in nature and needs of gifted/talented students and assessing student needs is so they will be able to recognize a need for differentiation and provide it as needed.
Teachers will want to add depth and complexity appropriate for gifted/talented students and differentiate for those who need it.
18.
Can Pre-AP be used to serve gifted students?
Yes, but remember that Pre-AP is designed to increase the pool of students who will be successful in AP classes at the 11th and 12th grades.
It is, therefore, a curriculum that is used to strengthen the educational program of all students in middle and high school.
Following this philosophy, it would be necessary for a district to differentiate Pre-AP the way any general curriculum would be modified for gifted students.
19.
Are the AP teachers required to have the 30 hours of training in gifted education? If yes, can their AP training count for it?
If AP classes serve as the mode of delivery for your services to gifted students, teachers should have the 30 hours of training in gifted education.
A part of the College Board five day summer institute training can count toward the curriculum and instruction component, but the teacher still need approximately six hours each in the nature and needs of gifted/talented students and assessing student needs training components.
(See question 15)
V. Accountability
20.
The law says that the state plan shall serve as the basis for district accountability in providing services to gifted students.
How and when will the districts be held accountable for indicators in the plan?
Districts are held accountable for the acceptable indicators in the state plan.
Monitoring of district efforts occurs through the District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) review and through the Program Analysis System (PAS) of the Texas Education Agency.
School districts are selected for on-site DEC visits on a six year cycle and through a risk-based system under PAS.
(Ref: TEC Ã¯Â¿Â½29.123 19 TAC 89.5; TSP Section 2, 2.6A)
21.
Do districts need to provide evidence of adding depth and complexity to the curriculum for District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) visits?
Yes.
Evidence of differentiation of the TEKS through depth, complexity, and pacing are reviewed.
Districts will be monitored for providing an array of challenging learning experiences that emphasize content in the four core academic areas for gifted/talented students.
22.
Do districts have to evaluate their G/T program every year?
Yes.
The g/t program is a part of the campus/district improvement plans, which are updated annually, the effectiveness of services for gifted students also must be reviewed annually with input from all stakeholders, including parents.
(Ref: TEC Ã¯Â¿Â½ 11.251-11.253; TSP Section 5, 5.3A)
