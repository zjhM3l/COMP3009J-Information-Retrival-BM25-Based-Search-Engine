Section VIII: Glossary of Broadcast Terms
INTRODUCTION Welcome to the TV Broadcast Station Self-Inspection Checklist.
The Enforcement Bureau (EB) of the FCC is committed to improving licensee compliance with the broadcast regulations.
We do this through a combination of educational and enforcement efforts.
The enforcement effort usually involves an on-scene station inspection conducted by FCC personnel.
Most on-scene inspections are conducted without prior notification to the station licensee.
This checklist has been developed to assist broadcast station management in conducting a selfinspection of their station.
It provides an opportunity for the broadcaster to review and correct any deficiencies associated with the operation of a station without an actual on-scene visit by the Commission.
While not all broadcast regulations are covered by this checklist, you will be able to assess your compliance with the most frequently violated broadcast regulations.
Each question contains a reference to the relevant rule section(s) to facilitate your review.
These references pertain to Title 47 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)
Parts 11, 17 and 73.
The following boxes are provided throughout the checklist to aid the broadcaster in determining the stations compliance: = YES.
The station is in compliance with this item.
= The station is not in compliance with this item.
Corrective action is PENDING.
= NOT APPLICABLE to this station.
If this response is not provided then this question is applicable to all TV stations.
All of the above responses are not applicable to every question.
Only appropriate responses will be provided for each question.
You will note that the above responses do not include a "NO" answer.
Any question in which a "NO" answer is applicable would be a violative condition requiring corrective action.
Stations encountering such situations should take immediate steps to correct the problem.
i
WHERE TO GET ASSISTANCE, FORMS and OTHER INFORMATION On June 3, 1996, the FCC established a national call center in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
This call center is operated by the FCC Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB).
This facility is capable of providing services for the hearing impaired and the center is staffed full-time with bi-lingual (English and Spanish) Specialists.
The toll free telephone number for this call center is 1-888-CALLFCC (1-888-225-5322).
If you have any questions about this self inspection checklist or the applicability of any regulation to your operation, you may contact the FCC Call Center.
DO NOT MAIL THIS CHECKLIST TO THE FCC FOR OUR REVIEW! Requests for Emergency Alert System (EAS) related documents should be directed to the Commission's EAS Office at (202) 418-1228.

SECTION II: ANTENNA STRUCTURES A. ANTENNA REGISTRATION: Most antenna structures that are higher than 60.96 meters (200 feet) above ground level or that may interfere with the flight path of a nearby airport must be studied by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and registered with the FCC.
Owners are required to register their non-exempt tower structures with the FCC.
All proposed and altered antenna structures must be registered prior to construction or alteration.
For licensees this means that the tower must be registered before a new construction permit or license modification involving the tower or antenna is granted.
Licensees should be familiar with the painting and lighting specifications shown on their station authorization.
In the event that the structure owner is unable to maintain the prescribed painting and lighting, e.g. in cases including but not limited to abandonment, negligence, or bankruptcy, the FCC would require that each tenant licensee on the structure undertake efforts to maintain painting and/or lighting.
Additionally, if the licensee has reason to believe that the structure is not in compliance or that the owner is not carrying out its responsibility to maintain the structure, the licensee must immediately notify the owner, notify the site management company (if applicable), notify the FCC, and make a diligent effort to ensure that the antenna structure is brought into compliance.
Once a tower is registered, then the registration number is to be displayed in a conspicuous place so that it is readily visible near the base of the antenna structure.
When the tower is located where the number cannot be seen without access to the property on which it is located, then the number should also be placed on the gate or fence leading to the tower where an outside observer can see it.
Materials used to display the registration number must be weather-resistant and of sufficient size to be easily seen.
An informational FACT SHEET, PR5000-15, "ANTENNA STRUCTURE REGISTRATION", and the Antenna Structure Registration Form (FCC Form 854), may be obtained by contacting the FCC's Forms Distribution Center at (800)418-3676.
This document will provide information on how to register a tower.
Users may also visit the FCC's Internet Homepage at http://wireless.fcc.gov/antenna/ for up to date information on filing procedures, electronic filing and database access.
51.
Registration: Has the owner of the tower on which the station antenna is mounted obtained registration for the structure? [See FACT SHEET - PR5000-15] Posting of Number: Has the registration number been posted in an easily viewed location at the tower site? [See FACT SHEET - PR5000-15]
52.
9
SECTION II: Continued B. ANTENNA SPECIFICS: The construction permit, station license, or other instrument of authorization provides authority for the station to operate under a specific set of operating parameters.
The licensee must thoroughly review the current station authorization, and where applicable the structure registration, to compare the listed specifications to the location, height, etc. that is actually used by this station.
[See the Terms of the Station Authorization (TSA)] 53.
OVERALL HEIGHT: Does the overall height of the structure match that specified in the station authorization and, where applicable, the structure registration? [See TSA] ANTENNA: Does the number and height of the antenna bays match that specified in the station authorization? [See TSA]

TOWER LIGHT OBSERVATIONS: The lighting on tower structures is to be observed at least once every 24 hours either visually or by observing an automatic indicating device; or alternatively the licensee/tower owner may provide and maintain an automatic alarm system to constantly monitor the lighting on a structure.
All automatic or mechanical control devices, indicators, and alarm systems are required to be inspected at intervals NOT TO EXCEED 3 months.
[See 17.47] 56.
OBSERVATIONS: Is the lighting on the tower(s) observed at least once every 24 hours either visually or by observing an automatic indicating device; or alternatively has the licensee/tower owner provided and maintained an automatic alarm system? [See 17.47]
57.
MAINTENANCE CHECKS: Have all automatic and/or mechanical control devices, indicators, and alarm systems associated with the antenna structure lighting been inspected within the last 3 months? [See 17.47]
10
SECTION II: Continued D. PAINTING/LIGHTING: The station authorization and/or tower registration specifies the painting and lighting requirements for your operation.
This is shown as a set of numbers or letters which correspond to paragraphs found on FCC Form 715 (Numbers - For towers with beacons and side lights) or 715A (Letters - For towers with strobed lighting), or the most current FAA Advisory Circular (currently AC 70/7460-1K) on Obstruction Marking and Lighting.
If no painting or lighting is required, then the authorization will specify "NONE" or "NONE REQUIRED".
Tower registration is only necessary when painting and/or lighting is required.
The licensee must make certain that the number and placement of paint bands and lighting match exactly with that shown on the station authorization and/or tower registration.
The licensee/tower owner should also be aware of the requirement to clean or repaint tower structures as often as necessary to maintain good visibility to aircraft.
[See Part 17 and TSA] NOTE: One of the most common problems associated with tower painting is the feedlines that are on the outside legs of a tower.
In many cases, the tower is painted correctly, but the solid black colored feedlines defeat the purpose of the painting by covering up the outside legs of the tower.
The licensee/tower owner should make certain that the feedlines are also painted in such instances.
This does not apply in cases where the tower is authorized for strobe lighting.
58.
PAINT SPECIFICATIONS: Does the painting on the tower structure(s) match the specifications in the station authorization? [See TSA]
59.
PAINT BANDS: Does the structure have the correct number of bands and are the top and bottom bands painted orange? [See Part 17]
60.
LIGHTING SPECIFICATIONS: Does the lighting on the tower structure match exactly with the specifications in the station authorization? [See TSA]
E.
FAA NOTIFICATIONS: The tower owner/licensee is to notify the nearest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Service Station within 30 minutes of the observation of an improper functioning or extinguished top steady burning light or ANY flashing obstruction light regardless of its position on the structure.
Such improper functioning beacons include non-lighted beacons as well as those that are lighted, but non-flashing.
Notification is to also be made immediately to the FAA once the beacon or steady burning top light is returned to service.
Notification is not required when side light outages are observed.
Tower owners/licensees should insure that the telephone number to the nearest FAA Flight Service Center is readily available and known to all personnel who would be responsible for notifying the FAA of such outages.
[See 17.48] 61.
FAA NOTIFICATION: Are the tower owner/licensee and all station operators aware of the requirement to notify the nearest FAA Flight Service Station within 30 minutes of the observation of an outage AND to notify the FAA again once the outage is corrected? [See 17.48]
11
SECTION II: Continued F. STATION LOGS: For all stations operating from a tower that specify tower lighting, the licensee/tower owner is observed or otherwise known extinguishment or improper on the tower.
[See 17.49, 73.1213 and 73.1820(a)(1)(i)] a. b. c. d. owned by the licensee and which have authorizations to make entries in the station log concerning ANY functioning of ANY tower light regardless of its position This log must contain the following:
The nature of such extinguishment or improper functioning.
The date and time the extinguishment or improper operation was observed or otherwise noted.
Date and time of FAA notification, required for outages of any flashing light.
The date, time and nature of adjustments, repairs or replacements made.
This would include any work conducted as part of a system inspection or preventive maintenance program.
62.
STATION LOGS: Does the licensee/tower owner maintain a station log containing entries concerning ANY observed or otherwise known extinguishment or improper functioning of ANY tower light? [See 17.49, 73.1213 and 73.1820(a)(1)(i)]
NOTE 1: Licensees should also log the date and time of quarterly inspections of lighting systems as described in Â§17.47(b).
NOTE 2: Any extinguishment or improper functioning of a required tower light, regardless of its position on the tower, is to be corrected as soon as possible.
See Â§17.49(b) and the terms of the structure registration.
A structure is not in compliance with the structure registration if any required light is not functioning properly.
However, violations are avoided by prompt and complete logging of the outage and by documenting that the efforts made to correct the condition are being done in a timely manner.
12
SECTION III: EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM (EAS) On December 9, 1994, the Commission released a Report and Order (10 FCC Rcd 1786) which relocated the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) rules of Part 73 to the newly established Emergency Alert System (EAS) rules under Part 11.
This new rule part reflects the expansion of EAS into other radio services, including cable, along with establishing the move from the analog technology used in EBS to the digital technology used with EAS.
On February 26, 2002, the Commission released a report and order (FCC 02-64)authorizing certain changes to the EAS rules, which have been incorporated into this document.
All broadcast stations must have installed operational EAS equipment capable of sending and receiving the digital EAS protocol.
If there are any questions pertaining to the new EAS rules then please contact the Commission's EAS office at (202) 418-1228, by email at eas@fcc.gov, or by visiting the EAS web site at http://www.fcc.gov/eb/eas.
A. PARTICIPATING vs. NON-PARTICIPATING: The difference between a "Participating" and a "NonParticipating" station occurs during national level Emergency Activation Notification (EAN) alerts.
Upon receipt of an EAN the participating station will stay on the air providing necessary information while the non-participating station takes its carrier off the air.
All stations are considered participating stations, unless they submit a written request to become a non-participating station, AND they receive a written authorization to that effect.
Regardless of their participating or non-participating status, ALL stations are to install and maintain EAS equipment and participate in the weekly and monthly tests of the system.
Additionally, all stations are required to monitor for state and local EAS activations.
Once a state or local level activation has been received, the station management can then decide whether or not to participate further at that level.
[See 11.19, 11.54, 11.55 and the EAS plan for your state] 63.
PARTICIPATING: Does the management of this station know whether the station is a participating or non-participating EAS station?
B.
HANDBOOK: All stations are to maintain an EAS Operating Handbook.
The handbook is to be available at ALL EAS control points.
Please contact 1-800-418-3676, or visit http://www.fcc.gov/eb/eas for copies of the handbook.
[See 11.15]
64.
HANDBOOK: Does the station have an EAS Operating Handbook available at EACH normal duty operator position, including all remote control and ATS points utilized during any portion of the broadcast day? [See 11.15]
http://www.fcc.gov/eb/eas
13
SECTION III: Continued C. EAS DECODER/MONITOR: All TV stations must have equipment installed and capable of decoding, either manually or automatically, the digitally encoded EAS protocol while monitoring at least two assigned EAS stations.
This equipment must be operational during all hours of broadcast operation.
Manually operated equipment must be located so that operators, at their normal duty stations, can be alerted immediately when EAS messages are received.
Only one EAS decoder is required for combined facilities operating from one common location, such as a co-owned and co-located FM and TV studio.
All decoder devices are to be certified by the Commission in accordance with Part 2 Subpart J of the Commission's rules.
[See 11.31, 11.33, 11.34, 11.35 and 11.52]
65.
CERTIFIED EQUIPMENT: Does the station use only certified equipment at each location utilized for EAS monitoring? [See 11.34] EQUIPMENT STATUS: Is the required EAS decoding/receiving equipment currently installed and in operational condition? [See 11.35]
66.
67.
68.
MONITORING ASSIGNED STATION: Is the EAS decoder/monitor tuned to receive EAS activations from the monitoring priorities named in the FCC-EAS Mapbook or State EAS plan? [See 11.52 and the FCC-EAS Mapbook]
NOTE 1: EAS test and activation announcements are to be in the same language as the primary language of the station.
[See 11.54(b)(2
This same order authorized EAS manufacturers and system operators to upgrade existing systems on an optional basis without need for additional equipment authorizations.
The order further requires all EAS units produced after August 1, 2003 to have the additional codes and selective display and logging features installed prior to sale.
[See 11.33(a)(4) and the R
14
SECTION III: Continued D. EAS ENCODER/GENERATOR: All TV stations are to have installed and operational equipment capable of transmitting the digitally encoded EAS protocol.
The equipment may be installed for either manual or automatic activation of the generator.
This includes the ability to transmit a visual message containing the Originator, Event, Location and the valid time period of an EAS message.
If manual activations are used, the EAS encoder must be located so that station staff, at normal duty locations, can initiate the EAS code and Attention Signal transmission.
Only one generator is required at combined studio facilities.
Any encoder device used for generating the EAS Protocol and Attention Signal must be type accepted.
[See 11.34, 11.35 and 11.51]
69.
CERTIFIED EQUIPMENT: Does the station maintain certified equipment capable of generating the EAS protocol to modulate the transmitter so that the signal may be broadcast to other receiving stations? [See 11.34]
70.
EQUIPMENT STATUS: Is the required EAS encoding/generating equipment currently installed and operational at this station? [See 11.35]
71.
LOCATION: For manually operated equipment, is the equipment positioned where responsible broadcast staff can initiate an activation during any portion of the broadcast day? [See 11.51]
E.
EAS TESTS: All TV stations are to conduct required weekly tests (RWT) of the EAS header and End of Message (EOM) codes a minimum of once a week at random days and times, which can include any time of the day or night.
In addition, required monthly tests (RMT) are to be conducted once a month as coordinated by the Emergency Communications Committee for each state.
The RWT is optional during the week that a monthly (RMT) test is conducted.
The RMT conducted in odd numbered months shall occur between 8:30 a.m. local time and local sunset.
The RMT conducted in even numbered months shall occur between local sunset and 8:30 a.m. local time.
All RMT's shall be retransmitted within 60 minutes of receipt and include the EAS header, 8-25 seconds of two tone attention signal, entire audio message and EOM.
[See 11.61] Note1: Since stations are required to monitor two EAS sources, then each station should receive at least one RWT (or emergency activation) from each of the two sources.
An EAS activation for a state or local emergency, as defined in the EAS Handbook, may be substituted for an RWT.
The RMT may result in only one test being received during that week.
Note2: If the station is not operating at the time an RMT is scheduled, then the licensee shall log that they were off the air and an RWT should be aired some time during the week after operation of the station resumes.
72.
CONDUCT WEEKLY EAS TESTS: Does the station conduct RWT transmission tests of the EAS header and EOM codes a minimum of once a week at random days and times? [See 11.61(a)]
73.
CONDUCT MONTHLY EAS TESTS: Does the station initiate/retransmit RMT tests that include the EAS header, two tone attention signal, audio message and EOM codes as required each month? [See 11.61(a)]
74.
RECEIPT OF EAS TESTS: Did the station receive an EAS activation during the last full calendar week from each of its two assigned EAS monitoring sources? [See 11.61(a)]
15
SECTION III: Continued F. STATION LOGS: All stations are to maintain a station log containing entries pertaining to each test and activation of the Emergency Alert System that is received or initiated by the station.
EAS entries must be made in the station log either manually by responsible broadcast station staff, or by an automatic device.
Stations may keep EAS data in a special EAS log which can be maintained at any convenient location; however, such log must be considered a part of the official station log.
It is also to contain entries which adequately describe the reason why any test activation was not received and any corrective action taken.
[See 11.35(a), 11.51(j), 11.52(e), 11.55(c)(7), 11.61(b) and 73.1820(a)(1)(iii)] Whenever any EAS equipment becomes defective, the station may operate without the defective equipment, pending its repair or replacement, for a period not in excess of 60 days.
The station must make appropriate entries into the station log showing the date and time the equipment was removed and restored to service.
[See 11.35(b)] If the station cannot restore service to the defective equipment within 60 days due to conditions beyond the control of the licensee, then the station must request an extension of this time from the FCC District Director of the area in which the station is located.
Such request shall include the steps that were taken to repair or replace the defective equipment, the alternative procedures being used while the defective equipment is out of service and an estimation when the defective equipment will be repaired or replaced.
[See 11.35(c)] 75.
STATION LOGS MAINTAINED: Does the licensee maintain a station log containing an entry of each activation (both sent and received) of the Emergency Alert System (EAS)? [See 11.51(j), 11.52(e), 11.55(c)(7), and 73.1820(a)(1)(iii)]
76.
FAILURE TO RECEIVE EAS TEST: Does the station log contain appropriate entries indicating the reasons why required EAS Weekly/Monthly test transmissions were not received? If all tests have been received and logged during the last two year period, then the appropriate response is yes "Y".
[See 11.35(a)]
77.
EQUIPMENT OUTAGE: Does the station log contain appropriate entries documenting the date and time any EAS equipment was removed and/or restored to service? If there have been no such outages in the last two years, then the appropriate response is yes "Y".
[See 11.35(b)]
NOTE: On February 26, 2002, the Commission released a report and order (FCC 02-64) which allows licensees the option to program their EAS equipment to preselect which EAS messages containing state and local event codes they wish to display and log.
Stations will continue to display and log all National level alerts, RWT's, RMT's and any state and local events they elect to receive.
16
SECTION IV: TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS A. POWER: All TV stations are to maintain visual transmitter output power between 80% and 110% of that authorized.
The power is to be maintained as near as practicable to the station's authorized power.
The aural transmitter output power shall be maintained as necessary to provide an aural carrier ERP up to, but not exceeding, 22 percent of the peak authorized visual ERP.
[See 73.1560 and TSA] In the event that it becomes technically impossible to operate at authorized power, a station may operate at reduced power for a period of not more than 30 days without specific authority from the FCC.
If operation at reduced power will exceed 10 consecutive days, a notification must be sent to the FCC-Media Bureau no later than the 10th day.
If normal power is restored prior to the expiration of the 30 day period, the licensee must notify the FCC upon restoration of normal operation.
78.
OPERATING POWER: Is the station operating with power levels within tolerance of the power levels authorized? [See TSA and 73.1560]
B.
DIRECT POWER MEASUREMENT - CALIBRATION: The operating power of TV stations is normally determined by the direct method.
The direct method of power determination for a TV station uses the indications of a calibrated transmission line meter located at the RF output terminals of the transmitter.
The meter indicates the peak visual RF output as a percentage of the authorized value.
The calibration process includes marking the meter at the upper and lower operating tolerance limits.
This meter must be calibrated whenever there is any indication that the calibration is inaccurate or whenever any component of the metering circuit is repaired or replaced.
Other methods may be used to determine operating power if the direct method cannot be used (for example, in the case of a metering failure).
The indirect method, appropriate for most VHF transmitters, is determined by applying an appropriate efficiency factor to the input power to the last radio-frequency power amplifier stage of the transmitter.
Indications of a peak reading, calibrated transmission line wattmeter have been used for UHF stations.
[See 73.664] Licensees must make certain that all duty operators know which method of power determination is being used (and how to calculate the output power if necessary).
79.
POWER CALIBRATION: Has the visual transmitter reflectometer been calibrated and appropriately marked so that the operating power can be readily and accurately determined? [See 73.664, 73.1560(c)]
17
SECTION IV: Continued C. FREQUENCY: The visual carrier frequency of a TV station may not exceed +/- 1000 Hz from that authorized.
Certain stations (for example, those under precise offsets) may have a more stringent tolerance in their instrument of authorization.
The aural carrier frequency may not exceed +/- 1000 Hz from the actual visual carrier frequency plus 4.5 MHZ.
[See 73.1545 and TSA] 80.
FREQUENCY: Is the station in compliance with the frequency tolerance specified in 73.1545 and/or TSA?
D.
MODULATION: The total aural modulation may not exceed 100 percent on peaks of frequent reoccurrence, unless other limits are specified in an authorization.
For monophonic transmissions, 100 percent modulation is defined as +/- 25 kHz deviation.
For stereophonic operation and/or for operation with multiplex subcarriers, maximum limits are given in 73.682(c), and are limited to a maximum total deviation of +/- 75 kHz for all baseband components.
[See 73.1570, 73.682(c), TSA] Visual modulation shall conform to the standards shown in 73.699, Figures 6 and/or 7, and described in 73.682.
81.
MODULATION: Is the station in compliance with the modulation specifications found in 73.682, 73.699 and 73.1570?
E.
TRANSMITTER METERING 
In addition, where applicable stations may need monitoring devices to determine compliance with antenna tower lighting.
All stations must have personnel which maintain the ability to turn off the transmitter.
[See 73.688, 73.691, 73.1350 and 73.1400] 82.
CONTROL: Does the equipment at this station allow transmitter control personnel the capability of turning off the transmitter at any time the station is in operation? [See 73.1350(b)(2)]
83.
OPERATING PARAMETERS: Does the licensee maintain necessary metering to determine compliance with power and modulation? [See 73.688, 73.691, 73.1350(c)(1) and 73.1400]
18
SECTION IV: Continued F. SPURIOUS AND HARMONIC EMISSIONS: Emissions from TV transmitters on frequencies in excess of 3 MHZ above and below the channel edges shall be attenuated at least 60 dB below the visual transmitted power.
In certain cases greater attenuation may be required to eliminate interference.
Additional emission limits for the spectrum within 3 MHZ, including the lower sideband modulation energy, are found in 73.687(a).
[See 73.687(a), 73.687(e)] 84.
EMISSION LIMITS: Does the transmission system comply with the emission limits found in 73.687?
G.
MONITORING PROCEDURES: The licensee must establish monitoring procedures and schedules for the station.
Monitoring procedures and schedules must enable the licensee to determine compliance with operating power, modulation levels and where applicable with antenna tower lighting.
Licensees should be able to provide upon request made by the FCC, the monitoring procedures and schedules they have established for each station.
[See 73.691(a) and 73.1350(c)(1)] In the event that a TV broadcast station is operating with excessive power, or with excessive modulation, then station operation is to be terminated within 3 hours, unless corrective action is taken prior to that time.
[See 73.1350(d)]
85.
SCHEDULES: Has the licensee established procedures and schedules for monitoring the power and modulation of this station? [See 73.691(a) and 73.1350(c)]
19
SECTION IV: Continued H. CALIBRATION: The licensee must conduct periodic complete inspections of the transmitting system, all required monitors and automatic logging devices to ensure proper station operation.
Monitors and automatic logging devices must be periodically calibrated so as to provide reliable indications of transmitter operating parameters with a known degree of accuracy.
The determination as to how frequent the complete inspection and calibrations are to occur is up to the licensee.
The licensee should make certain that the date of calibration of each device is entered in the station log along with any other resulting actions associated with the calibration, such as replacement of a meter or other device.
The licensee may keep calibration data in a special calibration log, however, such log must be considered a part of the official station log and as such must be made available upon request.
[See 73.1350(c), 73.1580 and 73.1820(a)(2)(iii)] 86.
CALIBRATION: Has the licensee established procedures and schedules for conducting periodic inspection of the transmitting system and all monitors, and to periodically calibrate these devices? [See 73.1350(c) and 73.1580]
87.
LOGGING: Are the results of such calibration entered into the station log? [See 73.1820(a)(2)(iii)]
20
SECTION V: ATTENDED VS UNATTENDED OPERATION A. ATTENDED VS UNATTENDED: Broadcast stations may be operated as either attended or unattended facilities.
No prior FCC approval is required to operate a station in the unattended mode.
Regardless of which method of station operation is employed, licensees must employ procedures which will ensure compliance with the EAS rules.
[See 73.1300] ATTENDED OPERATION: Attended operation consists of ongoing supervision of the transmission facilities by a station employee or other person designated by the licensee either at the transmitter site, a remote control point, or an ATS control point.
Such supervision may be by direct observation and control of the transmitting system by a live person at the transmitter site or remote control point, or such supervision can be by automated equipment that is configured to contact a person designated by the licensee.
In either case a live person must be on duty at a FIXED location during all hours of broadcast operation where they can turn off the transmitter and where they can either monitor the station operating parameters themselves or be contacted by the automated equipment which is monitoring the equipment for them.
During attended operation it is expected that the transmitter will be turned off by station personnel within 3 hours of an overpower or overmodulation condition (within 3 minutes for operation with an incorrect mode or directional pattern for that time of day) that can cause interference that cannot be corrected within that period of time.
[See 73.1350 and 73.1400(a)] UNATTENDED OPERATION: Unattended operation consists of using self-monitoring or automatic transmission system (ATS) monitoring equipment to control the transmission system, or alternatively, operation in the absence of constant human supervision with equipment that can operate for prolonged periods of time within assigned tolerances.
In the former case, equipment must be configured to automatically take the station off the air within the required 3 hour or 3 minute time periods after an out-of-tolerance condition arises.
In the latter case, the licensee is required to make certain that the station is monitored frequently enough to ensure that station operation is corrected or terminated within the designated 3 hour or 3 minute time limits, but constant human supervision is not required.
[See 73.1350(c) and 73.1400(b)] NOTE 1: The unattended transmitter operation rules are separate from the main studio presence requirements.
Please do not confuse the two.
Stations operating in an unattended transmitter monitoring mode are still required to maintain a human presence at the main studio during normal business hours.
NOTE 2: A Media Bureau Fact Sheet on Unattended Operation may be found on the Internet at
http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/noonehome.html.
88.
UNATTENDED: Does the licensee maintain either automated equipment or periodic human monitoring that enables station operation to be corrected or terminated within 3 hours (or 3 minutes) after an out-of-tolerance condition arises? [See 73.1350(c) and 73.1400(b)] ATTENDED: Does the licensee maintain a person on duty at a fixed location during all periods that the station is on the air where they can either monitor and control the station themselves or be contacted by automated transmitter monitoring equipment within 3 hours (or 3 minutes) after an out-of-tolerance condition arises? [See 73.1350(c) and 73.1400(a)]
89.
21
SECTION V: Continued B. NOTIFICATION: Whenever a transmission system control point is established at a location other than at the main studio or transmitter, then notification of that location must be sent to the FCC, Media Bureau, Washington, D.C. 20554, within 3 days of the initial use of that point.
This notification is not required if responsible station personnel can be contacted at the transmitter or studio site during hours of operation.
[See 73.1350] NOTE: Notification of an alternate control point should be a separate notification and action or notification you are sending to the Commission.
An informal letter is sufficient make certain that the letter includes the complete street address of the control point as number.
The licensee should also include the hours that this point is normally being used not a part of another notification.
Please well as a telephone as the control point.
90.
NOTIFICATION: Has the licensee notified the Media Bureau in writing of the location of all transmission system control points other than the main studio or transmitter location? [See 73.1350(g)]
91.
STATION RECORDS: Is a copy of this notification available in the station records?
22
SECTION VI: LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENT (LMA) DEFINITION: "Time brokerage", also known as "Local Marketing Agreement" or "LMA", is the sale by a licensee of discrete blocks of time to a "broker" that supplies the programming and commercial spot announcements to fill that time.
A.
LMA STATUS:
92.
LMA STATUS: Has this station been engaged in a time brokerage agreement during any portion the current term of the station authorization?
NOTE: If this station has not been engaged in a time brokerage agreement during any part of the current term of the station license or other authorization, then you are not required to answer any further questions contained in this section (Section VI).
B.
FILING OF CONTRACTS: All stations involved in an LMA must file a copy of the agreement in the stations public inspection file.
In addition, the LMA agreement must be filed with the FCC, Media Bureau, Washington, D.C. 20554, within 30 days of execution if a licensee in the same market is brokering the station and providing more that 15 percent of the time on the brokered station.
Confidential or proprietary information may be marked out in the copies placed in the public inspection file and this same information may be marked out in the copies filed with the Commission, however, such information shall be made available for inspection upon request by the FCC.
[See 73.3526(e)(14) and 73.3613(d)] A list of all contracts still in effect, which are required to be filed with the FCC in accordance with 73.3613, are to be filed with the ownership report.
This list shall include the date of execution and the expiration of each contract and the list shall document any interest which the licensee may have in any other broadcast station.
[See 73.3615(a)(4)]
93.
FILING: Has the licensee submitted a copy of the LMA to the FCC within 30 days of execution of the agreement? LISTS: Has the licensee provided a list of all contracts in effect along with the ownership report?
94.
23
SECTION VI: Continued C. CONTROL OF THE STATION: There is no exact formula by which control of a broadcast station can be determined.
However, the FCC has traditionally held that the licensee has ultimate responsibility over essential station matters, such as personnel, programming and finances.
Licensees are required to maintain control of their stations regardless of who is brokering the station.
[See Title 47 United States Code Chapter 5, Subchapter III, Part I, Section 310(d) and 73.3540]
95.
CONTROL: Has the licensee maintained control over this station?
D. MAIN STUDIO: Licensees are required to maintain a meaningful management and staff presence at stations, even when they are engaged in an LMA.
The Commission has interpreted this to mean full-time managerial and full-time staff personnel are to be employed and present at the station during normal business hours.
[See 73.1125]
96.
PRESENCE: Does the licensee maintain full-time managerial and staff personnel at the station during normal business hours when the station is brokered?

- An emission standard for AM stations aimed at attenuating AM sideband energy beyond 10 kHz of the assigned carrier frequency.
This standard was implemented June 30, 1994.
- The radio frequency output power of a transmitter's final radio frequency stage as measured at the output terminal while connected to a load.
Often referred to as TPO. - A publicly accessible file to be maintained by broadcast stations which contains documents pertaining to the station's licensing, ownership, and operation.
