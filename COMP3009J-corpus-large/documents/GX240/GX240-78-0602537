SENATE BILL
No. 361
Introduced by Senator Figueroa (Coauthors: Senators Aanestad and Vincent) (Coauthors: Assembly Members Correa, Nation, and Runner)
February 19, 2003
An act to amend Sections 4001, 4002, 4003, 4008, 4062, 4200, 4202, 4312, 4400, and 4403 of, and to add Sections 4083, 4106, 4200.2, 4200.3, 4200.4, 4314, and 4315 to, the Business and Professions Code, relating to pharmacy.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 361, as amended, Figueroa.
Pharmacy: administration and enforcement.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, creates the California State Board of Pharmacy within the Department of Consumer Affairs.
Under existing law, the board is authorized to appoint an executive director to exercise the powers and perform the duties delegated by the board.
The law makes these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2004, and repeals them on January 1, 2005.
Under existing law, the board consists of 11 members, 2 of whom are public members appointed by the Governor.
This bill would delete these inoperative and repeal dates and would extend the operation of these provisions to make them inoperative on July 1, 2008, and repeal them on January 1, 2009.
The bill would also increase the board membership to 13 by adding 2 more public members appointed by the Governor and .
The bill would also specify that one of 96
SB 361
--2--
the pharmacist appointees be a member of a labor union representing pharmacists , that one practice in an independent community pharmacy setting, and that another practice in a chain community pharmacy setting.
Existing law authorizes the board to employ inspectors of pharmacy.
These inspectors are required to be pharmacists if their principal duties are either inspecting or investigating pharmacies or pharmacists or supervising other inspectors of pharmacy.
This bill would delete the requirement that certain inspectors of pharmacy must be pharmacists.
The bill would authorize inspectors to issue a written order of correction and the executive officer, or his or her designee, to issue a letter of admonishment, directing a licensee to comply with the Pharmacy Law or related regulations.
The bill would require an order of correction or a letter of admonishment to contain certain information, including the process for a licensee to contest the order or letter.
The bill would require a licensee to have readily available on the pharmacy premises a copy of any order of correction or letter of admonishment issued against it in the prior 3 years, and a related corrective plan of action.
The bill would provide that an order of correction would not be a public record, except as specified.
This bill would authorize the board to issue a citation for a violation of the Pharmacy Law or related regulations, with a fine of up to $2,500 and an order of abatement, which may require a person to demonstrate how future compliance will be accomplished.
Existing law sets forth certain educational, training, and examination requirements that an applicant for a pharmacist license must meet.
This bill would revise the examination requirements, as specified, and would require the board to develop a Multi-State Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination for California that meets certain guidelines and to review the examination process.
The bill would prohibit an applicant who failed the national examination from retaking it for a designated time period.
Existing law requires an applicant for a pharmacy technician certification to meet certain education requirements.
This bill would revise those education requirements.
The Pharmacy Law makes a violation of its provisions a crime.
Because this bill would create new requirements for licensees under that law, the violation of which is a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.

SB 361

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST
SB 151, as amended, Burton.
Controlled substances: Schedule II.
Existing law provides that no person shall prescribe a controlled substance, nor shall any person fill, compound, or dispense such a prescription unless it complies with specified requirements, one of which is that prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances shall be prepared on triplicate prescription blanks issued by the Department
94
SB 151
--2--
of Justice.
Existing law also provides for the electronic monitoring of the prescribing and dispensing of Schedule II controlled substances pursuant to the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) program, as specified.
The CURES program is scheduled to become inoperative on July 1, 2008, and repealed on January 1, 2009.
Existing law provides that a violation of any of these provisions is generally a misdemeanor.
This bill would, on and after July 1, 2004, eliminate the triplicate prescription requirement for Schedule II controlled substances and would, on and after January 1, 2005, require prescribers of Schedule II controlled substances to meet the same prescription requirements imposed with respect to other prescribable controlled substances, as specified.
The bill would, on and after January 1, 2005, require prescriptions for any controlled substance to be issued on controlled substance prescription forms obtained from a security printer approved by the Board of Pharmacy, as specified.
Between July 1, 2004, and January 1, 2005, these prescriptions would be permitted using either the triplicate form or the security forms.
The bill would make the CURES program applicable to Schedule III drugs if there is adequate funding and would also provide for the indefinite continuation of the CURES program by deleting its repeal date.
The bill would make it a crime to counterfeit a controlled substance prescription; knowingly possess a counterfeited controlled substance prescription; or obtain under false pretenses, or fraudulently produce, a controlled substance prescription, as specified.
By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would also revise provisions relating to electronically transmitted prescriptions and would add provisions authorizing pharmacies to dispense certain prescriptions from out-of-state prescribers, as specified.
The bill would make conforming changes to related provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

Appropriation: no.
