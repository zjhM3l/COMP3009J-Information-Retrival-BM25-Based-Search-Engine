Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Programmatic Regulations Initial Draft December 2001 Introduction These programmatic regulations, once promulgated, will become part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
The CFR is the foundation of the Federal Register publication system.
It is an annual codification of the rules of the Federal agencies.
The basic structure of the CFR consists of a hierarchy of designated CFR units.
These units are Titles (broad area subject), Chapter (rules of a sing le issuing agency), Part (unified body of rules concerning a single function or specific subject), and Section (short presentation of one regulatory function).
The Corps of Engineers has decided to place the programmatic regulations in the CFR under Title 33 Navigation and Navigable Waters, Chapter II Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in a new part, Part 385, entitled "Programmatic Regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan."
This initial draft is being circulated to the public for discussion purposes.
This initial draft is expected to be revised following coordination with agencies, groups , and the public.
The Department of the Army and the Office of Management and Budget will also review the draft programmatic regulations before they are published in the Federal Register as a proposed rule.
This initial draft of the programmatic regulations uses the format required for placement of a proposed rule in the Federal Register in accordance with the Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook (October 1998 Revision) except for the addition of line numbers to the text and not being double -spaced.

ACTION: Proposed Rule.
SUMMARY: The Army Corps of Engineers proposes to establish programmatic regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Re storation Plan.
Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680), which was enacted on December 11, 2000.
The Act also requires the Secretary of the Army to promulgate programmatic regulations within two years to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved.
We have developed this proposed rule in response to that statutory requirement.
The proposed rule establishes processes and procedures that will guide the Army Corps of Engineers and its partners in the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 I. Background The purpose of these programmatic regulations is to establish a process : for the development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that ensure that the goals and the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved; to ensure that new information resulting from changes or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information or information that is developed through the principles of adaptive management contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan; and to ensure the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan may be evaluated throughout the implementation process.
The south Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally unique and important natural resource.
It is also a resource in peril, having been severely impacted by human activities for over a hundred years.
The Central 
First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple purposes.
The authorized purposes of the project include flood control, regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park, preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation.
For over 50 years, the Central 
However, the project also has had unintended adverse effects on the unique natural environment that constit utes the Everglades and south Florida ecosystem.
In 1992, the Army Corps of Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem, while enhancing water supplies and maintaining flood protection.
The resulting plan, which was submitted to Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The overarching goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan) is the restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water- related needs of the region such as flood protection and water supply.
The Plan contains 68 major components that involve creation of approximately 217,000 acres of reservoirs and wetland - based water treatment areas, wastewater reuse plants, seepage management, and removal of levees and canals in natural areas.
These components vastly increase storage and water supply for the natural system, as well as for urban and agricultural needs, while maintaining existing Central and Southern Florida Project purposes.
The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; improve water quality; and establish more natural hydroperiods in the south Florida ecosystem.
Improvements to native flora and fauna, including threatened and endangered species, are expected to occur as a result of the restoration of hydrologic conditions.
Section 601 of Public Law 106- 541, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for 4 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 modifications to the Central and Southern Florida Project.
Section 601 also authorized four pilot projects and ten initial projects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and contains other provisions associated with implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688) requires that the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior, and consultation with the Seminole Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, promulgate programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
This proposed rule is in response to the requirements of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000.
II.
Process for Developing the Proposed Rule We developed the proposed rule through an open and inclusive process that involved numerous meetings, briefings, and discussions with other Federa l, State, and local agencies; the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups; and the public.
Briefings on the programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Working Group.
In addition, programmatic regulations web pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan web site (www.evergladesplan.org).
The web site was used to post information about the programmatic regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic regulations.
The process we used to develop the programmatic regulations was designed to identify the major concerns of the agenc ies and the various groups and to find middle ground to the greatest extent possible prior to publishing the proposed rule and soliciting formal public comment.
We held an initial round of meetings with agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public in May and June 2001.
The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues a nd concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations.
Following the initial round of meetings, we developed a draft outline of the programmatic regulations.
We then held a second round of meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public to solicit comments on the draft outline.
After the second round of meetings were held, we developed an initial draft of the programmatic regulations and distributed this initial draft to the public in December 5 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 2001.
We then held numerous discussions and meetings with agencies, governments, and agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, a nd urban interest groups, to discuss the initial draft.
Finally, we developed the proposed rule after considering all the information received at the meetings that were held as well as written comments that were received.
III.
Major Issues Addressed in Developing the Programmatic Regulations A. General As described in the previous section, we held numerous meetings with agencies, governments, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public.
They raised a number of issues and concerns that were considered in the development of the proposed rule.
B. Partnership with the State of Florida Implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires a partnership between the Federal and State governments.
The South Florida Water Management District will be the non- Federal sponsor for many of the projects of the Plan.
The State of Florida has established a funding mechanism, the Save Our Everglades Trust Fund, to fund the State's share of implementation of the Plan.
Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 recognizes and encourages this partnership and the proposed rule is consistent with this intent.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes this partnership: "Subsection (h) does more than provide the necessary assurances.
It also defines the relation among the various Federal, State and local governmental entities charged with Plan implementation responsibilities.
The subsection places procedural and substantive requirements on both the Federal Government and the State of Florida.
Most importantly, subsection (h) strikes a careful balance between the Federal interest in ensuring that predicted Plan benefits, including benefits to Federal lands, are attained, and the State's interest in: ensuring that Stateowned or managed lands also receive predicted Plan benefits; and preserving its traditional sovereignty over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries."
The proposed rule provides a framework for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan by defining the processes and procedures needed to accomplish the necessary planning, design, construction, and operation of the projects of the Plan.
The processes and requirements included in the proposed rule were also developed to compliment, but not interfere with the rights and responsibilities of the South Florida Water Management District, the State of Florida, or other non- Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan.
The proposed rule also recognizes that the nonFederal sponsor for some projects will be governmental entities other than the South Florida Water Management District.
C. Consultation 6 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 Successful implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires not just the involvement of the implementing agencies, but extensive involvement by other Federal, State, and local agencies and the tribes.
Although implementation of the Plan is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor, the proposed rule provides that the implementing agencies consult with the Department of the Interior, the Florida Department of Enviro nmental Protection, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies as part of the implementation process.
The consultation provisions ensure that these agencies and governments are integrally involved with the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor in implementing the Plan.
D. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Rule Many agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about the amount of detail in the regulations.
Some believed that the programmatic regulations should be very detailed, specific, and prescriptive.
Others believed that the programmatic regulations should only define the "rules of engagement" between the Corps of Engineers and its non- Federal project sponsors.
In addition, some were concerned that these Federal regulations not infringe on the sovereignty of the State of Florida or interfere with the State's right to allocate its water resources.
Others were concerned that the programmatic regulations ensure that the Federal interest and investment in restoration, preservation, and protection of the south Florida ecosystem, including Federal properties such as national parks and wildlife refuges be protected.
The proposed rule attempts to balance these differing concerns and interests.
The proposed rule includes a number of processes that are necessary to guide the implementation process.
We recognize that more detailed protocols and procedures are needed as well to assist implementation.
We believe that, because for the most part the protocols and procedures will be very detailed and technical, they should not be included in the programmatic regulations.
Additionally, if protoco ls and procedures were included in the programmatic regulations, any revision to them would require us to initiate a formal rulemaking process even for minor revisions.
However, given the importance of protocols and procedures and the impact that they will have on implementation, we believe that the public should have the opportunity to review and comment on the protocols and procedures before they are adopted.
The proposed rule provides that opportunities for public comment be provided before any protocols and procedures are adopted.
The proposed rule also provides for the development of certain protocols and provides guidance for their development.
E. Implementation Principles Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 states that the ove rarching objective of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water- related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
So me agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about having a set of goals to guide implementation of the Plan.
They rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 7 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 DECEMBER 2001 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) which states, "Further, the committee expects that the implementing agencies will make every effort to accelerate the delivery of Plan benefits to t he natural system to the extent practicable.
It is estimated that 3 to 5 acres of land in the South Florida ecosystem are lost per day under current conditions.
Time is of the essence in this restoration effort."
The proposed rule establishes a number of implementation principles such as sequencing and scheduling projects to accelerate system- wide restoration, preservation, and protection benefits that are intended to guide the implementation process consistent with the overarching objective of the Plan.
F. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about integration of the individual projects that co mprise the Plan to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
They were concerned that there be a system- wide focus during implementation and that there be a way to ensure that the best scientific information on restoration is used.
Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned that there be a focus on achieving the other waterrelated benefits of the Plan, in addition to the restoration benefits.
The proposed rule provides that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District establish the Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team, a team that is functioning already.
RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency team that will ensure that a system- wide perspective is maintained throughout the implementation process.
Specifically, RECOVER will be responsible for developing system- wide performance measures for restoration as well as other water- related needs, evaluating projects from a system- wide perspective in the preparation of Project Implementation Reports, conducting adaptive assessment activities, developing and evaluating proposed revisions to the Plan, and developing recommendations for interim goals.
The proposed rule formalizes many of the activities already underway by RECOVER.
G. Independent Scientific Review Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were conc erned that the implementation process needs to include independent scientific review.
Section 601(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 requires the establishment of an independent scientific review panel.
The proposed rule does not establish t he panel, but it does include provisions for cooperating with the panel and considering the advice and recommendations made by the panel.
H. Project Implementation Reports Section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 establishes a new type o f reporting document called a Project Implementation Report to bridge the gap between the conceptual level of detail in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the detail needed for project design.
Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned that a clearly defined process was needed for the development of Project Implementation Reports, and 8 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 in particular the formulation and evaluation of projects.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) defines Project Implementation Reports: " The project implementation report is a new type of reporting document, simila r to a General Reevaluation Report in that it will contain additional project formulation and evaluation.
The project implementation report also will contain General Design Memorandum level of detail, or higher, for engineering and design.
Some of the task s associated with the preparation of the project implementation report will include: surveys and mapping; geotechnical analyses; flood damage assessment; real estate analyses; and preparation of supplemental National Environmental Policy Act documents.
The project implementation reports will bridge the gap between the programmatic- level design contained in the Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction.
Furthermore, each project implementation report will be accompanied by a project Management Plan, which will detail schedules, funding requirements, and resource needs for final design and construction of the project."
The proposed rule provides guidance for the development of Project Implementation Reports.
The proposed rule provides for development and adoption of a protocol that describes the major tasks to develop a Project Implementation Report and a protocol that provides an outline for the content of the Project Implementation Report.
The proposed rule also provides for development and adoption of a protocol for the formulation and evaluation of projects.
I. Project Cooperation Agreements The Project Cooperation Agreement is the legal agreement between the Department of the Army and the non- Federal sponsor that must be executed before a project can be constructed.
Section 601(h) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 requires that the agreement not be executed until the State has reserved or allocated water for the natural system as described in the Project Implementation Report.
A number of agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about how to make sure that the reservation or allocation is made in accordance with the Project Implementation Report.
The proposed rule provides that the District Engineer verify that this reservation or allocation has been made by the State as identified in the Project Implementation Report.
This will provide the assurances that Congress intended without infringing on the State's right to reserve or allocate water under State law.
The proposed rule also establishes that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that the reservation or allocation remain in effect and not be diminished, unless the Secretary of the Army agrees, for as long as the Plan is authorized.
This provision is intended to protect the Federal interest and investment in the Plan and the need to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
The propos ed rule provides that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that prohibits the Corps of Engineers or the non- Federal sponsor from eliminating or transferring existing legal sources of water until a new source of comparable quantity and 9 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 quality is available.
This provision implements the Savings Clause provisions of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000.
It is designed to prevent harm to existing legal sources of water including those for agricultural or urban water supply, the Miccosukee or Seminole Tribes, water supply for Everglades National Park, and water supply for fish and wildlife.
Also in compliance with the Savings Clause provisions, the proposed rule provides that the Project Cooperation Agreement include a provision that existing levels of flood protection not be reduced.
J. Operating Manuals Operating Manuals provide rules and procedures on how to operate the completed projects.
To achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan, individual projects must be operated as part of a system.
Operating manuals encompass both individual projects and the entire system.
Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned with ensuring that operating manuals be consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan.
The proposed rule establishes the development of two different types of Operating Manuals.
A System Operating Manual will be developed to provide a system- wide water control plan t hat ensures that the operation of individual projects is linked together into a system- wide framework.
A Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project.
The draft Project Operating Manual will be incorporated into the Project Implementation Report.
This connects operation of the project to the expected benefits of the project recommended in the Project Implementation Report.
The Project Operating Manual should be consistent with the System Operating Manual.
The final Project Operating Manual will be prepared before completion of the operational testing and monitoring phase.
K. Sequencing and Scheduling of Projects The Plan consists of 68 components that will be implemented as approximately 45 separate projects, including pilot projects.
The "Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement" dated April 1, 1999, included a sequence and schedule for the Plan.
In July 2001, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District updated the sequence and schedule to include updated information and requirements from Congress and the Florida legislature.
Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public were concerned about ho w projects would be sequenced and scheduled.
Some were concerned that the sequencing and schedule ensure that restoration benefits occur early in the implementation process.
Others were concerned that other benefits of the Plan would be postponed until very late in the implementation process.
The proposed rule establishes a process for developing a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.
The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will include the schedule and sequencing of projects based on the best funding, technical, contracting, and other information available.
The proposed rule provides that projects will be sequenced and scheduled to accelerate system- wide restoration, preservation, and protection benefits while providing for the 10 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 other water- related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
However, funding, technical, and other constraints could affect the sequence and schedule of projects.
The proposed rule provides that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan be revised as necessary to incorporate new information such as updated schedules from approved Project Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other studies, updated funding information, revisions to the Plan, Congressional or other authorization and direction, or information from the adaptive assessment program.
It may also be necessary to revise the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan to better achieve the interim goals.
L. Adaptive Assessment Program One of the key aspects of implementation of the Plan is adaptive assessment.
Adaptive assessment provides the flexibility needed to modify the plan based on new information.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes the intent of the adaptive assessment program: "The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it was submitted to Congress.
This result would be inconsistent with the adaptive assessment principles in the Plan.
Restoration o f the Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the April, 1999 Plan was based.
Instead, the committee expects that the agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and changed circumstances."
The flexibility offered by the adaptive assessment program is crucial for dealing with the uncertainties of the ecological responses that will occur as the Plan is implemented.
The proposed rule establishes an adaptive assessment program to guide implementation.
RECOVER will be responsible for carrying out adaptive assessment tasks and for developing necessary procedures to guide adaptive assessment.
If undesirable responses are detected, RECOVER will prepare a report with recommendations for correcting the problem.
These recommendations could include changes to operations, changes to the Plan, changes to the implementation sequencing or scheduling, or some combination of these.
M. Revisions to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically to reflect new information or to improve performance based on the results of adaptive assessment.
The proposed rule provides that a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be prepared whenever significant revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
Therefore, the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be an update or supplement to the "Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement" dated April 1, 1999.
After the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report is reviewed and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, it will be transmitted to Congress for approval.
N. Ensuring Achievement of Project Benefits 11 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 Section 601(f) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2686) requires the preparation and approval of Project Impleme ntation Reports prior to implementation of Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan projects.
The Act specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
The reservation or allocation of water for the natural system will be implemented under State law.
The Secretary of the Army cannot execute a Project Cooperation Agreement for the project until the reservation or allocation is made under State law.
"State law" includes reservations or allocations of water made by Florida's Water Management Districts under authority of state law.
Some groups expressed a view that the Plan required that water be reserved for the natural system on an 80%- 20% basis.
These groups rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) that states, " The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water to be produced by each project.
According to the Army Corps, 80 percent of the water generated b y the Plan is needed for the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the water generated for use in the human environment....
Subject to future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or allocated for the benefit of the natural system" (Emphasis added).
Although those percentages were appropriate as an initial estimate for the purpose o f developing the Plan, the regulations anticipate that each Project Implementation Report will evaluate and identify water to be reserved for the natural system, and that the Plan itself will be continually evaluated through adaptive assessment.
The needs of the natural system and the water required to be allocated under the Savings Clause may be a greater or less percentage than the initial Plan estimate.
Therefore, these regulations do not require that water for each project be strictly allocated on an 80 % 20% basis.
For the same reasons, it is not appropriate to establish a fixed allocation of water as an interim goal.
Agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public expressed a number of concerns about the identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
These concerns were mostly focused on how the identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system, which is a requirement o f the Project Implementation Report, would be coordinated with the actual reservation or allocation process which is conducted under State law.
Central to ensuring achievement of the benefits of the Plan is the development of the preCERP baseline.
This baseline represents the conditions in the region on the date of enactment of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (December 11, 2000).
The baseline establishes existing deliveries of water by the Central and Southern Florida Project.
The proposed rule provides that each Project Implementation Report consider the loss of pre- CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project comp onent.
12 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 DECEMBER 2001 The PIR may also consider other remedial actions, including, but not limited to: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report; or whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re- examine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system.
The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was developed as an integrated set of components or projects that are intended to work together to successfully achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan.
Although individual projects increase the amount of water available, the effect of an individual project extends far beyond the location of the project.
Accordingly, it is important that the identification of water to be reserved for the natural system take into account the synergistic and regional effect of projects.
The proposed rule provides that a protocol be developed to provide a uniform system- wide procedure for quantifying water made available by projects and for identifying the water to be reserved for the natural system.
The proposed rule also provides direction for the development of the protocol.
Some agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest gr oups, and the public were concerned about potential variations from the predicted availability of water once projects are actually implemented and operated.
The proposed rule provides that development of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be undertaken to determine the need for revisions to the Plan.
The proposed rule also provides that in the interim during preparation of the Project Implementation Report, operation of the project should be consistent with the purposes of the project component as aut horized by Congress.
In the absence of specific purposes for a project component in the Congressional authorization, then the operation of a project component generally should be based on providing water in accordance with the following priorities: the first operational priority will be uses transferred from existing legal sources of water, then "new water" for restoration of the natural system, and then "new water" for other uses of wate r. O. Savings Clause Provisions Many agencies, groups, and the public were concerned about the effects of implementation on existing legal sources of water and on existing levels of flood protection.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106- 362) describes the intent of the savings clause provisions: "Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until new sources of comparable quantity a nd quality of water are available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District is specifically preserved.
With respect to flood control, the committee intends that implementation of the Plan will not result in significant adverse impact to any person with an existing, legally recognized right to a level of protection against flooding.
The committee does not intend that, co nsistent with benefits included in 13 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 the Plan, this bill create any new rights to a level of protection against flooding that is not currently recognized under applicable Federal or State law."
The savings clause provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2690) are intended to provide protection to existing legal sources of water.
The proposed rule provides that the Project Implementation Report include analyses to determine if the project will cause such a transfer.
If the project will cause a transfer, then the Project Implementation report will include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer will not take place until after the project is constructed and operating as intended.
In accordance with the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2690), the proposed rule also provides that the Project Implementation Report include analyses of the existing level of service for flood protection.
If the existing level of service would be adversely affected, then the proposed rule provides that the recommended plan be modified to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effect.
The proposed rule also allows for the evaluation of increased levels of flood protection, provided that it is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and is practical.
P. Interim Goals Section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2689) requires that interim goals be established to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the restoration process.
Progress towards meeting the interim goals is to be reported to Congress as part of the periodic reports required by the Act.
While there was widespread agreement among agencies, agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups, and the public that interim goals should be established to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Pla n are achieved, there were different views about whether these interim goals should be a part of the programmatic regulations.
Some believed that the interim goals needed to be a part of the programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals would be met.
Their basis for this was the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Report 106- 362) which states, "In developing the programmatic regulations, the Federal and State partners should establish interim goals -- expressed in terms of restoration standards-- to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the implementation process.
The restoration standards should be quantitative and measurable at specific points in the Plan implementation."
They also believed that goals had to be incorporated into the regulations to enable the public to take part in the process of establishing the goals Others were concerned that the statute specifically required the re gulations to set up the process for establishing interim goals rather than the goals themselves.
Some were concerned that placing the interim goals in the programmatic regulations would make goals cumbersome to adopt and amend.
Some were concerned that inc orporating the goals themselves into the regulations would suggest that goals were meant to set standards or schedules enforceable in court rather than planning targets, and assessment and reporting tools.
14 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 DECEMBER 2001 The proposed rule attempts to balance these comp eting views, while making it clear that interim goals are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court.
The proposed rule establishes the process for developing the interim goals.
Development of the technical basis for interim goals will be carried out by the interagency Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team and includes a number of opportunities for public and agency comment.
Interim goals will be memorialized through an agreement signed by the Department of the Army, t he Department of the Interior, and the State of Florida.
The periodic reports to Congress that are required by section 601(l) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 will include information on progress towards meeting the interim goals.
The proposed rule also provides a process for revising the interim goals when necessary.
IV. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Schedule and Transition Rule Section 601(h)(3)(D) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2689) provides a schedule and transition rule for Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of the programmatic regulations.
The requirement for Project Implementation Reports approved pursuant to the schedule and transition rule is that they be consistent with the Plan.
A number of Project Implementation Reports are currently underway, but no Project Implementation Reports have been approved to date.
The Project Implementation Report for the Southern Golden Gates Estates project in Collier County is currently scheduled to be completed prior to promulgation of the final rule.
If the final Project Implementation Report on Southern Golden Gates Estates is approved before the date of promulgation of the final rule, then the preamble to the final rule will contain a statement concerning the consistency of that Project Implementation Report with the programmatic regulations.
The Water Preserve Areas and Indian River Lagoon feasibility studies, which include a number of Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan components, have been underway for some time and are nearing completion.
We anticipate that the final feasibility reports will be submitted to Congress later this year.
Following promulgation of the final rule, we anticipate preparing Special Project Implementation Reports and submitting them to Congress.
The Special Project Implementation Reports will address water quantification and identification of water to be reserved for the natural system using the protocols developed pursuant to these programmatic regulations.
V. Concurrence Requirements Section 601(h)(3)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688) requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence on the proposed programmatic regulations within 180 days from the end of the public comment period.
We maintained close coordination with the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida throughout the process for developing the proposed rule.
The final rule will include a reference to the 15 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 DECEMBER 2001 concurrence or non- concurrence statements of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Florida on the proposed rule.
VI. Organization of the Proposed Rule We have organized the proposed rule under four major headings.
The first heading provides the purpose and scope of the rule, definitions needed for the rule, and other information required by Section 601(h)(3)(C) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688).
The remaining headings were designed to be consistent with the content required by Section 601(h)(3)(C).
These headings are: Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Implementation Processes; Incorporating New Information into the Plan; and Ensuring P rotection of the Natural System Consistent with the Goals and Purposes of the Plan.
VII.

VIII.
Administrative Requirements A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)
This rule does not impose any information collection requirements for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required.
Thus, this action is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
B. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), we must determine whether the regulatory action is "significant" and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management a nd Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Order defines "significant regulatory action" as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 16 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been tentatively determined that this rule is a "significant regulatory action" in light of the provisions of paragr aph (4) above.
As such, this action will be submitted to OMB for review.
Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.
C. Executive Order 13132 Executive Order 13132, entitled "Federalism" (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), requires us to develop an accountable process to ensure "meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications."
"Policies that have federalism implications" is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have "substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government."
This rule does not have significant federalism implications.
The proposed rule defines the relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The proposed rule is limit ed to implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and, therefore, has little incremental impact on State and local governments and their activities.
It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132.
Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule.
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice- andcomment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions.
For purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1) A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not- for- profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not domina nt in its field.
After considering the economic impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The proposed rule only establishes processes and governmental relationships that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 17 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.): (a) This rule, as proposed, will not "significantly or uniquely" affect small governments.
A Small Government Agency Plan is not required.
Small governments will only be affected to the extent that they agree to act as non- Federal sponsor for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The proposed rule does not establish new or different requirements for non- Federal sponsors for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
(b) This rule, as proposed, will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or greater in any year, that is, it is not a "significant regulatory action" under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
The proposed rule defines processes and relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The proposed rule does not affect the cost sharing requirements for non- Federal sponsors in implementing the Plan and therefore, imposes no new obligations on State or local governments.
F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104- 113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our regulatory act ivities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.
Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.
The NTTAA directs us to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.
This rule does not involve technical standards.
There fore, we did not consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards.
G. Executive Order 13045 Executive Order 13045, entitled Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated after April 21, 1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be "economically significant" as defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns an environmental hea lth or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.
If the regulatory action meets all three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives that we considered.
This proposed rule is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866.
The proposed rule establishes processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the Federal and State partners for implementation.
Furthermore, it does not concern an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.
H. Executive Order 13084 18 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 Under Executive Order 13084, we may not issue a regulation that is not required by statute, if it significantly or uniquely affects the communities of Indian Tribal governments and imposes substantial direct compliance costs on those communities, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with those governments.
If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13084 requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a description of the extent of our prior consultation with representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the regulation.
In addition, Executive Order 13084 requires us to develop an effective process permitting elected officials and other representatives of Indian Tribal governments "to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory policies on matters that significantly or uniquely affect their communities."
The proposed rule is required by section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2688).
Additionally, the proposed rule does not significantly or uniquely affect the communities of Indian Tribal governments, nor does it impose significant co mpliance costs on them.
The proposed rule establishes processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the implementing entities.
Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of Execut ive Order 13084 do not apply to this rule.
I. Executive Order 12630 In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled "Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights", the proposed rule will not effect a taking of pr ivate property or otherwise have taking implications.
A takings implication assessment is not required.
The proposed rule establishes processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
J. Civil Justice Reform In accordance with Executive Order 12988, we have determined that the proposed rule does not unduly burden the judicial system and meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order.
The proposed rule establishes processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and defines the relationships between the governmental entities that will implement the Plan.
K. Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (EO 13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use.
Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions.
Because this proposed rule is not expected to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.
L. Environmental Documentation We have determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
Therefore, environmental 19 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for this proposed rule.
The Corps of Engineers has prepared appropriate environmental documentatio n, including a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
Moreover, this proposed regulation establishes requirements for the preparation of appropriate environmental documentation as part of the impleme ntation process.
We have identified actions in this regulation which generally require preparation of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact Statement or an environmental assessment), or which are categorically excluded from NEPA.
Our intent is to reduce controversy over whether NEPA is required for individual actions by taking a systematic look at the kinds of actions needed to implement the Plan, and to apply the principles of Ã¯Â¿Â½230 of this chapter to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan activities.
Certain individual actions, such as development, adoption or revision of methods or protocols, are listed as categorically excluded.
We have determined that development, adoption, or revision of a method or protocol itself would not require NEPA, and that use of the method or protocol could be analyzed under NEPA, if appropriate, in a decision document such as a Project Implementation Report.

(a) Development of Pre- CERP Baseline.
The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, shall develop the pre- CERP baseline to determine the quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by the existing Central and Southern Florida Project on the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680). (b) Pre- CERP Baseline Water Availability.
To the extent practical, each Project Implementation Report shall consider whether the pre- CERP baseline quantity of water available for the natural system is still available for the natural system.
If not, the Project Implementation Report shall consider the loss of pre- CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component.
The Project Implementation Report may also consider other remedial actions, including, but not limited to: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as described in Ã¯Â¿Â½385.28; or whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re- examine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system.
(c) Identification of Water to be Reserved or Allocated for the Natural System in the Project Implementation Report.
(1) Each Project Implementation Report shall ident ify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system and shall identify the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
(2) The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Wate r Management District shall develop and adopt a protocol in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½385.8 for preparing Project Implementation Reports that identifies the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system and ide ntifies the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
(i) Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of these programmatic regulations or the adoption of the protocol may use whatever method that, in the District Engineer's discretion, and in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District and the State of Florida, is deemed appropriate.
(ii) The protocol shall take into account the natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year; the objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to new sources; the need to maintain existing levels of flood protection; contingencies for drought protection; and the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by a new 50 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 DECEMBER 2001 project component while maintaining a system- wide perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan. (iii) The protocol may express the quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any other method which, in the District Engineer's discretion, and in cooperation with the South Florida Water Management District and the State of Florida, is deemed appropriate.
(iv) The protocol shall provide for re- examination of actual performance after a project component has been in operation for an appropriate period of time.
(d) Variations from Predicted Availability of Water.
If, after re- examination of the actual performance of a project component, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District judge that the actual long- term performance of a project component will not meet the quantity, timing, or distribution of water anticipated to be made available by the Project Implementation Report, then: (1) the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall determine if revisions to the Plan are necessary.
If so, then the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall prepare a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½385.28; and (2) in the interim during preparation of this Project Implementation Report, operation of the project shall be consistent with the p urposes of the project component as authorized by Congress.
In the absence of specific purposes for a project component in the Congressional authorization, then the operation of a project component generally shall be based on providing water in accordance with the following priorities: (i) uses transferred from an existing legal source of water to the new source made available by that project, (ii) new water for restoration of the natural system, and (iii) new water for other uses of water.
Ã¯Â¿Â½385.31 Compliance with Savings Clause Provisions.
(a) Elimination or Transfer of Existing Legal Sources of Water.
Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred as a result of project implementation.
If implementation of the project shall cause a transfer of existing legal sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer shall not occur until after the project is constructed and operating as intended.
(b) Existing Level of Service for Flood Protection.
(1) The level of service for flood protection that is in existence on the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) and in accordance with applicable law shall be determined.
To the extent practical, the pre- CERP baseline shall be used in determining the existing level of service for flood protection.
(2) The plan recommended in the Project Implementation Report shall be evaluated to determine if the level of service for flood protection that is in existence on 51 INITIAL DRAFT REGULATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 DECEMBER 2001 the date of enactment of section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680) and in accordance with applicable law will b e reduced by implementation of the recommended plan.
If so, then the recommended plan shall be modified as necessary to ensure that adverse effects on the existing level of service are mitigated or eliminated.
(3) In developing alternative plans for eva luation during the preparation of the Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the non- Federal sponsor may consider opportunities to provide greater levels of service or to provide flood protection in locations where there is currently no flood protection, provided that greater levels of service or the provision of flood protection is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat.2686).
