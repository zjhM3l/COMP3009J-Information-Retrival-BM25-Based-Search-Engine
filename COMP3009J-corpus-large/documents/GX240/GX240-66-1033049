LESSONS LEARNED FROM ENRON'S COLLAPSE: AUDITING THE ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2002
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:53 p.m., in room 345 Cannon House Office Building, Hon. W.J.
``Billy' Tauzin (chairman) presiding.
Members present: Representatives Tauzin, Bilirakis, Barton, Stearns, Gillmor, Greenwood, Cox, Deal, Largent, Burr, Whitfield, Ganske, Norwood, Shimkus, Shadegg, Pickering, Blunt, Davis, Bryant, Ehrlich, Buyer, Radanovich, Bass, Pitts, Walden, Terry, Dingell, Waxman, Markey, Hall, Boucher, Towns, Pallone, Brown, Gordon, Deutsch, Rush, Eshoo, Stupak, Engel, Sawyer, Wynn, Green, McCarthy, DeGette, Barrett, Capps, Doyle, John, and Harman.
Staff present: Jim Barnette, general counsel; David Cavicke, majority counsel, Shannon Vildostegui, majority counsel; Brian McCullough, majority counsel, Jon Tripp, assistant press secretary; Will Carty, legislative clerk, Jill Latham, staff assistant; David R. Schooler, minority general counsel and deputy staff director; Sue Sheridan, minority counsel; Consuela Washington, minority counsel; Candy Butler, minority professional staff; Nicole Kenner, minority legislative clerk; and Jessica McNiece, minority intern.
Chairman TAUZIN.
Let me announce the order of business.
We will begin opening statements on the full committee hearing this morning, but we will suspend and interrupt those opening statements as soon as staff informs me that we have a full quorum of the committee present to do business.
At that point, we will introduce a resolution before the full committee with the concurrence of the minority, which will authorize the Chair with again the concurrence of the minority to issue subpoenas in this case as we further need them in our investigation.
And then we will go back to opening statements and introduce our witnesses and finish the hearing.
The Chair will first recognize himself for an opening statement.
Today, we're taking the extraordinary step of holding a full Energy and Commerce Committee hearing to consider some of the most important policy issues that relate to Enron's collapse.
These issues include corporate governance, accounting and governance of the auditing profession and very importantly, the health of our energy interest and markets.
We take this step because of the profoundly troubling things we've discovered in the investigation of Enron.

2 Most significantly we have learned that first, senior Enron management engaged in self-dealing transactions, and second, Enron transacted with partnerships controlled by CFO, the Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, his associate, Michael Kopper and others, and that Enron appeared to shift the risk of loss on risky investments in these partnerships, but in fact, remained fully liable for their investments and those risks.
And third, Enron went ahead and reported fictitious gains on these transactions with the LJM and Raptor entities when the hedged investments declined in value, and that these gains were illusory.
The partnerships lacked the economic resources to make good on the transactions.
The effect of these sham transactions was to inflate Enron's publicly reported earnings in 1999, 2000 and 2001 significantly by more than $1 billion.
We have found substantial evidence of illegal activity by Enron and its management.
And this activity served to deceive the public about Enron's financial condition.
It artificially pumped up Enron's stock price and allowed these same executives to enrich themselves with the sales of Enron stock.
We have also found that Enron's auditor, Andersen, knew or should have known or should have discovered the fraudulent nature of the Fastow transactions and we have found that Enron's financial statements violated numerous existing accounting rules.
These statements misled investors about Enron's financial condition and over-estimated that net income by over $1 billion.
In the end it turns out that the Enron debacle is an old fashioned example of theft by insiders and a failure of those responsible for them to prevent that theft.
We believe this is a huge aberration of corporate behavior in America.
For example, in one transaction, Fastow and Kopper informed the investors in LJM2, a partnership at the center of this theft, that the expected rate of return on the transaction was 2,503 percent to be realized in just 8 days.
In each of the so-called Raptor transactions, Fastow extracted all of his equity, along with additional fees in the tens of millions of dollars before any transactions that involved any economic risk took place.
In this way, Enron was doing business with an entity with only one asset and that was Enron's shares that Enron had contributed.
This was not a hedging transaction.
Enron was merely issuing shares and calling the issuance earnings.
This clearly violated existing law and the most basic norms of corporate behavior.
Enron's Board of Directors, its Finance Committee and its Audit Committee failed to exercise due care with respect to these transactions and it simply boggles the mind that the Chief Financial Officer of a company was allowed to organize partnerships and simultaneously take the other side of deals with this company.
Such an arrangement should never have happened and does not ordinarily happen in any corporation that I know of in America.
Additionally, we have learned that the SEC conducted no meaningful review of Enron disclosures from 1997 through 2001, so before we rush to impose new laws and regulations in the wake of the scandal, we want to be sure that we're actually enforcing existing law and today, we're going to look at some of the broader implications of Enron and what it means for the controls and safeguards we have built into our capital raising system.

3 We'll hear from experts in corporate governance, in accounting, in the governance of auditors and we'll hear from an energy firm.
We'll look at the state of current law and the current practice to see if reforms are necessary.
Now I want to also make some other comments.
Next week, I've asked the Energy Subcommittee, chaired by Joe Barton to suspend action on his energy package, the electricity package, until we can thoroughly understand the effect of this Enron collapse under the energy markets.
And he will conduct a hearing next week on that issue.
I've also asked the chairman of our Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, Mr. Stearns to conduct a hearing into FASB's Rules, the accounting principles involved here and the accounting rules that may need improvement as we go forward and learn more from today's hearing and other hearings about this important area.
In short, this hearing today will feed into the hearing tomorrow by the Oversight and Investigations Subommittee in which we will have the principals whom we are investigating at Enron and who may have been responsible for some of this mess before us, and into the substantive committees on the Enron energy market's effect, as well as the effects on FASB and the need for changes in accounting principles or rules or governance in this country.
Today's hearing will give us a chance to look into those three areas and to get a clear understanding of what happened at Enron, what perhaps ought to be happening in the governance of accounting, and what perhaps ought to be happening in terms of board memberships and the quality and the capacity of board members to serve in America, and finally, the situation in the energy markets as a result of the collapse of Enron.
After the hearing or some time in the middle of the hearing, we will conduct the disposition of the resolution authorizing subpoenas, and then we will take up our witnesses.
Let me again, as I've done throughout this process, offer my sincere and deep appreciation to the ranking minority member of this committee, Mr. Dingell, for his extraordinary cooperation and for the fact that this investigation is being conducted in such a truly bipartisan fashion.
Our joint investigators are doing a superb job, not simply for this committee, but I think for our country, and again I want to thank the ranking member as I recognize him for his opening statement.
Mr. Dingell.

Today, we are taking the extraordinary step of holding a full Energy and Commerce Committee hearing to consider some of the most important policy issues raised by Enron's collapse.
These issues include corporate governance, accounting and governance of the auditing profession and the health of our energy markets.
We take this step, because of the profoundly troubling things we've discovered in our investigation of Enron.
Most significantly, we've learned that: 1.
Senior Enron Management engaged in self-dealing transactions.

4 loss on risky investments to the partnerships, but in fact it remained fully liable for those investments.
3.
Enron went ahead and reported fictitious gains on these transactions with the LJM and Raptor entities when the hedged investments declined in value.
These gains were illusory; the partnerships lacked the economic resources to make good on the transactions.
The effect of these sham transactions was to inflate Enron's publicly reported earnings in 1999, 2000 and 2001 significantly--by more than a billion dollars.
We have found substantial evidence of illegal activity by Enron and its management.
This activity served to deceive the public about Enron's financial condition.
It artificially pumped up Enron's stock price and allowed these same executives to enrich themselves with sales of Enron stock.
We have also found that Enron's auditor, Andersen, knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature of the Fastow transactions.
We have found that Enron's financial statements violated numerous existing accounting rules.
These statements mislead investors about Enron's financial condition and overestimated Enron's net income by over $1 billion.
In the end, it turns out that the Enron debacle is an old fashion example of theft by insiders, and a failure by those responsible for them to prevent that theft.
For example, in one transaction, Fastow and Kopper informed the investors in LJM2-- a partnership at the center of this theft--that the expected rate of return on the transaction was 2,503%, to be realized in just eight days.
In each of the so-called Raptor transactions, Fastow extracted all of his equity, along with additional fees in the tens of millions of dollars, before any transactions that involved any economic risk took place.
In this way, Enron was doing business with an entity whose only asset was Enron shares that Enron had contributed.
This was not a hedging transaction; Enron was merely issuing shares and calling the issuance earnings.
This clearly violated existing law and the most basic norms of corporate behavior.
Enron's board of directors, its Finance Committee and Audit Committee failed to exercise due care with respect to these transactions.
It simply boggles the mind that the chief financial officer of a company was allowed to organize partnerships and simultaneously take the other side of deals with his company.
Such an arrangement should never have happened.
Additionally, we have learned that the SEC conducted no meaningful review of Enron disclosures from 1997-2001.
So before we rush to impose new laws and regulations in the wake of this scandal, we will want to be sure that we are actually enforcing existing law.
Today, we are going look at some of the broader implications of Enron and what it means for the controls and safeguards we have built into our capital-raising system.
We will hear from experts in corporate governance, accounting, governance of auditors and an energy firm.
We will look at the state of current law and current practice and to see if reforms are necessary.
In the area of corporate governance, we will examine the proper role of a board, and the role of outside directors.
We will consider what incentives are necessary to get the outside directors to invest the time and effort necessary to oversee a company in times of difficulty.
We will compare that effort to the woeful performance of the Enron board.
In the area of accounting, we will examine existing rules governing disclosure of these now notorious Special Purpose Vehicles, the so-called 3% test, and mark-tomarket accounting.
We will consider whether FASB, which has been considering changes to the rules governing accounting for off-balance sheet transactions for the better part of a decade, should be encouraged to expedite those changes.
We will also consider the changes that need to be made in the area governance of the accounting profession.
We need to restore public confidence in the important work performed by the accountants.
We also need to be certain that adequate regulation of accounting firms is in place to encourage them to put investor's interest ahead of getting a particular deal done.
In the vital area of energy policy, we will consider what effect, it any, Enron's collapse had on the market for electricity and natural gas and its effect on consumers.
We will also consider the implications for reliability on an ongoing basis and whether prudent regulatory changes are called for.
After this hearing of the full Committee, our bipartisan investigation will continue under Subcommittee Chairman Greenwood.
Importantly, both Subcommittee Chairmen Barton and Stearns will begin a more detailed review of the policy implications in these areas and work to ensure that there are no future financial calamities of this type.

5 I welcome our witnesses, and look forward to their knowledgeable testimony.
Mr. DINGELL.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you.
I commend you for this hearing and I join you in the comment you have just made about the bipartisan character of this inquiry.
I commend you for that and I say that we on this side look forward to continuing the fine relationship which we have had in connection with this investigation.
It has been a bipartisan investigation and it is something which has been most welcome to me and to us over here.
Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for scheduling this full committee Hearing on the lessons of Enron.
A week ago today, the Kids Post Page of the Washington Post summed it up nicely under the banner headline, ``Greedy Liars, the Enron Scandal'', perhaps showing that while figures don't lie, liars can figure.
There was a picture of Enron's CEO, Kay Lay, with the caption, ``Did this Man Get Rich... '' and a picture of a former Enron employee and his wife with the caption, ``. . . while These People Got Poor?'' Then there was a little box at the bottom on the accountants with a caption, ``The Watchdog Doesn't Bark.''
In a nutshell, these comments accurately sum up what happened here.
And I join you, Mr. Chairman, in beginning to discuss it.
Last month, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt made a profound declaration: ``There's nothing rotten in the accounting profession.''
This is just plain hooey.
There are many honest accountants, and there are many fine and honest accounting firms.
I happen to retain one accountant and accounting firm to deal with my affairs and I find them to be completely honest and worthy of respect and admiration.
There are, however, systematic problems with the way the profession is governed and compensated, coupled with corrosive pressures put on honest auditors to bring in nonaudit business at almost any price and to satisfy their clients and employers, by coming up with acceptable answers.
It is almost impossible for many honest people to stand up and blow the whistle on management.
I held hearings on these matters in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The accountants said that I was wrong, but now history says they were wrong.
The accountants promised that they would reform themselves.
They did not.
So, Mr. Chairman, we must now do it for them.
And in so doing we must recognize that this action constitutes protection of our entire economic system which functions on facts, truth and, most importantly, on the trust of the people.
Today we start the process of looking broadly at regulatory issues.
As I said, Mr. Chairman, I welcome this event and I commend you for it and I welcome this morning's distinguished panel witnesses and I look forward to their testimony and guidance.
I note that amongst others we have before us today a witness suggested by the minority, Mr. James Chanos, who recently appeared on the cover of Barron's as ``The Guy Who Called Enron.''
I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of that article in the hearing record.
Chairman TAUZIN.
Without objection, so ordered.

6 Mr. DINGELL.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Along with a copy of Bethany McLean's March 5, 2001, Fortune article entitled, ``Is Enron Overpriced?'' Chairman TAUZIN.
Without objection, so ordered.
Mr. DINGELL.
Apparently, there were red flags waving all over Enron's financial statement, if you wanted to see them.
Was everybody else blind? Why did the accountants not see them and if so, why? We also have at the minority's request, Mr. Bevis Longstreth, who had a distinguished career as an SEC Commissioner during the Reagan Administration.
He recently served 2 years on the O'Malley Panel on Audit Effectiveness which reported a number of critical findings and recommendations in August 2000 for improving the performance of the profession and its governance system.
All the witnesses are here today because Enron is not unique.
It is huge.
Indeed, the biggest bankruptcy in history, but it is not unique.
Similar events may well be out there at this time, waiting to happen after similar or identical causes and reasons.
The SEC has been reporting in increasingly record numbers of financial fraud in cases involving bad accounting.
Enron is only an exclamation point in a long list of accounting frauds that include Waste Management, Sunbeam--and I note that those were both matters which were under the trust of, guess who, Arthur Andersen--Cendant, Rite Aid, Microstrategy, just to name a few.
I supported Arthur Levitt's efforts to rein in the abuse and I supported FASB's efforts to write tough accounting standards.
Others saw fit to bully the SEC and FASB on behalf of special interests who were opposed to what the regulators were trying to do.
I hope today, Mr. Chairman, that we will all stand shoulder-toshoulder in our resolve to do the right thing by the American people and to fix a badly broken system.
Mr. Chairman, this system smells bad enough for either repair or early burial and I suggest that the continued health and wellbeing of our financial system depends upon it.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this recognition and we on this side will support the motion on subpoena authority at the proper time.

18 Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend for his statement.
We obviously have a different view of some of that history, but we do stand shoulder to shoulder, Mr. Dingell.
The Chair will now interrupt the opening statements for the business meeting of the committee which is the resolution on subpoena power.
[Business meeting.]
Chairman TAUZIN.
The Chair will now ask if there are any other members who seek recognition first on this side? The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I won't take anywhere near that much time.
I have no prepared statement.
I would just merely like to thank you and particularly the witnesses for their willingness to come here today to give us this broad overview of the implosion, if you will, of Enron and what led up to it.
I know we're all concerned about the lack of confidence and the lack of credibility which has suddenly taken place in our minds, particularly regarding the accounting industry and the auditing industry.
Hopefully you gentlemen here today may help us to back away from that lack of confidence and credibility so that some of the things that we see happening today not only to employees, but also in the stock market, will change course.
I appreciate being here, Mr. Chairman, and again, thank you very much.
Chairman TAUZIN.
The gentleman yields back his time.
Under our rules, our members will be recognized for 3 minutes under our rules.
The Chair asks if there are any members on this side seeking recognition.
The gentleman from California, the gentleman, Mr. Boucher, is recognized for 3 minutes.
Mr. BOUCHER.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I want to commend you and Ranking Member Dingell for the very thoughtful way in which you have handled our committee's investigation into the Enron collapse.
It is a seismic event.
It resulted from a total system failure.
The safeguards upon which we have traditionally relied were inadequate to prevent this collapse and to warn that it was coming.
Enron's accountants did not detect and require reporting of more than $1 billion of inflated earnings over a 15month period as recently revealed in the report prepared by the Dean of the University of Texas Law School.
Banks extended credit without determining the corporation's true, financial condition.
Stock analysts who should have achieved a deeper understanding of the company's off the balance sheet liabilities continued to recommend the stock.
Chairman TAUZIN.
Excuse me, Mr. Boucher.
The Chair will ask for the cooperation of all the members and guests present.
This room is cavernous and even small whispers and talk is exaggerated here.
Let's give the speakers the courtesy of listening to them, please.
Mr. Boucher is recognized to complete his statement.
Mr. BOUCHER.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Stock analysts who should have achieved a deeper understanding of the company's off the balance sheet liabilities continued to recommend the stock as recently as a few months ago.
The ERISA law did not prevent Enron employees from losing their retirement funds and even al-

19 lowed a freeze on their ability to sell Enron shares in their 401(k) accounts while the shares lost value throughout the fall and became almost worthless.
The corporation's directors failed in their duties as representatives of the stockholders.
They apparently took no actions.
They were either unaware of the corporation's precarious financial condition or complicit in permitting that condition to continue.
Either way, they failed in their duties.
And some company executives who had front line responsibility for the financial success of the company were making huge profits from the businesses they were doing themselves with the company, as the selfserving arrangements they created sent Enron on a path to corporate collapse.
This committee's careful investigative work has contributed greatly to the public understanding of what went wrong and I again commend Chairman Tauzin for his stewardship of that work.
Many of the events contributing to the failures at Enron are within the purview of this committee's legislative jurisdiction.
Today, we will hear from knowledgeable witnesses who will speak to many of these matters from corporate governance to the use of derivative financial instruments to accounting practices.
As we assess the steps that need to be taken to assure that other companies do not suffer the same fate as Enron.
I look forward to the examination of those issues and to the recommendations of these witnesses and others from whom our full committee and various cubcommittees will hear concerning appropriate steps for this committee to take.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman.
Further requests for opening statements on this side? The gentleman, Mr. Brown from Ohio is recognized with 3 minutes for an opening statement.
Mr. BROWN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing and for your dogged investigation of this scandal.
We all know that Enron was the seventh largest corporation in America.
We all know that it was the largest energy trading company in the world.
We all know that the company was a Wall Street powerhouse and the darling of the Bush Administration.
Now we know that Enron is a company predicated on little more than greed and deceit.
It was no more than a pyramid scheme, a company that vastly overstated profits and concealed liabilities while using political and financial clout to free themselves from accountability, to rig the energy markets in their favor, then use their position to ravage consumers, investors and employees.
Some have called this crony capitalism, others Enron conservatism.
Its fall has had a devastating impact on its employees and its retirees, as we know.
The Public Pension Fund in my home State of Ohio lost $62 million in Enron investments.
Florida's Public Pension Fund managed by that State's very own Bush Administration lost $300 million.
One of the Nation's most esteemed accounting firms, Arthur Andersen, has also been implicated in this scandal.
We'd be remiss to avoid discussion of Enron's relationship with the Bush White House and how that may have influenced the Federal response to the company's decline.
Before his company's spectacular flameout, Ken Lay, the former Chair and CEO of Enron, was a close friend of President Bush's, such a close friend that he

20 was referred to as Kenny Boy.
Kenny Boy had unfettered access to the White House and enormous influence within the administraÂ´ tion.
He contacted Curt Hebert, the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and told him that if he wanted to keep his job, he would do well to bring his thinking into line with Â´ Enron's.
Mr. Hebert declined.
He's no longer FERC's Chairman.
When Vice President Cheney wrote the administration's energy plan, he met with Enron officials six separate times.
He's declined to release information about that.
While none of us is eager to see a return to the witch hunt mentality that surrounded the White Water investigation, we should carefully examine the closeness of the relationship between the White House and Enron and the impact it's had on that company's demise.
The President's friends at Fox News and elsewhere have assured the American people that because the President did not rush to save Enron from failure, that the President did nothing wrong.
But it isn't the administration's lack of action during Enron's death throes that concern me most.
What concerns me is what this administration and its allies on Capitol Hill did before Enron's collapse to create a permissive culture, a permissive culture for large corporations in America and to encourage rapacious behavior at companies like Enron.
The Bush White House last year called off a Clinton Administration initiative to stop money laundering through offshore banks.
The manipulation of our tax laws through offshore bank accounts and partnerships reduced Enron's 5-year tax liability to substantially less than zero.
In four of the last 5 years Enron paid no taxes at all.
Ironically, on the very same day that we are here investigating the spectacular collapse of Enron, we're being asked to confirm on the House floor right this minute the appropriateness of last year's Bush tax cut plan.
Enron and Ken Lay were one of the plan's greatest proponents.
Instead of wasting time affirming a plan that gives billions in tax breaks to corporate giants like Enron, $256 million in the tax plan, a plan that has, in essence, spent the Nation's surplus, we should instead, Mr. Chairman, be worrying--we should worry about preventing the collapse of the next Enron.
I'm hoping that his hearing will be a first step toward that goal.
I thank the chairman.

HON. SHERROD BROWN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

CONGRESS
Good afternoon.
Chairman Tauzin, thank you for calling this hearing into Enron's collapse, and for your dogged investigation of this scandal.
Less than a year ago, Enron was the seventh largest corporation in America and the largest energy trading company in the world.
The company was a Wall Street powerhouse and a darling of the Bush Administration.
Then a couple of months ago, Enron abruptly declared bankruptcy and was exposed as a company predicated on little more than greed and deceit.
Enron was no more than a pyramid scheme--a company that vastly overstated profits and concealed liabilities--while using political and financial clout to free themselves from accountability, rig the energy markets in their favor, and then use their position to ravage consumers investors, and employees.
This style has been called ``Enron conservatism''

21 Enron's fall has had a devastating impact on its employees and retirees, on its shareholders and customers, and on the confidence many Americans have in private equity markets and their government.
Average workers and investors were cheated out of their life savings--while a small group of executives and insiders made off with over a billion dollars from welltimed stock sales.
The public pension fund in my home state of Ohio lost $62 million on Enron investments--and Florida's public pension fund--managed by that state's very own Bush Administration, lost $306 million.
One of the nation's most esteemed accounting firms, Arthur Andersen, has also been implicated in this scandal--accused of helping to conceal its client's deceit.
Despite internal misgivings about Enron's methods of financial reporting, Andersen continued to certify the company's required financial disclosures as ``full and accurate.''
At a time when over 60 percent of Americans own stock, concerns about the lack of transparency in financial disclosures--and a lack of independence among auditors--has damaged the confidence of the investing public.
The Powers Report, released earlier this week, makes clear that the series of complex transactions that brought Enron down were not well-intentioned deals that went bad.
They were deliberate gimmicks created to conceal losses and to deceive investors.
This committee has a responsibility to the American people to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the malfeasance of Enron's executives, its auditors, and its board of directors.
And to better protect the thousands of employees and investors who have suffered from Enron's untimely and unnatural demise, this committee must also ask if the relevant federal agencies did everything they could have to protect the public.
I am confident that we will discharge these responsibilities.
We would be remiss, however, to avoid discussion of how Enron's relationship with the Bush White House may have influenced the federal response to the company's decline.
Before his company's spectacular flame-out, Ken Lay, the former Chairman and CEO of Enron was such a close friend of President Bush's that the President referred to him as ``Kenny-boy.''
Kenny-boy had unfettered access to the White House and enormous influence within the Administration, and he wielded this influence freely.
At one point last year, Mr. Lay contacted Curt Hebert, the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--the agency that regulated much of Enron's business--and told him that if he wanted to keep his job he would do well to bring his thinking into line with Enron's.
Mr. Hebert declined to do so, and is no longer FERC's chairman.
When Vice-President Cheney ``wrote'' the Administration's energy policy, he met with Enron officials six times.
Not surprisingly, the plan favored the same energy goals that Enron did.
Since May, the Vice President has refused to turnover the records of his meetings with Enron on the grounds that Congress and the GAO have no right to this information.
Vice President Cheney has also said that any similarities between Enron's recommendations and the Administration's Energy Plan are just a matter of (rightmindedness) like-mindedness.
In December, columnist Molly Ivins wrote that if Bill Clinton were still in the White House--and he were as close to Ken Lay as this President is--``we'd have four congressional investigations, three special prosecutors, two impeachment inquiries and a partridge in a pear tree by now.''
While none of us is eager to see a return to the witch hunt mentality that surrounded the Whitewater investigation, we should carefully examine the closeness of the relationship between this White House and Enron, and the impact it had on that company's demise.
The President's friends at Fox News and elsewhere have assured the American people that because the President did not rush to save Enron from failure that he couldn't have done anything wrong.
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans have said they were aware of Enron's difficulties before the company went bankrupt--and have celebrated their decisions to do nothing on the company's behalf.
Secretary O'Neill even went so far as to say this incident was emblematic of ``the genius of capitalism.''
Tell that to Enron's former employees.

The Chair does not see any member present and the Chair will announce that the committee will suspend until Mr. Greenwood is in the Chair.

So I will patiently wait and see that Mr. Greenwood arrives and then I will make the vote.
Mr. GREENWOOD [presiding].
The Chair recognizes himself for 90 minutes for the purpose of an opening statement.
The captains of American industry in the early 20th century were not without serious flaws and yet they also left us a remarkable legacy of new ideas, new technologies and in many cases enduring enterprises.
Simply taking a roll call of some of the more illustrious and in some cases notorious of these industrialists bears witness to this truth.
Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, John and Horace Dodge, George Westinghouse, Henry Firestone, Thomas Edison, George Eastman and Henry Heinz.
What they built, they built to last.
But in many ways, they were also rapacious and grasping men whose monopolistic tendencies trampled on the legitimate rights of smaller businesses, threatening free enterprise and the birth of new technologies.
The first Republican President of the 20th century, Theodore Roosevelt, rightly called them malefactors of great wealth.
But for all their faults, it was the wealth they themselves had created.
It is not clear that even this much can be said of the authors of the Enron debacle.
If they were malefactors of wealth, it appears it was largely the wealth of many unsuspecting others and in this reckless enterprise they were enabled and empowered, if not openly encouraged, by the accountants who were supposed to serve as watchdogs, sadly, at the time investors failed to notice these watchdogs' peculiar behavior.
They did not bark.

Others look upon it as a cow that they can milk.

This was perhaps their greatest betrayal.
For the triumph of free markets and the wealth they create, depend on the confidence of the investor, more and more of whom are average Americans.

By 1999, that number was nearly 50 percent.
And here we get to the heart of the matter, for all their vaunted talk of aggressive accounting, an oxymoron that would be amusing if it had not led to such terrible consequences.
Their failure is about so much more than money lost or money gained.
These were men who in the single minded pursuit of personal wealth apparently jettisoned any shred of personal morals or business ethics and replaced them with the morals of a dealer in a game of Three Card Monte.
The antidote to this behavior is not difficult to find.
In 1913 in a thoughtful essay on the lessons of history and free enterprise, former President Theodore Roosevelt wrote this, ``First and foremost, we must stand firmly on a basis of good, sound ethics.
We intend to do what is right for the ample and sufficient reason that it is right.''
He then continued with these prophetic words.
``If business is hurt by the stern exposure of crookedness and the result of efforts to punish the crooked man, then business must be hurt, even though good men are involved in the hurting.''
In this matter, too, the reputations of many who sought to do their best will be swallowed up in the bad dealings of the few.
Sadly, this too is part of the unfolding Enron tragedy.

Ms. ESHOO.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate the thoughtful comments that you have made since this issue has imploded and I have confidence that what you will do as Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee is going to cast more light and help the Congress come to grips with what needs to be done relative to Enron, the abuses that are now known, and the areas where we need to make reforms.
As a member of California's Congressional Delegation, I have a very special interest in this issue of Enron and what went wrong, as do my constituents and as do all Californians.
As early as November of 2000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, declared that consumers in California had been and were paying ``unjust and unreasonable rates'' yet nothing substantive was done about it.
Some estimate that the gouging amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps a billion.
The California's ISO says it was in the ballpark of $9 billion.
When the 107th Congress convened in January of 2001, a year ago, I introduced bipartisan legislation that allowed the Secretary of Energy to control price gouging.
In the following months, I called for hearings.
I called on the Attorney General to investigate.
I introduced legislation that would have imposed cost of service based pricing.
I introduced bipartisan legislation to provide refunds to consumers.
Enron and the rest of the industry in opposition said

25 that these calls should go unheeded.
And the process then became politicized.
So in this hearing and in other hearings, we're not only going to examine what went wrong inside, what did Enron do wrong inside and anyone, the professions included, that were associated with them, but also I think a worthy area of exploration is what they did wrong to others.
I believe that if the Congress had heeded the call of many of us on this very committee, on this issue, that we could have cast light on some of the wrongdoing of Enron at the time.
Californians paid.
Other people's pockets were lined.
Californians paid as did shareholders and Enron's employees.
So this is tragic not only in the fall of supposedly the seventh largest corporation in the country, but what they imposed in terms of policy, in terms of their lobbying, in terms of public policy and what was left unheeded, including the calls that some of us made right here in this Energy and Commerce Committee.
So I look forward to being part of the solution.
We know we have to have campaign finance reform.
We know that we need to have reforms relative to the accounting industry.
We know that we have to have reforms relative to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but I also think that it is worthwhile, very worthwhile in terms of my constituents and Californians to place on the record today that some of us were on to this a long time ago.
It went unheeded.
It's high time that the Congress come to grips with it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I yield back any balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Hon. Anna Eshoo follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. ANNA G. ESHOO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
CONGRESS
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As a member of California's Congressional delegation, I have a special interest in these hearings.
Enron and other energy marketers, generators and gas suppliers gouged the people of California and my district for more than a year.
According to Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner, consumers in California were gouged by ``hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion in aggregate sum'' (Report and Recommendation of Chief Judge and Certification of Record, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, July 12, 2001).
I think this is a rather conservative estimate.
According to the California Independent System Operator, the sum was closer to $9 billion.
One day my constituents may recover a portion of these overcharges, but I have my doubts and Enron's collapse certainly does not help this effort.
The fact is that Enron and its business go to the heart of the gouging and its collapse.
What was Enron's business? While all Americans know that Ford and GM make cars, I doubt many people could explain what Enron, seventh on the Fortune 500, actually did.
Enron was an energy company that really didn't produce or distribute energy.
Instead, it acted as a middleman, making deals between producers and users.
These were paper transactions that added no value to the product it sold.
It was corporate alchemy; it was like producing gold from straw.
Maybe this explains why other participants in the electricity market didn't suffer after Enron collapsed and why the industry doesn't seem to miss the company today.
Perhaps Enron's mysterious business explains why some call Enron's glass-walled headquarters in Houston ``the Black Box''--a more apt name might be Oz. By stretching and breaking complex accounting rules, Enron wove a mystical shroud.
The mystery of what lay behind that curtain made Enron even more appealing to investors, as did its majestic profits.
Many Congressional committees, including this one, have focused on Enron's corporate structure and governance and acts of malfeasance that allowed Enron to con-

26 vert debt for profit whenever it wished.
However, it seems that nobody is asking questions about the transactions between Enron and its clients.
It seems to me that the same creative minds that created Chewco, one of Enron's corporate shells, might also have one or two tricks to raise artificially the price of electricity in the West.
I hope this Committee and other investigators will be looking at these activities and transactions.
Last March I called upon Attorney General Ashcroft to look into the pricing practices of Enron and other energy companies operating in the West.
At that time, massive amounts of electricity were being withheld from the market, and wholesale energy costs rose by as much as 1,000%.
Yet to my knowledge, the Department of Justice did not investigate.
As the DOJ and Committees conduct a postmortem of Enron, the company's day-to-day business operations must be examined.
I've called on just written to Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson (who has taken over the oversight of the Enron investigation following Attorney General Ashcroft's recusal) to explore fully this line of inquiry.
But accounting is only part of the Enron story.
While Enron exploited the complexity of accounting rules to manufacture profits, it also tried to exploit its political connections to create a business environment--an environment without rules--in which it could thrive.
To do this, Enron greased the wheels with millions in campaign contributions to both parties.
That bought access and arguably more.
In interviews for the television program Frontline last year, former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay acknowledged that he provided the Administration with a list of Enron-favored nominees for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
He also acknowledged that he and Enron executives interviewed potential nominees to judge their suitability.
This was Ken Lay's casting couch, and a candidate's suitability was judged by how likely he or she was to agree with Enron's view of how the energy market should operate.
Several news reports indicate that Mr. Lay's top choices for FERC were accepted by the Administration.
These reports are extremely disturbing.
Citing potential bias, this Administration broke with a half-century tradition begun by President Eisenhower when it decided to refuse independent advice from the American Bar Association about the professional qualifications of potential nominees to the federal bench.
But, the Administration seemed more than willing to accept the same kind of advice from Enron in the selection of the regulators who are charged with overseeing the company.
Mr. Lay was not only lobbying the White House.
He attempted to influence FERC Â´ directly.
Mr. Lay himself called then-FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert to discuss Â´ issues of policy and to talk about whether the President would retain Mr. Hebert as the Chairman of the Commission.
Â´ Mr. Hbert described these conversations as unusual, noting that he never had Â´ similar conversations with other industry chief executives.
In the end, Mr. Hbert resigned from FERC after Vice President Cheney told reporters that Patrick Wood would replace him as Chairman.
Â´ In an interview for Frontline in 2001, Mr. Hebert was told, ``Our sources tell us that he [Mr. Lay] offered to talk to the President on your behalf if you would go along with what he wanted [open access to wholesale and retail markets]
Mr. Â´ Hebert responded, ``I don't think there's any doubt he would be a much stronger supporter of mine if I--were willing to do what he wanted.''
Perhaps this heavy lobbying didn't amount to anything, but I think we're beyond accepting ``trust me'' as an answer when it comes to matters involving Enron.
The Administration must be more forthcoming about its dealings with Mr. Lay and his company.
Mr. Chairman, the collapse of Enron is a tragedy for the company's employees and an embarrassment for the energy and accounting industries.
It's obvious that Congress must legislate a number of reforms.
Chief among these are campaign finance reform, pension reform, and accounting reform.
What we should not do is enact legislation that fundamentally restructures the electricity market until we have all the answers about Enron.
California made a huge mistake in hastily adopting a restructuring bill in 1996.
We should not make a similar mistake in Congress.
Mr. Chairman, thank you, for holding this Committee hearing on Enron.
I hope that along with today's examinations that you call a Committee hearing on the role of Enron in electricity pricing and practices.
Mr. GREENWOOD.
The Chair thanks the gentlelady and recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns for 3 minutes for an opening statement.

27 Mr. STEARNS.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me just say that--commend you and the staff for all the hard work you're doing on the Oversight Committee on which I serve.
I ask by unanimous consent that my complete opening statement be part of the record.
Mr. GREENWOOD.
Without objection, the gentleman's statement will be entered into the record.
Mr. STEARNS.
And also, Mr. Chairman, as chairman of my Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, I wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board shortly after this fiasco, this debacle and I asked in that letter that they answer some questions and they wrote back to me on December 18, 2001 and I ask unanimous consent that the reply by the Financial Accounting Standards Board President be made part of the record.
Mr. GREENWOOD.
Without objection, that document will be entered into the record.
Mr. STEARNS.
Mr. Chairman, what we have seen so far is that Enron's collapse was a result of a complete failure and meltdown of fundamental responsibilities and oversight and thereby allowing what appears to be unscrupulous Enron executives, the opportunity to reap fortunes on questionable transactions, ultimately draining the retirement security of thousands of employees and investors.
Professor Dharan of Rice University appearing before us today, directly states that ``Enron's collapse may be the biggest case of security fraud.''
I believe he may be the first witness before the committee to unequivocally state what many have been surmising over the past few months, especially with more Enron executives invoking the fifth amendment.
So perhaps we're just scratching the surface here, the complexity is very astounding.
We've heard the term aggressive accounting.
Accounting isn't just math.
It also means making judgment calls about what the rules allow.
Aggressive accounting isn't illegal, but it should be when it tells investors that red is black and so we hear the term aggressive accounting or cutting edge accounting to justify Enron's pursuit of these partnerships and Arthur Andersen has also used those terms.
But I think we need to get beyond the rhetoric here and get to what standards are adequate.
Is the private sector handling enforcement of these standards properly? Are these standards in line with economic innovation or is the accounting industry lagging behind with new rules? In regards to Enron's practices, Paul Brown, Chairman of the Accounting Department of New York University, has been quoted as saying, ``It's the old adage of a FASB rule, it takes 4 years to write it, and it takes 4 minutes for an astute investment banker to get around it.''
And that is not right.
So Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the hearing and again, I compliment the staff for their developing this hearing and others.
I yield back.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman.
Is there anyone from this side? The gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman is recognized for 3 minutes.
Mr. WAXMAN.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and for your efforts to get to the bottom of the Enron scandal.

28 American families of their financial security and we are holding these hearings to find out who did it and how they did it.
But I don't think we can just look at Enron and Arthur Andersen and stop there.
We also have to look at ourselves.
When I've said that before, others have accused me of playing a partisan blame game that would divert attention from other issues.
I couldn't disagree more.
To prevent future Enrons we have to understand how Ken Lay and other executives operated in the political system.
We need to know how they acquired political influence and how they asserted the power they accumulated.
We must, of course, scrutinize Enron and Arthur Andersen.
We have to scrutinize the regulators and we should scrutinize how Enron and Arthur Andersen exploited the political system.
And even though I believe we must look at both parties, some of my Republican colleagues have told me that I'm being partisan.
Now that we have a Republican President and a Republican House, I'm told that it's wrong to raise these issues and in doing so will only feed public cynicism.
I don't buy that.
We can't sit here sanctimoniously and browbeat Enron and Arthur Andersen executives and question every decision they made if we're not willing to give the same scrutiny to ourselves, to the Clinton Administration and to the Bush Administration.
And if we don't examine how the political system broken down, the public will see through us and that, in truth, will only deepen cynicism.
Washington created the regulatory environment that allowed Enron executives to steal from thousands of families and Arthur Andersen auditors looked the other way and we in the Congress need to examine how that happened.
The Enron scandal is a searing indictment of a business culture that values stock prices over honesty and integrity and it elevates fictional performance over actual productivity.
The Enron scandal is also an indictment of an accounting profession that has lost its way in values, profits and new business opportunities over honoring the public trust, and the Enron scandal is an indictment of a political system that allowed this calamity to happen.
Arthur Levitt's sensible accounting reform proposals didn't die an accidental death.
They were a victim of the political system and it was that same system that allowed derivatives to go unregulated.
Last year, Enron was the most politically powerful company in Washington.
Even as its foundation was rotting away, it was able to influence energy policy in a number of areas.
It's leader, Ken Lay was able to screen potential FERC Commissioners and lead a successful House effort to retroactively repeal the corporate minimum tax which would have brought Enron $254 million.
We owe it to all the victims and their children to hold Enron accountable.
We owe it to them to hold Arthur Andersen responsible, and we owe it to them to hold ourselves accountable as well.
Chairman TAUZIN.

Well, Mr. Chairman, today Mr. Ken Lay is looking like Darth Vader and Enron like the Death Star to investors and all those company employees who have had their pensions evaporated.
The auditor should have been the real Jedi, policing evil doings.
Instead, it appears like they were the bounty hunter, Boba Fett, doing the bidding of the evil empire.
Mr. Chairman, let us use our light sabers to cut to the quick of this galactic scandal.
May we have the wisdom of Yoda to fix whatever accounting and pension laws needs strengthening in order to protect the innocent, punish the greedy and prevent clone wars in other companies like we've seen in Enron.

Mr. GREEN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate you calling not only this hearing today, but the efforts of the full committee and the subcommittee to explore the circumstances surrounding the collapse of Enron.
As the only member of the Commerce Committee from Houston, I'm angered by the continuing disclosures of financial wrongdoing by the company.
Enron was the largest company in Houston, employing over 20,000 Houstonians and helped make our city the energy capital of the world.
Enron's position in our community and around the world has been permanently and probably irreparably damaged by the shenanigans of a few.
Enron is now the buzz word for financial funny business.
Enron's Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow are all household names known for this financial funny business.
They used Enron like a giant Monopoly game to enrich both themselves and their friends at the expense of their shareholders and employees and they were not able to accomplish this historic meltdown alone.
They had the help from Arthur Andersen, the New York banking community, even their own legal counsel.
Together, these entities were either blinded by the green of Enron's billions or just simply incompetent and allowed Enron to fool everyone.
So what have we learned about this tragedy? We need stronger accounting standards, better corporate financial disclosure and more Federal oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Congress needs to take a hard look at forcing companies to file bankruptcy in the community or the State at least where their corporate headquarters reside.
Enron made a corporate decision to file bankruptcy in New York which is a great deal, a long way away from small creditors and former employees to be able to address the bankruptcy.
Enron was allowed to walk through loopholes in the law and conduct their illegal business practices.
They used business practices which should be rarely used and created hundreds of off-the-book partnerships which enriched a few at the expense of the many.
These holes need to be patched.
Apart from these changes, I do want to take a minute and highlight what I believe has been one of the positive actions resulting from the collapse, probably the only positive action.

30 ergy trading companies were able to weather the storm and I want my colleagues to understand that Enron is a unique case and not the model for the energy community.
Enron's entire trading business was efficiently absorbed by competitors without any interruption of service to their consumers.
In addition, the demise of Enron has created more competition in the sector which will benefit consumers with lower energy prices.
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you again for your hard work on the issue and I'm looking forward to continuing this process in the future.
The people of Houston, the stockholders and the current and former employees deserve a clear answer to what happened here and to see that those responsible are held accountable and that we pass legislation to prevent these type of scams in the future and thank you again.

CONGRESS
FROM
Mr. Chairman: I want to commend you for calling this important hearing today, and I again appreciate the opportunity to participate with the Subcommittee.
I believe today will be our first real chance to receive firsthand information about what truly went on at Enron.
Let me begin by saying that I am pleased Mr. Skilling has decided to come forward and give the American people some insight into the inner workings of Enron and Enron's off-book partnerships.
I am truly disappointed that the rest of Enron's ``Masters of the Universe'' crowd failed to come forward and instead chose to exercise behind the Fifth Amendment.
While no American can be forced to testify against his or her will, I believe failing to provide answers to the Subcommittee is an indication that the witnesses are trying to hide and obscure their roles in this debacle.
The Powers Report that this Subcommittee received over the weekend outlined a pattern of malfeasance that spread from the Board of Directors, through the upper management and finally to the auditors and outside legal counsel.
The Board of Directors, Arthur Andersen, and Vinson 
Along the way, each of these individuals began to see themselves as a new Rockefeller or J.P Morgan of the 21st century.
In reality, the upper management of Enron turned out to be only pretenders.
Their accomplishments were based on smoke and mirrors and their accomplishments did not rival those of our country's greatest industrialists.
However, their accomplishments do bare a striking similarity to a group of infamous financiers.
Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow are now in the same league as Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, and the true inventor of the complicated Rube Goldberg.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from this witness panel, and I again want to thank you for allowing me to participate here today.

[The prepared statement of Hon. John Shimkus follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF
HON.
JOHN SHIMKUS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
CONGRESS
Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing today.
I am looking forward to hearing from the witnesses on their take of what exactly has happened here and what can be done to prevent it from happening again in the future.
This hearing should focus on the accounting problems that occurred in the Enron collapse, because that is what falls under the jurisdiction of Committee.
Congress may need to address possible changes in accounting laws and any loopholes that need to be closed regarding allowing accountants to also perform auditing functions.
I am happy to hear that Chairman Tauzin has stated that the Committee will be holding future hearings on the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Aside from Enron, accounting concerns are being raised about other recent bankruptcies, including Kmart and Global Crossing, where insiders sold $1.3 billion in stock in the years prior to the bankruptcy.
So much in fact that accounting firms are looking at ways to change their business structure.
PricewaterhouseCooper and Deloitte 
The Illinois Department of Regulation has been investigating Arthur Andersen since before the Enron collapse over its business practices.
Andersen was the auditor for Waste Management in 1998, when the company admitted that it had overstated its earnings by more than $1.4 billion.
The Committee also needs to look into the role of the states.
Accountants are regulated in every state and many state regulators are believed to be looking at Andersen.
Connecticut, for example, has taken steps that officials there say could lead to Andersen being banned from doing business in that state.
These state investigations are in addition to federal probes being conducted by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
One question that was asked in a hearing yesterday needs to be answered.
Were Andersen's accountants and consultants involved in the complex deal by which Enron bought out its JEDI partnership by creating a new one called Chewco--one of the off-balance-sheet deals that greatly contributed to Enron's collapse? Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend.
Members on this side? The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Sawyer, I think has sought recognition.
Mr. SAWYER.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your work with our ranking member, Mr. Dingell, to bring this opportunity before us today.
The collapse of Enron is really almost inconceivable in its magnitude and its suddenness.
It's like a mighty edifice now fallen that seems to have disappeared like a column of smoke.
It is an extraordinary event.
The nature and scope of this company's collapse is both multi-faceted and complex, but in the end, I have the sense that this is really a case about disclosure.
Our Federal securities' laws are there to protect shareholders, investors, not officers, not directors, not the companies' bottom line and it's designed to work through a system, yes, grounded in trust, but based on transparency, transparency through disclosure of relevant financial information.
This framework is designed so that employees, shareholders and prospective investors could make sound and informed decisions about how they invest their money.
In this case, where they were dealing with energy derivatives rather than securities, we simply didn't have that disclosure.
For nearly a decade these complex, financial transactions escaped regulatory review and were exempt from the same disclosure and reporting requirements that their securities counterparts were subject to from

32 the beginning.
It seems to me that at its base that is what we must change.
Enron's bankruptcy has triggered visceral responses in all of us.
We're dismayed that this could have happened and more importantly, we must ask ourselves if it could happen again.
In the end, it's our role to ensure that it does not.
And as tragic as this incident has been for our Nation and particularly for the thousands of Enron employees, it does raise important public policy questions for us to address.
That's our job here today and in order to get on with it, I'm going to yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Hon. Thomas C. Sawyer follows:] PREPARED S TATEMENT OF
HON. TOM C. SAWYER, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
IN
CONGRESS
Good morning Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dingell.
First, I would like thank you for the opportunity to be here today to address an issue of such importance to our nation.
Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for both your leadership and insight in bringing this issue before the Committee.
The collapse of Enron--only one year ago--the seventh largest company in the world, a leader in energy trading and distribution, is almost inconceivable to us as we sit here today.
It illustrates to all of us the vulnerability of American corporations--even the most seemingly solid--and the importance of government oversight to ensure that employees, shareholders and the American public receive adequate information upon which to make their investment decisions.
To ensure that employees have some degree of protection when it comes to their retirement and life savings.
The nature and scope of this company's collapse is both multi-faceted and complex.
It involves myriad issues such as: the degree of regulation the federal government should assume over complex financial arrangements, the role that accounting firms play with the corporate clients they audit, and the degree to which we oversee 401(k) retirement plans.
In my opinion, this is a case about disclosure.
The purpose of our federal securities laws, enacted in 1933 and 1934, is to protect shareholders--not officers--not directors--and not the company's bottom line.
Our federal securities laws protect shareholders through a system that is based on disclosure--disclosure of all relevant financial information that a rational investor would use to assess the status of a company.
We set up this framework so that employees, shareholders, and prospective investors could make sound decisions about how they invest their money.
In this case, where we were dealing with ``energy derivatives'' rather than ``securities'', we simply did not have that disclosure.
For nearly a decade, these complex financial transactions escaped regulatory purview and were exempt from the same the disclosure and reporting requirements their securities counterparts were subject to from the beginning.
This is what we must change.
It is not our role as members of Congress to legislate the nature of business transactions or the degree of risk that a company--or its investors for that matter-- should assume.
It is not our role to tell employees which funds to invest their retirement dollars or the degree of diversification that is necessary.
However, we can, as members of Congress, set parameters.
We can set the framework--so that employee pensions and 401(k) plans are protected and investors and employees are given clear and accurate information about a company's financial performance.
It is our role set guidelines for auditors--to ensure that they are free from the inherent conflict of interest associated with both auditing and consulting for a client at the same time.
Enron's filing for bankruptcy has triggered visceral responses in all of us.
We wonder how this could happened--and more importantly, if it could happen again.
It is our role to ensure that it does not happen again.
And, as tragic as this incident has been for our nation, and particularly for the thousands of Enron employees, it does raise important public policy issues for us to address: Â· Is it necessary for there to be some federal oversight of ``energy derivatives''? And, if so, who is the most logical body to oversee these transactions? Â· What the scope of the auditors' role with their clients? Should accounting firms be restricted from providing information technology and ``other consulting services'' to the clients they audit?

33 Â· What amount of stock should own employees own of their company? Should employees be subject to a 10% cap as other federally-insured plans are? These are the questions that I hope this Committee can answer and address in public policy.
These are the answers I seek today in this proceeding.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman for giving us the opportunity to delve into these issues and provide some sort of solution for our country.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend for yielding and for his statement.
The Chair seeks anyone on this side who seeks recognition? The chairman of the Environmental Subcommittee.
Mr. GILLMOR.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate your affording another opportunity to sort out the recent events, as well as focus on possible reforms regarding Enron's collapse.
As we delve into the destruction of documents, listen to the findings of a special investigative committee concerning the illegal transactions between Enron and partnerships, controlled by its chief financial officer, I welcome the witnesses today and look forward to hearing the testimony.
My motivation regarding this issue lies with the well being of shareholders and employees and the reckless actions of those in corporate management should not come at their expense.
In my own State of Ohio, the State Teachers Retirement System invested $4 million in Enron in late October 2001, and a month later it was worth $100,000 leaving the Teachers Pension Fund with 2.5 percent of its original investment.
Their total loss stands at over $55 million and added to the Public Employees Retirement System, a loss of $59 million.
Ohio's two principal employee pension systems were among the Nation's largest pension fund losers in Enron stock and while it is a sizable loss, fortunately both Ohio pension funds have assured teachers and public employees that it will not endanger member benefits.
However, the illegal transactions of a few at Enron turning thousands into millions in a matter of weeks, the same can't be said of other State funds of Enron employees and individual shareholders.
Enron stands as a company comprised of improperly structured transactions, faulty accounting, lack of internal oversight and an overall attempt to misrepresent the company's financial condition.
And most importantly, Enron hid its behavior from all those who had an interest in it.
Unfortunately, I think Enron is just an extreme example of a change of attitude over the last couple of decades of too many corporate managements in large publicly held companies where you have an atmosphere of management enrichment, regardless of whether the company does well, of management enrichment at the expense of the shareholders and at the expense of the employees.
There has been, I think, a continuing breakdown in corporate management responsibility, whether it's the way options are turned into a game where management can only win, they can't lose, so that they don't have a community of interest with the shareholders, whether it's the disguising or the failure to disclose corporate charitable contributions which may or may not be made for any corporate purpose, so there are a number issues here and I look forward to hearing the witnesses' viewpoint today and I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

34 PREPARED STATEMENT OF
HON. PAUL E. GILLMOR, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
IN
CONGRESS
Thank you Mr. Chairman, for yet another opportunity to sort out the recent events as well as focus on possible reforms regarding Enron's collapse.
As we have delved into the destruction of documents and listened to the findings of a Special Investigative Committee concerning the illegal transactions between Enron and partnerships controlled by its Chief Financial Officer, I welcome the witnesses today and look forward to hearing their testimony.
As I stated before, my motivation concerning this issue lies with the well-being of the shareholders and employees--The reckless actions of those in corporate management should never come at their expense.
In my home state of Ohio, the State Teachers Retirement System invested $4 million into Enron stock in late October of 2001.
A month later it was worth just $100,000, leaving the teachers' pension fund with 2.5% of its original investment.
Their total loss stands at $55.6 million.
Added to the Public Employees Retirement System's (PERS) loss of $58.8 million, Ohio's two principal public employee pension systems were among the nation's largest pension fund losers in Enron stock at a combined $114.4 million.
While it can be perceived as a sizable loss, both Ohio pension funds assured teachers and public employees that it would not endanger the funds' bottom lines or affect member benefits.
However, with the illegal transactions of a few at Enron, turning thousands into millions in a matter of weeks, the same cannot be said by other state funds, Enron employees, and individual shareholders.
In the end, Enron stands as a company comprised of improperly structured transactions, faulty accounting, lack of internal oversight, and an overall attempt to misrepresent the company's financial condition.
Most importantly, Enron hid its behavior from all who had an interest in them.
I look forward to hearing the witnesses' viewpoints from their respective sectors as well as further congressional oversight regarding this issue.

I look forward to hearing from various industry perspectives on how and why this happened as well as what can be done to prevent this from happening in the future.
Mr. Chairman, over the past several weeks, the Oversight Investigation Subcommittee has held hearings to explore this house of cards that was once the mighty Enron Corporation.
We have heard from Andersen employees about the shredding of documents, the destruction of e-mails that went on in an effort, I'm sure, to cover up their whole mess.
We have heard from Mr. Powers about his Commission's findings and the actions of several Enron employees who set up the special purpose entities to assist in cooking the financial books at Enron.
We have heard and read about the totally lax oversight of Mr. Lay

35 and Mr. Skilling and other executives on the Enron Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors gave dangerous flexibility to Mr. Fastow in allowing him to establish several of these special purpose entities.
They supposedly put a number of checks and balances in place when they waived their conflict of interest provisions.
But thus far all we have seen of the checks are tens of millions of dollars worth going into Mr. Fastow's bank accounts.
There certainly were no balances in the equation and no follow up to make sure the company wasn't being bilked.
We've learned new terms like aggressive accounting which in this case relates in my interpretation into making fat cats of Enron richer while sticking it to the shareholder.
This aggressive accounting, I believe, was the result of a new cavalier attitude in corporate America since the passage of the Securities Litigation Act of 1995.
You know, back then in 1995, many of us referred to this as the Securities Rip Off Act as I and others fought against this bill, because it insulates corporations from legal actions by putting up roadblocks, making it difficult for shareholders and employees to take action against them.
Mr. Chairman, this committee and the Powers Report have only scratched the surface of a thick veneer on Enron's house of cards.
We have not had the time or the cooperation from the parties involved to get to the root of this cancerous corporate greed.
We have not looked into allegations of corruption in Enron's worldwide holdings, corporations and partnerships.
We do not know who got bilked overseas who may have been cooking the books.
We do not know who all the investors were in these special purpose entities and what role, if any, they may have played in the aiding and abetting the leaders of this corporation.
Mr. Chairman, the top executives and board at Enron have allowed the seventh largest corporation in America to collapse.
In their wake, lies thousands of Enron employees and retirees with shattered financial lives while the corporate executives, many of whom are still working at Enron today, have lined their pockets.
It will be difficult, if not impossible for Enron to emerge as a credible company from bankruptcy without a comprehensive purging of Enron executives and board members who were at the helm during this debacle.
They must be held accountable and I hope the investors in Enron will get themselves a true board of directors and new senior management team.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings.
I look forward to learning from our panel's perspective on the Enron transactions.
I'm sure they'll provide us additional insight that will be useful in questioning many of the key players in this Enron scheme at tomorrow's oversight hearing.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

36 to hearing their various industry perspectives on how and why this happened as well as what can be done to prevent this from happening again in the future.
Mr. Chairman, over the last several weeks the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee has held hearings to explore this house of cards that was once the mighty Enron Corporation.
We have heard from Andersen employees about the shredding of documents and destruction of e-mails that went on in an effort, I'm sure, to coverup their role in this mess.
We have heard from Mr. Powers about his Commission's findings and the actions of several of Enron's employees to set up these Special Purpose Entities to assist in cooking the financial books at Enron.
We have heard and read about the totally lax oversight by Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling, other executives and Enron's Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors gave dangerous flexibility to Mr. Fastow in allowing him to establish several of these Special Purpose Entities.
They supposedly put a number of ``checks and balances'' in place when they waived their conflict of interest provisions, but thus far all we have seen are checks--tens of millions of dollars worth--into Mr. Fastow's bank accounts.
There certainly were no balances in the equations and no follow-up to make sure the company wasn't being bilked.
We have learned new terms like ``aggressive accounting'' which in this case translates in my interpretation into making fat cats in Enron richer while sticking it to the shareholders.
This aggressive accounting I believe is the result of a new cavalier attitude in corporate America since the passage of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995--or the Securities Rip Off Act as I refer to it--which insulats corporations from legal actions by putting up roadblocks--making it difficult for shareholders and employees to take legal action against them.
Mr. Chairman, this committee and the Powers report have only scratched the surface of a thick veneer on Enron's house of cards.
We have not had the time or the cooperation from parties involved to get to the root of this cancerous corporate greed.
We have not looked into allegations of corruption in Enron's world-wide holdings, corporations, and partnerships.
We do not know who got bilked overseas or who may have been cooking the books.
We do not know who all of the investors were in the Special Purpose Entities and what role--if any--they may have played in aiding and abetting the leaders of this corporate scam.
Mr. Chairman, the top executives and Board at Enron have allowed the 7th largest corporation in America to collapse.
In their wake lies thousands of Enron employees and retirees with shattered financial lives while the corporate executives, many of whom are still working at Enron today, have lined their pockets.
It will be difficult--if not impossible--for Enron to emerge as a credible company from bankruptcy without a comprehensive purging of Enron executives and Board members who were at the helm during this debacle.
They must be held accountable and I hope the investors in Enron will get themselves a new TRUE Board of Directors and new Senior Management team.
Thanks you again Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.
I look forward to learning our panel's perspective on the Enron transactions.
I'm sure they will provide us with additional insight that will be useful in questioning many of the key players in this scheme at tomorrow's Oversight hearing.

The Enron debacle is of particular importance to my constituents in Tulsa, many of whom are employed by the energy industry.

37 their assets and liabilities.
This is a guilt by association type mentality.
The purpose of these hearings should be to find out what went wrong at Enron and to make sure that it never happens again.
The backbone of a free market economy rests on the clear and transparent display of information that allows investors and employees the ability to make accurate decisions on how to invest their money.
Congress must now take a good look at corporate American and our accounting standards to see if we can prevent the type of shell games that created the largest bankruptcy in American history.
At the same time, the Department of Justice should vigorously prosecute any one and every one who violated the law with respect to Enron.
It is important to remember though, as horrible as the Enron bankruptcy is, for the most part our energy markets seem to be weathering the storm.
The fact is that markets formerly served by Enron are quickly being absorbed by other companies without widespread price or supply disruption.
This is an industry that is far from broken or in need of repair.
I understand that in the coming weeks the committee may consider legislation to reform our Nation's electricity markets.
I am concerned, however, that some of my colleagues might want to use the Enron bankruptcy as a means to advance an unneeded regulatory barrage on the energy industry.
I hope that we will resist that temptation and focus on the task at hand.
Let's not forget that in the end free markets do work.

Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman for his statement and ask if there are members on this side, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Engel, is recognized for 3 minutes.
Mr. ENGEL.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
There's an old saying and it goes like this, ``Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.''
It's evident to me and to all of us that there's has been a concerted effort by the top brass of Enron to create an intricate web of lies, so intricate in fact, that it will take months and years to discover the whole truth.
Our ability to learn the truth would be greatly facilitated by the assistance of Enron's top brass.
Thus, I'm saddened by the fact that Mr. Lay has chosen not to testify.
I believe that Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow should be doing everything they can to help us uncover the truth.
Instead, they're doing everything they can to cover their own proverbial backsides.
I'm especially interested in knowing for what purposes Mr. Lay used the money he was loaned by Enron.
As I understand, Mr. Lay had a $4 million line of credit with Enron.
I have to wonder if he used any of this money to set up any of the hundreds of partnerships.
These partnerships took on debt for Enron, thus making Enron's bottom line look better.
This, in turn, caused Enron stock to increase in price and finally Mr. Lay paid off these loans with Enron stock.
A tangled web indeed.
Then we come to the other player in this tragic comedy, Arthur Andersen.
Arthur Andersen in the terms of addiction was an enabler.
And as Enron's auditor they enabled Enron to set up hundreds of partnerships, enabled Enron to hide debt in the hundreds of millions of dollars, enabled Enron's top executives to personally profit through this tangled web of deceit, and enabled thousands of investors and employees to be misled and victimized.
During the oversight investigation hearings I questioned some of the Andersen employees about their code of professional conduct.
They responded that they did not view their actions as violation of the AICPA's code but as, and I quote, ``a gross error.''
I again quote from AICPA's code of professional standards that the code ``cannot accommodate deceit or subordination of principle.''
I must beg to differ with Andersen in its assessment of its culpability in this matter.
Andersen was a party to and did accommodate deceit.
The Powers report not only states that Andersen failed in its role as auditor, but that it directly participated in the structuring and accounting of the Raptor transactions.
Luckily for Andersen there is little chance that the AICPA will take any action against it.
AICPA has failed time and time again to properly oversee its members in the industry.
I have with me two articles from the Washington Post that delve into the poor performance of the AICPA.
They detail a history of lax oversight.
In fact, often when an individual was cited and fined by the SEC, the AICPA did nothing.
For an industry that has fought tooth and nail for the power of self-regulation, this is a shameful track record.

Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend.
The gentleman's time has expired.
Is there further request at this time? The gentleman, Mr. Buyer, is recognized from Indiana for 3 minutes.
Mr. BUYER.
Mr. Chairman, thank you also for holding the hearings on the Enron collapse.
I appreciate your leadership and that of Mr. Dingell and Mr. Greenwood.
Like others on the committee have stated, it is very serious if financial books were altered, if investors were intentionally misled, if employees were intentionally given false information and treated differently than executives.
It is appropriate for this committee to review all these allegations.
There are two things that trouble me at this time about the Enron collapse.
First, how employees were treated.
Executives were given the opportunity to sell stock when they knew the price was tumbling, but used the rules to prevent employees from doing the same.
This stabs at the most basic ideals of fairness.
If the rules were utilized to aid and abet this unfair treatment of employees, then we need to correct the wrong.
401(k)s are an important tool in retirement planning.
This one instance of abuse should not be used to dismantle 401(k)s, but to strengthen them and I'm confident that Congress will address pension reform.
The second most troubling item to me at the moment is the scandal of culture that has a foundation, an architecture, in Washington, DC and how this scandal of Enron feeds into it.
This is a business scandal, not a political scandal.
There are those in this town that want to transfer it to the latter, rather than the former.
It's important for us to put the microscope on this so we can understand the marketplace and a company and what went wrong.
This is a matter of a business failure.
Despite the financial losses to thousands, and I am not minimizing this loss, I note that the free market economy, the most successful in the world that we've ever seen, lets businesses fail if they deserve to fail.
We often hail victors of free markets and great innovators like Thomas Edison who developed an idea to benefit us all, but we must also realize that if the market rewards excellence, it also punishes failures.
And in the Enron case, it was brutal.
If Enron engaged in illegal and unethical business practices, then that is exactly what should happen in the end.
There is a failure in the marketplace.
Some may question whether it is the responsibility of government to guarantee success in the marketplace.
I submit it is not.
The responsibility of government is to make sure the marketplace

41 is fair, free, open and competitive.
If, in fact, someone is not operating in that marketplace under those standards, we then can bring the microscope in and find out what went wrong.
And if, in fact, there are rules that need to be corrected, that is the responsibility for us to engage.
So I want to thank you Mr. Chairman and Mr. Dingell, Mr. Greenwood and others.
I think it's going to take time.
It will take some patience.
What I've learned is follow the facts, it will determine where the law should go and for the best result for the American society.
I return my time.
Chairman TAUZIN.

Mr. Chairman, today, I hope today's hearing will allow the committee to gain a panoramic view of the Enron debacle so that when all is said and done and we in the Congress can make the legal and policy changes necessary to prevent this disaster from ever occurring again.
Today's hearing will be an opportunity to hopefully shed light on the various industry-wide accounting, corporate governance and energy concerns raised by the Enron collapse.
And while I commend the committee for calling witnesses to discuss the roles and responsibilities of the executives, auditors and accountants, I fear that we have left out an important player in the story of Enron and its fall from grace.

Certainly this component to the Enron collapse must be part of our public debate.
What was the lawyers' role in this? The outside attorneys and also Enron's own legal department.
And however, Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, it may be equally as important to discuss the importance of sound, legal advice that would have guided Enron to a very different place than where it is today.
Again, where were the lawyers, what were they doing and why did they not advise Enron to do differently than they did.

And while I commend the committee for calling witnesses to discuss the roles and responsibilities of the executives, auditors, and accountants, I fear that we have left out an important player in the story of Enron and its fall from grace...
The lawyers.
In Enron's own limited investigation of its shady business practices, Vinson and Elkins confirmed that the procedures for monitoring those practices was uniformly overseen, not only by accountants and officers, but lawyers as well.
Unfortunately, the very investigation meant to rout out mismanagement and illegality, seemed marked by a cloud of mismanagement and missed opportunity.In its findings Vinson and Elkins described the monitoring procedures for its LJM transactions as: Â· generally adhered to, Â· The accounting as, creative and aggressive and Â· the working conditions as awkward.
Even though ENRON's SPE related transactions ``created a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation,'' . . .
Vinson and Elkin's nonetheless concluded that, there was no need for an expanded investigation.
In short, while the store burned down around its client Vinson and Elkins called for business as usual.
In the written testimony given by one of today's panelists, he tells of a corporate climate in which aggressive management dares the accountant to ``show me where I can't'' bend twist and stretch the rules to show a profit.
Certainly, this component to the Enron collapse must be a part of the public debate.
However, it may be equally as important to discuss the importance of the sound legal advice that would have guided Enron to a very different place than where it is today.

Mr. Vigil is an electrical machinist working as foreman for Portland General Electric, PGE.
He works at PGE's Pelton Round Butte Hydroelectric Project in Central Oregon.
He's 47 years old and has been employed by PGE for 23 years.
Here's what he said.
``Enron purchased PGE in 1997 at which time all of the PGE stock we had in our accounts automatically converted to Enron stock.
At first this looked like good news for the employees.
Enron was riding high and as we saw the com-

43 pany officers and supervisors investing in company stock, we felt assured that our own investments were solid.
As you're probably aware by August of 2000 Enron's stock had shot up to all time high of $90.56.
At that time, my 1800 shares were worth $163,000.''
Continuing with Mr. Vigil's comments: ``We were all barred from trading our stock during the critical period this last fall.
It seemed strange to me that as soon as the really bad news came out on Enron, we found ourselves unable to move out of the stock.
Enron suddenly changed account managers and our investment accounts were locked down.
I've seen that Enron says we were only locked out of our accounts for 10 trading days, from October 29 through November 12, but as early as September 26 my co-workers were finding they could get access to their accounts, but they could not conduct any transactions.
As the truth about Enron started to come to light and as the officers at the top cashed out, we, the employees had no choice but to ride the stock into the ground.''
Mr. Chairman, I encourage everyone here to read the entirety of Mr. Vigil's statement because it puts a human face on what we're talking about today.
No longer is the giant energy marketing company Enron or the Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
We can see how far reaching this collapse is from Houston, Texas, the fourth largest city in America to Madras, Oregon, population, 5,080.
We have to get to the bottom of this, Mr. Chairman, and I commend you and others in this committee for these hearings.
Too many workers saw their retirement vanish, too many shareholders were misled, too many years of financial statements were misleading at best or downright fraudulent at worst.
Credibility of companies and auditors has been lost.
The impact on the financial markets and investor confidence has yet to be determined and it comes at a critical time of our economy.
What did the top execs at Enron and Arthur Andersen know and when did they know it? Particularly troubling is the timing of actions of both Enron and Arthur Andersen.
Also, were they intentionally misleading investors and employees? Why were the blackout dates for employees inconsistent? Is it usual to destroy documents like Enron and Arthur Andersen did? Were there side letters that were made by Enron with its partners in relation to risk sharing and structure of those same partnerships? Has the FASB failed to issue regulations that may have prevented some of this from happening in the first place? Has the SEC failed to issue enhanced financial statement disclosure requirements describing partnerships? Do the disclosures need to be more comprehensible to the reader at large? Do auditor independence requirements need to be reviewed again in light of the current situation? Any time there's a declining business environment, transactions inherently become more complicated.
Companies like Enron and their auditors will continue to find ways to get around returns to their investors.
The FASB and SEC must continue to evolve with these complex transactions.
Delay is not an option.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, let me start by quoting some material from Robert Vigil, a constituent of mine living in Madras, Oregon, testifying in front of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation during their hearing on Enron.
Mr. Vigil is an Electrical Machinist Working Foreman for Portland General Electric (``PGE'').
He works at PGE's Pelton/Round Butte Hydroelectric Project, in Central Oregon.

Enron suddenly changed account managers, and our investment accounts were `locked down.'
I have seen that Enron says we were only locked out of our accounts for ten trading days--from October 29 through November 12.
But as early as September 26, my coworkers were finding that they could get access to their accounts, but they could not conduct any transactions.
As the truth about Enron started to come to light--and as the officers at the top cashed out--we, the employees, had no choice but to ride the stock into the ground.''
Mr. Chairman, I encourage everyone here to read the entirety of Mr. Vigil's statement.
It puts a human face on what we are talking about today.
No longer is it the ``giant energy marketing company Enron'' or the ``big five accounting firm Arthur Anderson.''
We can see how far reaching this collapse is.
From Houston, TX, the fourth largest city in America to Madras, OR: population 5,080.
I intend to get to the bottom of this.
Too many workers saw their retirement vanish.
Too many shareholders were misled.
Too many years of financial statements were misleading at best, or downright fraudulent at worst.
The credibility of companies and auditors has been lost.
The impact on the financial markets and investor confidence is yet to be determined and comes at a critical time of our economy.
What did the top execs at Enron and Arthur Anderson know and when did they know it? Particularly troubling is the timing of actions by both Enron and Arthur Anderson.
Also, were they intentionally misleading investors and employees? Why were the blackout dates for employees inconsistent? Is it usual to destroy documents like Enron and Arthur Anderson did? Were there side letters that were made by Enron with its partners in relation to risk sharing and structure of those same partnerships? Has the FASB failed to issue regulations that may have prevented some of this from happening in the first place? Has the SEC failed to issue enhanced financial statement disclosure requirements describing partnerships? Do the disclosures need to be more comprehendible to the reader at large? Do auditor independence requirements need to be reviewed again in light of the current situation? Anytime there is a declining business environment, transactions inherently become much more complicated.
Companies like Enron and their auditors will continue to find ways to get the most return for their investors.
The FASB and SEC must continue to evolve with these complex transactions.
Delay is not an option.
Thank you for the time Mr. Chairman.
I look forward to the question session in the hopes that I can provide answers to my constituents.
Chairman TAUZIN.
The gentleman's time has expired.
The Chair thanks the gentleman.
The Chair is pleased to welcome and recognize the gentleman fresh from his victories in New Orleans, took the town by storm, chief sponsor and supporter of the Patriots, Mr. Markey.
Mr. MARKEY.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much, and I now realize why 9 of the 36 Super Bowls have been played in New Orleans.
I think once you're there, you want to go back as quickly as you can.
Chairman TAUZIN.
Glad you enjoyed it, Mr. Markey.

45 Mr. MARKEY.
It was beautiful.
Chairman TAUZIN.
It was truly a great Super Bowl and again, I think we all owe thanks to the United States securities forces for making it such a safe and amazing event for America.
I think we're all very grateful and quite a game, Mr. Markey, congratulations.
Mr. MARKEY.
For us, it was the expurgation of so many ghosts of years gone back, beginning with Bill Buckner, but then back so far into time that we can't remember them all and all of them now, the cloud has passed.
Not unlike what we're going to have to do with Enron and Arthur Andersen in terms of the cloud that it's placed over the capital markets.
For many of us the most striking thing about the Enron debacle is that the time these transactions were being put together no one ever appears to have stepped forward to say you can't do this.
No one appears to have stepped forward to say that would be wrong.
No one ever appears to have stepped forward said what you're trying to do is unethical and possibly illegal.
Instead, every single financial professional who was supposedly there to protect the public investors, the outside auditors, the attorneys, the Wall Street investment banks and the corporate insiders, all of them got together and conspired with one another on how to structure deals that could evade or flout the rules.
And what about the Wall Street expert securities analysts who were supposedly scrutinizing Enron's performance and the credit rating agencies or supposedly evaluating the company's credit worthiness? Where were these when the shenanigans were taking place? The public wants to know how could this happen? Where was Enron's Board? Where was its senior management? Where were the risk management systems? Where was the outside auditors? Where were the lawyers? Where were the regulators? It wants to know why it was that so many of the internal and external checks and balances that were supposed to protect the public failed so catastrophically? Traditionally, many have thought of accounting as an incredibly dull and arcane subject.
The stereotype of the accounting profession has been that it is pretty much a bunch of nerdy geeks with an inexplicable fascination with obscure and abstruse rules and regulations.
And let's face, accounting is boring.
Unless, of course, you wish to engage in financial fraud.
In which case, accounting is an absolutely fascinating subject.
Successfully cooking the books is the key to getting away with financial fraud and at Enron and at Arthur Andersen, new and innovative recipes appear to have been devised.
This week the Powers Committee Report was released and provided us with an exhaustive review of Chewco, Raptor and LJM transactions and these transactions' insiders appear to have constantly flouted the rules.
Back in the 1930's Will Rogers said that from what he could tell a holding company was where you hide the money when the cops show up.
Today, for Enron and for possibly many other U.S. companies, special purpose entitles are where you hide your debts, disguise your nonperforming assets, boost your earnings, conceal your losses and avoid paying your taxes.
And so I think our committee must look at this issue.
We are not at--we have not found the iceberg yet, Mr. Chairman.
We are at the tip of the iceberg.

46 When accountants want to keep score and play the game at the same time, we'd all love to do that if we could get away with it.
But once you start doing that, you are setting yourself up for big problems.
I thank you for your leadership in conducting these hearings.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend for his statement.
And the Chair is pleased to recognize the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Terry, for an opening statement.
Mr. TERRY.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to highlight a couple of points and I'll submit the rest of my statement for the record.
And while the statement is chock full of pithy quotes, I sadly have no Star Wars references.
I do want to point out two things, in the role of Omaha, Nebraska in this hearing today.
First of all, I welcome a friend and constituent, Mr. David Sokol.
Mr. Sokol is an expert in energy policy since that's his life and I think he's world renowned for his knowledge of the industry and we welcome him here today to share his expertise with us.
So welcome, Mr. Sokol.
The other, sad, part about Omaha is that in the late 1970's we enjoyed a great company called Internorth and Internorth had arranged a merger with a small Houston company named Enron.
Well, as it ended up, the small fish gobbled up the big fish.
Mr. Lay moved to Omaha promising great things for our community, all the while secretly plotting its removal from Omaha to Houston.
Nonetheless, while hundreds of people were ripped from their jobs and either forced to move to Houston or retire, they did keep a small division in Omaha, their pipeline division.
We have about 400 employees in Omaha and several of those people are friends of mine.
And I've heard from several people in the Enron Division in Omaha who told me stories about how they had hundreds of thousands of dollars built up for them from their years of service with Enron in their 401(k) and now as they are looking toward retirement, have nothing.
Now Mr. Chairman, it's said that there are two kinds of light.
The glow that illuminates and the glare that obscures.
Obviously, we thought Enron was a company with an illuminating glow, but we have found out that they have used that glow to obscure their tactics and we're here today to try and uncover those tactics.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your outspokeness on behalf of the employees in Omaha, Nebraska and in Houston, because I think it's our duty today to find those tactics, fill the policy void so this can never happen again and make sure that the Justice Department vigilantly pursues those who have broken the law.
I yield back the balance of my time.

FROM
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Today's hearing will primarily examine the lax accounting practices Andersen employed in its auditing of Enron.
I am pleased, though, that we will also hear testimony regarding the status of our energy markets.
I think it's worthy to note that although the largest energy trading company in America collapsed, energy prices have remained fairly stable, and I'm looking forward to the testimony of my good friend David Sokol, chairman of MidAmerican.
When I contemplate the Enron saga I am reminded of a line from Shakespeare's Henry The Eighth, ``Thy ambition, Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land.''

47 What I'm concerned about are Enron's accounting practices: are they the exception to the rule, or are they the rule in Corporate America? We've seen the collapse of Enron late last year, and last week Global Crossing declared bankruptcy--who's next? Enron's story is reminiscent of a Shakespearean tragedy: a hugely successful company responsible for transforming an entire industry engaged in an elaborate scheme of complicated, unprofitable, and possibly illegal business partnerships; a politically connected CEO; a precipitous financial collapse of immense proportions; and the recent tragic death of its former Vice Chairman.
How could a company so well reputed, employing so many hardworking Americans, and with such a prolific stature in Corporate America just crumble? As we begin to investigate what happened here and why, it's important to keep in mind people's motives.
My interest is twofold: first as a member of this Committee, but more importantly because Enron was formed by merging two companies--Houston Natural Gas and Internorth--the latter headquartered in my home district of Omaha, Nebraska.
Enron employs more than 20,000 people, or at least did before this past Fall.
400 or so of those employees are located in Omaha.
They joined thousands in trusting Enron's officers to make decisions that were good for the firm's employees, retirees, shareholders, and not merely to enrich its executives' bank accounts.
Until late last year, it appeared Enron's expansion knew no boundaries.
The company grew to titanic proportions, spanning 40 countries, operating 30,000 miles of pipeline, holding nearly $50 billion in assets, and taking in revenues in excess of $100 billion in 2000 alone.
This seemed like a company playing out that fabled American dream, and its employees and shareholders were reaping the rewards.
On Sunday, the Special Investigative Committee of Enron's Board of Directors released the Powers Report, detailing intricate schemes that created assets that never existed, coaxing investors and employees to invest in a retirement future that would never be.
For those who have not read the Powers Report, I'd like to read a brief excerpt of how people like Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, Michael Kopper, and others made millions.
``We were charged with investigating transactions between Enron and partnerships controlled by its Chief Financial Officer, or people who worked in his department.
That is what our Report discusses.
What we found was appalling.
``First, we found that Fastow--and other Enron employees involved in these partnerships--enriched themselves, in the aggregate, by tens of millions of dollars they should never have received.
Fastow got at least $30 million, Michael Kopper at least $10 million, two others $1 million each, and still two more accounts we believe were at least in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
``Second, we found that some transactions were improperly structured.
If they had been structured correctly, Enron could have kept assets and liabilities--especially debt--off its balance sheet.
But Enron did not follow the accounting rules.''
Now we're here to determine how this charade was allowed to happen.
Who dropped the ball? A lot of finger pointing has taken place, and yet no one has come forward to say, ``I'm responsible.
I was the one making millions of dollars, all the while knowing that what I was doing was illegal, malicious, and a complete breach of public trust.''
I hope our witnesses here today can shed some light on what happened in the accounting world to have allowed such a corporate calamity to occur.
It has been said that there are two kinds of light--the glow that illuminates, and the glare that obscures.
For years, Enron seemed to be that illuminating glow.
Today, we seek uncover the tactics they used to glare their investors and obscure the reality of their condition.
If the only result of these hearings, though, is placing blame on the appropriate parties, we have not fulfilled our duties.
We must seek solutions to the problems exposed by this unfortunate collapse and implement reforms on a bipartisan basis to ensure this does not happen again.
Therefore, I look forward to this Committee and others in Congress exploring further the relationship Enron had with Andersen.
It may make sense that one firm should never hold the duplicitous roles of both auditor and consultant.
Congress may need to closely examine the possibility of closing this loophole.
I hope the issue of reporting earnings, and the practice of restating earnings, is further explored.
We must ensure American investors have accurate, transparent, and timely information when making their investment decisions.
I am also hopeful we make some meaningful reforms to how 401(k) plans are administered--not kneejerk reactions, but commonsense, pro-active legislation that creates safe plans for both employers and employees.
It's unfortunate that these reforms are too late for some, but hopefully will benefit future American employees and retirees.

48 In the 1980's there was a popular movie entitled Wall Street.
One of the primary characters, Gordon Gecko, while speaking to a group of shareholders proclaims the memorable line, ``Greed is Good.''
However, it should be remembered that greed is one of the seven deadly sins.
And unfortunately in Enron's case--it has proved to be prophetic.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to the testimony.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend.
The Chair is pleased now to recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Towns, for an opening statement.
Mr. TOWNS.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
This is a sad day for this committee and the shareholders of Enron and the families that were employed by Enron.
It is clear that the leadership of Enron Corporation did nothing to protect their investors, their shareholders or the employees of the company.
The executives put their own interest ahead of the workers and their families and the company's shareholders.
Unfortunately, they were able to use regulatory loopholes to accomplish this deceit.
It appears that they also broke a lot of rules and laws.
We look to the leadership of our present Chairman, Billy Tauzin from Louisiana in guiding our efforts to plug the loopholes and make sure that such an ungodly mess never happens again in this country.
The financial losses resulting from Enron's collusion to defraud everyone except a few executives cannot be understated.
While Enron employees lost some $1.6 billion, let me just briefly discuss the impact on some New York institutions.
Amalgamated Bank of New York shareholders lost an estimated around $500 million.
J.P. Morgan Chase and CitiGroup could lose over $3 billion from loans made to Enron and finally the losses of the New York Common Retirement Fund will lose approximately $58 million.
In the past the SEC had argued that budgeting and staffing constraints limited their regulatory capability.
Mr. Chairman, you probably remember, in the 106th Congress I was the first member to propose a fee reduction and pay parity bill for the SEC.
I'm pleased to say that the President recently signed into law the legislation which provides pay parity for SEC staff.
However, I'm deeply troubled that the President's budget for fiscal year 2003 does not provide funding for either the pay parity to stem the loss of experienced staff or additional resources to hire the staff attorneys, staff accountants, economists and examiners necessary for safeguarding America's investors.
Since we can't find the money for the SEC, I cannot understand how all of a sudden we can find funds for Chairman Pitts' new oversight board.
That just bothers me.
It is up to us, here in the Congress, to ensure that no American investor or employee is ever again victimized by the corporate greed practiced by Enron.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how we can strengthen our existing regulatory system.
I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank my friend.
Let me interrupt to explain to our witnesses, it is our practice to do these opening statements for several reasons.
One is it's the first opportunity for all the members of the full committee to make comments, even those who do not serve on the Oversight Subcommittee that is doing the

49 investigation, and to give their observations and their perspectives on this issue.
That is valuable to the Chair and to the subcommittees who are going to have to produce the legislation, hopefully, to repair some of the damage that has been done, and as many members have said, to see to it that this does not happen again.
Second, I hope it helps the witnesses in terms of understanding either the correct impressions we have or give you a chance to correct any misimpressions we have about the state of some of these concerns.
And so I hope it's helpful to both of us.
Again, I apologize that we've kept you waiting, but this is an extraordinarily important part in the way in which our committee hears from one another, understands one another's perspectives and then prepares for the solution phase of our process which is to produce the legislation, hopefully, that will repair this damage.
The Chair now asks if there are members on this side of the aisle who seek recognition for an opening statement.
Mr. Deal, are you prepared at this time? The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 3 minutes.
Mr. DEAL.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the distinguished panel.
We look forward to your testimony.
Obviously, there are many points of view that have been and will be expressed during the course of this hearing and others that will follow.
As many of us in the legislative branch have always heard, there is an admonition that I think is important here and that is that bad facts sometimes make bad law.
The Enron debacle is bad facts of historic proportions.
I think our challenge is not to react to bad facts by tempting to solve the problem with bad law.
Certainly those who have violated the existing laws should be prosecuted as those laws provide.
If there is a requirement that Congress act to provide further legislative safeguards that, to me, is the thrust of what we need to do and what we need to understand.
Certainly, the confidence of the American public and others in the safeguards and the oversight of the business community in its private capacity has been shaken as a result of these events.
Obviously, I think it would be a mistake for us to attempt to pre-empt those by simple governmental action or governmental rules and regulations.
But I think we need to have assurances from the private business community that they will take the kind of corrective action that would not make further legislative, detailed legislative action necessary, but that they as a good part of our overall business community are willing to do some of the policing themselves.
I think those are the challenges that we face.
I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman for an opening statement.
He yields back and the Chair is pleased to recognized the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, for an opening statement.
Mr. PALLONE.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to say that I'm amazed at how many public policy crises are Enron-related.
I'd just like to list, for example, campaign finance reform, energy deregulation, SEC reform, bankruptcy protection and pipeline safety measures.
And I don't have time to review all these, but the first point

50 I'd like to make is aimed directly at Enron's political influence.
On January 24, USA Today said it best.
They said ``Enron's aggressive lobbying drove the deregulation of markets for energy and other commodities that allowed it to escape scrutiny and outdistance its rivals.''
The New York Times noted that ``Enron and its executives have been President Bush's most generous contributors.''
But we aren't hearing much about House Majority Whip Tom DeLay's wellknown relationship with Enron and his bold, fundraising campaigns created in part by his former Chief of Staff, turned Enron lobbyist, Ed Buckham.
A Washington Post article from October 1999 noted that ``DeLay's fundraising deals are straight forward.
A seat at the table to plot legislative and political strategy in exchange for help in passing the Republican's agenda and financial support for GOP candidates.''
Well, what was Enron's role when this committee drafted industry-supported energy restructuring legislation that would have provided FERC full authority over all transmission and interstate commerce? According to an Energy Daily article printed October 21, Enron lawyers argued this very issue before the Supreme Court supporting FERC's order opening access to transmission and further arguing that it did not go far enough.
Did Enron work with Mr. DeLay in an attempt to undermine the activities of this committee or try to push legislation that would remove consumer protections? Another point is aimed directly at the SEC and its role in corporate disclosure, 401(k) and pension reform.
Enron's collapse caused New Jersey's Public Worker Pension Fund $60 million in loss and 20 jobs in my District in Edison, New Jersey.
It wasn't the largest loss, but it's the proof of the impact of Enron's collapse around the country.
Finally, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to mention the need for bankruptcy reform in light of the effects it has on Enron's wholly owned subsidiary, San Juan Gas Company's 1996 pipeline explosion that killed 33 and injured 80 others.
In 1996, Enron lobbied in support of the Accountable Pipeline Safety Partnership Act.
I didn't support this bill with many of my colleagues and we called upon President Clinton to veto the bill because it gutted pipeline safety laws.
Shortly after it became law, Enron's San Juan Pipeline exploded and NTSB reported this explosion noted that Enron knew that the gas company's operations did not comply with pipeline safety requirements and recommended industry practices had knowledge of failure to meet safety standards on this pipeline since 1985.
Today, Enron and its subsidiaries are being held accountable for financial loss, wrongful death, personal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by this pipeline explosion, but according to the January 21 New York Times, ``Enron's bankruptcy case has frozen settlement negotiations and the first scheduled trials for hundreds of victims.''
First, this provides us a clear example of why we must strengthen pipeline safety laws and further ensure improvements and reform in corporate bankruptcy.
I know there are a lot of other issues, but I just wanted to highlight those, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.

51 PREPARED S TATEMENT OF HON.
FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
Mr. Chairman, I want to say that I am amazed at how many public policy crises are Enron related.
ENRON was the Lone Star of Texas, shining blindingly bright.
But, in truth, each of the Lone Star's points of light was aimed squarely at the American public like a weapon.
Each point represents significant public policy crises that warrant our immediate and thorough attention: campaign finance reform, energy deregulation, SEC reform, bankruptcy protection and pipeline safety measures.
The first point of this Lone Star is aimed directly at Enron's political influence.
On January 24, USA Today said it best, ``Enron's aggressive lobbying drove the deregulation of markets for energy and other commodities that allowed it to escape scrutiny and outdistance its rivals.''
The New York Times noted that Enron and its executives have been President Bush's most generous contributors giving more than $550,000 to President Bush's various campaigns, the vote recount coffers and the inaugural committee.
Enron's political connection to and relationship with President Bush through Mr. Lay, has been tight.
But, when asked about his relationship with Mr. Lay, President Bush's initial reaction was to fib.
In a Texas newspaper, the Dallas Morning News, President Bush claimed that Kenneth Lay was ``a supporter of Ann Richards'' whom he ``first got to know'' when he decided to retain Mr. Lay as the head of the Governor's Business Council.
In fact, according to a 1994 article published in The Nation, President Bush lobbied on behalf of Enron in 1988 when he called Rodolfo Terragno, a former Argentine Cabinet Minister and pressured Mr. Terragno to award a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Enron.
To what extent has Enron held onto this level of influence with President Bush and been able to influence public policy created by this Administration during the past year? According to a Businessweek report in December 2000, transition scouts were eyeing Ken Lay to serve as Treasury Secretary and just a few months later they reported that Ken Lay was a key Bush advisor on energy and was named a ``transition adviser'' to the Energy Department.
But, we also aren't hearing much about House Majority Whip Tom DeLay's wellknown relationship with Enron and his bold fundraising campaigns created in part by his former chief of staff turned Enron lobbyist, Ed Buckham.
A Washington Post article from October 1999, noted that DeLay's fundraising deals are straightforward: a seat at the table to plot legislative and political strategy in exchange for help in passing the Republicans' agenda and financial support for GOP candidates.
What was Enron's role when Rep. DeLay attempted to undermine the work of this committee last July by drafting industry-supported energy restructuring legislation that in part would have provided FERC full authority over all transmission in interstate commerce? According to an Energy Daily article printed October 21, Enron lawyers argued this very issue before the Supreme Court--supporting FERC's order and further arguing that it did not go far enough.
Was it Enron that instigated the attempt to undermine the activities of this committee and push legislation that would remove consumer protections? This ties in very closely with the Lone Star's second bright point, the need to examine energy markets.
Did deregulation of the electricity market assist Enron in its ability to operate under the radar of regulatory oversight? The industry maintains that a deregulated electricity market is necessary.
However, did deregulation allow Enron's executives more flexibility in what Chairman Wood calls, ``questionable non-core business investments''? To what extent do we need to implement more transparency in the electricity trading market? I think it is also important to keep in mind the expanding web of relationships as well.
Last year, Vice President Cheney told Frontline that he did not hear from Mr. Lay regarding FERC appointments.
However, the White House last week admitted that it received a letter signed by Mr. Lay that included suggestions for new FERC commissioners.
Mr. Lay's suggestions included Pat Wood and Nora Brownell, now the FERC Chairman and a Commissioner respectively.
Is this mere coincidence? The third Lone Star point is aimed directly at the SEC and its role in overseeing accounting and auditing activities, corporate disclosure, 401K and pensions.
Enron's collapse caused New Jersey's public-worker pension fund $60 million in loss and 20 jobs in the Edison, New Jersey office--not the largest loss of a state but proof that the impact of Enron's collapse was broad.
We need to take action to prevent megacorporations from undermining the retirement savings of their employees.
Employees must have accurate information about the pension benefits they have earned, including employer stock holdings in their plans, and vested employees must have

52 the right to diversity employer contributions.
Employers should also have to provide clear notice before ``locking down'' pension account, and allowed to do so for only a limited time.
Finally, employees must be able to use the Labor Department and the courts to recover losses if their retirement funds are misused.
We cannot allow such financial losses to fall upon misinformed workers again.
The fourth and fifth points of the this Lone Star's saga are related, the need for bankruptcy reform in light of the effects it has had on Enron's wholly owned subsidiary San Juan Gas Company's 1996 pipeline explosion that killed 33 and injured 80 others.
In 1996, Enron lobbied in support of the Accountable Pipeline Safety Partnership Act.
I did not support this bill and with many of my colleagues and called upon President Clinton to veto this bill--it gutted pipeline safety laws.
Shortly after it became law, Enron's San Juan pipeline exploded.
An NTSB report of this explosion noted that Enron knew ``that the gas company's operations did not comply with pipeline safety requirements and recommended industry practices had knowledge of failure to meet safety standards on this pipeline'' since 1985.
Today, Enron and its subsidiary are being held accountable for financial loss, wrongful death, personal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the pipeline explosion.
But, according to a January 21 New York Times article, Enron's bankruptcy case has frozen settlement negotiations and the first scheduled trials for hundreds of victims.
First, this provides us a clear example why we must strengthen pipeline safety laws to prevent corporate negligence as well as ensure that corporate bankruptcy protection does not undermine the ability of innocent victims to receive compensation for such loss.
Thank you.
Chairman TAUZIN.
The gentleman yields back his time and the Chair will recognize Mr. Cox, if he's ready for his opening statement, for 3 minutes.
Mr. COX.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On September 11, the men and women who worked at the World Trade Center, Wall Street analysts, traders, investment bankers, accountants were heroes.
We recognize that among the 3,000 souls who perished that day were some of our best and brightest, extraordinary individuals whose creativity, energy and leadership helped power the economic miracle that is our free enterprise system.
Today, America's men and women of Wall Street are under deep suspicion.
The problems at Enron, K-Mart and Global Crossing and at their accounting firms have deeply damaged the credibility of every accountant, every corporate manager, every analyst.
Today, accountancy is in the dock.
The essence of the Enron fraud is accounting.
According to the Powers Report, the accounting for Chewco was flatly wrong from its inception.
The purpose of the many SPEs that Enron created was to keep debt and risk hidden from investors, from regulators and from the public.
The audited financial statements were misleading.
The only questions that remained are the various levels of culpability and the number of people knowingly involved.
It is my hope that as we explore accounting issues today, we can learn not only how to inform remedial legislation, but also how to inform better regulation, both by the industry and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I hope that we also keep uppermost in mind our responsibility to protect the livelihoods of those people who are not guilty of any wrong doing and who participate honestly every day in the business of America at other places of work, in other firms.
I hope that we do everything possible to restore the confidence of the investing public, of workers and their own retirements and of people and their own employers so that we can get about the business of America.

Mr. BARRETT.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman TAUZIN.
You are recognized for 3 minutes.
Mr. BARRETT.
I want to thank you for holding this hearing and thank our witnesses for being here today.
We should learn lessons about the administration of Enron's 401(k) plan today.
As a result of what may prove to be willful deception, thousands of workers lost not only their family supporting job, but also their retirement savings.
Those families deserve answers from this Congress.
We should learn lessons about the limits of Wall Street's securities analysis capabilities.
Because of America's investment advisor and brokerage houses took Enron at its word, America's families and large institutional investors suffered untold losses.
Wisconsin State employees alone lost over $45 million in pension fund assets when Enron stocks held by Wisconsin Investment Board became virtually worthless.
Wisconsin employees and participants in other large institutional investment plans have worked hard to earn their pension benefits.
And Mr. Chairman, they deserve answers from this Congress.
We should learn lessons about the effectiveness of the accounting and audit system that helps investors and creditors to value one business venture against another.
Enron's chief work product appears to have been a web of dummy corporations and mislabeled accounts.
With literally thousands such sham devices, the company's wrong doing appears to have been as inconspicuous as a bulldozer at a tea party.
But Arthur Andersen signed off on Enron's reports and investors around the world took Enron at its word, in part, because Andersen had looked over the books.
Some of Andersen's reactions to allegations concerning its role in Enron's failure have been disappointing.
In comments appearing in the February 3 Washington Post, Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard responded to Enron's internal audit by setting Enron's failure to provide information about its money-pit partnership Chewco.
``We attempted to speak with them and they didn't speak with us'' Mr. Leonard told the Post.
Now it's been a while since I worked as a Federal bank examiner, but as I recall when a responsible auditor does not get the information he needs to be satisfied that the numbers add up, he refuses to sign off on the audit.
He doesn't rubber stamp it and then complain after the fact that he hadn't gotten all the information.
To borrow a phrase from President Bush, Enron's math was not just fuzzy, it was hairy, wooly, shaggy, downright furry.
But whether it was willful complicity or just shoddy work, Arthur Andersen was the watchdog that never barked.
We can take lessons from these failures too.
The current system of auditor accountability based on peer review may no longer serve the public interest.
I am hopeful that our witnesses will help us consider whether an independent, self-regulatory organization might better safeguard American investors.
We can also take a broader lesson from the Enron debacle about the importance of honest and complete information disclosure.

55 hometown of Stratford, Missouri--one of the largest employers and you don't have to be a very big employer in Stratford, Missouri, but one of the largest employers--went out of business on Friday because their owner had a contract and a loan with Enron.
Enron couldn't hold up their end of the bargain and now 130 Southwest Missourians are looking for work.
This is a complicated story with ramifications spilling over into many legislative and regulatory areas.
It would be easy for me and for all of us on this panel to propose a mountain of changes to prevent what happened to Enron.
Subsequently, what happened to businesses like Midwest Products in Stratford from ever happening again.
That's why I'm so pleased that the Mr. Chairman has chosen to hold these hearings so that we, as a committee, can find out what new regulations really are warranted or whether we're simply creating obstacles to solutions in the future.
Much of this mess may have been attributed to illegal business practices or individual misconduct, but we can't, of course, legislate scruples.
Some of this bankruptcy could be the result of bad business decisions and we can't legislate good business judgment either.
But the true scandal of this case may be cutting bookkeeping tricks and promises of retirement security that ultimately weren't worth the paper they were written on.
It's clear that we need to shine some light on corporate practices and then enforce corporate disclosure requirements.
SEC regulations and accounting rules already require disclosure in situations that are likely to have a material effect on a company's financial condition, but in this case, Enron's financial disclosures were vague at best or criminal at worst.
Wall Street continued to overvalue Enron stock based on this pattern of misleading reports.
If adequate information had been available about the true state of Enron's finances, Enron employees would have made informed decisions about their financial futures.
After all, fully 62 percent of their 401(k)s consisted of Enron stock and that stock plummeted from over $80 a share in January 2001 to less than $.80 a share by January 2002.
They never had a real chance, based on the reassurances they apparently were receiving about the future state of the company.
I'm co-sponsoring legislation as many on this panel are.
The legislation I'm working on with Congressman Portman and Congressman Carden will be legislation that will help workers avoid overconcentration in stock of their own companies.
Enron's been a case in point for enhanced employee control of retirement security.
We need to look closely at a bill of rights for retirement security.
Look at all the Enron-related problems that could have been avoided had we had this type of regulation already on the books.
I look forward to the committee's investigation of corporate disclosures at Enron and at all companies.
We need to get to the bottom of what changes need to be made and then enforce them so that workers aren't left trading years of service for empty promises and uncertainty in their retirement years.

IN
CONGRESS
FROM
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for calling these hearings.
We have an excellent opportunity to use Enron's collapse to effect some significant change in the way our nation's businesses do business.
Enron went down with a ``bang--not a whimper,'' and the ripple effects have been felt in communities nationwide.
In my hometown of Strafford, Missouri, one of our largest employers went out of business on Friday because their owner had a contract and a loan with Enron, and Enron couldn't hold up their end of the bargain.
Now 130 Southwest Missourians are looking for work.
This is a complicated story with ramifications spilling over into so many legislative and regulatory areas.
It would be easy for me and for all of us on this panel, Mr. Chairman, to propose a mountain of changes to prevent what happened to Enron--and subsequently to businesses like Midwest Products in Strafford--from ever happening again.
That's why I'm so pleased that you're conducting these hearings--so we as a committee can find out which new regulations are warranted, or whether we'd simply be creating obstacles to the real solutions.
Much of this mess may be attributable to illegal business practices or individual misconduct, and we can't legislate scruples.
Some of this bankruptcy could be the result of imprudent business decisions.
And we can't legislate good business judgment either.
But the true scandal in this case may be that which is perfectly legal--cunning bookkeeping tricks and promises of retirement security that ultimately weren't worth the paper they were written on.
It's clear that we need to shine some light on corporate practices and enact, and then enforce, corporate disclosure requirements.
SEC regulations and accounting rules already require disclosure in situations that are likely to have a material effect on a company's financial condition, but, in this case, Enron's financial disclosures were vague at best and criminal at worst.
Wall Street continued to overvalue Enron stock--based on this pattern of misleading reports.
If adequate information had been available about the true state of Enron's finances, Enron employees could have made informed decisions about their financial futures.
After all, fully 62 percent of their 401(k)s consisted of Enron stock, and that stock plummeted from 80 dollars a share in January 2001 to less than 80 cents a share in January 2002.
They never even had a chance.
I signed on yesterday to a bill Congressmen Portman and Cardin have introduced to avoid workers' over-concentration in the stock of their own companies.
Enron has been a case-in-point for enhancedemployee control of retirement security.
This legislation would provide for new diversificationrights, new disclosure requirements and new tax incentives for retirement planning and education.
It's a bill of rights for retirement security.
Look at all of the Enron-related problems that could have been avoided had we had this type of regulation already on the books to allow employees to take control of their own financial futures.
This bill will prohibit companies from forcing employees to invest in employer stock.
It will grant new diversification rights for 401(k) matching contributions in employer stock.
The bill will require companies to notify employees within 21 days of so-called ``blackout'' periods, so they can rearrange their investments if they see fit.
And it will require companies to make sure employees know about general investment principles when they enroll in a retirement plan, so they can make knowledgeable decisions about their futures.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the Committee's investigation of corporate disclosure--at Enron and in all companies.
Let's get to the bottom of what changes need to be made and then enforce them, so that workers aren't left trading years of service for empty promises and uncertainty in their retirement years.

57 weeks and a few of my observations are as follows: when we started this investigation several weeks ago, we were told that the entire collapse of the house of cards that was Enron was due to just a few bad actors and as we have gotten deeper and deeper into this issue, it has become clear to all of us that the problems go deep and wide, both in Enron and all of its advisors.
Let me give a few examples.
First, Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen.
We were told in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee that one renegade at Arthur Andersen, David Duncan, the project manager, on his own decided to simply shred documents using an appropriately named company, Shredco.
And we were told that he just decided this should be done.
As we went through the hearing it became immediately clear, that the shredding was done with the tacit understanding and the not-so-tacit advice of Andersen's in-house legal department and of Mr. Duncan's supervisors.
Mr. Duncan was told to use Andersen's regular policy and destroy all backup documentation.
He was told this, even after Andersen and Enron knew of pending litigation.
Second, the limited partnerships.
We've heard much today and in the last week about the complex web of limited partnerships and other financial entities which were designed to boost up Enron's balance sheet while at the same time hiding fantastic losses.
We were told at first this was just a few greedy individuals.
But as we sat through the Oversight an Investigations Subcommittee hearings this week, it became immediately clear that Andersen's senior management and their board were either asleep at the switch or worse.
This is the diagram of the Chewco transaction.
You can't see it too well from the witness table, but it doesn't make much difference because this transaction is so complex it's difficult for even fairly well trained lawyers like me to understand what was going on.
But the bottom line was to shift Enron's debt off the books to run it through limited partnerships and other entities and in the end to inflate what it looked like the bottom line was.
There were thousands of entities not all structured like this.
In fact, many structured quite differently than this.
This is a diagram of the first financial entity put together which I have an interest in since it was a Colorado company, Rhythms.
As you can see, these two are very different transactions.
And as we sat there and listened to the web of very complicated partnerships and accounting slight of hand, I could only help but think of one thing, what would a low level Enron employee with all of their 401(k) retirement plan in stocks make of these? The Enron investors relied upon Arthur Andersen, the Board of Directors and senior management of Enron to make sure that all of these transactions were legitimate and that any conflicts of interest were disclosed.
Finally, the huge personal gains made by Enron employees and offices.
Again, we were told this was just one or two people making a lot of money.
As we sat in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, we realized many senior level employees, several officers were benefiting unbelievably from these.
Let me just give a couple of examples.
People who invested a few thousand dollars in the limited partnership and received $1 million in compensation 6 months later.
People who invested a few tens of thousands of dol-

58 lars and received $30 million in compensation, just a few months later, all undisclosed.
It's clear we must know exactly what happened.
How did Enron senior executives and board members hide these losses while getting personal gains like this? What can Congress do? And most importantly, perhaps, what can our society do to protect the small investors who have lost everything while the executives gained.
[The prepared statement of Hon. Diana DeGette follows:] PREPARED S TATEMENT OF
HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO
CONGRESS
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In the past few weeks all of us have been stunned by the revelations surrounding Enron's bankruptcy and the involvement of Arthur Anderson.
These hearings may help us get to the bottom of the matter.
The arrogant web of lies and deception must be untangled.
We must restore investor confidence, mandate greater transparency, deter other corporations from flimsy fiscal practices, and find just recompense for employees who lost their savings.
Enron was the largest corporate implosion in history.
And while those charged with fiduciary duty protected their money, loyal employees and trusting investors were scammed.
The American people have lost confidence that Enron will provide the truth.
They have learned that Arthur Anderson, which functioned as an auditing safeguard, failed in its duty.
Now, the American people are looking to us for an honest accounting.
It is our duty to use these hearings to answer the many questions at hand.
We must know exactly what happened.
How did Enron's senior executives and board members hide such fantastic losses while themselves realizing some breathtaking gains? How can shell partnerships be created that bury huge losses? How did Enron get away with annual reports filled with half-truths, even lies, omitting key information and transactions? What kind of corporate mentality creates a climate to ignore the law with seeming impunity, especially in an organization that in many ways was so visible? We know Enron was a hard-charging, rapid-growth company that constantly pushed the envelope.
The Powers Report detailed a litany of problems, compounded by a corporate mentality where executives thought that the law was an inconvenience to be over-ridden, not a legitimate public demand for honest practices and transparent dealings.
Arthur Anderson helped Enron, of course.
How did a reputable, internationally recognized firm like Arthur Anderson fail to provide a credible, transparent, honest audit of the company? How did Arthur Anderson hope to remain objective and credible when they were receiving astronomical consulting fees? I am most mindful of the many investors here who have lost their money, and the employees who lost their retirement funds.
What can Congress do to protect these employees and shareholders, many of whom have lost their entire retirement savings.
We have had two Oversight 
I look forward to learning more today so that we may begin to untangle the web which Enron left us.

I have a sense of compassion for our witnesses.
I'll give you the Cliff Notes version of my opening statement because you all have certainly gotten the spirit of the day.
We all know Enron is the largest corporation in American history to file for bankruptcy.
In addition to the type of investor losses the gentlelady just discussed, there was a dramatic and sudden fall in Enron stock prices that stripped retirement accounts of many current and retired Enron employees whose savings were based on Enron's stock.

59 Our committee colleagues from both sides of the aisle support this committee's efforts to discover whether or not Enron engaged in illegal business practices.
We want to understand a lot.
We want to understand why executives received large bonuses and compensations during a period of financial decline while other employees were prevented from selling their stock.
We want to understand how such a large corporation was able to hide its debt and collapse without any warning from responsible regulatory agencies and auditors.
Yet additional questions must be answered.
Did Enron's use of a large number of partnerships contribute to its collapse? Was there a complete failure of Federal regulators? Did Federal regulators have authority to adequately oversee complex commodity trading and financial transactions, the foundation of Enron's rapid growth? Through your guidance we'll certainly come to some conclusions, hopefully, solid conclusions with regard to these issues.
Chairman Tauzin's efforts to promote dependable, affordable and environmentally friendly production and distribution of energy are well known.
Some, and you've heard a sampling here today, but not most members of this committee, may try to confuse deregulation and the need for sound energy policy with illegal and duplicitous actions.
I continue to believe that the competitive market protected from potential abuse through proper oversight and the law remains the foundation for a strong economy, the basis for our national security and provides the best products and services for our citizens.
We look forward to what you all have to say and thank you for being here.
I yield back.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, the failure of any business is deeply disappointing.
In most cases, employees and their families bear the brunt of this failure with many experiencing a profound sense of loss, anger, and shame.
As the failure ripples through related enterprises, rocking businesses and communities-- disillusionment and loss is left in its wake.
Unfortunately, the tempest of a failed enterprise is in direct proportion to its size, and, accordingly, I applaud your conducting this inquiry of Enron, once our nation's 7th largest company.
On December 2, 2001, energy-giant Enron shocked the energy and financial communities by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Enron is the largest corporation in American history to file for bankruptcy.
In addition to investor losses, the sudden and dramatic fall in Enron's stock price has stripped the retirement accounts of many current and retired Enron employees, whose savings were largely based on Enron stock.
Mr. Chairman, my colleagues and I support the committee's efforts to discover whether or not Enron engaged in illegal business practices.
We want to understand why executives received large bonuses and compensation during Enron's financial decline while other employees were prevented from selling their stock.
We want to understand how such a large corporation was able to hide its debt and collapse without any warning from responsible regulatory agencies and auditors.

Did federal regulators have authority to adequately oversee complex commodity trading and financial transactions--the foundation of Enron's rapid growth? Through your guidance, these and many other questions will be answered.
Mr. Chairman, I applaud your efforts to review accounting standards, practices, and services and their effects in the Enron collapse.
If there are flaws in the regulatory system, then the laws must be changed to guarantee that a debacle of this magnitude will never happen again.

This must be an era of corporate responsibility.
The deliberate destruction of evidence by an employee in an ongoing investigation brings its own State and Federal criminal and civil penalties, as does failure to comply with SEC regulations and directives.
Our court system will resolve the many lawsuits seeking justice and compensation.
Illegal and duplicitous actions should not and cannot be tolerated.
Further, it is clear that some may attempt to use this business scandal that has hurt so many as a tool for petty politics and opinion manipulation.
We owe those who have worked hard, played by the rules, and have lost so much a strong, bipartisan investigation, or risk victimizing them a second time.
Mr. Chairman, your efforts to promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally-sound production and distribution of energy are well known.
Opponents may try to confuse deregulation with illegal and duplicitous actions.
I continue to believe that the competitive market, protected from potential abuse through proper oversight and legal protections, remains the foundation for a strong economy, the basis for national security, and provides the best products and services to our citizens.
Finally, this committee's investigation into Enron's business practices will prevent future business collapses of this nature, determine the effectiveness of Federal oversight and regulatory agencies, and make clear whether changes to Federal law are necessary to protect employees and shareholders.
We must and will get to the bottom of Enron's failure, and work to ensure it never happens again.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman for his statement.
The Chair is pleased to recognize the gentlelady, Ms. McCarthy, for an opening statement.
Ms. DeGette, I was not here to recognize you and I did want to take a moment to personally thank you for the extraordinary work you're doing on the subcommittee and I deeply appreciate the attention you've given that work.
Thank you.
Ms. McCarthy is recognized for 3 minutes.
Ms. MCCARTHY.
I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I thank you for conducting this hearing.
I would like the panelists to know that I arrived at 12:15, 21/2 hours ago and so I'm going to submit the bulk of my text to the record, but I want to thank you for taking the time to be here with us today.
I think what the committee is about is lessons learned and I'm pleased, Mr. Chairman, that that is how you have framed this hearing, because while all of us have been consumed by this in the news, and our committee staff has done 2 months of investigation and they've come up with some very serious determinations for us to look to, I look forward to your presentations because I think you're going to help us understand that many of the things that we feel we might need to fix can be done through regulatory and statutory mechanisms already in place, but that we might need to revisit some of the ideas that former Chairman Levitt and others presented to us over time that might tighten those regulatory processes to avoid this in the future.
I'm particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on how corporate boards can reform themselves because I think they can go a long way toward finding or being part of the solution to this kind of activity so that it doesn't happen anywhere else and I think too, Mr. Chairman, that all of us on this committee can learn from this experience that we're going to have, how we can shape national energy policy that we are working on very diligently, to make sure that we in the Congress also are working together with the regulatory agencies and existing statutory law and the boards to make

I thank the gentlelady for always very thoughtful comments and she yields back.
Are there further requests for time? I believe we have the vice chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, who has done such an excellent job for our committee for 3 minutes.
Mr. BURR.
I thank the Chair.
I don't want to prolong opening statements.
I only want to make a comment about the work of this committee.
This committee has a long history and certainly in the 7 years that I have been here to tackle tough issues.
And even though the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee has been asked to look at numerous things in those 7 years and prior to that under other leadership, also difficult issues, I personally have not been as challenged as I think we have been so far with the Enron issue, nor do I think we will be any more challenged as we head through this.
This is clearly like peeling an onion and with every layer we see something different.
We see something new and in many cases we find something even more ugly than we saw in the last layer.
We owe it to the American people to fulfill our commitment of oversight, of understanding, but most importantly, of assurance that we have gotten at the cancer that exists.
I'm confident, Mr. Chairman, under your leadership and with the commitment of all members, and hopefully, hopefully, with the cooperation of more directly involved in this whole issue we can get at the truth and move on to the solution much faster.
I yield back.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman for his statement and the Chair yields to the gentlelady, Ms. Capps, from California for an opening statement.
Ms. CAPPS.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm so pleased the committee is holding this wide ranging hearing about Enron.
It's important that we begin now to look into steps Congress, the regulatory agencies and corporate players must take to protect the public from future Enrons.
The distinguished panel of witnesses we have here will certainly be helpful in shedding light on this scandal and how we might prevent future ones.
I share the outrage of my colleagues and my constituents over this whole affair.
The various actions of Enron and Andersen executives has been inexcusable, immoral and maybe illegal.
As we all know, Enron's meltdown has cost thousands of the company's employees some or all of their life savings.
It has burned millions more investors across the country.
It has highlighted some glaring inadequacies in the accounting profession and its ineffective system of oversight that has allowed and even encouraged corporate shenanigans.
And of course, Enron has shown us, once again, the ugly face of greed and dishonesty.
Every day, congressional hearings in the media bring out more details about this sordid affair.
We know, for example, that Enron executives set up thousands of partnerships to help the company hide its debts.
We know that many of these executives made fortunes through these partnerships.
We know that Arthur Andersen was involved in some or all of this and we now know that Enron,

62 once touted as a management innovator, was apparently not much more than a sophisticated pyramid scheme.
But there's a lot we still don't know.
For starters, Mr. Chairman, we still don't know exactly who approved all these complex relationships and what they knew when they did it, who were all the partners and how much money they made.
We don't know how deeply Enron may have been involved in the California electricity crisis.
These are my constituents.
How Enron's actions may have exacerbated that situation? We know there's a strong connection.
We still are paying that price and will be paying it for a long time in California.
Until we know answers to these and many other questions our work here will not be complete.
So this committee must continue its aggressive investigation and I applaud all of the efforts into doing that.
The unanswered questions, however, do not excuse us from taking actions immediately.
I would hope that we can look into the idea of limiting the amount of time an accounting firm can do audits for the same company to a set number of years.
Perhaps that's worth exploring.
The attempt of our former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt to stop accounting firms from performing auditing and consulting for the same client is now clearly seen as something that should be pursued in Congress.
Some have suggested that the stock exchanges be responsible for hiring the accounting firms to audit companies.
These ideas should be explored and I would like to hear from our witnesses on these and other ideas.
These kinds of changes may be necessary to give investors more responsible and accurate accounting of corporate books.
I think it's important to note, however, that at the bottom of all this are not seemingly mundane accounting problems.
At the bottom appears to be simple greed and dishonesty at the highest levels of a corporation.
It was Enron executives who were in charge when the company was going to say what was happening regarding its profits and losses.
It was Enron executives that chose to stretch and finally break the bounds of propriety.
And so it must be the goal of this committee to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that the next set of executives in Enron or any other of our large corporation or any of our business executives think twice before they do the same thing.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back the balance of my time.

64 ward as a Nation and to sustain the lifestyle we have.
So I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings.
I think I want to jump off of the point that Ms. Capps just made.
There are clearly some things wrong in the system.
When I listen to the bureaucratese about special purpose entities and then you go behind those and you discover that they really are off-balance sheet entities which in this instance were used to hide debt and create a false impression about the financial security of this company, it is clear that we need to take a close look at the accounting standards of this country.
We need to take a close look at the role for the SEC.
We need to take a close look at the role of FASB and whether or not we're doing the right things there.
I commend you for bringing in this particular panel of witnesses.
But in our effort to examine this, we need to discern between that which was a regulatory failure where we did not have bright lines in the rules that govern misconduct and as Ms. Capps put it simple greed, because in this instance it looks to me fairly clear that there was a great deal of simple greed.
No one I believe reading the documents and studying what happened can fail to recognize that members of the board of directors had to know what was going on, officers had to know what was going on, they had to know that the public was being deceived.
Now someone should have caught that before now and we should make sure that the enforcement mechanisms are there to do so, but we should not just enact new regulations to replace the regulations that failed the last time and thereby burden the economy.
This is a critically important inquiry.
I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for conducting it.
Chairman TAUZIN.

Mr. Chairman, thank you for providing today's forum to examine issues that demand this Committee's prompt attention; accounting standards reform and auditor oversight.
Malcolm Forbes once said: ``Too many people overvalue what they are not, and undervalue what they are.''
Some of Enron's top leadership knowingly and systematically reported an income and financial stability that simply did not exist, and thus betrayed consumer trust by portraying a greater value of the company than actually existed.
To make this matter all the more onerous, Enron accountants appear to have exploited loopholes in existing law governing the disclosure of relevant material financial information to achieve their deception.
I am troubled by the allegations that top management officials with Enron capitalized on the lack of effective and enforceable accounting

65 standards, and thus bullied their accountants into misrepresenting numbers to public investors to hide the fact management had made terrible business decisions.
The debt incurred by these deals was obscured from investors in special purpose entities, and what real income Enron was realizing from other SPE deals was being pocketed by a select few at the top.
Enron officials knew this was occurring, but did nothing to alert the public.
Investors took such information in good faith and heavily invested pension plans in Enron stock.
The results were catastrophic for working class Americans, as the value of employee pension plans a worker had invested in and counted on for years were wiped out in an instant.
I am very concerned that our current accounting and auditing practices can be manipulated and exploited to hide fraudulent activities.
This committee must look at ways to improve and strengthen our accounting standards to prevent intentional circumvention by unscrupulous individuals whose greed overshadows principle.
Such individuals are compromising the integrity of their professional and personal reputations, while ruining the trust of a public that relies on information they provide to make investment decisions.
If this is the best that accounting industry selfregulation can do, then Congress has no choice but to step in with real regulation.
In my view, allowing the same firm on a company payroll to do the auditing for that company is a practice that is ripe for exploitation, especially when laws prohibiting this exploitation are vague or nonexistent.
We must empower the Securities and Exchange Commission with the proper resources and authority to enforce accounting and auditing standards, and I sincerely hope this Committee explores ways to reduce or eliminate this conflict of interest in industry practice.
My colleagues, one of prime directives of this Committee is to ensure that American consumers are protected from harmful goods and services.
Clearly, Enron violated the rights of consumers by reporting false or misleading information through the use of ``pro-forma'' earnings reports, whereby disclosure laws are skirted through the use of creative accounting terms and practices.
We must act to reform our ability to regulate and enforce disclosure laws so that investors know and clearly understand the financial shape of a company before making investments.
Chairman TAUZIN.
Further requests on this side? Then the Chair is pleased to announced to our very patient panel of witnesses that he's going to recognize the last member on this side of the aisle, Mr. John of Louisiana.

There are many lessons to be learned from Enron's collapse.
Some are very simple.
But some are very complex.

The witnesses have made lots of concrete recommendations in your testimony, a lot of which have merit and we're going to discuss them today.
And we'll enact, possibly enact, legislation at the end of our investigation.
I think Enron's collapse revealed a complex, corporate web of related party transactions and off-balance partnerships that beg the question: ``how could this have happened to a publicly traded company?''

66 through the doors of Enron, lax oversight of auditing and reporting processes, a complete disregard for their own code of ethics, and collusion among members of senior management to distort the true financial picture of the company in its public filings.
Mr. Chairman, I believe the Justice Department will bring justice to the individuals that played any role in defrauding the millions of investors and for destroying the retirement dreams of thousands of employees, some of whom live in my District in Louisiana.
However, I believe that it is the responsibility of this committee to determine what role the auditing and accounting professions have played in the collapse of Enron.
I think that is our role.
For example, is there enough self-regulation in the industry to convince investors that accurate and relevant information is being disclosed? Or does Congress need to take legislative action to ensure auditor independence? I think before we take any legislative action, it's important to be sure that we have not learned the wrong lessons here.
We must make sure that we do not harm consumers or investors with our good intentions or the hasty movements of this committee.
I look forward to the testimony with our witnesses here today, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to educate members of this committee and the public about what went wrong at Enron and the steps we can take in Congress to prevent employees and investors at other companies from experiencing the same fate.
There are many lessons to be learned from Enron's collapse, some simple and others more complex.
The expert panel you have assembled today on auditing and accounting practices will greatly assist the committee in distinguishing between what transpired at Enron versus what takes place every day in corporate America.
The witnesses have made many concrete recommendations in their written testimony which merit discussion today and possible legislative enactment at the end of our investigation.
Enron's collapse has revealed a complex corporate web of related-party transactions and off-balance-sheet partnerships that beg the question: how could this happen to a publicly traded company? The Powers Report reveals a company that was plagued with flagrant conflicts of interest, lax oversight of the auditing and reporting process, a complete disregard for their own code of ethics, and collusion among members of senior management to distort the true financial picture of the company in public filings.
Mr. Chairman, the Justice Department will determine which Enron executives should be put on trial for their roles in defrauding millions of investors and for destroying the retirement dreams of thousands of employees.
However, it is the responsibility of this committee to determine what role the auditing and accounting profession played in Enron's collapse.
For example, is there sufficient self-regulation in the industry to convince investors that accurate and relevant information is being disclosed, or does this Congress need to take legislative action to ensure auditor independence?

67 Mr. BARTON.
For once I timed it right.
I got here right at the end of the opening statements, so I apologize to our panel for having to wade through all of this.
I have just a few brief comments.
I am very glad that we're holding this hearing.
I think the American public needs to understand if it's possible to understand exactly what happened at Enron.
I think the accounting practices are paramount to that understanding.
I took six different accounting classes in undergraduate and graduate school.
And for the first 10 years out of college I could understand an annual report about as well as anybody.
I took a look at the Enron annual report and I can't understand it.
I spent an hour attempting to really understand what they were doing and it's impossible by a layman reading their annual report.
I am very interested to learn how some of these accounting practices came to be generally accepted.
The mark to market accounting seems to me murky at best.
How in the world you can book a revenue this year for something you may not get for 10 or 15 years at 100 percent face value is beyond the comprehension of the average American.
I also would be very interested if the panel is allowed, to discuss this practice of an audit firm with a consulting arm, both consulting and auditing the same firm.
It would seem to me that one pretty straight forward change would be you could do one or the other, but you can't do both.
So again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing.
I have followed very closely the collapse of Enron.
I'm one of the stockholders that has now got stock that if I were to trade it would probably be trading at pennies on the dollar, so I want to get to the bottom of this as well as the next person and do whatever we need to do as a committee to prevent this from happening to future companies and future stockholders.
Chairman TAUZIN.
I thank the gentleman.
I also thank the gentleman for agreeing to examine the energy markets next week at a hearing.
I think we've scheduled it for the 13th or 14th, Joe? Mr. BARTON.

ONGRESS FROM
Mr. Chairman, I would like to first thank you for calling this hearing into the Enron collapse and all of the ramifications it holds for our economy and financial paradigm.
To say the Enron situation is troubling is, of course, an understatement.
Beyond being another episode of self-enrichment by rogue employees and careless oversight by senior officers and board members, this case has possible severe implications for our capitalist system.
This is because the accounting and auditing procedures currently in place are now being questioned.
As we have heard over the past several weeks, if the numbers on the financial reports are meaningless, or if there is widespread gimmickry in use to conceal true financial status of an enterprise, then we are in deep trouble.
If investors cannot rely upon the information available to them, then the equities markets devolve into little more than games of chance, where smoke and mirrors prevail over reason and rational decision-making.
While it is not the role of Congress to try and convict those charged with wrongdoing, it is the duty of Congress to conduct effective oversight and strengthen regulation to ensure as little chicanery as possible goes on in the marketplace.
If, as evidence becomes available and as events unfold, it becomes apparent that the officers and former officers of the Enron Corporation were guilty of gross negligence and/ or criminal activity, then it is my personal desire to see them prosecuted to the full-

68 est extent of the law.
If the Powers report is to be believed, it is unfortunately likely that such misdeeds and derelictions of duty did, in fact, occur.
What is also troubling--perhaps more so--is the role the auditors of Arthur Anderson, LLP played in this whole affair.
Can we believe that simple human error is to blame for the basic accounting mistakes attending the creation of the Special Purpose Entities created by Mr. Fastow in an effort to conceal debts and liabilities of the Enron Corporation? Or was something more sinister at play? We are now left with the aftermath of this debacle.
Recently, doubts have been cast regarding the accounting procedures of other large and heretofore extremely successful companies.
While the fluctuations of the stock market should never be used as the basis for policy decisions, the underlying investor doubt in financial reporting is something to take very seriously.
Most unfortunate of all, however, are the employees and other innocents who were forced to stay on board the SS Enron while the top officials jumped like rats off the sinking vessel.
While it may be impossible to make their retirement accounts whole again, this unseemly episode does give added impetus to thorough review of pension laws so that this does not happen to anyone else.
In summary, there was enough shoddy oversight by all responsible parties, enough self-enrichment, enough complicity on the part of auditors and senior management, to warrant an exhaustive investigation.
I look forward to hearing the testimony today and to the ongoing efforts of the committee to bring the actions of the Enron board and executives to light.
PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH, A REPRESENTATIVE CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN
Mr. Chairman, today's hearing is a very important step in building confidence in our U.S. capital markets.
Without consumer confidence our American market system, based in part on trust, will not operate.
While trust is a key, we need to fix the system to abide by the principle tenant of ``trust but verify.''
We must uncover all the secret Enron partnerships that were designed to enrich top executives and defraud stockholders.
The Enron Special Investigation Committee report has uncovered secret and possible illegal dealings between Enron and partnerships controlled by its top executives.
We owe a thorough investigation to the people who worked all their lives at Enron only to retire with a handful of change while top executives made millions.
Enron's attempt to trade water rights in my home state of California through their subsidiary Azurix Inc. is a perfect example of Enron's appalling business deals.
It is unjust for a company to dissolve losses of $326 million in one transaction alone, while executives who leave just prior to the downfall receive millions in severance pay at the time of their departure.
Huge severance payments paid out to former executives played a part in Azurix's downfall and left many Californians broke and unemployed.
Due to the Enron failure and the scandalous events surrounding the company, the accounting profession has also been tarnished.
Arthur Anderson has shown that the regulatory model that governs their profession is in dire need of reform.
The conflict of interest when auditors provide other services, especially management consulting services, to their audit clients, require changes that are vital to the survival of the industry.
In the end, I hope we collect enough information to determine the real purpose behind the creation of these secret Enron partnerships.
And if their purpose was to have a friendly third party with which Enron could engage in various financial transactions in order to improve Enron's balance sheet, those involved should be brought to justice.
For the sake of our markets, our investors, and our pension plans this problem must be fixed.
I thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing, and I yield back the balance of my time.

69 Mr. Chairman, like all of us, I am disheartened what happened with Enron.
It seems that every day reveals new information and evidence about this collapse that makes this case even more serious and complicated.
Enron's collapse is not just about corporate mismanagement, accounting standards, or regulatory failure, but about thousands of American working men and women who lost their jobs and saw their pensions shrivel to nothing.
As we move forward on this investigation, we shouldn't forget them--those whose futures have been affected by this mismanagement.
I am hopeful that this hearing will help us get to the bottom of what happened, and obviously, how we can avoid this from happening in the future.
I look forward to hearing from this panel of experts today about the transactions behind the company's collapse.
Specifically, I am interested in learning more about audit practices and current standards for Audit Committees and whether these standards are adequate to ensure meaningful oversight for shareholders.
I am also hopeful that the witnesses will discuss the current state of corporate disclosure and make recommendations for improvements.
Unfortunately, in the case of Enron, it seems there was a failure to communicate essential information about the real risks facing the company to the people who needed it most--the investors.
As I mentioned before, our final goal in this investigation should be to make sure this doesn't happen again, to protect the hard-earned pensions of the American people and to restore their trust.
Mr. Chairman, I believe we should be careful not to rush to legislative responses to the Enron bankruptcy.
However, I do look forward to looking into President Bush's plan and others which address federal laws governing worker pensions and 401(k) plans.
I appreciate the witnesses taking the time to share with us today and look forward to hearing their testimony.
I yield back the balance of my time.
PREPARED STATEMENT
OF
HON. MARY BONO, A REPRESENTATIVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

CONGRESS
FROM
Mr. Chairman: Thank you for holding these hearings.
Enron created more than 3,000 partnerships, restated nearly $600 million of profit over four years and went from one of this country's top companies to a source of controversy and shame.
Seeking to look more profitable, the creation of these 3,000 partnerships allowed Enron to move its debts off its financial statements and out of the public eye.
In doing so, the company allegedly sought to mislead investors and shareholders and betrayed the trust and confidence of its very own employees.
In fact, Enron officials went beyond keeping quiet about the company's financial woes--top officials allegedly encouraged further investment by its employees when they knew this house of cards would collapse.
It is unfortunate that Congress must now look at enacting safeguards for 401(K) plans not only because a business failed, but because of the callousness of the men and women who ran it.
Another player in this disturbing turn of events is the Arthur Andersen firm.
Arthur Andersen seemed to either bless these business practices of Enron or was oblivious to it.
But what makes this relationship even more tenuous is the fact that not only was Arthur Andersen Enron's auditor, but also its consultant.
Arthur Andersen collected audit fees of $25 million but earned even more for its consulting work.
Therefore, the role played by auditors in our capital markets should also come under scrutiny.
The ``Big Five'' have long served as a sort of ``Good Housekeeping'' seal of approval for investors in our capital markets.
High standards of disclosure and transparency are the keystones to a healthy and vibrant market.
Unfortunately, it has become apparent that Congress needs to discuss implementing stricter accounting standards and more thorough disclosure requirements.
But these troubles do not end in the questionable business practices of Enron and Arthur Andersen.
It is now apparent that individuals at both firms decided to shred documents after the Security and Exchange Commission launched a formal investigation on October 31, 2001.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to this hearing and ones to come in order to understand exactly what went wrong and how Congress can address these problems in a responsible and well thought out manner.

HON. RALPH M. HALL, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS
IN
CONGRESS
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee--I thank you for holding this hearing today on accounting issues and questions that have been raised in the wake of the collapse of Enron.
Let me state at the outset that I fully support the Committee's inquiries and investigations of Enron to determine what, if any, laws, rules and regulations have been broken or evaded.
While it is important that we understand fully what happened at Enron so that we may carry out our obligations to make whatever changes are needed in law and policy--we should recognize that ultimately the courts and the regulatory agencies will deal with what happened there.
The title of this hearing--``Lessons Learned...'' is an appropriate one that is in keeping with our role.
However, I suggest that this may be only the first ``Lessons Learned''' hearing.
As facts continued to be uncovered, obviously there will be a need for more hearings of this type by the Full Committee.
The witnesses before us today have a great deal to teach us based on what they have observed thus far, and I trust that we will benefit greatly from their observations and experience.
Perhaps we ought to have them back six months from now and ask them how their views may have changed as the Enron saga continues to unfold.
Analysts are telling us that investors are becoming uneasy about the truthfulness and veracity of financial statements issued by major corporations.
As corporate securities are more widely held now by individuals than ever before, it is even more incumbent on us to work carefully but fast to find and identify the problems in accounting and reporting and take all actions necessary to remedy them in this Congress.
Some people are frightened about the security of their life's savings in 401(k) and similar plans, so we need to work carefully and calmly to ascertain the facts and take appropriate action in order to calm the markets and those who invest in them.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, as a member from the oil patch, let me urge my colleagues not to tar all other energy companies with the Enron brush.
There are many, many well-run energy companies that are conservatively managed and treat their creditors, employees and shareholders fairly.
Oil, natural gas, and--yes--electricity markets are evolving.
But let's be careful that we don't act hastily to undo the progress that these markets have made.
As problems are uncovered, let's correct them, but don't throw out the premise that competitive markets are innately bad.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman TAUZIN.
It is now time for us to turn to our distinguished panel, again, with my deep appreciation for your patience.
I hope you have gathered from all the discussions of the members how deeply members are concerned to find solutions, not just to understand what went wrong in this case, which is our first tour of duty, but also then move on and find solutions.
I want to thank again Mr. Dingell and the minority for helping us to assemble this panel who will begin the process of telling us what we might want to do in order to fix these problems and we start with an understanding of what happened at Enron and we move from an understanding of what happened at Enron coming from Mr. James Chanos, who was the first, I think, of the analysts who actually could see this coming.
He was recommending a sell while everybody else was recommending a buy.
And we move on to experts in the accounting field, Mr. Robert Raber, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors who first talked to us about the role of directors in a major corporation.
What is their responsibility? What is their training? What is their expertise, what might we do to enhance the capacity of directors of America's publicly traded corporations to do a better job than we see was done at Enron? We'll move on to accounting issues and we'll hear from Dr. Roman Weil, who is a Ph.D., Professor of Accounting at the University of Chicago who will talk to us about general accounting issues and we'll move on to special purpose vehicles, the SPEs and the market-to-market accounting

71 issues that my friend from Texas finds it difficult to follow in an annual report.
I think all Americans would find difficult to follow.
We will hear from Dr. Bala Dharan who is a professor in the Graduate School of Management at Rice University in Texas.
We'll also then move to Mr. Baruch Lev who is the Philips Bardes Professor of Accounting and Finance at the Department of Accounting Taxation and Business Law at the Stern School of Business in New York.
I'm told that Mr. Lev is an extraordinarily gifted individual in this area and who can teach us about accounting policy and possible remedies and we look forward to your recommendations, Mr. Lev.
We'll move then to governance of accounting.
Many suggestions as to how we might oversee the accounting industry, who audits the auditors has been the question raised and we're going to get some recommendations from another witness recommended by the minority, Mr. Bevis Longstreth of New York, who also has some expertise in this area and I would be deeply interested in your suggestions and observations, Mr. Longstreth.
Finally, I want to thank David Sokol, Chairman and CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company for coming to give us a perspective on the energy markets and the energy business and how it reacted to the collapse of Enron and whether or not it worked well as Mr. Largent has indicated in working around the financial collapse and still delivered electricity and gas to customers across the country served by the seventh largest corporation in America as it collapsed.
So we get a sense of the effect of the Enron collapse on the energy markets.
Indeed, a distinguished panel.
We turn to you and we welcome Mr. James Chanos, for your testimony, sir.
STATEMENTS OF JAMES S. CHANOS, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES, LTD.; ROGER W. RABER, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS; ROMAN L. WEIL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO; BALA G. DHARAN, RICE UNIVERSITY; BARUCH LEV, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY; BEVIS LONGSTRETH, DEBEVOISE 
Mr. CHANOS.
Good afternoon, my name is James Chanos.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for allowing me to offer my perspective on this tragic Enron story.
I'm the president of Kynikos Associates, a New York private investment management company that I founded in 1985.
Kynikos Associates specializes in short selling, an investment technique that profits in finding fundamentally overvalued securities that are poised to fall in price.
Kynikos Associates employs seven investment professionals and is considered the largest organization of its type in the world, managing over $1 billion for its clients.
Prior to founding Kynikos Associates, I was a securities analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital and Gilford Securities.
My first job on Wall Street was as an analyst at the investment banking firm of Blyth Eastman Paine Webber, a position I took in 1980 upon graduating from Yale University with a B.A. in Economics and Political Science.
Neither I nor any of our professionals is an attorney or a certified public accountant, and none of us has had any direct dealings with Enron, its employees or accountants.

72 On behalf of our clients, Kynikos Associates manages a portfolio of securities we consider to be overvalued.
The portfolio is designed to profit if the securities it holds fall in value.
Kynikos Associates selects portfolio securities by conducting a rigorous financial analysis and focusing on securities issued by companies that appear to have (1) materially overstated its earnings; (2) been victims of a flawed business plan; or (3) that engaged in outright fraud.
In choosing securities for its portfolios, Kynikos Associates also relies on the many years of experience that I and my team have accumulated in the equity markets.
My involvement with Enron began normally enough.
In October of 2000, a friend asked me if I had seen an interesting article in The Texas Wall Street Journal, which is a regional edition, about accounting practices at large energy trading firms.
The article, written by Jonathan Weil, pointed out that many of these firms, including Enron, employed the so-called ``gain-on-sale'' accounting method for their long-term energy trades.
Basically, ``gain-on-sale'' accounting allows a company to estimate the future profitability of a trade made today and book a profit today based on the present value of those estimated future profits.
Our interest in Enron and other energy trading companies was picked because our experience with companies that have used this accounting method has been that management's temptation to be overly aggressive in making assumptions about the future was too great for them to ignore.
In effect, ``earnings'' could be created out of thin air if management was willing to push the envelope by using highly favorable assumptions.
However, if these future assumptions did not come to pass, previously booked ``earnings'' would have to be adjusted downward.
If this happened, as if often did, companies addicted to the crack cocaine of ``gain-on-sale'' accounting would simply do new and bigger deals--with a larger immediate ``earnings'' impact--to offset those downward revisions.
Once a company got on such an accounting treadmill, it was hard for it to get off.
The first Enron document my firm analyzed was its 1999 Form 10-K filing, which it had filed with the U.S. SEC.
What immediately struck us was that despite using the ``gain-on-sale'' model, Enron's return on capital, a widely used measure of profitability, was a paltry 7 percent before taxes.
That is, for every dollar in outside capital that Enron employed, it earned about seven cents.
This is important for two reasons; first, we viewed Enron as a trading company that was akin to an ``energy hedge fund.''
For this type of firm, a 7 percent return on capital seemed abysmally low, particularly given its market dominance and accounting methods.
Second, it was our view that Enron's cost of capital was likely in excess of 7 percent and probably closer to 9 percent, which meant from an economic point of view, that Enron wasn't really earning any money at all, despite reporting ``profits'' to its shareholders.
This mismatch of Enron's cost of capital and its return on investment became the cornerstone for our bearish view on Enron and we began shorting Enron common stock in November of 2000 for our clients.
We were also troubled by Enron's cryptic disclosure regarding various ``related party transactions'' described in its 1999 Form 10-

73 K as well as the quarterly Form 10-Qs it filed with the SEC in 2000 for its March, June and September quarters.
We read the footnotes in Enron's financial statements about these transactions over and over again, and like Representative Barton, we could not decipher what impact they had on Enron's overall financial condition.
It did seem strange to us, however, that Enron had organized these entities for the apparent purpose of trading with their parent company, and that they were run by an Enron executive.
Another disturbing factor in our review of Enron's situation was what we perceived to be the large amount of insider selling of Enron stock by Enron's senior executives.
While not damning by itself, such selling in conjunction with our other financial concerns added to our conviction.
Finally, we were puzzled by Enron's and its supporters' boasts in late 2000 regarding the company's initiative in the telecommunications field, particularly in the trading of broadband capacity.
Enron waxed eloquent about a huge, untapped market in such capacity and told analysts that the present value of Enron's opportunity in that market could be $20 to $30 per share of Enron stock.
These statements are troubling to us because our portfolio already contained a number of short ideas in the telecommunications and broadband area based on the snowballing glut of capacity that was developing in that industry.
By late 2000, the stocks of companies in this industry had fallen precipitously, yet Enron and its executives seemed oblivious to this.
Despite the obvious bear market in telecommunications capacity, Enron still saw a bull market in terms of its own valuation of the same business, an ominous portent.
In January 2001, we began contacting a number of analysts at various Wall Street firms with whom we did business and invited them to our offices to discuss Enron.
Over the next few months a number of them accepted our invitation and met with us to discuss Enron and its valuation.
We were struck by how many of them conceded that there was no way to analyze Enron, but that investing in Enron was instead a ``trust me'' story.
One analyst, while admitting that Enron was a ``black box'' regarding profits, said that, as long as Enron delivered, who was he to argue.
It was clear to us that most of these analysts were hopelessly conflicted over the investment banking and advisory fees that Enron was paying to their firms.
We took their ``buy'' recommendations, both current and future, with a very large gain of salt.
Something else that caught our attention was a story that ran in The New York Times about Enron in early February of 2001.
In light of the California energy crisis, Enron was invoking a little-noticed clause in its contract with its California retail customers.
This clause allowed Enron to directly match its retail buyers of power in California with the power providers with whom Enron had contracted on its customers' behalf.
Most of these power providers were in bankruptcy now.
In effect, Enron was telling a number of very prominent California companies and institutions ``This is now your problem, not ours.''
This was done despite the fact that Enron was paid by its customers a middleman fee precisely so that Enron would accept what is called counter-party risk, something Enron now backed out of doing.
As a result, Enron's credibility in the en-

74 tire energy retail business began to crumble simply because the company refused to recognize sure losses in California.
One of my analysts said at the time, ``Gee, it's as if Enron can never admit to a losing trade.''
Future revelations would prove that remark prophetic.
It was also in February 2001 that I presented Enron as an investment idea at our firm's annual ``Bears in Hibernation'' conference.
As I recounted Enron's story to the conference participants, most of them agreed that the fact pattern and numbers presented were very troubling.
Most also agreed that Enron's stock price left no room for error.
Following our conference, the short position in Enron reported monthly began to move higher.
In the spring of 2001, we heard reports, confirmed by Enron, that a number of senior executives were departing from the company.
Further, the insider selling of Enron stock continued unabated.
Finally, our analysis of Enron's 2000 Form 10-K and March 2001 Form 10-Q filings continued to show low returns on capital as well as a number of one-time gains that boosted Enron's earnings.
These filings also reflected Enron's continuing participation in various ``related party transactions'' that we found difficult to understand despite the more detailed disclosure Enron had provided.
These observations strengthened our conviction that the market was still is over-pricing Enron's stock.
In the summer of 2001, energy and power prices, specifically natural gas and electricity, began to drop.
Rumors surfaced routinely on Wall Street that Enron had been caught ``long'' in the power market and that it was moving aggressively to reverse its exposure.
It is an axiom in securities trading that no matter how well ``hedged'' a firm claims to be, trading operations always seem to do better in bull markets and to struggle in bear markets.
We believe that the power market had entered a bear phase at just the wrong moment for Enron.
Also in the summer of 2001, stories began circulating in the marketplace about Enron's affiliated partnerships and how Enron's stock price itself was important to Enron's financial well-being.
In effect, traders were saying that Enron's dropping stock price could create a cash-flow squeeze at the company because of certain provisions and agreements that it had entered into with affiliated partnerships.
These stories gained some credibility as Enron disclosed more information about these partnerships in its June 2001 Form 10-Q which it filed in August of 2001.
To us, however, the most important story in August of 2001 was the abrupt resignation of Enron's CEO, Jeff Skilling, for ``personal reasons.''
In our experience, there is no louder alarm bell in a controversial company than the unexplained, sudden departure of a chief executive officer no matter what ``official'' reason is given.
Because we viewed Skilling as the architect of the present Enron, his abrupt departure was the most ominous development yet.
Kynikos Associates increased its portfolio's short position in Enron shares following this disclosure.
The events affecting Enron that occurred in the fall of 2001, particularly after October 16, have been recounted seemingly everywhere in the financial press.
Kynikos Associates cannot add much to that discussion, but I have tried to provide an overview of what

75 our firm thought were significant developments and revelations during the preceding 12 months.
And while this testimony is mainly about our firm's assessment of Enron and the basis for that assessment, we would be remiss if we did not share a few observations about what happened.
First and foremost, no one should depend on Wall Street to identify and extricate investors from disastrous financial situations.
There are too many conflicts of interest, all of them usually disclosed, but pervasive and important nevertheless.
In addition, outside auditors are archaeologists, not detectives.
I can't think of one major financial fraud in the United States in the last 10 years that was uncovered by a major brokerage house analyst or an outside accounting firm.
Almost every such fraud ultimately was unmasked by short sellers and/or financial journalists.
In addition, a company's adherence to GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles, does not mean that the company's earnings and financial position are not overstated.
GAAP allows too much leeway in the use of estimates, forecasts and other inherently unknowable things to portray current results.
In the hands of dishonest management, a rapidly growing subset in my opinion, GAAP can mislead far more than they inform.
Further, I believe that certain aspects of GAAP, particularly accounting for stock options in the United States, are basically a fraud themselves.
Such obvious accounting scams should be ended immediately without any interference by third parties.
While no fan of the plaintiffs bar, I must also point out that the so called ``Safe Harbor'' Act of 1995 has probably harmed more investors than any other piece of recent legislation.
The statute, in my opinion, has emboldened dishonest managements to lie with impunity, by relieving them of concern that those to whom they lie will have legal recourse.
The statute also seems to have shielded underwriters and accountants from the consequences of lax performance of their ``watchdog'' duties.
Surely, some tightening of this legislation must be possible, while retaining the worthy objective of preventing obviously frivolous lawsuits.
Our current system of self-monitored disclosure is first-rate in my opinion, with one important exception.
In this day and age of EDGAR, the internet and real-time disclosure, our system for disclosing insider stock purchases and sales remains antiquated.
Insiders buying or selling shares should disclose such transactions immediately.
And esoteric collars, loan/stock repurchase deals and other derivatives that are in the ``gray area'' of insider disclosure should be treated for what they are, another way to either buy or sell shares.
The structure of an inside transaction should never hinder its immediate disclosure.
Finally, I want to remind you that despite 200 years of ``bad press'' on Wall Street, it was those ``unAmerican, unpatriotic'' short sellers that did so much to uncover the disaster at Enron and at other infamous financial disasters during the past decade.
While short sellers probably will never be popular on Wall Street, they often are the ones wearing the white hats when it comes to looking for and identifying the bad guys.
Thank you very much for this opportunity to tell our story.
