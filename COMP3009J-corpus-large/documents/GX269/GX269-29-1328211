ABSTRACT This retrospective study by Texas Health Quality Alliance (THQA) addresses care provided to 195 adult type 2 diabetics enrolled in three STAR+PLUS Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans during State Fiscal Year (SFY) 1999.
Performance measures associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment practices are presented.
Data was abstracted from medical records for the following performance measures: documented glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test results, HbA1c test results greater than 9.5%, documented plans to manage poor glucose control, documented retinopathy screening, documented lipid panel, triglycerides test results greater than 200 mg/dl, high density lipoprotein (HDL) test results less than 40 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein (LDL) test results greater than 130 mg/dl, documented nephropathy monitoring, documented foot examination, and documented educational interventions.
Major findings from this study are: over half (52%) of adults with diabetes enrolled in each managed care plan had measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin and lipid panels; documented rate of adherence to diabetes monitoring indicators was low across care plans ; on average, 10% of adults had documentation of retinopathy and nephropathy screening; about 28% of adults had documented foot exams ; and 25% had evidence of at least one educational intervention.
Looking at differences between plans, members enrolled in ACCESS had significantly higher rates of documented retinal screening, nephropathy monitoring and educational interventions than the other plans.
Members enrolled in Americaid had a significantly higher rate of lipid panel documentation.
In addition, male members were five times more likely than female members to have triglyceride results 
Members under the age of 50 were three times more likely than members over the age of 50 to have glycosylated hemoglobin test results 
Finally, the risk of diabetes complications may be increased for men and for members under age 50.
Results from this study indicate that documentation indicative of the quality and level of care provided to adult type 2 diabetics in Medicaid Managed Care is low for all performance measures.
These findings are in line with other studies of adult diabetes performance measures, and provide useful information for identifying ways to improve patient care.
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE STAR+PLUS DIABETES FOCUSED STUDY INTRODUCTION In the United States adult population, the prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing especially in some ethnic groups and the economically disadvantaged (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2000).
Factors influencing the increase in diabetes include issues related to lifestyle such as diet, obesity, and decreased physical activity (Haffner, Miettinen, 
Demographic variables associated with acculturation, socioeconomic status, aging, and an increase in populations with a genetic predisposition to the disease, have also been implicated (Haffner, 1998).
Children and grandchildren of type 2 diabetics have a two times greater risk of developing diabetes than children of nondiabetics (Klein, Klein, Moss, 
Guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus, and improved administrative systems that permit monitoring episodes of illness and the costs associated with clinical management, have also contributed to increased case identification (CDC, 1997b).
The Texas Diabetes Council (TDC) estimates that 1.6 million Texans over the age of 18 have diabetes and an estimated 680,000 additional Texans remain undiagnosed (TDC, 1998a).
In 1997, diabetes contributed to 12,299 deaths and was the sixth leading cause of death listed on Texas death certificates.
Diabetes is a major clinical challenge within certain ethnic groups as well as by age, gender and socioeconomic status (King, Aubert, 
For example, women, Hispanics and African Americans have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than men or Caucasia ns (Burke et al., 1999).
The onset of the disease usually occurs at an earlier age, and there is a higher rate of diabetic complications in these populations (Harris, Klein, Welborn, 
The occurrence of microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes has been reported to occur 4 to 7 years prior to the clinical diagnosis of diabetes (Harris et al., 1992; United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] Group, 1998).
Although extensive research has validated the efficacy and economic benefits of secondary prevention (controlling glucose, lipid and blood pressure levels) and tertiary prevention (screening for early diabetes complications), these measures are not routinely used in daily clinical management of diabetes (Kraft et al., 1997).
The purpose of the SFY 2000 Medicaid Managed Care STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study was to provide information about the monitoring of diabetes control and complications among diabetic adults aged 18 to 64 enrolled in the STAR+PLUS managed care program.
Documentation of performance measures is reported in this study for the following areas: glucose screening, glucose control management plan, lipid panel testing, retinopathy screening, nephropathy screening, foot examinations and diabetes educational interventions.
While these measures have been tracked by the Texas Medical Foundation (Texas Medical Foundation, 2000) for diabetics in the Medicare population, data specific to the Medicaid population in Texas had not been evaluated prior to 1998 [THQA], 1999).

The current study addressed recommendations from the STAR+PLUS Medicaid Managed Care Focused Study for SFY 1999 Diabetes in Adults (THQA, 1999), to concentrate on performance measures such as metabolic measures, physical examinations and patient education, as well as measuring management of poor glucose control.
This year's study elements were consistent with physician performance measures as defined by the Performance Measurement Coordinating Council (PMCC) (AMA, 2000).
The PMCC adult diabetes performance measures and required data elements are comparable with the HEDISÂ® 2000 Comprehensive Diabetes Care measures and the Diabetes Quality Improvement Project (DQIP) Initial Measure Set (ADA, 1998), as well as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) measurement set (ADA, 1999).
HEDIS measures are generally collected and reported nationally by health plans through the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) (NCQA, 1999a).
The NCQA HEDIS measures are intended to enable comparisons of managed health care plans by consumers and purchasers (AMA, 2000).
The Texas Health Care Information Council (THCIC) requires that all Texas commercial health plans report their performance on the HEDIS measure related to comprehensive diabetes care (Texas Health Care Information Council, 2000).
Results for this measure will be available in 2001.
In 1999, THCIC required commercial health plans to report on the HEDIS measure related to eye examinations for people with diabetes, as a predecessor to the comprehensive diabetes care measures.
THCIC reported that the Texas average for eye examinations for people with diabetes was 32% in 1997 and 33.2% in 1998.
These measures are lower than the national averages as reported by NCQA of 39% in 1997, and 40.9% in 1998 (NCQA, 1999c).
LITERATURE REVIEW Some of the notable findings in recent diabetes literature reveal that Medicaid expenditures and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Texas have exploded in recent years (TDC, 1999a).
In 1994, the direct and indirect costs of diabetes in Texas were an estimated $9 billion.
These costs are second only to heart disease (TDC, 1999c).
Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death listed on U.S. death certificates in 1996 and the fifth leading cause of death among minority populations (Office of Minority Health, 1999).
Minority populations are also more likely to develop diabetes complications and experience greater disability from these complications than Caucasians with diabetes (Harris, Klein, Cowie, Rowland 
The complexity of care required for individuals with diabetes is widely recognized.
However, many of the multifaceted complications of diabetes can be prevented with early detection, improved delivery of care, and enhanced education in diabetes self- management (CDC, 1999b; 2000).
In recent studies, adherence by providers to performance recommendations offered by the American Diabetes Association (1999) have proven to be difficult in many clinical settings (Kraft et al., 1997).
In addition to limited participation by mainstream providers of care, Medicaid programs have been hampered by many other factors.
Some of these factors are: excessive reliance on clinically and economically inappropriate sites of care; lack of coordination in care delivery; lack of an identified regular source of primary care; inappropriately high levels of certain types of care; and indiscriminate and episodic care by recipients (Raube 
However, managed care research has demonstrated substantial improvements in process

and outcomes of care for diabetic members as seen by decreased mortality and co- morbidities, and an increase in good glycemic control and screening for complications (Petitti et al., 2000).
Prevalence According to CDC (1998), 15.7 million people have diabetes constituting 5.9% of the general population.
National health surveys conducted during the past 35 years have demonstrated the complexity of diabetes prevalence and have shown that the percentage of minority populations diagnosed with diabetes is increasing dramatically (Harris et al., 1998).
Extensive epidemiological research has identified variations in prevalence by ethnicity, age, gender and socioeconomic status (Burke et al., 1999).
Among ethnic groups, prevalence is higher among African Americans (18.2%), Hispanics (10.6%) and American Indians (9.0%) than among Caucasians (8.2%).
Prevalence of diabetes is higher among people age 65 or older (18.4%) as compared to people age 64 or younger (8.2%) (Harris et al.,1998).
Variations in age prevalence have also been reported by ethnicity.
About 25% to 30% of Mexican Americans age 50 or older, have either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 1998b).
Epidemiological research also indicates variations in prevalence of diabetes by gender and socioeconomic status.
Of the 1.6 million Texans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes the prevalence by gender is 5% among men and 8.1% among women (TDC, 1998).
Among African Americans age 50 or older, 19% of men and 29% of women have type 2 diabetes (NIDDK, 1998a).
Across all age groups, African American women have a higher prevalence of diabetes than African American men (Harris et al., 1998).
Among Mexican American women, diabetes prevalence has been inversely related to socioeconomic status.
Specifically, diabetes prevalence has been reported higher among low income Mexican American women than among middle or upper income Mexican American women (Burke et al., 1999).
Diabetes Complications Principal risk factors for microvascular diabetes complications are related to the degree and duration of hyperglycemia.
The risk factors for macrovascular complications are related to cholesterol level, blood pressure and cigarette smoking (Klein, 1995; Steiner, 1999; Stern, Mitchell, Haffner 
According to recent research, type 2 diabetes may lead to microvascular and/or macrovascular complications related to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, nervous system disease, nephropathy, blindness, amputations, and dental disease (CDC, 1999a; Haffner, 1998; Stern et al., 1992).
Nervous system disease Neuropathy is the most prevalent symptomatic complication of diabetes and potentially one of the most devastating (Apfel, 1999).
Diabetic neuropathy comprises a number of different syndromes, each with a range of clinical and subclinical manifestations (Vinik, 1999).
Although there is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy is multifactorial, the prevailing theory implicates persistent hyperglycemia as the primary factor (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Group, 1993).
About 60% to 70% of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nervous system damage (CDC, 1998), but control of hyperglycemia has been shown to slow the progression of mild somatic and autosomatic neuropathy (Parry, 1999).

Heart disease Numerous studies have documented that cardiovascular disease, particularly ischemic heart disease, is a leading cause of death and a major caus e of morbidity and functional disability among diabetics (Donahue 
The pathogenesis of heart disease in diabetes is complex.
Factors such as serum lipids are frequently abnormal and likely contribute to the risk of coronary artery disease (Sowers, 
Low levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels are probable contributors to cardiovascular disease and have been reported in type 2 diabetes (Miller, 1999).
Ethnicity and gender differences in patterns of serum lipids have also been noted (Cowie, Howard, 
Cook and colleagues (2000) report that diabetic African Americans have lower triglyceride levels and higher HDL cholesterol concentrations than Caucasians, and that diabetic women have higher LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations than diabetic men.
Although heart disease mortality in the nondiabetic U.S. population has declined substantially, similar progress has not been made within the realm of diabetes (Gu, Cowie, 
National clinical studies have found death rates to be twice as high among middle- aged diabetics as compared to those without diabetes (CDC, 1999a).
In contrast, the San Antonio Heart Study found a much lower rate of heart disease among diabetic Mexican Americans than among diabetic Caucasians (Haffner, Miettinen, 
High blood pressure According to the American Heart Association (2000), diabetics are more likely than nondiabetics to develop hypertension.
Conversely, recent data suggests that persons with hypertension are much more likely to develop diabetes over a period of 5 years (Sowers, 1998).
About 60% of people with diabetes have high blood pressure.
These data suggest that both diseases have common underlying causes and coexistent risk factors (Haffner, Lehto, Ronnemma, PyÃ¶rÃ¤lÃ¤, 
Hypertension in diabetics manifests in disproportionate elevations of nocturnal blood pressure that increases the cardiovascular and renal load that is associated with albuminuria and left ventricular hypertrophy (Sowers, 1998).
Regardless of the primary cause of death, death certificate data indicate that hypertension is the most powerful coexistent risk factor for premature death in diabetic patients (Francisco 
Up to 75% of diabetes related cardiovascular complications may be attributable to hypertension (Sowers, 1998).
Stroke The risk of stroke is 2 to 4 times higher in diabetics than in nondiabetics (CDC, 1998).
African American males and females in all age groups have the highest death rates from stroke (Escobedo, Giles, 
The increased risk for stroke experienced by African Americans can be explained by their socioeconomic status and higher prevalence of stroke risk factors, especially diabetes and hypertension (Giles, Kittner, Hebel, Losonczy,

Blindness Diabetic retinopathy is estimated to be the leading cause of blindness in adults aged 20- 74 years (Aiello et al., 1998).
The prevalence of retinopathy is strongly related to duration of diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2000b).
The frequency of diabetic retinopathy is 40% to 50% higher in African Americans and Mexican Americans than in Caucasians (Harris et al., 1998).
Diabetic nephropathy Diabetes is a leading cause of end- stage renal disease, accounting for about 40% of new cases every year (CDC, 1999a).
The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the appearance of low or abnormal levels of microalbuminuria (Bennett et al., 1995).
A higher proportion of individuals with type 2 diabetes are found to have microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes (Ritz, Rychlik, Locatelli, 
Without specific interventions, 20% to 40% of diabetics with microalbuminuria progress to overt nephropathy.
Among diabetic African Americans, early renal function decline is three times more likely to develop than in diabetic Caucasians (Krop et al., 1999).
Population based studies of Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes have shown that Mexican Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop proteinuria (a condition where an excessive amount of protein exists in the urine, initiated by various factors), and are more like to develop end stage renal disease (Pugh, 1996).
Amputations Distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common form of peripheral neuropathy and is the leading cause of lower limb amputation (Greene, Stevens, 
The risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have had diabetes for more than nine years, are male, have poor glucose control, or have cardiovascular, retinal or renal complications (American Diabetes Association, 2000d).
More than half of lower limb amputations in the United States occur among people with diabetes.
Among adult diabetics in Texas, 3,041 diabetics who were 65 years of age or younger had lower extremity amputations in 1995 (TDC, 1999a).
Lower extremity amputations are reported to be more common in African American diabetics than in diabetic Caucasians (Martin, Selby, 
Dental disease Periodontal disease is more severe among diabetics and occurs in 30% of diabetic adults (CDC, 1998).
Economic Costs of Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is a costly disease.
Diabetes- related discharges accounted for 24.7 million days of hospital stay in 1993 (Aro, Kangas, Reunanen, Salinto, 
Rates were higher among persons aged 45 years or older with rates of diabetes- related hospital discharges increasing with age (CDC, 1997b).
In 1992, outpatient visits per 100 persons with diabetes were 37.5 visits for women versus 19.2 for men.
About 12% of persons with diabetes have had a diabetes- related emergency room visit (CDC, 1997b).
In 1993, average physician contacts were 15.9 per 100 persons diagnosed with diabetes (CDC , 1997b).
In a comparison study of costs for one year of medical care, Selby and colleagues (1997) found that managed care expenditures for members with diabetes were 2.4 times higher than for non11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 5
diabetic members.
Of the total costs of medical care ($282.7 million), almost 38% or $1,400 per diabetic patient per year was attributable to treatment of long- term complications of diabetes.
An additional 4% was due to short- term complications of the disease.
The total cost of diabetes in 1997 was estimated at $98.2 billion including direct medical costs and indirect costs due to disability, work loss and premature mortality (CDC, 1999a).
Direct medical costs increased with the number of co- morbidities and complications, the number of physicians providing care, and the use of insulin in disease management.
However, researchers have found that improved glycemic control promotes quality of life, alleviates symptoms, and reduces health care utilization and costs (Selby et al., 1997; Sadur et al., 1999; Testa 
Many economic costs associated with diabetes could be decreased by preventing diabetic complications, controlling co- morbidities, and reducing the number of specialist consultations (Guo, Gibson, Gropper, Oswald, 
Secondary and Tertiary Prevention of Diabetes Complications Patient instruction in self- management techniques and provider adherence to screening guidelines are considered significant factors in preventing diabetes complications.
Treatment or care of diabetics is an individualized process that addresses medical, psychosocial, and lifestyle issues (CDC, 1999b).
Treatment in most cases includes diet, exercise, home blood glucose testing, and in some cases, oral medication and/or insulin, with approximately 40% of individuals with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin injections at some point in their lives (CDC, 1999a).
According to Healthy People 2010 (CDC, 2000), there is inadequate access to proper diabetes prevention and control programs for many ethnic groups and low- income persons at high risk for diabetes complications.
In addition, Schiff and associates (1998) report that diabetics with problems accessing care have inadequate diabetes management.
For the two- thirds of diabetics who are actually diagnosed (CDC, 1999a), treatment is often symptomatically focused, unplanned and episodic.
Preventive measures addressing diabetes complications are often overlooked.
Physicians who see more than the average number of patients per unit of time tend to have lower rates of screening (Streja 
Research indicates possible reasons for this phenomenon may be: unawareness of primary care providers of preventive guidelines; existence of barriers to available specialists (Grundel, Caucasian, 
In contrast to these lower rates in screening for diabetes, Miller and associates (2000) evaluated process measures of 121 patients with type 2 diabetes.
Their findings demonstrated that endocrinologists yielded glycemic control levels comparable with those of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group.
In the context of routine specialists' practices, achieving good control of glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels required complex treatment regimens.
Glycemic outcomes were enforced through multiple contacts, including physician appointments, nurse practitioner visits, dietitian visits and telephone calls.
Harris and associates (1999) found differences in blood glucose control among three ethnic groups.
Blood glucose self- monitoring was less common in Mexican Americans, but most patients in all groups had never self- monitored.
Poor glycemic control (HbA1c 
common in African American women (50%) and Mexican American men (45%) compared with the other groups (35- 38%), but HbA1c levels for both sexes and for all three groups were elevated, indicating poor glycemic control.
There was no relationship of glycemic control to socioeconomic status, or access to medical care in any ethnic group.
However, Glasgow and associates (1997) have found that less education, lower income, older age, being female and being a Medicare/Medicaid recipie nt were related to lower quality of life among diabetics.
Performance Measures for Diabetes Care A number of national organizations, such as NCQA, ADA and American Medical Accreditation Program (AMAP), have developed performance measures for adult diabetes.
It is important to note, however, that performance measures developed by different organizations often have different purposes.
For example, HEDIS measures are intended to enable comparisons of managed health care plans by consumers and purchasers (NCQA, 2000).
Physician performance measures were developed by PMCC, a collaboration among AMAP, NCQA, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
The primary purpose of the PMCC Adult Diabetes performance measures is to encourage improved patient care by comparing physician performance with established clinical recommendations (PMCC, 2000).
Physician performance measures are not intended as clinical guidelines, but rather as tools to provide physicians with opportunities for improving patient care.
PMCC adult diabetes physician performance measures and required data elements are comparable with performance measures developed by NCQA, the Diabetes Quality Improvement Project (DQIP) (ADA, 1998), and by the American Diabetes Associatio n (ADA, 1998).
The measures include: HbA1c testing; monitoring for nephropathy, retinopathy, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and lower extremity changes; instruction in patient selfmanagement techniques; and patient satisfaction.
ADA (1998) screening recommendations for diabetes micro and macrovascular complications include the following: Â· Test for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin performed one to two times a year for patients with histories of stable glycemic control and quarterly for those with poor control or treatment changes Â· Â· Â· Â· Eye examination for retinopathy performed once a year Lipid control measured annually Nephropathy screening performed once a year Feet examined at each regular visit for the presence of neuropathy
Screening recommendations provided by ADA (1998) have been developed from an extensive body of research.
For example, The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) Group (1993), the UKPDS Group (1998), the Stockholm Intervention Study (PyÃ¶rÃ¤lÃ¤ et al., 1997) and the Kumamoto Study (Ohkubo et al., 1995) have shown that intensive diabetes therapy can significantly reduce the risk of the development of microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes.
The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) Group (1993), also demonstrated that effective blood glucose control may delay the onset and progression of diabetes related complications by as much as 70%.
For every 1% decrease in HbA1c value there was a 40% to 50% reduction of microvascular risk for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; Aubert et al., 1998; Clark, 1998).
11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 7
There is substantial evidence that diabetes care interventions can significantly affect patient outcomes and complications (Vijan, Stevens, Herman, Funnell, 
Hofer et al., reports that the approach of generating physician profiles (averaging case- mix- adjusted patient measures within each physician's panel) is either widely practiced or attempted in many health care systems (Hofer et al., 1999).
Secondary and Tertiary Prevention in Managed Care The ADA partnered with the American Association of Health Plans in sponsoring a program called Taking On Diabetes (Peters, Legorreta, Ossorio 
This program has set specific goals for reducing the incidence of irreversible vision loss, foot amputations, and foot ulcers, risk of cardiovascular disease, and the development of end- stage renal disease.
These goals aim at the establishment of community partnerships, work site education programs, identification, dissemination and promotion of best practices and promotion of diabetes screening programs.
In 1998, the TDC formed the Managed Care Work Group to establish minimum standards of care and outcome measures for Texans with diabetes.
A cost- benefit analysis determined that in two years, savings resulting from decreased health care costs could recover the cost of operating the work group (TDC, 1999b).
The output of the work group was the Minimum Standards for Diabetes Care under Managed Care in Texas (TDC, 1998a).
In 1998, Texas Health and Human Services Commission (THHSC) initiated a Texas Medicaid Managed Care diabetes pilot program to foster implementation of the standards and to improve quality of care.
The pilot was initiated in Bexar County and is expected to conclude its evaluation in December 2001 (THHSC, 1998; 1999).
Petitti and her colleagues (2000) reported on a long- term management and clinical monitoring study of managed care diabetic patients in Kaiser Permane nte Southern California between the years 1994- 1997.
In this study, process improvements increased utilization of laboratory services and prescriptions but did not have an immediate impact in terms of lower hospitalizations.
A similar ten year case control study was conducted by Brown, Nichols, and Glauber (2000) of diabetics enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northwest.
Substantial improvements in the process and outcomes of care were seen in decreased mortality and co- morbidities, with an increase in good glycemic control and screening for complications.
Multidisciplinary Care Management in Secondary and Tertiary Prevention The Michigan Diabetes Control Program's Upper Peninsula Diabetes Outreach Network established a diabetes care and education program with hospitals , health departments and home care agencies.
Participants in the program experienced a 45% lower rate of hospitalizations, a 31% lower rate of lower- extremity amputations, and a 27% lower death rate.
This program has been replicated in five new outreach networks throughout the state (CDC, 1999b).
Similar to previous research (O'Connor et al., 1996; Peters 
Post- intervention data compared to control group showed a significant improvement in glycemic control, improved diabetes self- care practices and lower rates of hospitalization and 11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 8
outpatient services utilization.
Other studies have shown multidisciplinary teams to be effective in lowering HbA1c levels and in decreasing the risk of limb amputation (Aubert et al., 1998; Sadur et al., 1999).
Sherbourn and associates (1992) discovered that social support contributed to successful diabetes self management.
In a study addressing familial support in diabetes management, Fisher and associates (2000) recruited Hispanics and Caucasians from three managed care settings.
Ethnic differences were found in the relationship between family characteristics and diabetes management.
For Caucasians with type 2 diabetes, family coherence was negatively associated with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.
For Hispanic diabetics, family cohesiveness was associated with good diet and exercise.
The authors concluded that multiple independent dimensions of a family provide multiple targets for intervention.
Summary In summary, epidemiological research has demonstrated that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. population is both multifaceted and complex.
Over the past five years, strategies for treating type 2 diabetes have offered new options for achieving diabetes control (Ratner, 2000) and an increase in good glycemic control and screening for complications has been demonstrated in the managed care setting (O'Connor et al., 1996).
Screening for diabetes complications and treatment of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes is also increasing in primary care (Harris, 2000).
However, Medicaid managed care continues to be a relatively untested model of delivery for individuals with type 2 diabetes (Bureau of Tenn Care, 1997; Lyons 
It is believed that Medicaid managed care, as in other managed care settings, has the potential for stemming the growth of expenditures while providing coverage to low- income individuals with type 2 diabetes (Harris, 2000).
PURPOSE The SFY 2000 Medicaid Managed Care STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study was developed to assess the performance of the three STAR+PLUS plans in treating type 2 diabetes, using a set of diabetes care performance and outcome measures, including the rate of monitoring for glucose control and screening for diabetes complications in the adult STAR+PLUS population.
Additionally, the study addresses other issues related to the care and treatment of type 2 diabetes in this population.

Performance Measures Performance measures that were documented from medical records for glucose screening, glucose control management plan, lipid panel, retinopathy screening, nephropathy screening, foot examination and diabetes education, were reported in this study.
The following criteria that defined documentation of process indicators were used in data abstraction, statistical analysis and interpretation.
A multidisciplinary panel, convened by THQA, reviewed existing guidelines and performance indicators and selected a set of performance measures for monitoring the documented quality of health care of Medicaid diabetes in Texas.
These measures are presented in Table 1.

Random Sample of Eligible Population Using eligibility criteria, a sample of 1429 eligible members were identified from administrative data files.
From this sample of eligible members, a random sample of 110 members per plan was drawn to obtain a 95 percent confidence interval, a 10% margin of error, and a 10% over sample (assuming a 0.5 probability of occurrences for measures).
Demographic characteristics of the random sample and by STAR+PLUS plans are presented in Table 2.
Data Collection THQA utilized the Med QuestTM data entry software package for medical records abstraction.
Based on the focused study's specifications for diabetes in adults, THQA prepared an audit tool and help screens for the abstraction of the data elements (refer to Appendix II).
The audit tool was tested by THQA on 10 records.
Abstractors were trained in the use of the tool prior to receiving medical records.
Any inter- abstractor problems identified during the pre- test abstraction were corrected.
Finally, THQA created links between administrative data and medical records data in order to upload needed information.
Medical Records Request and Receipt The record request was based on the provider assigned for the last enrollment segment of the member.
One medical records request was sent to each provider using the following procedures: Â· STAR+PLUS plans' providers were identified through NHIC Master Provider File.
Â· Â· Â· Â· THQA generated a by- provider request for records.
THQA sent medical request letters to the providers, return receipt requested.
TDHS and the plans were notified of the lists of records requested.
THQA assigned contact persons to facilitate and clarify questions regarding the request.
THQA developed a tracking system for monitoring the receipt of the records and sending reminders to the providers.
Of the 330 medical records requested, only 195 were received for all three plans: Americaid (N=56), HMO Blue (N=63), and MSCH- ACCESS (N=76).

Medical Records Data Abstraction To evaluate the accuracy of record abstraction, THQA applied an Internal Quality Control (IQC) process.
Specifically, a second abstractor re- abstracted a case that was part of a 3- 5% random sample of records for each focused study.
The IQC function matched the two selected sets of data (abstracted and re- abstracted) from a single medical record and displayed the results side by side on the computer screen.
The IQC program identified discrepancies, calculated rate of agreement for each record and produced a report for the study.
Accuracy problems identified were corrected and additional training for abstraction was provided as needed.
Medical Records Confidentiality and Security In accordance with state and federal law, THQA has adopted a policy to safeguard patients' confidential health care information.
THQA has developed and implemented procedures to protect the confidentiality and security of all medical records received and stored by THQA.
Medical records are under the direct supervision of a Registered Records Administrator who incorporates the principles of health information management.
In order to maintain confidentiality, data do not identify STAR+PLUS enrollees by name or social security number, or any other unique identifier.
Statistical Analysis The major unit of analysis was the individual managed care plan.
Four phases of analysis were performed to examine the association of performance measures by STAR+PLUS plans.
Â· Â· The first phase of statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics to describe demographic characteristics of the obtained sample and the eligible population.
Next, by statistically comparing both samples in terms of all available demographic and enrollment characteristics, the degree to how representative the obtained sample was to the population being studied could be determined.
The second phase of analysis, categorical statistical techniques, were used to compare managed care plans on demographic/enrollment characteristics and performance measures.
Given research findings of differences in performance measurers by ethnicity, age and gender (Harris, Eastman, Cowie, Flegal, 
Logistic regressions were used to calculate odds ratios for assessing the likelihood of selected process and outcome measures.
Â·
Â·
Â·
Analyses were performed with the statistical packages SPSSTM and LogXactTM.
Frequency rates were used to describe sample populations.
Chi- square tests were used to test for differences in proportions.
Logistic regression was used to explore relationships between demographic and enrollment variables and performance measures.

RESULTS Demographic Characteristics of Obtained Sample of Eligible Members Specific calculations of frequency distribution rates by total obtained sample and by managed care plans are presented in Table 2.
Of the total obtaine d sample of 195 members, 39% were enrolled in MSCH- ACCESS, 28.7% in Americaid and 32.3 % in HMO Blue STAR+PLUS.
Frequency distribution rates of demographic characteristics of the obtained sample and the three STAR+PLUS plans (Americaid, HMO Blue STAR+PLUS and MSCH- ACCESS) are presented in Table 2.
Demographic characteristics across the three plans were similar indicating a sample primarily female (69.74%), and members who were 50 years or older.
The mean age for the total sample was 50.74 (SD 9.75, range 21 to 62) with similar means noted across plans: Americaid (mean age 51.05, SD 10.4, range 22 to 62), HMO Blue STAR+PLUS (mean age 50.83, SD 9.66, range 24 to 62) and MSCH- ACCESS (mean age 50.43, SD 9.46, range 21 to 62).
The total obtained sample of members was predominantly African Americans (49.74%) followed by Caucasians (21.54%), Hispanics (17.44%), Asians (2.56%), and unknown groups (8.21%).
The breakdown was similar for all three plans.
There were more women than men in the total sample and in each plan sample.
Comparison of the total obtained sample's mean age by ethnicity and gender indicates that by ethnicity and sex, men were younger (mean 47.38, SD 10.32) in the Caucasian group while females were younger (mean 44, SD 21.21) in the Asian American group.
Hispanic females were older (55.78, SD5.22) compared to all other groups.
Chi- square tests of observed versus expected frequencies revealed that there were no significant demographic differences between the obtained sample and the population of eligible members on the variables ethnicity and sex, but that there was a significant difference in the proportion of obtained sample to the population of eligible members, ?2 (1, N = 1429) = 5.2073, p

Performance Measures for Diabetes In this section, frequencies and calculated diabetes performance measures are reported for the obtained sample and for each plan.
These are presented in Table 3.
For each performance measure, statistical analyses were performed to determine any differences between rates of managed care plans or demographic groups.
If rate differences were detected by managed care plans, those clinical indicator rates are described.
Glucose Control More than half (52.8%) of sampled members had documented HbA1c test results during the oneyear study period.
Of these members, 32% had HbA1c results 
A documented management plan was identified for almost half (45.5%) of those members with HbA1c test results

DISCUSSION One of the most critical questions in sampling medical records for any clinical focused study is whether the obtained sample is representative of the population being studied.
After excluding members not meeting study criteria and non response to record requests by a provider, the sample of members appears to be representative of the eligible population.
In other words, the results of this study can be generalized to the Medicaid STAR+PLUS population as a whole.
Overall, the results of this focused study of a representative sample of STAR+PLUS adult members with type 2 diabetes indicate that documented performance measures were low.
Documented rates did not achieve TDC minimum standards for glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid 11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 18
profile, retinopathy examinations or nephropathy screening (TDC, 1998).
Only half (52%) of sampled members had documented glycosylated hemoglobin during the one- year study period.
Glycosylated hemoglobin testing rates were similar to reported research (44%, 53%) (ADA,1999; Miller et al., 2000) and within the range reported by CDC (33%- 81%) (CDC, 1999).
Only a small proportion of members had documentation of having received retinopathy screening, nephropathy screening, foot examinations, or educational interventions.
Rates for retinopathy screening were lower than those reported (23% - 83%) by CDC (1999) and the NCQA (1999) (40.9%).
Foot examination documented rates were lower than the CDC reported rate of 55 percent.
In comparison to SFY 1999, performance rates remained similar (THQA, 1999).
The results of this study also indicate that STAR+PLUS members who were under the age of fifty were more likely to have poor glucose control than members over the age of fifty.
The principal risk factors for microvascular diabetes complications are related to the degree and duration of hyperglycemia.
Given the risk factor profile of poor glucose control, microvascular complications may be more likely in the under age 50 group.
The most common pattern of dyslipidemia in adults with type 2 diabetes is elevated triglyceride levels and decreased HDL cholesterol levels (Haffner, 1998).
Men were at a higher risk of macrovascular complications given their likelihood of having triglycerides 
In summary, the documented rates (AMAP, 1999) of performance measures surrounding screening for diabetes complications and management of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia were low.
There are several reasons why the rates found in this study are lower than the literature suggests: patient self- care practices, differences in physician medical care practices, lack of access to all documented medical records in the initial study design, and incomplete documentation of services provided to diabetics.
Implications for Quality Improvement The Diabetes Quality Improvement Project sponsored by many organizations involved with diabetes was designed to increase the level of care provided to individuals with diabetes and to improve the accountability of health care systems (ADA, 1998).
The needs and opportunities for quality improvement in the diabetes care process is a complex endeavor (Clark, 1998).
At present, 16 million Americans have this disease.
The number of people with diabetes will likely increase to 50 million, leading the CDC (CDC, 1999a) to declare an epidemic.
A conservative estimate puts diabetes- related costs in the US at close to a trillion dollars by 2030.
These costs do not take into account the negative impact on quality of life as well as time lost at work.
Practice recommendations have improved diabetes care in general practices, but a wider more comprehensive approach to quality management may be necessary to enhance diabetes care in Medicaid managed care organizations.
For example, O'Connor and associates (1996) found that a continuous quality improvement initiative in the clinic of a health maintenance organization lowered hemoglobin A1c values.
Given the lack of a trend in the significant differences between plans, strategies for a more concentrated and structured management approach may be beneficial.
Implications for Clinical Practice Physician practice behaviors and settings are influential in determining health outcomes in diabetes (Deichmann, Castello, Horswell 
More than 90% of managed care contracts use the primary care provider as the "gatekeeper" of care (Grundel, White 
1999).
However, research has indicated that physicians who see more than the average number of patients per unit of time tend to have lower rates of testing for HDL cholesterol and proteinuria, as well as, lower rates of referrals for ophthalmic examination (Streja, 
In this study, as in previous research (Wasson et al., 1992), low indicator rates may indicate the need for co- involvement of a health care team.
Clinical trials have demonstrated that health care systems utilizing nurses and other non- physician personnel such as case managers and those with telephone based contact, are effective in improving glycemic control, blood pressure and lipid levels (Aubert et al., 1998, O'Connor et al, 1996; Peters, 
Availability of social support, such as that provided by nurse case managers, appears to be a major factor that contributes to adherence by diabetic patients to such behaviors as following a diet, weight loss, taking prescribed medications, checking blood glucose and foot examinations (Aubert et al., 1998; Sherbourne, Hays, Ordway, DiMatteo, 
Implications for Future Research Research has demonstrated that reducing the HbA1c of individuals with type 2 diabetes results in benefits in microvascular and neuropathy similar to those that have been convincingly demonstrated in type 1 diabetes (ADA, 1998; Clark, 1998).
Reduction of macrovascular events requires not only the treatment of hyperglycemia (Steiner, 1999), but also treatment of all cardiovascular risk factors and abnormalities seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
Only a comprehensive approach to type 2 diabetes is likely to significantly reduce the microvascular and macrovascular morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.
Microvascular disease and its risk factors are often already present upon diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (Donahue, 
Patient instruction for type 2 diabetes is an ongoing process of self- management techniques.
Performance measures are a significant factor in monitoring diabetes and prevention of complications, and require evaluation across time among managed care organizations.
Given the limitations of sample size, possible selection bias, reliance on chart reviews of process of care and a limited study period, THQA recommends a carry- over of current data samples for secondary analysis and for comparisons across managed care plans that involves analysis of performance measures with metabolic outcomes and number of physician visits.
To capture performance measures in documentation, similar to Miller and associates' (2000) research, additional documentation or mixed methods that further reflect performance may need to be utilized.
Clinical trial evidence indicates that improvements in patient outcomes will occur in time if attention is given to the control of hyperglycemia, blood pressure and the early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy (Ho, Marger, Beart, Yip, 
A number of studies have shown a direct relationship between hyperglycemia, as measured by HbA1c levels and retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy (DCCT, 1993; Klein, 1995).
For Medicaid STAR+PLUS members, future studies should continue to address HbA1c testing frequency, HbA1c absolute values, number of office visits, patient and provider characteristics related to performance measures, and patient outcomes in terms of metabolic measures.
Study Limitations This study was limited to a one- year period.
A crucial concern in observational studies of this nature is the inability to ascribe directionality and causation.
Understanding the process of care for type 2 diabetes requires long- term observation.
Reviewing a process of care that utilized dissimilar methods of implementation across three managed care plans limited generalizations 11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 20
across plans.
Also, exclusion of medical records without complete data introduced potential selection bias.
Small sample sizes decreased statistical power and reduced the accuracy of obtained indicator rates for each STAR+PLUS plan.
Methods utilized to deliver care to members were unknown, whether the delivery care process was similar or dissimilar between members is unknown.
Important variables that could potentially influence HbA1c were not available as measures, such as, ave rage HbA1c levels, height and weight, blood pressure, age of onset or duration of diabetes, documentation of neither hypoglycemia, nor co- morbidity information and extent of treatment measures.
Data limitations also prevented description of resource utilization.
Further study limitations include reliance on chart reviews for documentation of performance measures as well as limited period of review that may not reflect actual process of care for a long- term chronic illness.
Finally, the obtained sample size for this study limits the confidence in the clinical performance measures.
The margins of error for plan rates are rather large.
To address this issue, a larger, initial sample size per plan might be required or at least a larger over- sampling will address the problem of limited statistical power due to small sample size per plan.
CONCLUSIONS Given that adherence to diabetes guidelines is a new area of research, it is worthwhile to consider the strengths and limitations of the research method employed, as well as challenges for future investigations.
Screening for diabetic complications is one of the most important areas for quality improvement in primary care.
One overall strength of this study was that rates for performance measures could be compared to previous THQA studies and national studies.
Generally the results of this study were similar to those reported in the THQA focused study of Medicaid Managed Care during SFY 1999.
Performance measures for Texas Medicaid Managed Care were either in line or lower than national studies (CDC, 1999).
Further, the representative sample of Medicaid members with diabetes informed practice by revealing two high- risk cohorts, males and those under age 50, within a sample of managed care plan members already at high risk for complications.
Assessments such as these have been found to improve the level of care for management of type 2 diabetes (Glasgow, Boles, Calder, Dreyer 
Medical records are likely superior sources for clinical technical information and values on laboratory tests (Glasgow et al., 1999) and generally do not contain detailed informatio n about counseling or other prevention strategies (Strange, et al., 1998).
As such, precise assessment of some diabetes performance measures may not be possible as in the case of educational interventions.
However, metabolic measures have been shown to measure the quality of diabetes care among a known population of people with diabetes (Petitti et al., 2000).
A managed care organization can measure improvements in care and services over time by utilizing metabolic measures such as glycosylated hemoglobin (Glasgow et al., 1997).
Secondary analysis to expand preliminary data on diabetes is recommended.
Continual observance of these performance measures is prudent and worthwhile.
A secondary analysis would complement the primary study by describing the extent to which metabolic measures are met by type of provider (DiMatteo et al., 1993; Hofer et al., 1999).
Further, comparison of glycosylated hemoglobin values to previous research may generate overall economic impact of poor glucose control in this Medicaid managed care population (Sadur et al., 1999; Selby et al., 11/10/00 STAR+PLUS Diabetes Focused Study Final Technical Report Page 21
1997).
This area of research by THQA will continue to add to the body of research being conducted with the Texas Medicaid population with type 2 diabetes.
Currently, there is an ongoing Medicaid Managed Care Pilot Program that is examining the efficacy of case managers in comprehensive diabetes management (THHSC, 1998).
Overall, the data collection procedures for an initial investigation were satisfactory and allow a meaningful description of each plan's performance.
These methods could be improved with a larger sample size.
Particular needs for future research are studies that compare and contrast results for the same subjects collected over time via different methods (medical record review vs. patient report vs. provider recall vs. direct observation).
Multimethod studies can inform areas where inexpensive procedures such as surveys can be used and where expensive methods such as direct observation may be required to obtain valid information (Von Korff, Gruman, Schaefer, Curry 
While few representative studies have been conducted of the quality and level of care provided to persons with diabetes in Medicaid managed care, low performance of even basic management and preventive services is commonly reported (Marrero, 1994).
The results of this study are not so much discouraging as they are indicative of the treatment of diabetes with this population.
Although prospective research may be difficult given the characteristics of Medicaid populations, the metabolic outcome measure of glycosylated hemoglobin will provide a way to measure care process (Brown et al., 2000; Petitti et al., 2000).
Continuous quality improvement research has demonstrated improvements in process and outcomes of care for diabetics in managed care settings (O'Connor et al., 1996).
This study has identified areas for future studies and various performance initiatives.
