Executive Summary Office of Children and Family Services Child Day Care Planning Under Welfare Reform Scope of Audit Effective August 20, 1997, the newly created Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) assumed responsibility for administering the State's child welfare programs, including day care.
The former Department of Social Services (Department) had been responsible for these programs.
OCFS's Bureau of Early Childhood Services (Bureau) is responsible for overseeing the provision of all regulated child day care services in the State to ensure that day care is provided in secure and healthy environments.
In August 1996, the Federal government enacted welfare reforms that establish various work participation requirements for two parent families with children and single parent families with children.
States which fail to achieve the participation rate for a particular year could be subject to a Federal sanction of 5 percent of their TANF Block Grant amount.
The success of welfare reform is dependent on placing persons in work activities.
The availability of day care is an integral factor in enabling work activity placement.
Therefore, the absence of sufficient day care would reduce a person's chances for finding employment.
The cumulative effect of such a lack of day care will impact the State's ability to successfully implement welfare reform and to obtain the intended benefits.
Our audit addressed the following question relating to OCFS's child day care planning under welfare reform for the period January 1, 1996 through January 31, 1998: ! Has OCFS done adequate planning to ensure sufficient day care will be available for recipients entering work activities as a result of welfare reform?
Audit Observations and Conclusions
OCFS needs to improve its planning to ensure sufficient day care will be available for recipients entering work activities.
OCFS has taken steps to contact local social services districts (districts) and the various child care resource and referral agencies to initiate collaborative planning.
However, it has not developed an adequate method to estimate the number and location of children who will need day care under welfare reform.
As a result, OCFS could be at risk of not having a sufficient supply of day care in the locations needed.
Advance planning is needed for OCFS to coordinate the resources to ensure adequate day care is available in the areas of most need.
Our audit showed that OCFS was delayed in its planning efforts related to day care.
Part of this delay can be attributed to the passage of the Federal and State welfare reform acts: the Federal legislation was vague in certain respects and the State's legislation was not passed until August 1997.
Nevertheless, as early as 1994, copies of the proposed legislation were distributed to state welfare departments for review and comment.
However, the Bureau did not begin regional planning sessions until April 1997.
As of January 31, 1998, OCFS had not identified the number and location of children who would need day care under welfare reform.
(See pp. 5-7) We found that OCFS officials have taken steps to contact local districts concerning certain aspects of the State's day care system.
However, OCFS did not seek input from the districts in determining the statewide need for day care.
We believe that input from the districts is important in developing meaningful estimates of the State's day care needs.
We sent a questionnaire to the districts to determine whether they had estimated their day care needs.
Of 58 districts surveyed, 32 districts either did not respond to our survey or their responses contained insufficient data for our analysis.
OCFS needs to address this situation to ensure that the districts are able to provide appropriate input in the determination of needed day care.
(See pp. 7-8) Our analysis of available data indicates that 108,758 additional children will need day care over the four year period ending September 30, 2001 to accommodate welfare reform.
Therefore, an adequate system to plan for and develop the necessary supply of day care is needed.
In addition, such a system must include a monitoring function to identify differences between the estimates and actual needs as welfare reform is implemented over the coming years.
(See pp. 8-10)
Response of OCFS Officials
OCFS officials disagree with the methodology we used to estimate the number of children needing day care during the five year period ending September 30, 2001.

State Comtproller's Notes
Introduction Background During a portion of the period covered by our audit, the Department of Social Services (Department) was responsible for administering the State's child w elfare programs.
Effective August 20, 1997, the newly created Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) assumed responsibility for these programs, including day care.
OCFS's Bureau of Early Childhood Services (Bureau) is responsible for overseeing the provision of all regulated child day care services in the State to ensure that day care is provided in secure and healthy environments.
The Office oversees the State's 58 local social services districts (districts), including the Human Resource Administration (HRA) of New York City that are responsible for administering the State's public assistance programs.
Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (CCRR) aid the Office and the districts in the administration of the State's day care programs.
Inherent in these activities is the identification of the number and location of children who will require day care under welfare reform.
In New York State both regulated and legally exempt (informal) day care exist.
Informal day care providers operate less than three hours per day or care for fewer than three children or care for children related to the provider.
All other providers must be registered or licensed.
According to OCFS, as of July 1997, there were more than 22,500 formal child day care providers statewide, with a capacity to serve 400,000 children ages six weeks through 12 years.
Regulated (formal) day care providers include: ! family day care homes, serving from 3 to 6 children plus two additional school age children when they are not in school, school-age child care providers, caring for school age children less than 13 years old at a permanent site before or after school, group family day care homes, serving from 7 to 12 children in a home environment, and child day care centers, caring for seven or more children outside a home environment.
!
!
!
In August 1996, the Federal government enacted welfare reforms that eliminated open-ended entitlement funding of the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program and replaced it with a block grant to the states.
AFDC's replacement, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, includes a five-year lifetime limit on cash benefits.
Welfare reform establishes various work participation requirements.
For single parent families, the work participation rate was 25 percent for the year ended September 30, 1997 and increases 5 percent a year until reaching 50 percent for the year ending September 30, 2002 and beyond.
The legislation grants states a credit to this rate based on reductions in their caseload since 1994.
According to OCFS, with this credit, New York State's participation rate for the year ended September 30, 1997 was 19.3 percent.
States which fail to achieve the participation rate for a particular year could be subject to a Federal sanction of 5 percent of their TANF Block Grant amount.
The New York State Legislature implemented the requirements of the Federal Welfare Reform Act through legislation passed in August 1997.
The success of welfare reform is dependent on placing persons in work activities.
The work requirements are intended to help recipients become self-sufficient by allowing them to transition into long-term, full-time employment.
Based on the level of income the recipients receive from their employment, the recipients may still qualify for reduced TANF benefits.
The availability of day care is an integral factor in enabling work activity placement.
Therefore, the absence of sufficient day care would reduce a person's chances for finding employment.
The cumulative effect of such a lack of day care will impact the State's ability to successfully implement welfare reform and to obtain the intended benefits.
There are exemptions from work participation requirements.
For example, an exemption exists for parents of severely disabled children or parents who themselves are disabled.
Also, at the time of our audit, local districts were required to give TANF recipients at least two choices of formal child care providers who are accessible, available and willing to accept the amount and type of payment offered by the local districts.
(Subsequent to the passage of New York State's welfare reform legislation, TANF recipients must attempt to locate day care, and if unsuccessful, the local district must provide referrals to at least two providers, one of which must be regulated.)
Local districts cannot reduce or end public assistance payments to recipients for their failing to participate in work activities due to a lack of child care.

Audit Scope, Objective and Methodology
We audited activities related to child day care planning under welfare reform for the period January 1, 1996 through January 31, 1998.
The objective of our performance audit was to determine whether OCFS has done adequate planning to ensure sufficient day care will be available for recipients entering work activities as a result of welfare reform.
To accomplish our objective, we interviewed OCFS officials, assessed Bureau procedures and regulations, reviewed Bureau planning efforts, and sent questionnaires to the local districts to determine their planning efforts related to day care.
We also used OCFS's Welfare Management System (WMS) to develop a methodology for estimating the number and location of children who would need day care under the Federal and State welfare reform laws.
WMS is OCFS's database of information related to recipients of the State's welfare and social services programs.
We did not independently verify the data on the WMS or the day care data provided by the local districts.
However, OCFS officials provided us with evidence that they routinely test the reliability of WMS data.
These tests document that WMS data is reasonably accurate.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Such standards require that we plan and perform our audit to adequately assess those operations which are included within our audit scope.
Further, these standards require that we understand the internal controls and compliance with those laws, rules and regulations that are relevant to our audit scope.
An audit includes examining, on test basis, evidence supporting transactions recorded in the accounting and operating records and applying such other auditing procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
An audit also includes assessing the estimates, judgments and decisions made by management.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our findings, conclusions and recommendations.
We use a risk-based audit approach when selecting activities to be audited.
This approach focuses our audit efforts on those operations that have been identified through a preliminary survey as having the greatest possibility for needing improvement.
Consequently, by design, finite audit resources are used to identify where and how improvements can be made.
Thus, little audit effort is devoted to reviewing operations that may be relatively efficient and effective.
As a result, our audit reports are prepared on an "exception basis."
This report, therefore, highlights those areas needing improvement and does not address activities that may be functioning properly.

Response of OCFS Officials to Audit
Draft copies of this report were provided to OCFS officials for their review and comment.
Their comments have been considered in preparing this report and are included as Appendix B. Within 90 days after final release of this report, as required by Section 170 of the Executive Law, the Commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services shall report to the Governor, the State Comptroller and the leaders of the Legislature and fiscal committees, advising what steps were taken to implement the recommendations contained herein, and where recommendations were not implemented, the reasons therefor.

Availability of Day Care To successfully implement the requirements of welfare reform, the State needs to have sufficient day care available in the geographic areas of most need to improve a person's chances for employment.
As the State implements the welfare reform legislation and is required to move larger percentages of its public assistance caseload into work related activities, greater numbers of welfare recipients are likely to need child day care.
Therefore, OCFS must have a plan in place that identifies the number and location of children who will need day care as the State proceeds through each year of Federal welfare reform.
Advance planning is needed for OCFS to coordinate the resources to ensure adequate day care is available in the areas of most need, since a certain degree of lead time is necessary to create new day care.
We believe proper planning should include certain elements.
For example, planning should include development of demographic information from OCFS's WMS, to identify the number and location of needed day care.
OCFS should consult with local districts and the child care resource and referral agencies to confirm the accuracy of the WMS analysis and to get their input on expected child day care needs.
This collaborative effort would help produce a meaningful estimate of the State's day care needs resulting from welfare reform.
Ongoing monitoring of the development of day care is important to ensure that fluctuations in actual demands are being met and that if not, modifications are adequately planned for.
Although OCFS has taken steps to contact local districts concerning certain aspects of the State's day care system, OCFS did not obtain input from these districts to determine the number and location of children who will need day care.
While OCFS provided us with its estimate of day care needs for the year ended September 30, 1997, OCFS has not done long range planning through September 30, 2001.
Further, the estimates provided by OCFS for the year ended September 30, 1997 did not give details concerning the geographic location where the day care was needed.
In addition, OCFS did not seek input from the districts in determining the statewide need.
We believe the local districts can provide valuable input.
Our analysis of available WMS data indicates that OCFS's first year estimate of child day care needs was understated by over 51,000 children.
Further, our analysis suggests that as many as 108,758 additional children will need day care over the four year period ending September 30, 2001.
An adequate system to plan for and develop the necessary day care supply

is needed.
Such a system must include a monitoring function to identify differences between the estimates and actual needs as the implementation of welfare reform progresses.
Day Care Planning
We found that OCFS was delayed in its planning efforts related to child day care.
Part of this delay can be attributed to the passage of the Federal and State welfare reform acts: the Federal legislation was vague in certain respects and the State's legislation was not passed until August 1997.
Some of the delay in planning may have been unavoidable because the Federal legislation did not fully define the terms of the program's requirements.
For example, the gross work participation rate in the first year was 25 percent, and the states will receive a reduction to this rate requirement for prior years' successes in reducing their public assistance caseload.
Further, the legislation does not define how this rate reduction will be precisely determined, nor fully define the activities that will count toward work participation activities.
While the vagueness of the Federal legislation could have hampered the development of precise estimates of the participation rate and resulting day care needs, the planning process should have been initiated on a statewide and local district level shortly after the passing of the Federal legislation in August 1996.
If this had been done, adjustments needed to reflect changes resulting from the Federal and State legislation could have been incorporated to the planning process and revision made to the original estimate of the number and location of children who will need day care.
The concept of welfare reform has been in the forefront of discussion for many years.
As early as 1994, copies of the proposed legislation were distributed to state welfare departments for review and comment.
However, regional planning sessions by the Bureau did not begin until April 1997.
Because the provision of day care in the State is overseen by OCFS and implemented by the local districts, we sent a questionnaire to the local districts to determine whether they had estimated their day care needs.
Of 58 local districts surveyed, 32 districts either did not respond to our survey, or their responses contained insufficient data for our analysis.
OCFS needs to address this situation to ensure that the local districts are able to provide appropriate input in the determination of the number and location of children needing day care.
6
Twenty-six local districts provided sufficient data for analysis, including an estimate of children needing day care for the year ended September 30, 1997 and a description of their planning process (e.g., TANF caseload analysis, WMS demographics, local district data bases, and discussions with child care resource and referral agencies, local departments of labor, job training units, school districts and Head Start Programs).
These 26 local districts reported that an additional 6,408 children would need day care for the first year of welfare reform ended September 30, 1997.
Because there is no data for the remaining 32 local districts, which include New York City, we conclude that OCFS needs to work together with the local districts and other appropriate agencies to develop a method for determining the number and location of children who will need day care.
During our audit, OCFS officials told us that during 1997 they had begun regional sessions that brought together district commissioners and child care resource referral agency representatives for planning purposes.
The purpose of these meetings was to discuss plans for the implementation of welfare reform in the districts and to describe the role of the CCRRs in this effort.
These officials also stated that they have worked in conjunction with the CCRRs to expand day care capacity by setting day care development targets which include identifying under served populations and had undertaken several initiatives to strengthen and expand the quality of available day care.
This includes such activities as regulation revision, parent and provider training, informal care development, and development of a computer system to automate and support the regulation of child day care.
While these efforts, if successful, will improve the availability of quality day care, OCFS still needs a method to identify the children and the geographic areas in need of day care.
We also noted that OCFS received funding to subsidize 14,100 additional day care slots for the year ended September 30, 1997.
We asked Bureau officials to explain the basis for the 14,100 estimate.
They indicated that, from past experience, the placement of an individual into work activities resulted in an additional .7 children who would need day care.
Bureau officials indicated that about 19,000 individuals had to be placed into work activities during the year ended September 30, 1997 to meet the State's participation rate of 19.3 percent.
These factors contributed to the estimate of 14,100 children needing day care.
In addition, the State's 1998-99 budget includes $21 million to subsidize payments for 49,000 more children in day care than the pre-welfare reform subsidy program was able to.
7
While we recognize OCFS efforts in planning for future day care needs under welfare reform, we believe that this effort would be buttressed by pro-active determinations of where day care is needed.
Estimated Day Care Need Based on TANF Population
Because OCFS did not have an effective system in place to estimate day care needs under welfare reform, we developed a methodology to estimate this need.
At our request, OCFS officials provided us with a computer tape from the WMS, containing demographic information related to the approximately 725,000 children and 378,000 adult recipients who were receiving public assistance benefits as of July 31, 1997.
We used this data to estimate the number and location of additional children who would need day care through September 30, 2001.
We excluded certain data from our analysis because welfare reform exempts certain TANF recipients from the work activity requirement, as follows: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! a disabled parent or disabled child, a primary caretaker over the age of 60, children age 13 or older, a child currently under the age of one year old and their siblings, ineligible aliens or persons with unknown citizenship, children annotated in the WMS as already in day care, and children only households.
In addition to the exemptions that are provided for by legislation, we excluded two parent households and 4,828 households which had missing dates of birth.
The TANF household population that remained was comprised of single parent households with children between the ages of one and 12 years old.
Children in these households represented those needing day care because their parents had to locate employment or work related activities as a result of welfare reform.
We then sorted this information on a county by county basis.
WMS data showed that there were 339,258 children in households receiving TANF as of July 1997.
According to OCFS, for the first year of welfare reform ended September 30, 1997, the required work participation rate is 19.3 percent.
Using this rate we estimated that 65,477 children (339,258 x .193) needed day care during the year ended
8
September 30, 1997 (See Exhibit 1).
Our estimate for the first year identifies children in those local districts where day care will be needed.
Additionally, while OCFS reported that the State had met the participation rate for the year ended September 30, 1997, OCFS officials could not provide us with data showing the extent that work placements came from the population of TANF cases with children needing day care.
For example, work placements could have come from cases without children such as persons enrolled in the State's Home Relief program.
The success of the State's implementation of welfare reform depends upon enabling employable TANF recipients, including single parents with children, to be placed in work activities.
Current processes provide no assurance that this is happening.
The welfare reform work participation rate increases 5 percent each year starting at 25 percent during the year ended September 30, 1997.
We have estimated the number of additional children who may need day care for each year after reducing the total population of children available by the number of children placed in prior years.
Included in the population of children are those less than a year old and their siblings as they will require child care during this time period.
Our estimates exclude those children who are currently nine years old or older as they will not require day care by 2001.
Also not included or considered for this population are newborn children of TANF households during years two through five of welfare reform (e.g., the years ending September 30, 1998 through September 30, 2001) who will age into child care and new TANF households with children needing care.
Therefore, we believe our methodology results in a conservative estimate of children that will require future day care.
We have estimated the additional child day care needs for the years ending September 30, 1998 through September 30, 2001 as follows: Year End September 30, 1998 1999 2000 2001 Total Children Needing Day Care 50,681 19,358 19,359 19,360 108,758

Exhibits two through five of this report show the details of our computations.
Our estimates are based on data available to us at the time of our audit and based on assumptions we believe are appropriate to reasonably determine the number of children that will require day care as a result of welfare reform.
We believe that OCFS officials could build upon our analysis to formulate their own methodology and estimate day care slots needed as a result of welfare reform.
As the implementation of welfare reform progresses, the estimates used by OCFS need to be monitored to determine their continued relevance.
10
Recommendations 1.
Work in conjunction with formalizing a methodology to all areas throughout the State.
input from the local districts local districts in developing and determine future day care needs in Use the WMS database as well as as part of developing this estimate.
(OCFS officials stated that they regularly consult with local social services districts in addressing child care needs, including regional sessions, invitations to take a direct developmental and oversight role and Project Bridge.
Auditors' Comment: The OCFS's response fails to address the crux of the recommendation, which is development of a method to estimate the number and location of children who will need day care as a result of welfare reform.)
2.
Review the planning process for all local districts and determine the validity and reliability of their planning methodology.
(OCFS officials stated local social services districts were awaiting passage of State law and budget and that it was unreasonable to expect that districts were in a position to develop strategic plans at the time of the audit.
According to OCFS officials, since passage of the State's welfare reform legislation, local districts have been developing local responses to all aspects of Welfare Reform and will formalize the child care portions of their new approaches in the child care section of the Consolidated Services Plan.
Auditors' Comment: The issue of welfare reform has been discussed since 1995.
Integral to these discussions has been the topic of work participation requirements for public assistance recipients.
Although at the time of our audit State welfare reform legislation had not passed, the underpinning for this legislation, the Federal Welfare Reform Act, became law in August 1996.
While the absence of State law may have precluded OCFS from developing specific policies and procedures for implementing welfare reform at the State level, OCFS could have initiated a planning process designed to determine whether sufficient day care existed in each county for the children of those public assistance recipients who would be entering work or work related activities.)
11
Recommendations (continued) 3.
After estimating the need of each local district, initiate the development of day care providers to ensure a sufficient supply of day care exists.
(OCFS officials stated that the ongoing development of day care supply is not driven exclusively by a static needs assessment of local social services districts.
According to the officials, the overall needs of New York's families require an ongoing effort to strengthen the child care market for all families.
OCFS officials further stated that they have and will continue to support an agenda to expand the supply and improve the quality of child care.
Auditors' Comment: We urge OCFS officials to identify the location and number of children who will require child care as part of their efforts to expand the supply and improve the quality of child care.)
4.
Continually monitor and revise as necessary the estimated need for day care as a result of the methodology developed by OCFS and the local districts.
(While disagreeing with the methodology we employed in this audit, OCFS officials concurred that any methodology developed to project need must be updated to reflect new information, trends and data.
Auditors' Comment: We encourage OCFS officials to develop a methodology which projects day care needs in each county of the State and takes account of all relevant information, trends and data.)

State Comptroller's Notes 1.
Contrary to the statement by OCFS officials, we did not add this section to the audit at the midway point of the "licensing audit," timing the expansion to the debate among the Senate, Assembly and Governor's Office concerning the passage of the 1997-98 Budget and Welfare Reform legislation.
We undertook an audit of child day care, a component of which was planning for welfare reform.
However, the Bureau of Early Childhood Services was unable to document its efforts to identify those counties in New York State where children of welfare recipients needed day care.
To provide the time to pursue this matter, we divided our audit into two reports, and issued a separate report on one component titled Monitoring Health and Safety at Child Day Care Providers (96-S-88, issued June 10, 1998).
This report, Child Day Care Planning Under Welfare Reform, covers the second component of the audit.
The issue of welfare reform has been discussed since 1995.
Integral to these discussions has been the topic of work participation requirements for public assistance recipients.
Although at the time of our audit State welfare reform legislation had not passed, the underpinning for this legislation, the Federal Welfare Reform Act, became law in August 1996.
While the absence of State law may have precluded OCFS from developing specific policies and procedures for implementing welfare reform at the State level, OCFS could have initiated a planning process designed to determine whether sufficient day care existed in each county for the children of those public assistance recipients who would be entering work or work related activities.
We have amended the final report to reflect OCFS's comments in response to the draft report.
We disagree with the statements by OCFS officials that our report confuses child day care subsidy counts with child care slot capacity needs and that our report seems to work from the perception that every child day care slot in New York State was in full utilization and, thus, the addition of each child required expansion beyond current licensing capacity.
As we state consistently throughout our report, we attempted to estimate the number and location of children who would need day care under welfare reform.
Additionally, OCFS could not provide us with the data necessary to convert the number of children needing day care into day care slots.
OCFS officials state that the first year of closely resemble the Governor's projection did not include the Governor's projection them for the number they did not provide welfare reform is over and caseload increases far more than the OSC projection.
However, the OCFS officials of day care needs in their response and when we asked it to us.

According to OCFS officials, they met Federal work participation requirements and therefore there were no unmet child care needs related to TANF requirements in Federal fiscal year 1996-97.
This statement is misleading.
New York State has prepared and sent to the Federal government its documentation that it met the work participation requirements.
However, this documentation, which is based on a statistical sampling of public assistance recipients who entered the job market, is subject
Appendix C
to audit and adjustment by the Federal government.
Therefore, until the data is audited and accepted by the Federal government, New York State may not have met Federal work participation requirements.
Additionally, during the course of our audit, OCFS officials could not provide us with data showing the extent to which work placements came from the population of TANF cases with children needing day care, and not, for example, from the population of Home Relief cases.

Throughout the course of their response, OCFS officials disagree with our methodology for estimating the number and location of children who will need day care because of welfare reform.
At several points during the audit, including the exit conference, we explained our methodology and asked for input.
At the same time, we asked OCFS officials to provide us with documentation of their methodology for estimating the number of children needing day care by county.
OCFS officials did not provide us with alternatives to our methodology or the details of their methodology.
The OCFS response accurately states that our methodology for estimating the number and location of children needing day care used work participation rates for years two through five as contained in the Federal welfare reform statute.
These rates increase 5 percent each year from 30 percent in year two to 45 percent in year five.
New York State is eligible to receive a reduction in the work participation rate in the first year, which is 25 percent, subject to downward adjustment based on prior year caseload reductions.
According to OCFS officials, the Federal government will reduce New York State's work participation rate for the first year to 19.3 percent from 25 percent.
Further, according to OCFS officials, similar reductions in work participation rates in years two through five are also warranted.
However, as explained in note 6 above, New York's asserted 19.3 percent work participation rate has not been accepted by the Federal government, and is subject to audit and adjustment.
We believe that our estimate of the number of children needing day care is conservative and less likely to underestimate the number of children needing day care.
According to OCFS officials, continuing caseload reductions have a compounding effect on child care need because each case closing also reduces the number of children on TANF and, as a result, the column labeled "Children Available" on Exhibits 1 through 5 is in question.
We based our analysis on the welfare roles as of July 31, 1997.
We did not consider the effect that caseload reductions would have on our estimates.
In this regard, OCFS officials did not provide any data to support their assertion regarding caseload reductions.
To clarify our report, we revised the column headings on Exhibits 1 though 5 to state "Total Children Needing Day Care" and "Net Children Needing Day Care."
Exhibits 1 displays the number and location of children who we estimate will need day care during the year ended September 30, 1997.
Exhibit 2 displays the total number and location of children w ho we estimate will need day care during the year ending September 30, 1998.
We reduced this total by the number of children accounted for in the year ended September 30, 1997.
Exhibits 3 through 5 use a similar methodology to arrive at the net number of children who may need day care.
