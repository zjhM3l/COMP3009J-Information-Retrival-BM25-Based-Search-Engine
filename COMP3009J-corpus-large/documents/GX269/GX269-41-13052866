Trust Accounting -- Can You Trust Your Methods? By Lynda Gottfried
For many people, trust accounting can be a complicated experience.
Some brokers tend to procrastinate and hope it will go away, which can only complicate the problem.
The designated broker bears the ultimate responsibility for all trust account funds and record keeping.
Brokers should have a good knowledge and understanding of the requirements and reports even when they hire accountants, bookkeepers and employees to do the work on their behalf.
A.R.S. 32-2151; 322174 and 32-2175, as well as Commissioner's Rule R4-28303 are among the statutes and rules that apply to trust accounts and related records.
Brokers are required to maintain a complete record of all monies received.
Records must be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Brokers may choose to handle trust accounting either manually or by computer.
No matter which method of accounting is used, the broker's records must include a properly descriptive receipts and disbursement journal (commonly known as a checkbook or check register) AND a client ledger (an individual breakdown of the funds held for each party such as each owner, tenant, buyer).
One of the more common violations occurs when client ledgers are not maintained properly.
For every deposit, withdrawal, transfer and check there must be a record.
Deposit slips are required to be descriptive including the date, amount and names of all parties to the transaction.
In the case of computerized trust account records for property management, names of parties to the deposit are not required to be written on the deposit slip if the computer program provides the necessary information for each deposit.
For property management funds, should the broker and owner agree, money can be deposited directly to the owner's account instead of a trust account.
If this is the case, the broker is NOT required to have a trust account; however the broker is not to have any access to the owner's account either.
Brokers are required to maintain a trust account reconciliation and client ledger balance on a monthly basis.
In many cases when a broker has a shortage or overage in their trust account, it is because they have not reconciled the account on a monthly basis.
One of the most prudent methods of catching and correcting any bank or employee errors is by
monthly reconciliation.
In many cases where an employee has converted or embezzled funds from a trust account, the broker has had no involvement in or knowledge of the monthly reconciliation process.
Trust account reconciliation has a two-part requirement.
One part is the bank statement and the receipts and disbursements journal.
The second part is the adjusted balance and the client ledger balance.
As with any bank account, a statement is received from the banking institution, which reflects all activity within the account for the given period, usually monthly.
Any checks written and not cleared must be accounted for, as are any deposits, transfers and withdrawals.
There will be adjustments needed for such things as interest, bank charges and returned items to the account.
By taking the bank statement balance, subtracting outstanding checks and disbursements, adding outstanding deposits and receipts and offsetting the necessary adjustments, an adjusted balance is determined.
This should be the balance in the broker's receipts and disbursements journal for the same date as the ending date on the bank statement.
The adjusted balances should be the same and should then be compared to the client ledger balance.
If they are not the same, then an overage or shortage may exist.
In other words, what the broker has in the trust account and what the broker owes to the various parties should always be the same.
When these balances are not in agreement, research must be done to determine the error or problem.
When this is done promptly, it is easier to find and correct the error or problem, than when it is left undone or not resolved.
By comparing the three figures, fraudulent action is easier to determine.
For example, the receipts and disbursements journal and bank statement could be in balance and reconciled; however the broker could owe more money to clients than the broker has in the trust account.
This usually is a sign of errors, commingling, conversion of funds and/or other violations.
The broker may have their own money, not to exceed five hundred dollars, in a trust account.
This is usually for such things as bank charges, fees and minimum balances.
This is NOT considered commingling.
The broker cannot, however, use a client's trust account to manage properties in which the broker is a principal.
If interest is earned on a trust (Continued on page 4) Page 2

Commissioner's Corner By Commissioner Elaine Richardson am delighted to have been appointed to serve as your Commissioner for the Arizona Department of Real Estate.
Our mission at the Department of Real Estate is to protect the public interest through licensure and regulation.
I feel it is imperative that the Department be an accessible, effective and professional resource when dealing with both the public and real estate professionals.
The reception I have received in our community has been very warm and inviting.
It is my hope to hear from you as we seek new ways to improve our department and its services.
We are in an extraordinary time in our industry with growth continuing to be pivotal in our state's economy.
We will be instituting stakeholder meetings to look at issues of concern.
We have a target date of the middle of June for the first of these meetings.
I feel this is a first step in reaching out to our community for a healthy working relationship, which is one of the many steps that contributes to a healthy economy.
I
Look in future bulletins for my section titled Commissioner's Corner, where I will address many hot topics and respond to issues as they arise.
Since the Department of Real Estate is a statewide agency, there are different issues that affect licensees in both rural and urban areas.
Therefore, we have mapped out a series of visits throughout the state, from Page to Patagonia, in order to listen to your concerns in each diverse area.
Our first trip is scheduled to Yuma at the end of May.
Please let me know if there is an event in your area that you feel would be beneficial for our Department to attend.
I am excited about working with each of you to make the Arizona Department of Real Estate responsive and effective.
I will ask that you help us to help you by sharing your thoughts and keeping our dialogue open.
Until next time....
Commissioner Richardson responds to her own emails and can be contacted at erichardson@re.state.az.us.
Due to discrepancies inadvertently made in the Spring 2003 Bulletin article titled, "Homeowner's Insurance Raises Disclosure Questions," the Arizona Department of Real Estate has decided to remove this article.
It does not reflect the Department's policy or interpretation of law on the subject of homeowner's insurance.
Please watch for a more comprehensive article on this topic in a future Bulletin.

account, the funds must be removed at least once every twelve months.
If interest is retained by the broker (with written authorization such as in a property management agreement,) that which puts the broker over the five hundred dollar amount would have to be removed more frequently.
If the interest is to be paid to the owners or tenants, it should be disbursed per the terms of the property management agreement.
At all times, the broker should maintain a record of all broker funds and transactions and include the balance as a part of the monthly reconciliation.
A broker may choose to add other parties as authorized signors on their trust account.
If a trust account is used for property management only, the broker may authorize a licensee under that broker's license or an unlicensed person in their direct employ to have signatory authority.
If the person is an unlicensed person, they must be a bona fide officer, member, principal or employee of the property management firm.
If the trust account is used for sales/earnest or any other combination of uses, the broker may only grant signatory authority to a licensee under that broker's license.
Of course, the broker remains responsible for any money handled by others.
Records related to property management trust ac-
counts are to be maintained by the broker for a period of three years.
This includes bank statements, canceled checks or bank generated check images, deposit slips, receipts and disbursement journals, client ledgers and all other related records.
Records related to sales and other real estate transactions are to be kept for a period of five years.
As a result, it is also required to maintain trust account records for sales for a five-year period.
In the event that a trust account is used for both property management and sales, the five-year recordkeeping rule applies.
Trust account records are to be kept at the broker's main office or at an off-site storage location.
In the event they are kept somewhere other than the main office, the broker is required to notify the Department of Real Estate, in writing, of the street address of the storage location.
Also, brokers are required to notify the Department, in writing, within 10 days of opening, closing or relocating a trust account.
When a broker is involved in trust accounting, he or she bears the responsibility of managing other parties' monies.
This means that prompt and accurate accounting is not only prudent, it is required.
Don't Ask Home Inspectors to Break the Law! By Cindy Ferrin
Did you know that if a real estate person asks home inspectors to pay to place their brochures in their real estate offices, that they are asking the home inspector to break the law? The Department of Real Estate receives inquiries from home inspectors and instructors requesting that we educate real estate professionals.
So here is the scoop: A.A.C. R4-30-301.01 (B)(1), under the Home Inspector Rules of Professional Conduct, states that "a certified home inspector shall not : pay or receive, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, a commission or compensation as a referral or finder's fee."
Based upon this rule, if a Certified Home Inspector pays a real estate office or broker to place their brochures in the real estate office, the Arizona Board of Technical Registration may take disciplinary action against the license of the Certified Home Inspector.
Please consider the above administrative rule when you are working with a Certified Home Inspector so that you are not asking them to break a rule and suffer disciplinary action! VOL U M E 2 9 , I SSU E 1 Page 4

DON'T FORGET YOUR SIGNS! A.R.S. 32-2126.B states that, "each designated broker ...shall cause a sign to be affixed at the entrance to the broker's place of business, in a place and position clearly visible to all..., with the name of the broker, the name under which the broker is doing business..., and sufficient wording to establish that the person is a real estate broker..."
Remember -- any licensee who has a broker's license, even if you work out of your home or do not only engage in brokering, is required to show a clearly visible sign.
Don't get caught without one!
