RESOURCE TYPES TERMINOLOGY BUILDING - A building, such as a house, barn, church, hotel, or similar construction, is created principally to shelter any form of human activity.
"Building" may also be used to refer to a historically and functionally related unit, such as a courthouse and jail or a house and barn.
Examples: houses, barns, stables, sheds, garages, courthouses, city halls, social halls, commercial buildings, libraries, factories, mills, train depots, stationary mobile homes, hotels, theaters, schools, stores, churches, power plants, and observatories.
SITE - A site is the location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archaeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure.
Examples: habitation sites, funerary sites, rock shelters, village sites, hunting and fishing sites, ceremonial sites, petroglyphs, rock carvings, gardens, grounds, battlefields, ruins of historic buildings and structures, campsites, sites of treaty signings, trails, areas of land, shipwrecks, cemeteries, designed landscapes, and natural features, such as springs and rock formations, and land areas having cultural significance.
STRUCTURE - The term "structure" is used to distinguish from buildings those functional constructions made usually for purposes other than creating human shelter.
Examples: bridges, tunnels, gold dredges, fire towers, canals, turbines, dams, power plants, corncribs, silos, roadways, shot towers, windmills, grain elevators, kilns, mounds, cairns, palisade fortifications, earthworks, railroad grades, systems of roadways and paths, boats and ships, railroad locomotives and cars, telescopes, carousels, bandstands, gazebos, and aircraft.
OBJECT - The term "object" is used to distinguish from buildings and structures those constructions that are primarily artistic in nature or are relatively small in scale and simply constructed.
Although it may be, by nature or design, movable, an object is associated with a specific setting or environment.
Examples: sculpture, monuments, boundary markers, statuary, fountains and telescopes.
DISTRICT - A district possesses a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development.
Examples: college campuses; central business districts; residential areas; commercial areas; large forts; industrial complexes; civic centers; rural villages; canal systems; collections of habitation and limited activity sites; irrigation systems; large farms, ranches, estates, or plantations; transportation networks; and large landscaped parks.
