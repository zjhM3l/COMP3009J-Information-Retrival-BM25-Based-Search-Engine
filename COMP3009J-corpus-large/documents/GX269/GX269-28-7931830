interest, as one seems preferable on nylon while the other is better on leather.
In the meantime, we have synthesized an analog of these dyes that possesses improved water solubility, and will be evaluating its fastness properties soon.
In recent weeks, we elected to turn our attention to a family of less commonly used complex-forming monoazo dyes as targets for the synthesis of new I:2 Iron complexes.
The result has been the formation of blue and violet colors for nylon and wool, in addition to brown and black shades.
Needless to say, this is an exciting and quite promising turn of events.
We are planning to synthesize a group of mixed complexes, with the goal of fine tuning some of the present shades.
Obviously, the next step is to assess the fastness properties of this new family of dyes.
The results of this determination will be outlined in our next report.
Preliminary results from the mutagenicity testing of the metallized dyes prepared so far indicate that the Fe complexes are either non-mutagenic or significantly less mutagenic than both the corresponding Co and Cr analogs and the unmetallized precursors.
Laura will have more definitive results for the next report.

.Summary: We completed our investigation of the utility of FeCl, as a coagulant for the removal of phosphate ions from disperse dye wastewater.
Using filtrates derived from the synthesis of Disperse Red 177, we found that phosphate removal at a level of 99.999+% can be achieved when an Fe:P ratio of 2: 1 is used.
This means that either Alum or FeCl, can be used as long as the proper pH is employed.
For Alum the pH should be 5-6, and for the pH should be 3-4.
In the coming months we will conclude the present aspect of our work in this area with a determination of the utility of the collected phosphate as a component for commercial fertilizers.
This is envisioned as an alternative to either incineration or landfilling the coagulants.

Summary: Mike Cato and Hechmi Hamouda (flC State) are going to attend the 28th Microwave Power Symposium in Montreal Canada July 12-14, 1993.
Hechmi will present a paper titled An Analytical Model for the Combined Convective and Radiative (IR) Drying of Fabrics.
Following is an abstract from the paper: The process of moisture removal is analyzed based on a balance of the required and supplied thermal energies during drying.
The computations were implemented to investigate the process limitations to achieve efficient fabric dving or preheating.
An illustrative example, requiring the removal of 70% of the initial water content from a given fabric, was numerically treated for a specific set of drying conditions.
Hechmi Hamouda and Mike Cato have submitted an abstract to the Microwave and High Frequency 1993 International Conference in Goteborg, Sweden, September 28-30.
The title of the abstract is A Precise Model for RF Drying of Yarn Packages.
The abstract is given below.
A mathematical model of the transport phenomena involved in the radio frequency (RF) drying of yarn packages was developed to describe the simultaneousjlow of heat, liquid, water and air.
The model consists of mass and energy balances of the process defined in terms of a set of nonlinear equations; empirical relationships are used to solve these equations.
Evaluation and applications of the model was demonstrated through a interactive spreadsheet program.
The results of the mathematical model are compared to a set of experimental radio frequency drying tests of yarn packages.
These tests were investigated in terms of power, moisture content and dving mechanism.
The computer modeling of polymer properties system consisting of the Biosym software running on a Silicon Graphics workstation has been used to predict properties for several polyesters of interest as binders for xerographic printing of textile substrates.
The predictions are being checked by preparing the polyesters and checking properties such as glass transition temperature, melt viscosity and initial shear and tensile moduli.
Polyesters are being prepared by interfacial polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride with a number of both single and mixed dials.
A number of polymer films have also been prepared by UV initiation of acrylic acid terminated monomers.
Polyacrylates, polyesters, and polyurethanes have been prepared and are currently being evaluated.
The initial results on the use of an HPLC pumping system with spectroscopic detection for on-line analysis of the dye stream being pumped to a continuous carpet dye range have been completed.
Results show that it is possible to dilute the dye stream at least lo-fold with a gradient pumping system with a high degree of precision.
A range of dye concentrations from approximately 0.001 g/L to 1 g/L can be analyzed with no dilution of the dye stream and with dilution this range is 0.001 to 1.0 g/L.
This is a very conservative estimate of the analytical range.
The low volume applicator for continuous dye ranges is functional and initial runs are underway.
We are now evaluating the uniformity of wet pick-up and the influence of speed and pressure on the wet pick-up.
Based on these experiments, conditions will be selected for uniformity and repeatability studies.
Detailed information is also being collected on all existing low volume applicators to look at approaches others have taken to solution of this problem and for comparison with the system we are developing.
A trip is planned next quarter to visit the Research Center in Valence, France.
