Status of this document Unless otherwise stated, references to "the Directive" in this document means the Council Directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control.
This document is a working draft of the European IPPC Bureau.
It is not an official publication of the European Communities and does not necessarily reflect the position of the European Commission.

Relevant legal obligations of the IPPC Directive and the definition of BAT the reader understand the legal context in which this document has been drafted, st relevant provisions of the IPPC Directive, including the definition of the term techniques", are described in this preface.
This description is inevitably is given for information only.
It has no legal value and does not in any way alter actual provisions of the Directive.
In order to help some of the mo "best available incomplete and or prejudice the The purpose of the Directive is to achieve integrated prevention and control of pollution arising from the activities listed in its Annex I, leading to a high level of protection of the environment as a whole.
The legal basis of the Directive relates to environmental protection.
Its implementation should also take account of other Community objectives such as the competitiveness of the Community's industry thereby contributing to sustainable development.
More specifically, it provides for a permitting system for certain categories of industrial installations requiring both operators and regulators to take an integrated, overall look at the polluting and consuming potential of the installation.
The overall aim of such an integrated approach must be to improve the management and control of industrial processes so as to ensure a high level of protection for the environment as a whole.
Central to this approach is the general principle given in Article 3 that operators should take all appropriate preventative measures against pollution, in particular through the application of best available techniques enabling them to improve their environmental performance.
The term "best available techniques" is defined in Article 2(11) of the Directive as "the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing in principle the basis for emission limit values designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole."
Article 2(11) goes on to clarify further this definition as follows: "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned; "available" techniques are those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator; "best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.
Furthermore, Annex IV of the Directive contains a list of "considerations to be taken into account generally or in specific cases when determining best available techniques ... bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and the principles of precaution and prevention".
These considerations include the information published by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(2).
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February, 2001 i Preface Competent authorities responsible for issuing permits are required to take account of the general principles set out in Article 3 when determining the conditions of the permit.
These conditions must include emission limit values, supplemented or replaced where appropriate by equivalent parameters or technical measures.
According to Article 9(4) of the Directive, these emission limit values, equivalent parameters and technical measures must, without prejudice to compliance with environmental quality standards, be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology, but taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.
In all circumstances, the conditions of the permit must include provisions on the minimisation of long-distance or transboundary pollution and must ensure a high level of protection for the environment as a whole.
Member States have the obligation, according to Article 11 of the Directive, to ensure that competent authorities follow or are informed of developments in best available techniques.
3.
Objective of this Document Article 16(2) of the Directive requires the Commission to organise "an exchange of information between Member States and the industries concerned on best available techniques, associated monitoring and developments in them", and to publish the results of the exchange.
The purpose of the information exchange is given in recital 25 of the Directive, which states that "the development and exchange of information at Community level about best available techniques will help to redress the technological imbalances in the Community, will promote the world-wide dissemination of limit values and techniques used in the Community and will help the Member States in the efficient implementation of this Directive."
The Commission (Environment DG) established an information exchange forum (IEF) to assist the work under Article 16(2) and a number of technical working groups have been established under the umbrella of the IEF.
Both IEF and the technical working groups include representation from Member States and industry as required in Article 16(2).
The aim of this series of documents is to reflect accurately the exchange of information which has taken place as required by Article 16(2) and to provide reference information for the permitting authority to take into account when determining permit conditions.
By providing relevant information concerning best available techniques, these documents should act as valuable tools to drive environmental performance.

Information Sources This document represents a summary of information collected from a number of sources, including in particular the expertise of the groups established to assist the Commission in its work, and verified by the Commission services.
All contributions are gratefully acknowledged.
5.
How to understand and use this document The information provided in this document is intended to be used as an input to the determination of BAT in specific cases.
When determining BAT and setting BAT-based permit conditions, account should always be taken of the overall goal to achieve a high level of protection for the environment as a whole.
The rest of this section describes the type of information that is provided in each section of the document.
ii Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Preface Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the industrial sector concerned and on the industrial processes used within the sector.
Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning current emission and consumption levels reflecting the situation in existing installations at the time of writing.
Chapter 4 describes in more detail the emission reduction and other techniques that are considered to be most relevant for determining BAT and BAT-based permit conditions.
This information includes the consumption and emission levels considered achievable by using the technique, some idea of the costs and the cross-media issues associated with the technique, and the extent to which the technique is applicable to the range of installations requiring IPPC permits, for example new, existing, large or small installations.
Techniques that are generally seen as obsolete are not included.
Chapter 5 presents the techniques and the emission and consumption levels that are considered to be compatible with BAT in a general sense.
The purpose is thus to provide general indications regarding the emission and consumption levels that can be considered as an appropriate reference point to assist in the determination of BAT-based permit conditions or for the establishment of general binding rules under Article 9(8).
It should be stressed, however, that this document does not propose emission limit values.
The determination of appropriate permit conditions will involve taking account of local, site-specific factors such as the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.
In the case of existing installations, the economic and technical viability of upgrading them also needs to be taken into account.
Even the single objective of ensuring a high level of protection for the environment as a whole will often involve making trade-off judgements between different types of environmental impact, and these judgements will often be influenced by local considerations.
Although an attempt is made to address some of these issues, it is not possible for them to be considered fully in this document.
The techniques and levels presented in Chapter 5 will therefore not necessarily be appropriate for all installations.
On the other hand, the obligation to ensure a high level of environmental protection including the minimisation of long-distance or transboundary pollution implies that permit conditions cannot be set on the basis of purely local considerations.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that the information contained in this document is fully taken into account by permitting authorities.
Since the best available techniques change over time, this document will be reviewed and updated as appropriate.
All comments and suggestions should be made to the European IPPC Bureau at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies at the following address: World Trade Center, Isla de la Cartuja s/n, E-41092 Seville, Spain Telephone: +34 95 4488 284 Fax: +34 95 4488 426 e-mail: eippcb@jrc.es Internet: http://eippcb.jrc.es VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February, 2001 iii Scope SCOPE This document covers the industrial activities specified in Section 6.2 of Annex 1 of Directive 96/61/EC, namely: "Plants for the pretreatment (operations such as washing, bleaching, mercerisation) or dyeing of fibres or textiles where the treatment capacity exceeds 10 tonnes per day".
Particular attention is given to the following processes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ fibre preparation Ã¯Â¿Â½ pretreatment Ã¯Â¿Â½ dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ printing Ã¯Â¿Â½ finishing.
Upstream processes which may have a significant influence on the environmental impact of the subsequent wet processing activities are also briefly described.
The backing of carpets is included in this document because it is an intrinsic part of carpet manufacturing and has the potential to pollute the environment.
All main fibre types, namely natural fibres, man-made fibres derived from natural polymers such as viscose and cellulose acetate as well as man-made fibres derived from synthetic polymers are described, including their blends.
Non-woven fabric manufacturing is not included in this BREF.

216 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 xiii Chapter 1 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The textile industry is one of the longest and most complicated industrial chains in manufacturing industry.
It is a fragmented and heterogeneous sector dominated by a majority of Small and Medium Enterprises, with a demand largely driven by three main end-uses: clothing, home furnishing and industrial use.
The importance of textile industry in the European economy is shown in Table 1.1.
In 1997 the turnover was over 197 billions ECU (?) and the 116000 companies employed 2.4 (?) millions people.
Value Production added at f.c.

The textile industry's activities are distributed right across Europe, but concentrated in a few EU states.
Italy is the leading European producer, far ahead of Germany, the UK, France and Spain (in that order).
These five countries together account for over 80 % of the Community textile and clothing industry.
[EURATEX] The textile and clothing chain is composed of a wide number of sub-sectors covering the entire production cycle from the production of raw materials (chemical fibres) to semi-processed (yarns, woven and knitted fabrics with their finishing process) and final/consumer products (carpets, home textiles, clothing and industrial use textiles).
The complexity of the sector is also reflected in the difficulty of finding a clear-cut classification system for the different activities involved.
The old nomenclature system (old NACE 1995) still classified textile industry's activities as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ man made fibres industry Ã¯Â¿Â½ wool Ã¯Â¿Â½ cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ silk Ã¯Â¿Â½ flax/jute Ã¯Â¿Â½ knitting Ã¯Â¿Â½ finishing Ã¯Â¿Â½ carpets Ã¯Â¿Â½ other textiles Ã¯Â¿Â½ household linen.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 1 Chapter 1 The new nomenclature system (NACE 1997) identifies the following categories: Ã¯Â¿Â½ yarn and thread Ã¯Â¿Â½ woven fabric Ã¯Â¿Â½ textile finishing Ã¯Â¿Â½ home textiles Ã¯Â¿Â½ industrial 
The old nomenclature reflects the historical subdivision of the textile industry's activities according to the fibre processed.
This stems from the fact that historically the only textile fibres available were natural fibres, with a predominance of wool and cotton, which resulted in the development of two main sectors, wool and cotton.
Because of the different physico-chemical characteristics of these two fibres, different machinery and different techniques were developed.
Nowadays, with the proliferation of man-made fibres these two historical sectors both process all available fibres and it has become impractical to classify textiles activities by reference to the fibre.
As for the scope of this document, it is confined to those activities in the textile industry that involve wet processes.
In addition to wool scouring, that means primarily activities falling within the following new NACE classifications: Ã¯Â¿Â½ textile finishing Ã¯Â¿Â½ industrial and other textiles (including Carpets) Ã¯Â¿Â½ home textiles (?).
Because of its very specialised nature, carpet manufacturing is always considered as a standalone sector, even though many of the operations carried out are very close to those carried out elsewhere in textile finishing.
This document follows that tradition: carpets are the only sector where the end product is taken as the point of reference.
Some general information is given below about the three macro-sectors of wool scouring, textile finishing (excluding floor-coverings) and carpets.
1.1 Wool scouring sector 1.1.1 Sector organisation Wool is processed to yarn mainly via two systems: woollen and worsted.
Scourers tend to specialise in wools for one system or the other.
Woollen system scourers normally only scour the wool, though some may blend it before despatch to the customer.
Worsted system scourers (referred to as combers in English) scour, card and comb the wool and their product is called top.
Within Europe, significant quantities of wool are obtained from skins of slaughtered animals by fellmongering.
Fellmongers normally sell the wool they produce to merchants, who have it scoured on commission.
In France there are several fellmongers who also scour the wool they produce.
The wool scouring and combing business in Western Europe is largely carried out on commission.
There are a few exceptions to this system, notably in the UK, where three carpet yarn manufacturers who have their own wool scouring plants.

(c) Assuming an average yield of 70 %.
(d) A second scouring/combing mill in Germany is not believed to be operational.
Table 1.2: Wool production and wool scouring production in EU Member States [INTERLAINE] As it is possible to see from the reported data, 90 % of the EU scouring activity is concentrated in France, Germany, Italy and UK, while eight EU member states have no scouring plants.
The UK scouring and combing industry is the largest in Europe, though only slightly larger than that of Italy.
About 2/3 of the UK scouring production comprises coarse wools for woollen spun carpet yarn.
Figure 1.1 shows the amounts of wool scoured in the 15 EU Member States in terms of greasy wool weight.
This is the unit most often used by scourers to express their throughput.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 3 Chapter 1 Production, million kg greasy wool per year 120 100 80 60 40 20 Luxembourg Netherlands Germany Denmark Portugal Austria Belgium Finland Ireland Spain Sweden France Greece Italy UK 0 Figure 1.1: Estimates of the amounts of greasy wool scoured during 1997 in the 15 EU Member States [INTERLAINE] During the period from 1993 to 1997 the total production in EU Member States has declined almost 10 % from 326 million kg (clean wool) in 1993 to 300 million kg (clean wool) in 1997.
Within this overall trend a steeper decline has been observed in northern Europe (Belgium, France, Germany and UK) alongside an increase in production in the Italy and Spain.
Although the overall decline in production in the European scouring sector has been relatively slow, there have been significant structural changes.
The competitive nature of the industry and the cost and technical difficulties of complying with increasingly stringent environmental legislation have driven the changes.
Several large and small scouring mills have been forced beyond the limits of commercial and economic viability and have ceased trading.
Often, their market share has been absorbed by competitors, so there are now fewer companies in the sector, on average processing larger amounts of wool.
This tendency towards consolidation is especially the case in UK, where a large part of the scouring industry's trade is the processing of UK and Irish wools.
Almost 80 %1 of the British and Irish wool production, totalling 90000 tonnes is scoured in UK and this trade is unlikely to be lost to competitors in other countries.

The carpet manufacturing, carpet yarn spinning and associated dyeing industry can be divided into a number of basic sub-sectors, although there can be considerable variation on the following pattern.
All sectors may process combinations of 100 % synthetic fibre, 100 % natural fibre and blends of the two, as many of the processes and techniques used are not fibre specific.
As are Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Table 1.3 shows there are four main different categories of companies where wet processes normally carried out: commission loose fibre dyehouses commission yarn dyehouses integrated yarn manufacturing companies, which in addition to the dyeing processes perform on-site conversion of the loose fibre to yarn, selling the finished yarn as endproduct Ã¯Â¿Â½ integrated carpet manufacturing industries, which carry out all the mechanical processes, dyeing and finishing operations required to convert natural and synthetic fibres into finished carpet.

Note that individual units may be part of a larger group, providing services to other members of the same organisation.
In a similar way, a yarn spinning company with its own dyeing facilities may, if production schedules require, also have work carried out by a commission dyer or may carry out commission work for other companies if spare capacity is available.

Among these, water is the most important concern.
The textile industry uses water as the principal medium for removing contaminants and applying dyes and finishes and for the generation of steam.
Losses to the product are negligible, therefore, apart from a minor amount of water which is evaporated during drying, the bulk is discharged as aqueous effluent.
The main concern is therefore about the amount of water discharged and the chemical load it carries.
An overview of these charging loads is given in Table 1.5.
The reported data have been extrapolated to European level from the results of a research in Germany and Austria.
Substances Salts Natural fibres contaminants Sizes (mainly starch derivatives, but also polyacrylates and polyvinylalcohol) Preparation agents (mainly mineral oils, but also ester oils) Surfactants (dispersing agents, emulsifiers, detergents) Carboxylic acids (mainly acetic acid) Thickeners (starch derivatives) Urea Complexing agents Organic solvents Special auxiliaries with more or less ecotoxicological properties Source: [EURATEX] Charging load (t/yr) 200 - 250000 50 - 100000 80 - 100000 25 - 30000 20 - 25000 15 - 20000 10 - 15000 5 - 10000 
These are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ sizing agents Ã¯Â¿Â½ natural fibres impurities Ã¯Â¿Â½ preparation agents Sizing agents are used to assist weaving process.
They are removed from the woven fabric at the finishing mill thus producing high levels of organic load in the water.
Auxiliaries, so-called preparation agents and spinning oils, are applied to fibres in various steps of the process, from the manufacturing of the fibre itself (for synthetic fibres only) to the VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 9 Chapter 1 formation of the yarn.
These organic substances are removed during pretreatment at the finishing mill, contributing the increase of the organic load of the final effluent.
All natural fibres contain a percentage of impurities that have to be removed before the fibre can undergo the finishing processes.
In the case of wool, in particular, the bulk of the natural impurities (grease, dirt, etc.) is removed before the fibre enters the finishing mill.
This operation is carried out in a preparation step called wool scouring which is responsible for the generation of an effluent with a very high concentration of organic material.
Moreover, wool contains other pollutants, so-called micro-pollutants, originating from the pesticides used to prevent sheep becoming infested with external parasites (ticks, lice, blow-fly maggots, etc.).
These biocides are in general toxic to aquatic life and, in some cases, may be highly toxic and persistent.
In this context, the extensive industrial and agricultural use of OC pesticides (in particular lindane, dieldrin and DDT) in most wool-producing countries has left a legacy of low-level background contamination in the general environment.
Consequently, wool from all sources may still contain detectable OC residues arising from this background contamination.
The hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) is still used as a veterinary medicine in some former Soviet States, the Middle East and South America.
Modern sheep treatment medicines are formulated from a range or organophosphate (OP's) insecticides, synthetic pyrethroid insecticides (SP's) and insect growth regulators (IGR's).
Their pattern of permitted use varies widely.
These substances are lipophilic in character and strongly associate with the wool grease at shearing.
They are largely removed during the scouring process, which makes them another important concern for the wool scouring sector.
A very small percentage of these compounds, however, remains on the fibre, which means that wool dyeing effluents may also contain residual pesticides.
The input of chemicals and auxiliaries added at the finishing mills can be up to 1 kg per kg of processed textiles, which is high.
The range of these substances is very extensive: the latest issues of TEGEWA lists more than 7000 auxiliaries.
However, as shown in Figure 1.6, in a typical finishing mill, 80 % of the annual consumption is covered by only 20 % of the product types used.

Although they are responsible for the colour of the effluent - a common problem for the textile industry - they do not represent a significant load compared with other substances used in the process.
That said, their presence in the water is important, not only because of the colour, but also in relation with other environmental concerns (e.g. difficultto-eliminate organic load, AOX, metals, in particular for certain classes of dyestuffs).
A number of chemicals used in the textile process are worth mentioning for their potential negative effects on the environment.
These are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ alkyl phenol ethoxylates (detergents, wetting agents, levelling agents, etc.) polybrominated diphenyl ethers and chlorinated paraffins (flame retardants), halogenated phenols and benzenes (reagents in the production of flame retardants).
All these substances have proven or suspected hormonal effects Ã¯Â¿Â½ mothproofing agents based on permethrin and cyfluthrin (carpet sector) and other biocides highly toxic to aquatic life Ã¯Â¿Â½ poorly bioeliminable sequestering agents such as EDTA, DTPA and NTA, capable of forming very stable complexes with metals Ã¯Â¿Â½ chlorine and chlorine-based agents such as sodium hypochlorite (bleaching agent) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (wool anti-felting agent) capable of reacting with organic compounds to form adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) Ã¯Â¿Â½ metal-containing compounds such potassium dichromate (oxidising agent used for the fixation of chrome dyes).
It is reported that: Ã¯Â¿Â½ more than 90 % of the organic input in pretreatment and dyeing operations is released to the environment Ã¯Â¿Â½ of the organic chemicals added in the finishing process, 90 % remain on the textile Ã¯Â¿Â½ nearly 90 % of the organic load entering the process is emitted to water, the remaining amount being released to air.
[EURATEX] Concerning emissions to air, volatile organic compounds are released from particular activities such as: Ã¯Â¿Â½ printing processes when organic solvents are used (e.g. they are contained in pigment printing pastes) Ã¯Â¿Â½ cleaning with organic solvents Ã¯Â¿Â½ heat treatments (e.g. thermofixation, drying, curing) when the textile materials contain oils, plasticisers and other chemicals that evaporate or degrade thermally Ã¯Â¿Â½ vulcanisation of the backing layers (carpet sector).
Moreover, emissions of CO2 , SOx and NOx associated with the on-site burning of fossil fuels to produce thermal energy are to be taken into account.
Energy is consumed primarily in raising the temperature of the baths (e.g. pretreatment, dyeing, etc.) and in drying and curing operations.
To this aim steam is produced on-site.
Electrical energy is required for driving the machinery.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 11 Chapter 2 2 APPLIED PROCESSES AND TECHNIQUES The textile chain begins with the production or harvest of raw fibre.
The basic steps in this chain are schematically represented in the following diagram and will be described in this chapter.
POLYMERS TEXTILE CHAIN FIBRES MANUFACTURING (Section 2.2) Man-made fibres Natural fibres FIBRES PREPARATION (Section 2.3) FINISHING PROCESSES Pre-treatment (Section 2.6) Dyeing (Section 2.7) Printing (Section 2.8) Finishing (Section 2.9) Washing (Section 2.10) Drying (Section 2.11) Loose fibres/stock YARN MANUFACTURING (Section 2.4) - spinning Yarn CLOTH PRODUCTION (Section 2.5) weaving knitting tufting needle-felt Cloth MANUFACTURE OF END PRODUCTS (clothing, knitwear, carpet, etc) Figure 2.1: General diagram of processes in the textile industry The main part of this chapter will describe those treatments that are broadly referred to as "finishing treatments" (pretreatment, dyeing, printing, finishing).
As the diagram shows, they can take place at different stages of the production process: the substrates for finishing can be cloths, yarns or loose fibres.
"Textile finishing" cannot be defined as a standard sequence of treatments, but rather is a combination of unit processes that can be applied within the production of a textile product, depending on the requirements of the final user.
For this reason finishing treatments will be described (from Section 2.6 to Section 2.11) as unit processes without considering the possible sequences in which they can be applied.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 13 Chapter 2 In the second part of this chapter a distinction has been made between the carpet finishing sector and the rest of the finishing industry.
Some typical categories of industries have been identified within each sector.
The wool scouring industry has also been identified as a stand-alone sector.
These categories have typical features that are described in brief.
As well as fibres, the raw materials of the textile industry include a wide range of chemicals and auxiliaries.
These chemicals and auxiliaries are often not process-specific and can be found in different steps within the process cycle.
For this reason it has been considered more practical to report the description of these issues in separate annexes (ANNEX I Textile Auxiliaries and ANNEX II Dyes and Pigments).
Only general information about textile raw materials, including common procedures for storage 
In the same way, because most of the machines have a multifunctional use within the production cycle, equipment is also described in a specific annex (ANNEX III Wet Processes: Machinery and Techniques).
2.1 Raw materials 2.1.1 Fibres Two general categories of fibres are used in the textile industry: natural and man-made.
Manmade fibres encompass both purely synthetic materials of petrochemical origin, and regenerative cellulosic materials manufactured from wood fibres.
A more detailed classification of fibres is: Natural fibres Ã¯Â¿Â½ Animal origin Raw wool Silk fibre Hair Raw cotton fibre Flax Jute Asbestos Viscose, cupro, lyocell Cellulose acetate Cellulose triacetate Glass for fibre glass Metal for metal fibre Polyester (PES) Polyamide (PA) Polyacrylonitrile (PAC) Polypropylene (PP) Elastane (EL) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Vegetable origin Ã¯Â¿Â½ Half-synthetic fibres Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mineral origin Vegetable origin Ã¯Â¿Â½ Synthetic fibres Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mineral origin Petrochemical origin Fibres included in this document are described in more detail below, highlighting in particular the typical impurities present on them.
These impurities will enter the textile process and will influence the associated emissions.
14 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.1.1.1 Polyester fibres (PES) Polyester fibres are made of linear macromolecules containing at least 85 % of an ester in the chain.
This ester is made through the reaction between ethylene glycol and phathalic acid derivatives (e.g. terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate).
During the polycondensation reaction, cyclic oligomers with very low water-solubility can be formed (1 - 3 % on the weight of the fibre [EURATEX]).
These oligomers tend to migrate to the surface of the fibre during dyeing, thus affecting negatively level dyeing and rub-fastness properties.
PES fibres have a very high degree of cristallinity, which allows for excellent resistance to heat and other mechanical properties.
On the other hand, this compact structure inhibits the diffusion of the colorants into the fibre during dyeing.
To counteract this effect the use of dyeing accelerants (so-called carriers), which are harmful for the environment and in many cases are toxic for humans, has been common practice for many years.
Modified PES fibres are now gaining importance in the market.
Thanks to physical and chemical alterations made to the structure of the fibre during the manufacturing process, these fibres show a lower cristallinity and as a result they are easier to dye without the need for carriers.
2.1.1.2 Polyamide fibres (PA) The starting polymer comes from the polycondensation reaction between a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid.
According to the number of carbon atoms of the end product one can speak of PA 6,6 or PA 6.
PA 6,6 is made by thermal polycondensation of equimolecular amounts of adipic acid and 1,6hexamethylendiamine.
The equilibrium condensate contains small amounts of monomers and cyclic dimers (2 %).
PA 6 is made by polycondensation of the monomer epsilon-caprolactame.
The caprolactame content in the polymer can be reduced to 0.2 % by extraction with hot water.
During the melting process for the production of the fibre (melt spinning), the caprolactame content rises again and is partially emitted during the following thermal treatments.
2.1.1.3 Polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAC) The polymer is obtained by radical polymerisation of acrylonitrile in aqueous emulsion or in solvent.
The obtained polymer, made of 100 % acrylonitrile (also called PAN), gives fibres with insufficient dye-binding capability, due to the high glass transition temperature (above 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C).
For this reason this polymer is no longer used in the textile industry.
Polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAC), commonly found on the market today, are anionic copolymers containing 85 89 % of acrylonitrile, 4 10 % of a non-ionic comonomer (vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate) and 0.5 1 % of ionic comonomers containing sulphonic or sulphate groups.
Dry and wet-spinning techniques can be used for the production of the fibre.
When dry spinning is used the polymer is dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF).
If the fibre is manufactured through wet spinning, besides DMF, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, ethyl carbonate and aqueous solutions of inorganic salts or acids are also used.
Residues of these solvents (0.2 - 2 %) are found in wastewater from pre-treatment.
2.1.1.4 Polypropylene fibres (PP) The isotactic polymer is used for fibre production.
Due to the tertiary carbon atom, PP is very sensitive to high temperature and oxidation.
Alkylated phenols or p-xylols, together with suphides or thio-derivatives (dilauryl- or distearyl thiopropionate) are used as stabilizers.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 15 Chapter 2 Substances with benzotriazol groups, Ni complexes, anthrachinon derivatives and steric hindered diamines are used as UV-absorbents.
These low molecular weight substances remain in the PP fibres and are considered as possible emission-relevant substances.
2.1.1.5 Elastane (EL) Elastane fibres are made out of an elastomer contaning at least 85 % of polyurethane (PU).
For the production of the fibre (dry spinning) the polymer is dissolved in dimethylacetamide.
Residues of this solvent remain in the fibre (
To reduce the high adhesive characteristics and to guarantee sufficient gliding properties during processing, preparation agents are applied to the fibre (approximately 6 8 % add-on).
These auxiliaries contain 95 % silicone oils and 5 % surfactants.
The high percentage of silicone oils will cause environmental concerns during pre-treatment of the textile material, when these substances have to be removed.
2.1.1.6 Viscose (CV) The starting material is the cellulose that is extracted from coniferous timber and supplied to the fibre manufacture in sheets about 1cm thick.
The wood contains ca. 40 50 % cellulose that is useable to make viscose.
The cellulose is first allowed to swell in a NaOH solution.
The white flakes obtained are then treated with carbon disulphide until the sodium cellulose xantogenate is formed.
The xantogenate is soluble in diluted sodium hydroxide and the formed solution (pulp) is already called viscose.
The pulp then needs to be spun.
Spinning consists in coagulating the xantogenate solution at the outlet of the spinneret in an acid bath containing sulphuric acid, sodium sulphate and zinc sulphate.
2.1.1.7 Cupro (CU) Cellulose (wood pulp) can also be dissolved in an aqueous solution of ammonia and copper sulphate.
Cupro fibres are produced by wet spinning.
2.1.1.8 Acetate fibres The cellulose molecule contains 3 alcohol groups.
When between 2 and 2.5 of the 3 groups are esterified with acetic acid, the polymer is called diacetate.
When all the three alcohol groups are esterified then the polymer is called triacetate.
The acetate fibres contain less that 92 % of cellulose acetate, but at least 74 % of the hydroxilic groups must be acetilated.
2.1.1.9 Wool Wool is an animal hair from the body of sheep.
This hair is normally sheared once, or sometimes twice, a year and its quality and quantity varies widely, depending on the breed of sheep and environment.
Wool is a member of a group of proteins known as keratin, also found in horns, nails, etc.
16 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 In addition to wool fibre, raw wool contains: - Wool grease 2 - 25 % of greasy Ã¯Â¿Â½ Natural impurities - Suint (dried perspiration) 2 - 12 % of greasy - Dirt 5 - 45 % of greasy Ã¯Â¿Â½ Residues of insecticides, acaricides or insect growth regulators used as veteri to protect sheep from ectoparasites, such as lice, mites, blowfly, etc. wool weight wool weight wool weight nary medicines The percentage of the above mentioned components may vary widely depending on the origin of wool.
For example, fine wool from merino sheep, used mainly in apparel, typically contains 13 % wool grease, whereas coarser wool of the types used for carpets contains an average of about 5 % grease.
The clean fibre content of raw wool usually lies within the 60 to 80 % range, but may vary from 40 to 90 %.
Wool grease is insoluble in water, but soluble in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane or hexane.
Refined wool grease is a valuable by-product.
Suint is water-soluble material arising from the secretion of the sweat glands in the skin.
Suint is soluble in polar solvent such as water and alcohol.
Dirt can include a variety of materials such as mineral dirt, sands, clay, dust and organic materials.
Ectoparasiticides have important implications for the discharge of raw wool scouring effluent and disposal of the sludge generated by the treatment of the effluent.
The chemicals known to be present in raw wool include: - -Hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Organochlorine insecticides (OCs) - Dieldrin - DDT Ã¯Â¿Â½ Organophosphorous insecticides (OPs) Diazinon Propetamphos Chlorfenvinphos Chlorpyriphos Dichlorfenthion Cypermethrin Deltamethrin Fenvalerate Flumethrin Cyhalothrin Cyromazine Dicyclanil Diflubenzuron Triflumuron Ã¯Â¿Â½ Synthetic pyrethroids insecticides (SPs) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Insect growth regulators (IGRs) The organochlorines are hazardous due to their persistence and bioaccumulability.
They are thus likely to have long-range effects.
-Hexachlorocyclohexane (also called lindane) is the most toxic (and also the most active as pesticide) of the hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (- and HCHs).
The technical crude product contains - and -HCH, the -isomer being the most persistent.
Lindane and DDT compounds are well-studied substances with demonstrated endocrine disrupting capacity.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 17 Chapter 2 The synthetic growth regulators show high aquatic toxicity (predicted no-effect concentration for cypermethrin is estimated at 0.0001 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/l, while for OPs the correspondent value is 10.9 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/l).
Organophosphates have lower aquatic toxicity than synthetic pyrethroids and are less persistent than organochlorines.
All major grower countries have banned the use of organochlorine pesticides for sheep treatment, but there is evidence that wool from some former Soviet Union States and South America contain lindane at detectable concentrations.
This would suggest that either their grazing is heavily contaminated or that this compound continues to be used occasionally for sheep treatment against ectoparasites.
Wool from the majority of grower nations contains residual sheep treatment medicines which are used legally to control infestations of lice, ticks and mites.
These materials may be organophosphates, typically diazinon, propetamphos and trans-chlorfenvinphos, synthetic pyrethroids, typically cypermethrin and insect growth regulators such as cyromazine.
The incidence of these materials on wool is variable and depends on the permitted legal use pattern in each country.
Manufacturers can use a database containing quantitative information on the OC, OP and SP content of wool from major producing countries.
ENCO maintains one such database.
Manufacturers use these data to avoid processing wool from suspect sources.
The system is of immediate benefit to manufacturers who purchase and process wool from known sources.
Commission processors of either loose fibre or yarn may be not aware of the origin of the fibre they are processing and so find it more difficult to control their raw material inputs using this approach.
More information regarding ectoparasiticides is reported in Section 2.3.1 where the wool scouring process is discussed.
2.1.1.10 Silk Silk accounts for only 0.2 % of the total fibre production.
Nevertheless, this fibre is very important for specific "niche" articles such as ladies' shirts, jackets and scarves.
Silk is derived from the silk worm, which spins a cocoon around itself.
It is a protein fibre like wool and it is the only natural filament fibre to be used with success in the textile industry (the length of the thread is in the range of 700 to 1500m).
The silk fibre is composed of fibroin filaments wrapped with sericine (silk gum), which has to be removed during the pre-treatment.
2.1.1.11 Cotton and flax Cotton fibre consists mainly of cellulose and some other components, as shown below.
Substance Cellulose Pectin substances Wax Proteins Ash Other organic components Source: EURATEX Table 2.1: Chemical composition of cotton fibre Content 88 0.7 0.4 1.1 0.7 0 .5 96 1.2 1.0 1.9 1.6 1.0 % % % % % % 18 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Cotton production may use chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides and defoliants and these may remain as a residue on raw cotton fibres that reach the textile mill.
However, this is of little concern for textile industry.
In fact, tests of cotton samples from around the world, performed from 1991 to 1993, reported levels of pesticides below the threshold limit values for foodstuffs.
[EPA] Flax is a bast fibre.
Many economic factors have contributed to this fibre losing much of its previous importance.
Nevertheless flax remains a noble fibre suitable for luxury articles.
2.1.2 Chemicals 
this document they will be divided into the following categories: dyestuffs and pigments basic chemicals, which include all inorganic chemicals and organic reducing and oxidising agents as well as the aliphatic organic acids Ã¯Â¿Â½ auxiliaries, which comprise all textile auxiliaries containing mainly organic compounds except organic reducing and oxidising agents and organic aliphatic acids.
To give an idea of the variety of products available on the market (in particular, auxiliaries), it is worth noting that in the "2000 Textile Auxiliaries Buyers' Guide" more than 7000 commercial products are reported, based on 400 to 600 active components.
They are classified according to the well-established TEGEWA nomenclature, according to their functional use in the production process, although the chemical nature of these products is too varied to allocate them unequivocally to one category.
For practical reasons the information about dyestuffs and textile auxiliaries is reported in this document in separate annexes (see Section 8 and Section 9).
2.1.3 Materials handling and storage Basic fibrous raw materials arrive on site in press-packed bales and are stored in covered warehousing, which may also be used to store and dispatch finished goods to customers.
Basic chemical intermediates, acids, alkalis and bulk auxiliary chemicals are normally held within a bound or contained storage area.
Large bulk containers may be situated in the open.
High value and moisture- or environmentally-sensitive materials are normally transferred directly to the preparation area ("colour kitchen") from where they are dispensed.
Some synthetic organic colorants are regarded as a potential health hazard.
Therefore colour kitchens are normally equipped with air extraction and filter systems to suppress dust levels during dispensing.
The chemicals (dyestuffs, pigments, basic chemicals and auxiliaries) are metered out either in powder form or as solutions.
This operation can be done manually or with computer-aided metering devices.
The required measured amounts of products must in general be dispersed, diluted or mixed before being fed to the finishing machinery.
Various systems are found in the industry, ranging from completely manual procedures to fully automatic ones.
In the case of manual systems the prepared chemicals are added directly into the machine or in a storage container near the equipment, from which they are then pumped into the machine.
In larger companies the chemicals are usually mixed in a central mixing station, from which they are supplied to the various machines through a network of pipes.
The quantities and the addition of chemicals and auxiliaries are normally called up automatically according to predetermined programmes.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 19 Chapter 2 2.2 Fibre manufacturing: synthetic and artificial fibres Manmade fibres are typically extruded into continuous filaments.
The continuous filaments can then be: Ã¯Â¿Â½ used directly (in general, following further shaping or texturing) Ã¯Â¿Â½ cut into staple length and then spun in a process resembling the one used for wool or cotton.
Three main methods are used to produce the continuous filaments (primary spinning): Ã¯Â¿Â½ melt spinning Ã¯Â¿Â½ dry spinning Ã¯Â¿Â½ wet spinning.
Melt spinning: The polymer is melted in a spinner opening under pressure and cooled preparation (spin finish) is generally applied process is suitable for thermoplastic fibres polypropylene) and glass fibre. melt-extruder. by a jet of air at the bottom such as polye The liquid is forced through the to form the filament.
A spinning of the spinning duct.
The melting ster, polyamide, polyolefins (e.g. Dry spinning: The polymer is dissolved in a solvent.
The dissolved polymer is extruded through a spinneret into a chamber of heated air or gas where the solvents evaporates and the filament forms.
This filament is further after-treated with a spin finish.
The dry spinning process is principally used for acetate, triacetate and polyacrilonitrile.
Wet spinning: The polymer is dissolved in solution.
The solution is forced under pressure through an opening into a liquid bath in which the polymer is insoluble.
As the solvent is dissipated the fibre forms.
The solvent can be dissipated through extraction or by means of a chemical reaction between the polymer solution and a reagent in the spinning bath (reactive spinning).
The residual solvent can be extracted by simple washing.
After the thread is formed and the solvent is washed out, a spin finish can be applied.
Wet spinning produces viscose, acrylic fibres.
Following primary spinning, the applied treatments vary, depending on the final product and the processed fibre.
Two simplified process sequences can be identified for this stage: Ã¯Â¿Â½ process for the manufacturing of continuous filament in flat or texturised form Ã¯Â¿Â½ process for the manufacturing of staple fibres.
20 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Continuous flat filament Possible points of spin finish application Primary spinning Drawing (dry) Continuous texturised filament Possible points of spin finish application Primary spinning Drawing (dry) Texturising (oven up to 500 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) To reestablish the amount of spin finish lost in the texturing process Staple fibre Possible points of spin finish application Primary spinning Drawing (wet) (in aqueous bath with preparation agents) Heat-setting (170 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) If needed Crimping Cutting As shown in the diagrams above, preparation agents can be applied at various stages during the manufacturing of the chemical fibres.
Application of preparation agents in primary spinning (fibre manufacturing) is usually followed by further additions during secondary spinning, when the yarn is manufactured (see Section 2.4).
The preparation agents need to be removed to ensure uniform penetration of dyes and finishing agents and to avoid reaction or precipitation with them.
Due to their high organic content and their often-low bioeliminability, these substances are responsible for wastewater pollution and air emission in the subsequent fibre pre-treatment.
Particularly relevant in this respect is the production of continuous filaments destined for the production of knitted fabric and the manufacturing of elastomeric fibres, because in this case the amount of preparation agents applied is higher.
The amount of preparation agents applied varies according to the fibre (e.g. PES, PA, etc.) and make-up (flat or texturised filament, staple fibre).
Information about the chemistry of the preparation agents and the amount applied on the fibre is given in Section 8.2.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 21 Chapter 2 2.3 Fibre preparation: natural fibres 2.3.1 Wool Wool is usually opened and de-dusted before it is fed to the scour.
This is a mechanical process designed to shake out dirt from the wool and open the fleeces in order to improve the efficiency of the scour in removing contaminants.
The process also roughly blends the wool and produces a layer of fibres suitable for presentation to the scour.
The opening and de-dusting processes vary considerably in severity depending on the characteristics of the particular wool being processed.
The process produces a solid waste comprising dirt, sand, fibre fragments and vegetable matter.
The object of subsequent raw wool scouring processes is to remove contaminants from the wool fibre and to make it suitable for further processing.
Almost all of the scouring plants are based upon aqueous washing.
Solvent scouring is much less widely practised.
According to [VITO] there are world-wide only about five companies that degrease with organic solvents.
2.3.1.1 Cleaning and washing with water A conventional wool scouring set is shown in Figure 2.2.
The process the wool through a series of 4 8 wash bowls, each followed by a which removes excess scouring liquor from the wool and returns it to added at the last bowl and passes via a counter-flow system from disharge from the first bowl in a controlled manner to drain.
is carried out by passing mangle or squeeze press the bowl.
Clean water is bowl to bowl with final Figure 2.2: Conventional wool scouring arrangement In the scouring bowls, suint is removed from the wool by dissolution, grease by emulsification and dirt by suspension.
For merino wools, the first bowl may be charged with water only and, in that case, its purpose is the removal of water-soluble suint before the wool enters the scouring process proper (this bowl is usually called "de-suint").
In order to achieve grease emulsification, the scouring bowls are charged with detergent and often with sodium carbonate, or other alkali, which acts as a detergent builder.
Concentrations of detergent and builder are usually highest in the first scour bowl and they decrease in subsequent bowls.
22 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Detergents used by scourers are mainly synthetic non-ionic surfactants, namely alcohol ethoxylates and alkylphenol ethoxylates.
Some scourers also report the use of "solvent-assisted detergents" for the removal of marking fluids from fleeces.
Finally, the wool is rinsed by passing it through bowls containing water only.
In coarse wool scouring plants the final bowl of the scouring train is sometimes used for chemical treatments.
In this case, it is isolated from the countercurrent liquor flow system and may also be isolated from the drain if the chemical treatment uses ecotoxic chemicals.
The most commonly used treatment is bleaching, in which hydrogen peroxide and formic or acetic acid are added to the bowl.
Other treatments sometimes applied include mothproofing, using a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide and acetic or formic acid, and sterilisation (of goat hairs) using formaldehyde.
Wool grease has a melting point around 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½C.
Since removal of solid grease from wool by detergents is slow and difficult, 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½C is the lowest temperature at which aqueous scouring liquors are effective for removing grease.
In addition, non-ionic detergents lose efficiency rather rapidly below 60 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, which means that scour and rinse bowls are typically operated at 55 - 70oC.
After leaving the final squeeze roller the wool will contain 40 to 60 % moisture.
It is therefore dried by convection in a hot-air drier.
The drier is usually heated either by closed steam pipes or by direct gas firing.
The heat supply to the drier may be controlled by a signal from a device which senses the humidity of the drier atmosphere or the moisture content of the wool at the output end, thus saving energy and avoiding overdrying the wool.
The mechanical design of wool scours and the arrangements for circulating the scour and rinse liquors vary widely.
Since these matters have a direct influence on energy and water usage, as well as the partial removal of contaminants from the effluent, it is important to illustrate them in more detail.
New generation scouring plants like the one illustrated in Figure 2.3 have an integrated system for grease and dirt recovery.

Opening of the valve may be under the control of a timer or may respond to a signal from a turbidity meter which senses the thickness of the dirt suspension in the hopper bottom.
The discharge from the scour bowl hopper bottoms is led to a heavy solids settling tank where it is gravity-settled and the settled liquor partly recycled to scour bowl 1 and partly discharged.
Flocculant may be added to the heavy solids settling tank to assist the separation of dirt, or a decanter centrifuge or hydrocyclone may be used in preference to gravity settling for dirt removal.
For grease recovery, modern scour bowls have a side tank in which the grease-rich liquors removed from the wool by the squeeze press are collected.
From here, part of the flow may be pumped to the previous bowl or, in the case of bowl 1, to a primary grease centrifuge.
The centrifuge separates the liquor into three phases.
The top phase, referred to as the cream, is rich in grease and passes to secondary and possibly tertiary centrifuges for further de-watering, finally producing anhydrous grease; the bottom phase is rich in dirt and goes to the heavy solids settling tank; the middle phase is impoverished in both grease and dirt compared with the input and this is split, part being recycled to scour bowl 1 and part being discharged.
In a commonly used variation of the above recycling arrangements, the dirt and grease removal and recycling loops may be combined.
In this case, scouring liquor may be removed from the bottoms of the bowls only, or from top and bottom, and passed first through the dirt removal equipment, then through the primary grease centrifuge.
Some scourers recycle rinse water (see Figure 2.3).
The flowdown from the first rinse bowl can be treated to make it suitable for addition to the feed to the final rinse bowl.
Normally, this is accomplished by removing dirt in a hydrocyclone and processing the water through a membrane filtration plant to remove other impurities.
It is normally necessary to purge dirty liquors which collect at the bottoms of the rinse bowls, but this is not always the case.
The dirt removal and grease recovery loops described above serve several purposes.
They save water, by recycling effluent to the scour, and they act as a process-integrated partial effluent treatment.
The recovered wool grease can be sold, although the market for this by-product has been variable in most recent years.
Finally, since the discharges from the loops are the only points at which heavily contaminated scour liquors are discharged, valves and meters at these points can be used to control the rate of water usage in the scouring section.
2.3.1.2 Environmental issues associated with wool scouring (with water) In this section we will discuss the environmental issues associated with the overall scouring process including the treatment of the process effluent.
The main environmental issues associated with the wool scouring process arise from emissions to water, but solid waste and the air emissions also need to be taken into account.
Potential for pollution of water The removal of contaminants present on the raw fibre leads to the discharge of an effluent in which the main polluting contributors are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ highly concentrated organic material in suspension and in solution, along with dirt in suspension Ã¯Â¿Â½ micro-pollutants resulting from the veterinary medicines applied to protect sheep from external parasites.
24 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 There are also detergents in the discharged water, which contribute to the increase of the chemical oxygen demand of the effluent.
The detergent is recycled via the grease recovery/dirt removal loop.
As a result, low efficiency in this recovery system is associated with higher amounts of detergent in the effluent.
Compared to the chemical oxygen demand attributable to wax, dirt, etc., the detergents can be considered minor contributors to water pollution, but this is not the case when harmful surfactants such as alkylphenol ethoxylates are used as detergents (for more detail on environmental issues, see Section 8.1).
As to the organic matter coming from wax and dirt, according to [Stewart, 1988] the COD of effluent and of greasy wool can be calculated using the following equation: COD(mg/l or mg/kg) = 8267 x suint(%) + 30980 x oxidised grease(%) + 29326 x top grease(%) + 6454 x dirt(%) + 1536.
Since the coefficients for top grease and oxidised grease2 in this equation are similar and since approximately equal quantities of top grease and oxidised grease are present in many wools, it is possible to combine the two grease terms the above equation as follows: COD (mg/l or mg/kg) = 8267 x suint(%) + 30153 x total grease(%) + 6454 x dirt(%) + 1536 It is then possible to calculate the COD content of "typical" merino and crossbred wools: Merino wool: suint = 8 %; grease = 13 %; dirt = 15 % COD = (8.267 x 8) + (30.153 x 13) + (6.454 x 15) + 1.536 = 556 g/kg greasy wool Crossbred wool: suint = 8 %; grease = 5 %; dirt = 15 % COD = (8.267 x 8) + (30.153 x 5) + (6.454 x 15) + 1.536 = 315 g/kg greasy wool.
These high levels of oxygen-depleting substances must be removed from the effluent before it can be discharged without potential for harmful effects.
Organohalogen, organophosphorus compounds and biocides are among the priority substances listed for emission control in the IPPC Directive.
Worldwide, the most common ectoparasiticides used for treating sheep are diazinon (OP), propetamphos (OP), cypermethrin (SP) and cyromazine (fly-specific IGR), for control of blowfly.
Insect growth regulators such as dicyclanil, diflubenzuron and triflumuron are registered only in Australia and New Zealand.
Organochlorine pesticides (in particular, hexachlorocyclohexane) are still found on wool coming from the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and some South American countries.
[INTERLAINE] (See also Section 2.1.1.9).
Concerning the fate of ectoparasiticides when they enter the scouring process, a distinction has to be made between lipophilic and hydrophylic compounds such as cyromazine.
OCs, OPs and SPs associate strongly with the wool grease and are removed with it during scouring (although a fraction (4 %) is retained by the fibre and will be released in the subsequent finishing wet processes).
This behaviour applies also to diflubenzuron (IGR).
Recent studies have shown that triflumuron associates partially with the dirt and partially with the grease and that consequently a higher proportion of the residue is likely to be retained on site.
[NRA] The water-soluble compounds cyromazine (11 g/l at 20 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) and dicyclanil are probably not removed from the effluent stream except by evaporating treatments.
2 Top grease is unoxidised grease which is readily separated from scour liquors by centrifuging; oxidised grease is less hydrophobic and is less readily separated.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 25 Chapter 2 In the following wastewater treatment systems an additional fraction of these residues is removed.
Physico-chemical separation techniques remove the biocide residue at approximately the same rate as the grease and the dirt with which they are associated.
On the other hand, evaporation systems remove OCs and SPs in significant quantities, but up to 30 % of the OPs may appear in the condensate because they are steam volatile.
[INTERLAINE] Despite these treatments, the removal of pesticides is often incomplete and there is potential for pesticides to enter the aquatic environment when the effluent is discharged.
The environmental concentrations of ectoparasiticides in the receiving water depend greatly on local circumstances, in particular, the amount of scouring activity concentrated in a given catchment and the dilution available between scouring discharges and the river which receives the treated effluent.
In areas of Europe with a high concentration of scouring activity, there is a risk of high concentration levels of pesticides in the receiving water.
In this case, it is preferable to define discharge limits on the basis of risk assessment models.
In UK for example, statutory environmental quality standards (EQS) for the OCs and non-statutory standards for the OPs and cypermethrin have been defined.
Discharge limits (given in g/tonne of greasy wool) are set up for processing mills by comparing the given EQS targets with predicted environmental concentrations based on tonnage of wool processed and typical effluent treatment systems.
The control of the discharge limits at the scouring mills is carried out by using data from the ENCO wool 
Potential for pollution of land Two main "wastes", grease and sludge, are produced as a consequence of the scouring activities (and related effluent treatment).
Depending on its oxidation extent, it may be possible to recover from 20 to 40 % of the grease initially present on the raw wool.
This is usually regarded as a by-product rather than a waste, since it can be sold to lanolin refiners.
However, high levels of pesticides residues in the grease can also be a problem for the lanolin refiners, especially for the production of lanolin-based pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, since more expensive and sophisticated techniques have to be used to remove the pesticides to acceptable levels.
Acid-cracked grease has no market value and has to be landfilled.
The sludge produced as a grease, dirt and the portion Concentrates and sludges which is mainly potassium result of physico-chemical treatment of wastewater also contains of pesticides which are strongly associated with either grease or dirt.
from evaporation or membrane filtration may also contain suint, chloride and potassium salts of fatty acids.
Sludge and concentrate disposal may follow several routes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ incineration (with heat recovery) Ã¯Â¿Â½ pyrolysis/gasification Ã¯Â¿Â½ brick manufacturing Ã¯Â¿Â½ composting or co-composting with other organic material Ã¯Â¿Â½ landfill.
The first three sludge disposal routes listed destroy the organic material in the sludge, including grease and pesticides.
The ash from incineration may contain potassium salts, derived from suint, and heavy metals characteristic of the soil on which the sheep producing the wool have grazed.
The ash is normally disposed of to landfill.
The characteristics of the char from pyrolysis/gasification are unknown and this char is also typically disposed of to landfill.
The use 26 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 of wool scour sludges in brick manufacture results in no residues for immediate disposal.
These three sludge disposal methods probably have the least potential to pollute land.
Wool scour sludges cannot be composted alone, but require the addition of carbon-rich organic material.
Green waste from agriculture or horticulture has been used.
Composting is not yet regarded as a fully developed, fail-safe technique and only partly degrades the pesticides present in the sludge.
However, since the pesticides present in the sludge are there because of their lipophilicity or their strong propensity to absorb onto solids, they are likely to be immobile in soil, and spreading of compost derived from wool scour sludges on agricultural land is unlikely to pose an environmental risk of any significance.
Landfill is the simplest and often cheapest method of disposal of sludges.
In the longer term, however, landfill is not believed to be either economically or environmentally sustainable.
The fate of wool scour sludges in landfill is not known, but there is a small potential for the ectoparasiticides present to arise in leachate.
Anaerobic degradation of the organic material in the sludge will give rise to methane emissions.
Potential for pollution of air Air pollution is not a main issue for wool scouring processes.
Nevertheless two issues can be mentioned.
Hot acid cracking, which involves heating the scour effluent with sulphuric acid, when used near residential areas, has been the subject of odour complaints.
Incineration is used in conjunction with evaporation of the effluent because the surplus heat from the incinerator can be used in the evaporation process.
Incineration of wool scour sludges has potential for air pollution.
Since sludges contain relatively high levels of chloride (from suint) as well as organically bound chlorine from ectoparasiticides etc., there is potential for the production of polychlorodibenzodioxins and furans, when they are incinerated.
The sludges also contain relatively high levels of sulphur and nitrogen and the combustion process therefore produces SOX and NOX. 2.3.1.3 Cleaning and washing with solvent ? 2.3.2 Cotton and flax Cotton is a much cleaner raw fibre than wool and initial operations are mainly dry.
The fibres are supplied to the spinning mill in compressed bales.
The fibres are sorted by grade, cleaned to remove particles of dirt and blended with fibres from different bales to improve the consistency of the fibre mix.
Sorting and cleaning is performed in machines known as openers.
With flax, the isolation of the fibre from the flax stem is done in different steps.
After crop (plucking) the flax is retted (dew retting, water retting, enzymatic, microbiotic, steam or chemical retting).
Pectinic and hemicellulosis substances are degraded in this step.
Rovings are produced by further mechanical treatment before spinning.
2.3.3 Silk For silk production the silk worm is killed with steam and the filament is unwound directly from the cocoon.
The filament is submitted to pre-treatment processes to remove the silk gum and other organic impurities.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 27 Chapter 2 2.4 Yarn manufacturing Almost all textile apparel products are made from spun yarns of either 100 % natural fibres, or 100 % man-made staple fibres or blends.
Only a few apparel products, for instance smooth sportswear, are made of filament yarns exclusively.
Spinning is the process by which staple fibres are transformed into yarn suitable for the textile industry.
There are two main spinning processes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the wool spinning process Ã¯Â¿Â½ the cotton spinning process.
2.4.1 The wool spinning system The wool spinning process is mainly used to produce wool and wool-blend yarns.
A distinction is made between the worsted and woollen process.
In worsted spinning, higher-quality and longer fibres are processed and the result is a fine yarn which is used to produce worsted fabric.
In the woollen spinning system, shorter fibres are processed.
In both the woollen and worsted systems the various fibres (e.g. wool fibres from different sources, different types of synthetic fibres) are combined during the blending operation.
In order to allow efficient mechanical processing in the subsequent operations, fibre lubricants are applied to the fibres at this stage (or later before or after carding, depending on the system applied).
In the worsted system the fibres are paralleled in a combing machine and are then drawn and spun.
In the woollen system the fibres are only carded and then spun.
The resulting yarn is then twisted (if required) and finally prepared for the subsequent treatments (dyeing, weaving, tufting, etc) through an operation called winding.
The environmental implications of the yarn production stage for the subsequent finishing steps of the textile chain originate from the lubricants applied in the oiling stage.
Since lubricants need in general to be completely removed before dyeing, they are found in wastewater from finishing mills.
Lubricants are generally sold in aqueous solution (50 % oil and 50 % water), which are further diluted before use in spinning mills.
Water-soluble synthetic oils are generally used.
Mineral oils are sometimes used, too, but in smaller quantities.
In addition, spinning formulations contain a surfactant to improve the oil-removal during washing and, sometimes, antistatic agents, especially with of synthetic fibres.
In most cases surfactants are based on APEOs.
In the carpet industry, mothproofing agents can also be present in the formulations.
Emissions of hard-to-biodegrade organic substances such as mineral oils and hazardous compounds such as APEOs and pesticides (only when mothproofing agents are applied) that are, need to be taken into account.
Additional information about spinning oils is given in Section 8.2.
It is, however, difficult to analyse in more detail the environmental aspects associated with the use of these substances because of the large variety of commercial products.
Spinning mills usually buy lubricants from dealers, who buy chemical products from large chemical producers, and mix them according to the specific needs of each spinning mill.
This makes even more difficult the identification of the chemical substances present on the yarn when this enters the finishing mill.
Moreover, a distinction must be made between fabric derived from carded process) and fabric manufactured using combed yarn (worsted process).
There difference, in fact, not only from a mechanical point of view, but also in lubricants applied (which reaches approximately 5 % in the woollen process, but worsted process). yarn (woollen is a substantial the quantity of only 1 % in the 28 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.4.2 The cotton spinning system The cotton spinning system is generally used for cotton and man-made fibres.
As has already been described in Section 2.3.2, cotton fibres are first submitted to opening and cleaning operations.
The following steps, which are the same for cotton and man-made fibres, are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ carding Ã¯Â¿Â½ combing Ã¯Â¿Â½ drawing Ã¯Â¿Â½ roving Ã¯Â¿Â½ spinning Ã¯Â¿Â½ twisting (if required) Ã¯Â¿Â½ winding.
In the case of synthetic fibres an extra amount of preparation agents is applied to the fibre at the yarn manufacturing stage.
This amount is especially relevant in the case of elastomeric fibres where the final content of preparation agents (mainly silicone oils) can reach 6 % on the weight of the fibre.
These substances will be removed during the pre-treatment processes in the finishing mills, thus increasing the organic load of the resulting emissions.
2.5 Cloth production Raw materials for cloth production are spun yarns and filament yarns.
These raw materials can then be converted into: Ã¯Â¿Â½ woven textiles Ã¯Â¿Â½ knitted textiles Ã¯Â¿Â½ floor-coverings.
The last item covers a number of different end-products which are typical of the carpet industry.
2.5.1 Woven textiles 2.5.1.1 Warping Before weaving, warp yarns are wound onto beams in a process called warping.
During this operation there is no consumption of auxiliary agents that could have a negative influence on the emissions from the subsequent finishing processes.
2.5.1.2 Sizing In order to lubricate and protect the warp yarn during weaving, sizing agents (in the form of water solutions or water dispersions) are applied after warping.
The main sizing agents can be grouped into two classes: a) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sizing agents on base of native polysaccharides: starch starch derivates such as carboximethyl starch or hydroxiethyl starch ether cellulose derivates, especially carboximethyl cellulose (CMC) galactomannans protein derivates.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 29 Chapter 2 b) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fully synthetic polymers polyvinyl alcohols (PVA) polyacrylates polyvinyl acetate polyester The ratio of synthetic sizing agents to native sizing agents is about 1:3 (in Germany) (?).
It is important to bear in mind that: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the type of sizing agent applied varies according to the fibre concerned Ã¯Â¿Â½ sizing agent formulations are usually mixtures of the substances mentioned above.
Moreover additional auxiliaries are present in the sizing mixtures.
These are mainly [ULLMANN'S]: Ã¯Â¿Â½ viscosity regulators: complex formation between borax and the hydroxyl groups of starch increases the viscosity of the paste, while urea reduces it.
Important viscosity regulators include starch-degrading agents such as oxodisulphates, peroxosulphates that act by oxidative cleavage of the macromolecules. Ã¯Â¿Â½ sizing fats: are used to improve the weaving behaviour of the warp.
Suitable materials include sulphated fats and oils and mixtures of fatty acid esters with non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers. Ã¯Â¿Â½ antistatic agents (mainly based on polyglycol ethers). Ã¯Â¿Â½ wetting agents: fatty alcohols poly(glycol ethers) with a low degree of ethoxylation. Ã¯Â¿Â½ de-foaming agents: their addition is often necessary when the sizing agents tend to produce foam (e.g. with PVA) or if wetting agents are added.
Suitable products are based on paraffin oils, phosphoric esters, fatty acid esters or silicone oils. Ã¯Â¿Â½ preservatives: for sizing liquors that are stored for long periods and contain degradable components such as starch and starch derivatives, fungicides and/or bacteriocides are added.
Typical preservatives include formaldehyde, phenol derivatives, heterocyclic compounds of the isothiazoline type.
Sizing agents are introduced by the weaving firm, but have to be removed by the finisher (during the operation called desizing).
This desizing process results in high wastewater loads.
In the case of woven fabric, sizing agents can represent 30 70 % of the total COD load in wastewater.
The lower percentage is for finishing of woven fabric mainly consisting of flat filament yarns and the higher for staple fibres, especially for cotton and in case of native sizing agents.
Therefore it is important to know the COD of these substances and their characteristics in terms of biodegradability and bio-eliminability.
The additives present in the formulations also influence the aquatic toxicity and BOD of the resulting emissions.
Section 8.3 gives more details about: Ã¯Â¿Â½ characteristics of the chemical substances commonly used as sizing agents and specific COD and BOD5 values Ã¯Â¿Â½ typical amounts applied on the various fibres.
2.5.1.3 Weaving Weaving is the process by which yarns are assembled together on a loom and a woven fabric is obtained.
The process only requires electricity.
Lubricants and oils are used to lubricate the loom, but in particular cases they may contaminate the fabric.
30 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.5.2 Knitted textiles 2.5.2.1 Waxing Before knitting, the yarn is lubricated or waxed (generally with paraffin wax) to allow knitting at higher speed and protect the yarn from mechanical stresses.
Waxing may be done while rewinding the yarn onto bobbins, in which case the process is normally called "preparation for knitting".
2.5.2.2 Knitting Like weaving, knitting is a mechanical process and involves knotting yarn together with a series of needles.
Mineral oils are generally used to lubricate the needles and other parts of the knitting machinery.
The quantity of oils used depends on the technology of the machine and on the speed of the needles; the value ranges between 0.2 and 0.3 % of the weight of the fabric.
The oil and the wax that remain on the final fabric will be washed out during the finishing treatments.
However, their contribution to the total pollution load coming from finishing mills is not significant.
2.5.3 Textile floor-coverings Textile floor-covering is a collective noun for articles having a usable surface of textile material.
This particular class of cloths can be schematically described as composite substrates made up of the following layers: Ã¯Â¿Â½ a carrier layer, which is mainly made of polypropylene strips of fabric (75 %), PP or PES webs (16 % and 8 %, respectively) and less commonly of jute fabric (1 %).
[VITO] Ã¯Â¿Â½ a pile yarn, which can equally well be made from filament or staple fibre yarns (mainly polypropylene, polyamide, polyester, wool). Ã¯Â¿Â½ a pre-coating layer, which is typical of tufted carpet and whose function is to anchor the pile onto the carrier layer.
This coating layer is made from synthetic rubber or an artificial dispersion based on carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber latex.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ a coating layer, which is an additional layer applied to the bottom side of the carpet.
We can distinguish between foam coating, textile backing coating and heavy coating methods.
The purposes of this final layer are various.
Mainly, it is intended to strengthen the attachement of the pile, improve dimensional stability of the carpet and provide the carpet with properties such as anti-slip, heat insulation, stepping elasticity, etc. (carpet coating techniques are described in more detail under the finishing treatments in Section 2.12).
This is, however, a very general definition.
In fact, the characteristics of the end product and the applied manufacturing techniques can vary significantly.
The principal methods of manufacturing carpet/floor-coverings are tufting, weaving and needling.
The best way to describe these techniques is probably to describe the different types of carpets.
2.5.3.1 Tufted carpet As the figure below shows, tufted carpets are made up of the following different components: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the face yarn (pile), which can be made from either staple fibres (PA, PP, PES, PAC, wool and cotton) or synthetic filaments Ã¯Â¿Â½ the primary backing (carrier layer) Ã¯Â¿Â½ the pre-coating layer Ã¯Â¿Â½ the back-coating layer (which can consist of a textile back-coating or of a foam coating layer).
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 31 Chapter 2 Figure 2.4: Cross-section of a tufted carpet In the tufting process, pile yarns are inserted by needles into a woven or non-woven carrier material (primary backing), made of polypropylene, polyester or jute, across the entire width of the substrate (up to 5m).
During subsequent manufacturing processes the base of the pile yarn is anchored in the back of the carpet by means of an applied coating.
Figure 2.5 is a simplified representation of a tufting plant.
Figure 2.5: Simplified representation of a tufting plant Through variations of the tufting technique, different three-dimensional pile structure can be produced as well as patterned carpets (e.g. level loop pile, multi-level loop pile, cut and loop, velvet and velour, saxony).
Figure 2.6 shows two examples of carpet styles are shown.
32 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Figure 2.6: A: Level loop pile; B: Cut and loop pile 2.5.3.2 Needle-felt carpet Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.8 show the manufacturing process for needle felt carpets.
The fibres lie criss-cross to each other and are compressed with needles.
This compression is fixed with binding agents [VITO].
Needle-pile carpets can consist of one or several layers, with or without a carrier layer.
They may be equipped with various types of backings (textile backing, foam, heavy coating).
For lasting binding of the fibres, the needled substrate is subsequently subjected to further thermal or chemical treatment (chemical reinforcement).
Figure 2.7: Manufacture of needle-felt carpet Almost all fibres may be used for the production of needle felts; however, man-made fibres are mostly used (PP, PA, PES, PAC, wool, jute/sisal, viscose).
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 33 Chapter 2 Figure 2.8: Production line for needle-felt carpets 2.5.3.3 Woven carpet The manufacturing process for woven carpets is similar to manufacturing of any other woven good (IS THE WARP SIZED OR NOT IN THE CASE OF CARPET MANUFACTURING?).
A scheme of the production process for woven carpets is reported in Figure 2.9.
Figure 2.9: Representation of the production process for woven carpets As a rule, woven carpets are provided with a stabilising back-coating.
Only in rare cases is an additional heavy coating (e.g. PVC or bitumen) applied.
34 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.6 Pre-treatment before colouring Pre-treatment processes should ensure: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the removal of foreign materials from the fibres in order to improve their hydrophilic characteristics and their affinity for dyestuffs and finishing treatments Ã¯Â¿Â½ the improvement of the ability to absorb dyes (which is the case in mercerising) Ã¯Â¿Â½ the relaxation of tensions in synthetic fibres (without this relaxation of tension, unevenness and dimension instabilities can occur).
The position of pre-treatment within the production scheme is closely related to the position of dyeing in the sequence.
The point is that pre-treatment comes immediately before dyeing (and printing).
Pre-treatment processes and techniques depend: Ã¯Â¿Â½ on the kind of fibre to be treated: for raw goods made of natural fibres such as cotton, wool, flax and silk the technical task is more difficult than for those made of synthetic and artificial fibres.
Natural fibres in fact are accompanied by a higher amount of substances that can interfere with later processing.
Man-made fibres, in turn, usually contain only preparation agents, water-soluble synthetic size and soil which simple washing processes can remove.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ on the form of the fibre (flock, yarn, woven or knitted fabrics) Ã¯Â¿Â½ on the amount of material to be treated (for example, continuous methods are more efficient, but are economically viable only for large production capacities).
Pre-treatment operations are often carried out in the equipment in which the material is subsequently dyed.
For ease of reading of this part of the document, machines that are not specific to a given treatment are described in a separate annex (see Section 10).
2.6.1 Pretreatment of cotton 
Some of these treatments are obligatory steps only for certain make-ups (e.g. desizing is carried out only on woven fabric).
Moreover some of these treatments are often combined together in one single step in order to respond to the need to reduce production time and space as much as possible.
Nevertheless, for practical reasons they will be described as separate treatments, leaving the discussion about specific make-ups to the following sections.
Singeing Singeing can be carried out both on yarns and fabrics, but it is more common on fabrics, especially on cotton, cotton/PES and cotton /PA substrates.
Protruding fibre ends at the fabric surface disturb the surface appearance and produce an effect known as "frosting" when dyed.
It is therefore necessary to remove the surface fibres by passing the fabric through a gas flame.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 35 Chapter 2 The fabric is passed over a row of gas flames and then immediately into a quench bath to extinguish the sparks and cool the fabric.
The quench bath often contains a desizing solution, in which case the final step in singeing becomes a combined singeing and desizing operation.
Singeing has no effect on the effluents because only cooling water is necessary.
As far as air emissions are concerned, relatively strong odours and dust emissions are observed.
[EURATEX] Desizing Desizing is used for removing from woven fabric sizing compounds previously applied to warp (see Section 2.5.1.2) and is usually the first wet finishing operation performed on woven fabric.
Desizing techniques are different depending on the kind of sizing agent to be removed.
Currently applied techniques can be categorised as follows: 1.
techniques for the removal of starch-based sizing agents (water-insoluble sizes) 2.
techniques for the removal of water-soluble sizes.
1.
Techniques for the removal of starch-based sizes Starch-based sizes are difficult to remove and require either bacterial action of an enzyme or other chemical treatment in order to be converted into a washable form.
This chemical degradation is mainly achieved by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ enzymatic desizing Ã¯Â¿Â½ oxidative desizing.
Enzymatic desizing is the most widely used method for the removal of starch, amylases being particularly suitable.
The advantage in the use of enzymes is that starches are decomposed without damaging cellulose fibre.
In order to reduce the number of steps in the pre-treatment process, it is common practice to combine desizing with cold bleaching in a single step.
In this case the process is also called "oxidative desizing".
The fabric is impregnated in a bath containing hydrogen peroxide and caustic soda, together with hydrogen peroxide stabilisers and complexing agents.
Persulphate is also usually added to the solution.
Due to the action of NaOH, this treatment, beside a desizing/bleaching effect, also serves as prescouring treatment.
Furthermore, oxidative desizing is particularly useful when the textile contains enzyme poisons (fungicides) or when sizes are present that are difficult to degrade.
However, because starch scarcely differs from cellulose in the cross-linking of the cellulose rings, chemical oxidation, if not well controlled, can damage the fibre.
Desizing is usually carried out in pad-batch.
The fabric is impregnated in a padder with the desizing solution.
It is then rolled-up on a beam and kept in slow rotation for some hours.
Sometimes (only for big lots and with enzymes that are stable under steaming conditions) a padsteam process can be applied.
After the reaction time, the fabric is thoroughly washed in hot water (95 Ã¯Â¿Â½C).
36 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.
Techniques for the removal of water soluble sizes For the removal of water-soluble sizes such as PVA, CMC and polyacrylates, theoretically, only washing with hot water and sodium carbonate is needed for desizing.
However, the washing efficiency can be increased by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ adding suitable auxiliaries (wetting agents) to the desizing liquor (with some restrictions in case of size recovery) Ã¯Â¿Â½ allowing adequate time for immersion in the desizing liquor (this ensures maximum liquor pick-up and adequate time for the size to swell) Ã¯Â¿Â½ washing thoroughly with hot water in order to remove the solubilised size.
In this case is the process carried out in normal washing machines (?) Mercerising Mercerising is carried out in order to improve tensile strength, dimensional stability and lustre of cotton.
Moreover an improvement in dye uptake is obtained (a reduction of 30 50 % of dyestuff consumption can be achieved thanks to the increased level of exhaustion).
Mercerising can be carried out on yarn, woven and knitted fabric through one of the following different treatments: Ã¯Â¿Â½ mercerising with tension Ã¯Â¿Â½ caustisizing (without tension) Ã¯Â¿Â½ ammonia mercerising.
Mercerising with tension Caustic soda mercerising is the most commonly applied mercerising technique (it is not applied to flax).
Cotton is treated under tension in a solution of concentrated caustic soda (270 300g NaOH/l, which means also 170 350 g NaOH/kg) [UBA] for approximately 40 - 50 seconds.
During mercerising the temperature is adjusted at low values (5 - 18 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) when the lustre is the priority and at slightly higher levels when the improvement of the other characteristics is preferred.
Because the reaction between caustic soda and cellulose is exothermic, cooling systems are applied to keep down the temperature of the bath.
Beside the conventional cold treatment, a hot mercerising process is also now commonly applied (is it used only for fabric(?).
The material is soaked in a solution of caustic soda close to boiling point.
After hot stretching, the fabric is cooled down to ambient temperature and washed under tension.
In order to ensure a homogeneous penetration of the liquor, especially when operating at ambient temperature, wetting agents are employed.
Sulphonates mixed with non-ionic surfactants and phosphoric esters are the most commonly used.
Caustisizing In the caustisizing process, the material is treated at 20 30 Ã¯Â¿Â½C with caustic soda at lower concentration (145 190 g/l) without applying tension.
The material is allowed to shrink, thus improving the dye absorption.
Ammonia mercerising Cotton yarn and fabric can be treated with anhydrous liquid ammonia as an alternative to caustic soda.
Effects similar to mercerising are obtained, although the lustre grade is inferior to caustic VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 37 Chapter 2 soda mercerising.
Traces of ammonia have to be removed, preferably with dry heat treatment followed by steaming.
Is this method used in practice (?) Two examples of mercerising machines respectively for woven fabric (Figure 2.1) and for knitted fabric in tubular form (Figure 2.11) are reported below.
Figure 2.10: Example of Mercerising equipment for woven fabric Figure 2.11: Example of Mercerising equipment for knitted fabric in tubular form Scouring (alkaline extraction) Scouring (also known as boiling-off or kier boiling) is aimed at the extraction of impurities present on the raw fibre or picked up at a later stage such as: Ã¯Â¿Â½ pectins Ã¯Â¿Â½ fat and waxes Ã¯Â¿Â½ proteins Ã¯Â¿Â½ inorganic substances, such as alkali metal salts, calcium and magnesium phosphates, aluminium and iron oxides Ã¯Â¿Â½ sizes (when scouring is carried out on woven fabric before desizing) Ã¯Â¿Â½ residual sizes and sizing degradation products (when scouring is carried out on woven fabric after desizing).
38 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Scouring can be carried out as a separate step of the process or in combination with other treatments (usually bleaching or desizing) on all kind of substrates: woven fabric (sized or desized), knitted fabric and yarn.
For yarn and knitted fabric, scouring is a batch process which is carried out in the same equipment that will subsequently be used for dyeing (mainly autoclaves or hank dyeing machines for yarn and overflows, jets, etc. for knitted fabric).
Woven fabric is scoured in continuous mode using the pad-steam process.
The action of scouring is performed by the alkali (sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate) together with auxiliaries, which include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ non-ionic (alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates) and anionic (alkyl sulphonates, phosphates, carboxylates) surfactants Ã¯Â¿Â½ NTA, EDTA, DTPA, gluconic acid, phosphonic acids as complexing agents, which are used to remove metal ions (and, in particular, iron oxides, which catalyse the degradation reaction of cellulose when bleaching with hydrogen peroxide) Ã¯Â¿Â½ polyacrylates and phosphonates as special surfactant-free dispersing agents Ã¯Â¿Â½ sulphite and hydrosulphite as reducing agents (to avoid the risk of formation of oxycellulose when bleaching with hydrogen peroxide).
Bleaching After scouring, cotton becomes more hydrophilic.
However, the original colour stays unchanged due to coloured matter that cannot be completely removed by washing and alkaline extraction.
When the material has to be dyed in dark colours it can be directly dyed without need of bleaching.
When it has to be dyed in pastel colours or it needs to be subsequently printed, however, bleaching is an obligatory step in the pre-treatment process.
Bleaching can be performed on all kinds of make-ups (yarn, woven and knitted fabric).
The most frequently used bleaching agents are the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Ã¯Â¿Â½ sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) Ã¯Â¿Â½ sodium chlorite (NaClO2).
Apart from these, peracetic acid is also applicable.
[UBA, 1994] Bleaching with hyd
The textile is treated in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide, caustic peroxide stabilisers at pH 12 - 12.5.
Sodium silicate together with Mg salts and sequestering/complexing agents (EDTA, DTPA, NTA, gluconates, polyacrylates) are commonly used as stabilisers.
Operating temperatures range from ambient to high temperature.
Nonetheless, a good bleaching operating at around 60 80 Ã¯Â¿Â½C. soda and hydrogen (MgCl2 or MgSO4) phosphonates and can vary in a wide action occurs when Other auxiliaries used in hydrogen peroxide bleaching are surfactants with emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties.
Employed surfactants are usually mixtures of anionic compounds (alkyl sulphonates and alkyl aryl sulphonates) with non-ionic compounds such as alkylphenol ethoxylates or the biologically degradable fatty alcohol ethoxylates [ULLMANN'S].
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 39 Chapter 2 Bleaching with hydrogen peroxide in weakly acidic conditions (pH range of 6.5 8) is also possible in some cases (e.g. when treating cotton in blends with alkali-sensitive fibres such as wool).
At these pH conditions' activators are required to give bleaching activity.
A wide range of bleaching processes can be used, including cold pad-batch, bleaching under steaming conditions and bleaching processes in long bath.
Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite The high reactivity of this bleaching agent imposes softer operative conditions than hydrogen peroxide (pH 9 - 11 and temperatures not above 30 Ã¯Â¿Â½C).
Otherwise there is a risk of damage to the cellulose fibre.
The bleaching stage is followed by an anti-chlorine treatment in order to eliminate completely the hypochlorite and decompose the chloroamines generated during bleaching.
The use of hypochlorite as bleaching agent is in decline for ecological reasons.
It can still be found in particular cases for yarn and knitted fabric when a high degree of whiteness is required.
When the textile material is bleached with hypochlorite a two-stage process is applied in which hypochlorite is used in the first step and hydrogen peroxide is used in the second one.
What processes are used when bleaching with sodium hypochlorite (?) Bleaching with sodium chlorite Chlorite bleaching can be applied to cotton, flax and other cellulosic fibres, often in combination with hydrogen peroxide.
The material is bleached by padding or in long bath processes.
The chlorite method is still found for knitted fabric (in continuous processes where the fabric is processed in rope form), but its importance is also in decline for ecological reasons.
Bleaching with peracetic acid Is peracetic acid used in practice (?) 2.6.1.2 Environmental issues The main environmental issues associated with cotton pretreatment arise from emissions to water.
The characteristics of the emissions vary according to a number of factors: the make-up, the sequence adopted, the fact that some treatments are often combined in a single step, etc.
The most relevant issues are highlighted below for the various operations involved in pretreatment.
Desizing and scouring In a typical mill processing cotton or cotton-blend woven fabric, desizing represents the main emission source in the overall process.
As already stated in Section 2.5.1.2, the washing water from desizing may contain up to 70 % of the total COD load in the final effluent, especially in the case of native sizing agents.
Neither enzymatic nor oxidative desizing allows size recovery, while for some synthetic sizing agents size recovery is technically feasible, but difficult to apply for commission companies.
40 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Compared to woven cotton fabric, the removal of contaminants from yarn and knitted fabric is less significant in terms of pollution load.
Nevertheless, consideration must be given to the COD load associated with the removal of knitting oils (for knitted fabric), spinning oils and preparation agents (when cotton is in blend with synthetic fibres) and the biodegradability of these compounds.
Substances such as synthetic ester oils are readily emulsified or soluble in water and easily biodegraded.
More problems are posed by the presence of substances that are difficult to emulsify and poorly biodegradable such as silicone oils, which are found in cotton blends with elastan.
Mercerising Mercerising is responsible for a large amount of strong alkali that is discharged in wastewater and needs to be neutralised.
The corresponding salt is formed after neutralisation.
In this respect, the cold process involves higher emission loads than the hot one.
In order to allow the required retention time and make possible the cooling of the bath in continuous mode, a portion of the bath needs to be taken out and cooled down in continuous mode.
This means that higher volumes of bath are necessary in cold mercerising, which result also in higher emissions if the caustic soda is not recovered.
Bleaching with hydrogen peroxide The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which takes place during the bleaching reaction, forms only water and oxygen.
However, environmental concerns associated with the use of stabilisers have to be taken into account.
These products may contain complexing agents such as EDTA, DTPA and phosphonates with poor bio-eliminability, which may pass undegraded through the wastewater treatment systems.
Their ability to form very stable complexes with metal makes the problem even more serious because they can mobilise heavy metals present in the effluent and release them in the receiving water.
It has been reported ([EURATEX]) that, depending on concentration, pH, time and temperature, effluents containing inorganic chlorides (e.g. NaCl from dyeing and printing, MgCl2 from finishing) can be oxidised to their chlorites/ hypochlorites when they are mixed with hydrogen peroxide bleach wastewater.
In this way AOX may be found in wastewater even if bleaching is carried out without chlorine-based bleaching agents.
However, experimental measurements have shown that this does not play an important role, if any.
[UBA, 1994].
The residual hydrogen peroxide in the effluent, which, due to its oxygen-reducing effect, contributes to increasing chemical oxygen demand of the final effluent, needs also to be taken into consideration [EURATEX].
Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite For ecological reasons the use of sodium hypochlorite is now limited in Europe to just a few particular cases, connected with knitted fabric and, in some cases, bleaching of yarn when a high degree of whiteness is required.
Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite leads, in fact, to secondary reactions that form organic halogen compounds, commonly quantified as AOX. Trichloromethane (which is suspected of being carcinogenic) accounts for the bulk of the compounds formed, but other chlorinating subsidiary reactions might occur, besides haloform reaction.
Bleaching with sodium chlorite Sodium chlorite bleaching is also responsible for AOX generation in the wastewater.
However, compared to sodium hypochlorite, the amount of AOX formed during chlorite bleaching is much lower (on average only 10 % to a maximum of 20 % of the amount of AOX generated by hypochlorite).
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 41 Chapter 2 Handling and storage of sodium chloride need particular attention because of toxicity and corrosion risks.
Mixtures of sodium chlorite with combustible substances or reducing agents can create problems, especially when they are subject to heat, friction or impact.
Sodium chlorite forms chlorine dioxide when put in contact with acids.
Moreover, sodium chloride decomposition produces oxygen, which supports combustion.
Sodium chlorite is also very corrosive and spillages need to be washed away with large amounts of water.
2.6.2 Wool preparation before colouring Typical preparation wet treatments applied on wool fibre before dyeing are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ carbonising Ã¯Â¿Â½ washing (scouring) Ã¯Â¿Â½ fulling Ã¯Â¿Â½ bleaching.
Other possible treatments are those that go under the definition of anti-felt and stabilisation treatments.
Although they are often carried out before dyeing, they are not obligatory preparation steps.
For this reason they have been described under finishing operations (Section 2.9.2.8).
2.6.2.1 Principal manufacturing processes Carbonising Sometimes scoured wool contains vegetable impurities that cannot always be completely removed through mechanical operations.
Sulphuric acid is the chemical substance used for destroying these vegetable particles and the process is called carbonising.
Carbonising can be carried out on floc/loose fibre or on fabric (this operation is not applied in the carpet sector).
Loose fibre carbonising is performed only on fibres that are later used to produce fine fabric for garments (worsted fabrics) and usually takes place at the scouring mill.
In typical equipment for carbonisation of loose fibre, the still damp scoured wool is soaked in a solution containing 6 9 % of mineral acid (generally sulphuric acid).
Excess acid and water are removed by pressing or by centrifugation until on average 5 7.5 % of sulphuric acid and 50 65 % of water remain.
The fibres are then dried at 65 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½C to concentrate the acid and baked at 105 130 Ã¯Â¿Â½C (carbonising).
As soon as the wool is dried, it is fed into a machine, which consists of two counter-rotating rolls.
These rolls crush the carbonised particles into very small fragments, which are then easily removed.
The addition of small quantities of detergent to the sulphuric acid improves the yield and reduces the attack on the wool.
In order to prevent the fibre from being gradually degraded, the pH is finally set to 6 by neutralisation with sodium acetate or ammonia.
Sulphuric acid can be replaced by gaseous HCl or by aluminium chloride.
The latter releases HCl when it is heated: this method is useful for the carbonisation of wool/synthetic fibres mixtures such as wool/PES, that are too sensitive to sulphuric acid.
After carbonising, the fibre can be carded and then spun before being dyed or it can be dyed directly in floc form.
42 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Fabric carbonising is typical of woollen fabrics.
The operation can be carried out by either the traditional or the more modern "Carbosol" system.
The conventional procedure is substantially similar to that used for loose fibre.
The fabric can be previously soaked in a water or solvent bath and squeezed, but this step is optional.
Then it is impregnated in a concentrated sulphuric acid solution (acidification) and squeezed (hydroextraction) before passing through the carbonising chamber.
The carbonised particles are then removed by mechanical action and subsequent washing.
In modern carbonising plants all these steps are carried out in continuous mode.
The "Carbosol" process, licensed by SPEROTTO RIMAR, uses an organic solvent instead of water.
The equipment consists of three units.
In the first one the fabric is impregnated with perchloroethylene, in the second the material is soaked in the sulphuric acid solution and in the third, carbonising and solvent evaporation take place.
At this stage the perchloroethylene is recovered by distillation in a closed loop.
The "Carbosol" system is reported to have several technical advantages over the traditional process.
The level of acidity of the fabric after carbonising is much lower and the risk of damage to the wool fibre is reduced.
Thanks to full recovery of the organic solvent, the process can also be considered more efficient from the environmental point of view.
Figure 2.12: Representation of a conventional carbonising installation Figure 2.13: "Carbosol" system VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 43 Chapter 2 Scouring Both yarn and fabric contain, besides accidental impurities, a certain amount of spinning oils and in some cases also sizing agents such as CMC and PVA.
All these substances need to be removed before dyeing in order to make the fibre more hydrophilic and allow the penetration of the fibre by dyestuffs.
As pointed out in Section 2.4.1, the percentage of spinning oils on woollen wool is quite relevant and it is always above 5 %, while on worsted wool it never reaches 2 %.
Typical substances that have to be removed by scouring can be classified as: Ã¯Â¿Â½ soluble in water Ã¯Â¿Â½ insoluble in water, but emulsifiable thanks to the action of surfactants Ã¯Â¿Â½ insoluble in water and non-emulsifiable (or difficult to emulsify) with surfactants.
These substances can be removed only by using organic solvents (in general, halogenated solvents like perchloroethylene).
As a result the material can be washed (scoured): Ã¯Â¿Â½ with water or Ã¯Â¿Â½ with solvent (dry cleaning) Water washing is carried out in neutral or weakly alkaline conditions (by sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) in the presence of detergents.
Commonly used detergents are mixtures of anionic and non ionic surfactants such as alkyl sulphates, fatty alcohols and alkylphenol ethoxylates.
In wool carpet yarn production the scouring process can include simultaneous chemical setting of yarn twist with reductive agents (sodium metabisulphite) and/or application of insect-resist agents.
Water scouring is normally a batch operation which is carried out in the equipment in which the textile material will be subsequently dyed.
This means that an autoclave is the commonly used equipment for yarn, while jets and overflows are the machines typically applied for fabric.
In this respect, the carpet sector is an exception.
Wool yarn for carpet is scoured on continuous or semi-continuous basis in tape scouring machines (hanks) or in package-to-package scouring machines (package yarn), where the yarn is passed through a series of interconnected bowls (see Section 2.13.5.1.2).
Dry cleaning is less common and is applied when the fabric is heavily soiled and stained with oils from the weaving or knitting process.
The most widely used solvent is perchloroethylene.
In some cases water and surfactants are added to the solvent to provide a softening effect.
Solvent washing can be carried out either in discontinuous mode in a tumbler (generally for knitted fabric) or in continuous mode in open-width (for woven and knitted fabric).
Impurities are carried away by the solvent, which is continuously purified and recycled in a closed loop.
Fulling This treatment takes advantage of the felting tendency typical of wool fibre when it is submitted to friction under hot humid conditions and is a typical pre-treatment for woollen fabric.
It is usually carried out after carbonising, but in some cases (e.g. heavy woollen fabrics) it can be done directly on raw fabric.
The material is kept in circulation in a bath containing fulling auxiliaries.
Both acids (pH 
Fulling auxiliaries available on the market, however, also produce excellent results under neutral conditions.
As a result, fulling either in acid or alkaline conditions is becoming less common.
After fulling, the fabric is washed.
44 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Machines specially designed for this process are still in use.
However, today they have been largely replaced by multifunctional machines, where both fulling and washing can be carried out, simply adjusting the set-up of the equipment.
Bleaching Wool is bleached with hydrogen peroxide (sodium hypochlorite may discolour and damage the wool).
An additional reductive bleaching is, however, indispensable for achieving high levels of whiteness (full bleach).
A typical reductive bleaching agent is sodium dithionite (hydrosulfite), which is often used in combination with optical brightners to enhance its effect.
In the oxidative bleaching step, hydrogen peroxide is applied in the presence of alkali and stabilisers, which slow down the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide.
When wool has been previously submitted to an anti-felt treatment it is preferable to use hydrogen peroxide in weakly acid conditions.
2.6.2.2 Environmental issues Wool pretreatment gives rise mainly to water emissions, although there are also specific operations (e.g. carbonising with the Carbosol system and dry cleaning) where halogenated (mainly perchloroethylene) solvents are employed.
The use of these solvents can produce not only emissions to air, but also contamination of soil and groundwater if their handling and storage is not done using the necessary precautions.
The process also involves the generation of exhausted active carbon from the solvent recovery system.
This solid waste has to be handled separately from other waste material and disposed of as hazardous waste or sent to specialised companies for regeneration.
Due to the predominantly batch nature of wool pretreatment operations for all types of makeups, the resulting emissions will be discontinuous and with concentration levels largely influenced by the liquor ratios used.
The pollutants that can be found in the wastewater, originate in part from the impurities that are already present on the fibre when it enters the process sequence and in part from the chemicals and auxiliaries used in the process.
Pollutants originating from impurities present on the raw material Residues of pesticides used to prevent the sheep becoming infested with external parasites can still be found on scoured wool in amounts which depend on the efficiency of the scouring process.
These are mainly organophosphates (OPs) and synthetic pyrethroid (SPs) insecticides and insect growth regulators (IGRs), but detectable residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCs) can be observed.
They partition between the fibre and the water according to their stronger or weaker lipophylic character and, as a consequence, traces of these compounds are released in the wastewater.
More information about ectoparasiticides can be found in Sections 2.1.1.9 and 2.3.1.2.
Spinning oils and glues (only for woven fabric) also represent an important issue in wool pretreatment: they are removed during the scouring process, contributing to the COD load in the final effluent.
Pollutants originating from chemicals and auxiliaries used in the process Considerable amounts of surfactants are used in pretreatment as detergents, wetting agents, etc.
Surfactants with good biodegradability with acceptable performance are now available.
Nevertheless, the use of alkylphenol ethoxylates is still common in some companies due to their VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 45 Chapter 2 low cost.
are under system of discussed Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) and in particular nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) pressure due to the reported negative effects of their metabolites on the reproduction aquatic species.
The environmental issues arising from surfactants in common use are in Section 8.1.
Other pollutants of concern that may be found in water effluent from pretreatment activities are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ reductive bleaching agents (contribute to oxygen demand in the wastewater) Ã¯Â¿Â½ poorly bio-eliminable complexing agents (e.g. EDTA, DTPA, phosphonates) from hydrogen peroxide stabilisers, etc.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ AOX from sodium hypochlorite bleaching.
More details regarding environmental issues associated with the above mentioned substances are given elsewhere in this document, in particular in Section 2.6.1.2 (AOX from sodium hypochlorite bleaching) and Section 8.5 (Products containing complexing agents).
2.6.3 Pre-treatment of silk (?) 2.6.4 Pre-treatment of synthetic material 2.6.4.1 Principal manufacturing processes Typical operations before colouring are washing and thermofixing (heat-setting).
Washing is necessary to remove from the yarn the preparation agents that have been applied to its surface in the previous treatments (2 3 % on the weight of the fibre).
Most preparation agents (about 95 %) are removed at this stage (ethoxylated fatty alcohols are commonly used as emulsifying agents).
Elastomeric fibres (elastan) are an exception because they contain up to 6 % of preparation agents mainly made up of silicone oils.
Silicones are more difficult to remove and partly still remain on the fibre (40 % of the initial add-on) after washing.
To improve their removal it is common practice to use ethoxylated nonylphenols.
When pre-treating woven fabric the removal of sizing agents is a crucial step.
The extraction of these substances is achieved thanks to the synergistic action of: Ã¯Â¿Â½ surfactants (non-ionic or mixtures of non-ionic and anionic): they act as wetting and emulsifying agents and promote the solubilisation of the size Ã¯Â¿Â½ complexing agents (e.g. phosphonates): they are used when there is a risk of re-precipitation of the components of the sizing agents.
An increase in hardness level can occur, particularly, in continuous lines when processing synthetic blends with cellulose fibres (characterised by the presence of Ca and Mg salts as natural impurities) Ã¯Â¿Â½ alkali (caustic soda or sodium carbonate): the alkali is chosen according to the sizing agent employed (for example for the removal of sizing agents based on polyacrylates ammonium salts the use of caustic soda is obligatory, while a polyester sizing agent would precipitate in the same pH conditions).
Thermofixation is also another important operation in synthetic fibres pre-treatment.
Its position within the process can be different, depending on the make-up and the fibre.
As a result the following possible sequences are possible: 1.
thermofixation washing dyeing 2.
washing thermofixation dyeing 3.
washing - dyeing - thermofixation.
46 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.6.4.2 Environmental issues Synthetic fibres contain several types of impurities that are imparted to the fibres before they reach the textile-finishing mill.
These impurities encompass: Ã¯Â¿Â½ polymer synthesis by products such as unreacted monomers (for example caprolactame, which is the monomer used for the production of PA 6, is emitted to air during thermal treatments) low-molecular-weight oligomers, and residual catalysts Ã¯Â¿Â½ preparation agents Ã¯Â¿Â½ sizing agents added before weaving.
Since all these substances are removed before dyeing and finishing, they are ultimately found in pre-treatment wastewater or in air emissions from high-temperature processes such as drying, and thermofixation.
The main environmental concerns associated with the discharge of these organic substances in water are high COD and BOD loads and aquatic toxicity.
In particular, the COD:BOD ratio is often high, indicating the potential for pass-through during treatment and subsequent discharge to the environment.
2.7 Dyeing In the following sections the general principles of dyeing and the most commonly used dyeing techniques for the different fibres are described.
For practical reasons, detailed information concerning dyeing auxiliaries, dyestuffs and dyeing equipment is given in specific annexes (namely, Sections 8.6, 9 and 10).
2.7.1 General principles of dyeing Dyeing is a method for colouring a textile material in which a dye is applied to the substrate in a uniform manner to obtain an even shade.
A dye is an organic molecule which contains a chromophoric group (conjugated system) capable of interacting with light, thus giving the impression of colour.
Textile dyeing involves the use of a number of different chemicals and auxiliaries to assist the dyeing process.
Some of them are process-specific, while others are also used in other operations.
Some auxiliaries (e.g. dispersing agents) are already contained in the dyestuff formulation, but more commonly auxiliary agents are added at a later stage to the dye liquor.
Since auxiliaries in general do not remain on the substrate after dyeing, they are ultimately found in the emissions.
Various dyeing techniques exist: Ã¯Â¿Â½
mass dyeing, in which a dye is incorporated in the synthetic fibre during its production (this technique will not be described in this document)
pigment dyeing, in which an insoluble pigment, without affinity for the fibre, is deposited onto the textile substrate and then fixed with a binder Ã¯Â¿Â½
dyeing processes which involve the diffusion of a dissolved (or at least partially dissolved) dye into the fibre.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 47 Chapter 2 This last group of processes is the one that will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
From a molecular point of view four different steps are involved: 1.
first, the dye, previously dissolved or dispersed in the dye liquor, diffuses from the liquor to the substrate 2.
the second step consists in the accumulation of the dye on the surface of the textile material.
This process is controlled by the affinity (substantivity) of the colourant for the fibre 3.
the dye diffuses/migrates into the interior of the fibre until this is uniformly dyed.
This step is much slower than the transport of the dye within the dye bath.
The penetration of the dye into the fibre requires that the fibre itself is accessible.
In the case of hydrophilic fibres the dye penetrates through the available micro-pores, while in hydrophobic fibres, whose molecular structure does not allow a continuous water phase, cavities need to be developed in order to make the penetration of the dye possible.
In general, access to the fibre is enhanced by temperature.
Hydrophobic fibres can only be penetrated by the dye above the glass transition temperature, which sometimes lies above 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C.
During the diffusion into the micro-pores an electrostatic barrier, which develops on the surface of the fibre, still has to be overcome.
In some cases large amounts of salt have to be added to the dyeing bath in order to reduce the electrostatic forces on the surface of the fibre and promote an even penetration of the dye. 4.
the dye must be anchored (fixation) to suitable places within the substrate.
Different mechanisms of fixation are known, ranging from chemical reaction of the dye with the fibre to form a covalent bond (reactive dyes) to formation of Van der Waals and other short range forces between the fibre and the dye (direct dyes).
This is more fully explained in Annex II. 2.7.2 Dyeing processes Textiles can be coloured at any of several stages of the manufacturing process so that the following colouring processes are possible: Ã¯Â¿Â½ flock or stock dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ top dyeing: fibres are shaped in lightly twisted roving before dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ tow dyeing: it consists in dyeing the mono-filament material (called tow) produced during the manufacture of synthetic fibres Ã¯Â¿Â½ yarn dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ piece (e.g. woven, knitted and tufted cloths) dyeing.
Dyeing can be carried out in batch or in continuous.
The choice between the two processes depends on the type of make-up, the chosen class of dye, equipment available and cost involved.
Both continuous and discontinuous dyeing involve the following steps: Ã¯Â¿Â½ preparation of the dye Ã¯Â¿Â½ dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ fixation Ã¯Â¿Â½ washing and drying.
Batch- dyeing In batch dyeing (also called exhaustion dyeing) a certain amount of textile material is loaded into a dyeing machine and brought to equilibrium with a solution containing the dye and the auxiliaries over a period of minutes to hours.
The dyeing process starts with the absorption of the colourant onto the external surface of the fibre, then the diffusion and migration of the colourant through the fibre takes place.
The use of chemicals and controlled temperatures accelerates and optimises exhaustion and fixation of the dye.
When the dyeing is judged to be on shade, the spent dyebath is drained and the textile material is washed to remove unfixed dyes and chemicals.
Washing is usually carried out in the same equipment.
However, separate washing machines can also be used in the case of fabric.
48 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 An important parameter in discontinuous dyeing is the liquor ratio of the equipment.
This is the weight ratio between the total dry material and the total liquor.
So, for example, a liquor ratio of 1:10 means that we have 10 litres of water on 1 kg textile material.
This parameter is very important because it influences the environmental impact of discontinuous dyeing processes.
Dyeing machines vary greatly in their liquor ratios, as shown in Table 2.2, and each type of machine has its own limitations and range of applicability to particular substrates.
Make-up Loose/stock fibre (also card sliver and tow) Yarn Bobbins/ cones Hank Woven and Rope knitted fabric, tufted carpet Open-width Source: (1) [RIZA] (2) [EPA]
Most commonly textiles are fed continuously in open width through a dip trough filled with dye liquor.
The substrate absorbs an amount of dye solution and leaves the dip trough through two rollers that control the pick-up of the dye.
The surplus of stripped dye flows back into the dye bath.
In the carpet industry, thickening agents are added to the pad liquor to prevent dye migration.
Moreover, special application systems are also encountered, where the dyestuff is poured, jet-sprayed or applied in the form of foamed liquor.
Dye fixation is usually achieved in a subsequent stage using chemicals or heat (steam or dry heat).
The final operation is washing, which is usually carried out in washing machines in the same line.
The only difference between continuous and semi-continuous processes consists in the fact that in semi-continuous dyeing the application of the dye is performed continuously by padding, while fixation and washing are discontinuous.
In general, dyes with low affinity are favoured in continuous dyeing to prevent tailing attributable to undesirable exhaustion of the padding solution and to make washing-off of the unfixed dye easier.
In these processes the factor to be taken into account is the pick-up % (grams of liquor picked up by 100 grams of substrate), while the liquor ratio is unimportant and it is not used.
An overview of the most common techniques and machinery in continuous and semi-continuous processes is given in Table 2.3.

On the contrary, it shows good affinity for dyes that are able to establish secondary or covalent bonds with the fibre.
Cellulose fibres can be dyed with a wide range of dyestuffs, namely: Ã¯Â¿Â½ reactive Ã¯Â¿Â½ direct Ã¯Â¿Â½ vat Ã¯Â¿Â½ sulphur Ã¯Â¿Â½ naphtol.
Reactive dyes One third of dyes used for cellulose fibres today are reactive dyes.
They are mostly applied according to the pad-batch process for woven fabric, while batch processes are the most common for knitted fabric, loose stock and yarn.
In batch dyeing, dye, alkali (sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate) and salt are added to the dyebath in one step, at the start of the process, or stepwise.
In the stepwise process the alkali is added only after the dye has absorbed to the fibre.
Its amount is determined by the reactivity of the system and the desired depth of shade (cold dyers are applied at lower pH compared to warm and hot dyers).
Salt is added to improve bath exhaustion: the concentration employed depends on the substantivity of the dye and on the intensity of the shade.
Higher concentrations are required for deep shades and low-affinity dyes, as shown in the table below.
Shade 
In pad dyeing processes dye and alkali can be added together or separately to the dye bath.
When all the chemicals are applied in one step, the stability of the pad liquor is important.
In fact with increasing reactivity of the dye there is a risk that the dye, after a long dwell time in the pad box, is hydrolysed by the alkali, before reacting with the fibre.
For this reason dye and alkali are commonly metered separately into the padder.
In addition, pad boxes are now constructed so that the liquor volume is as low as possible so that it is replaced on average within 5 minutes.
[ULLMANN'S] Among semi-continuous processes the cold pad-batch is by far the most important one for reactive dyes.
After the textile has been padded with dye and alkali, it is rolled up into batches.
Fixing takes place during storage.
In continuous processes, padding, fixing, washing off and drying are carried out in the same process line.
Fixation is commonly achieved either by dry-heating or by steaming.
The following processes are commonly used: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pad-steam process (dye application by padding - intermediate drying - alkali application by padding - dye fixation with saturated steam - washing - drying) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pad-dry process (dye and alkali are padded at the same time; then the material can be dried and fixed in a single step or it can be thermofixed after an intermediate drying stage).
In all cases, after fixation the material is always carefully washed off in open width or in a rope washing machine to remove completely the hydrolysed colorant and is then dried.
In continuous processes urea is usually added to the padding liquor to increase the solubility of the dye and to act as a solvent for the dye during fixation.
Direct dyes Direct dyes are also quite important in cellulose fibres dyeing: 75 % of the total consumption of these colorants is used, in fact, to dye pure cotton or viscose substrates [ULLMANN'S].
Direct dyes are applied directly from the dye bath together with salt (sodium chloride or sodium sulphate) and auxiliary agents, which ensure a thorough wetting and dispersing effect.
Mixtures of nonionic and anionic surfactants are used for this purpose.
In the batch process the dye is made into paste, then dissolved in hot water and added to the dye bath.
The electrolyte is then added to the dyebath.
After the dyebath has been drained, the fabric is washed with cold water and generally subjected to after-treatment.
Pad Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ processes encompass the following techniques: pad-steam pad-roll cold pad-batch pad-jig process (the material is padded with the dye and then passed through a salt liquor in a jigger).
In all processes the material is rinsed at the end with cold water.
With increasing depth of colour the wet fastness decreases to such an extent that after-treatment must generally be carried out.
[ULLMANN'S] Two methods exist: 1.
removing the unfixed dye by: a) washing with complexing agents or surfactants with a dispersing effect, b) reductive decomposition or c) extraction with an organic solvent VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 51 Chapter 2 2.
reducing the solubility of the dye by blocking the hydrophilic groups and/or enlarging the dyestuff molecules.
Various techniques can be applied to achieve this enlargement of the molecule.
Namely, the dyed textile can be treated with: Ã¯Â¿Â½ fixative cationic agents: these are complex substances that form with the anionic dye a saltlike compound less soluble than the original dye. Quaternary ammonium compounds with long hydrocarbon chains, polyamines and polyethyleneimine derivatives can be used for this purpose Ã¯Â¿Â½ metal salts: copper sulphate and potassium dichromate can form with certain azo dyes metal-complex with higher light fastness Ã¯Â¿Â½ agents based on formaldehyde condensation products with amines, polynuclear aromatic phenols, cyanamide or dicyandiamide (the use of these condensation products leads to the formation of sparingly soluble adducts with the dye molecules) Ã¯Â¿Â½ diazotised bases: after dyeing, the material is submitted to diazotisation and is then coupled with aromatic amines or phenols that must not contain hydrosolubilising groups [ULLMANN'S].
Environmental concerns arise when after-treating with formaldehyde condensation products or metal salts.
The method using fixative cationic agents is, therefore, the most frequently applied (?).
Vat dyes Vat dyes have excellent fastness properties when properly selected and are often used for fabrics that will be subjected to severe washing and bleaching conditions (towelling, industrial and military uniforms, etc.).
Vat dyes are normally insoluble in water, but they become water-soluble and substantive for the fibre after reduction in alkaline conditions (vatting).
They are then converted again to the original insoluble form by oxidation and in this way they remain fixed into the fibre.
When applying vat dyes in batch processes the textile is dyed very rapidly and unevenly due to the high affinity of the dye.
Nevertheless, level dyeing can be achieved by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ adding levelling agents Ã¯Â¿Â½ increase of the temperature under a controlled profile ("High Temperature" process and "Semi-pigmention" method) Ã¯Â¿Â½ impregnation of the textile with the dye as water-insoluble dispersion, followed by addition of the reductive agent in a subsequent step (pre-pigmentation process).
In all cases, oxidation and after-treatment follow.
After-treatment consists in washing the material in a weakly alkaline bath with a detergent at boiling temperature.
Continuous processes are used almost exclusively for dyeing woven fabrics and to only a small extent for knitwear.
The most commonly applied continuous process is the pad-steam process.
The textile is padded with the aqueous dye dispersion in the presence of anti-migrant (polyacrylates, alginates, etc.) and dispersing/wetting agents, if required.
After drying, the fabric is passed through a chemical padder, which contains the required amount of alkali and reducing agent and is fed immediately to a steamer.
The material is finally rinsed, oxidised and soaped in an open-width washing machine.
Voluminous open fabrics can be dyed according to a wet-steam process.
Unlike the pad-steam process, this process does not require intermediate drying before steaming.
52 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 The following chemicals and auxiliaries are applied in vat dyeing: Ã¯Â¿Â½ reducing agents: mainly sodium dithionite (hydrosulphite) and sulphoxylic acid derivatives (the latter, in particular, are used when the pad-steam process is applied).
Sulphur-free organic reducing agents such as hydroxyacetone are also now available for some applications.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ oxidising agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, perborate, or 3-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid Ã¯Â¿Â½ alkali (caustic soda) Ã¯Â¿Â½ salt Ã¯Â¿Â½ dispersing agents: they are already present in the dye formulation and they are further added in the subsequent steps of the dyeing process Ã¯Â¿Â½ levelling agents: they form adducts with the dye, thus retarding its absorption onto the fibre.
Sulphur dyes Sulphur dyes are used in piece dyeing (cellulose-polyester blends), yarn dyeing (sewing thread, warp yarn for denim fabric, yarn for coloured woven goods), dyeing of flock, card sliver (woolman-made fibres blends) [ULLMANN'S].
Like vat dyes, sulphur dyes are insoluble in water, but after reduction they are converted into the leuco-form, which is water-soluble and fibre.
After adsorption into the fibre the colorant is oxidised and insoluble state.
The reducing agent, salts, alkali and unfixed dye are fibre by rinsing and washing.
under alkaline conditions has high affinity for the converted to the original finally removed from the Mostly continuous dyeing methods are applied, although batch dyeing (in jigger, jet, and winch beck) is also possible.
In continuous processes the material is impregnated with dye, reducing agent and wetting agent through a one-bath or a two-bath procedure.
With the one-bath procedure (pad-steam process) the reducing agent and the dye are added at the same time.
With the two-bath procedure (paddry/pad-steam) the material is padded in the liquor containing the dye and the wetting agent, while the reducing agent is applied, if necessary, in a second step, after intermediate drying.
The material is then submitted to air-free steaming.
After that, rinsing, oxidation and re-rinsing are carried out.
Chemicals and auxiliaries applied to the substrate during the dyeing process are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ reducing agents: sodium sulphide and sodium hydrogensulphide are the most commonly employed, although binary systems made of glucose and sodium dithionite or thiourea dioxide are also used as alternative reducing agents for water-soluble dyes.
Sulphur dyes can also be available in the ready-for-use form, in which case the reducing agent is already contained in the formulation.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ alkali (caustic soda) Ã¯Â¿Â½ salt Ã¯Â¿Â½ dispersing agents (they are necessary in the process steps in which the pigment has not yet been reduced or has been re-formed by oxidation) Ã¯Â¿Â½ complexing agents: EDTA or polyphosphates are used in some cases, especially in circulating-liquor dyeing to avoid the negative effects of alkaline-earth ions on dyeing Ã¯Â¿Â½ oxidising agents: mainly hydrogen peroxide and halogenated organic compounds such as bromate, iodate and chlorite.
Naphtol dyes Naphtol AS dyes allow colours with outstanding fastness, but their popularity has declined because of application costs and the possible presence of arylamines on the fabric and in the effluent [EURATEX].
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 53 Chapter 2 Dyeing with azoic colorants is a complex process which involves a number of delicate steps: Ã¯Â¿Â½ preparation of the naphtolate solution by the hot solution process (the naphtol is dissolved by boiling with caustic soda) or by the cold solution process (the naphtol is solubilised with alcohol or cellosolve, caustic soda and cold water).
For certain naphtols the addition of formaldehyde is also necessary to prevent the formation of free naphtol Ã¯Â¿Â½ application of the naphtolate to the fibre by batch or padding techniques Ã¯Â¿Â½ preparation of the diazotized base by reaction with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid (this step can be avoided when using fast colour salts) Ã¯Â¿Â½ formation of the azoic dye into the fibre, by passing the textile, previously impregnated with the naphtolate solution, through a bath containing the diazotized base or the fast colour salt (addition of buffering agents is necessary to control the pH, in order to increase the coupling capacity) Ã¯Â¿Â½ after-treatment by rinsing the material to remove the excess of naphtol from the fibre.
Dyestuff Reactive - Chemicals and auxiliaries/ typical application conditions pH 9.5 - 11.5 by addition of sodium carbonate and/or sodium hydroxide Salt is used to increase dye bath exhaustion: higher concentrations are used for low-affinity dyes and for deep shades Application temperatures vary from 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½C to 80 Ã¯Â¿Â½C depending on the class of the dyestuff In padding processes urea or cyanoguanidine is usually added to the pad liquor After dyeing, the material is soaped at 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and then washed off with addition of surfactants to remove unfixed dye Salt is used to increase bath exhaustion Mixtures of nonionic and anionic surfactants are used as wetting/dispersing agents After-treatment is usually necessary to improve wet-fastness (possible use of fixative cationic agents, formaldehyde condensation products) Alkali and reducing agents (sodium dithionite, sulphoxylic acid derivatives, thiourea dioxide, organic reducing agents) are applied to convert the dye to the sodium leuco form Poorly degradable dispersants are present in the dye formulation and are further added in other steps of the process Levelling agents are sometimes necessary Temperature and the amount of salt and alkali required vary according to the nature of the dye (IK, IW, IN) Dye is fixed to the fibre by oxidation, generally using hydrogen peroxide, but halogen-containing oxidising agents can also be used After-treatment takes place in a weakly alkaline detergent liquor at boiling temperature In continuous processes, anti-migration and wetting agents are used Reducing agents (Na2S, NaHS, glucose-based combination of reducing agents) and alkali are applied to convert the dye into soluble form, unless ready-for-use dyes are used Dispersants and complexing agents are used in batch dyeing In batch dyeing, the dye generally absorbs at 60 - 110 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, while in the pad-steam process the material is padded at 20 - 30 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and then subjected to steaming at 102 - 105 Ã¯Â¿Â½C Oxidation is carried out mainly with hydrogen peroxide, bromate and iodate Preparation of the naphtholate (caustic soda and, in some cases, addition of formaldehyde is required to stabilise the naphthol on the fibre) Impregnation of the naphtholate by exhaustion or padding processes Preparation of the diazotised base (with NaNO2 and HCl) Developing stage (the textile is passed through the cold developing bath or the developing solution is circulated through the stationary textile in the dyeing machine) Technique Batch Pad-batch Pad-steam Pad-dry Batch Pad-batch Pad-jig Pad-steam Batch Direct - Vat - Pad-steam Sulphur - Batch Pad-steam Pad-dry/ padsteam Batch Naphtol - Padding methods Table 2.5: Summary of the most common dyestuffs and dyeing techniques applied for cellulose fibres 54 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.7.4 Wool dyeing Wool can be dyed with the following dyestuffs: Ã¯Â¿Â½ acid Ã¯Â¿Â½ chrome Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1:1 and 1:2 metal complex Ã¯Â¿Â½ reactive.
Acid dyes Acid dyes are typically applied in acidic conditions, but the pH range used varies depending on the type of acid dye.
The greater the affinity of the dyestuff for the fibre, the more the ionic bonds must be repressed by applying the dye at higher pH.
Therefore level-dyeing colorants are applied under strongly acidic conditions (1 3 % formic acid) in the presence of sulphate ions (5 10 % sodium sulphate) to assist migration and levelling.
Levelling agents are not generally required and the rate of dye uptake is controlled initially by increasing the temperature of the dyebath slowly (1 Ã¯Â¿Â½C/min.) and then extending the time at the boil to allow the dye to migrate from areas of high initial uptake.
Fast acid dyes (also known as half-milling dyes or perspiration-fast dyes) exhibit superior fastness properties to level-dyeing acid dyes, while retaining some of the migration properties.
Application is from a moderately acidic dyebath (1 3 % acetic acid) in the presence of sodium sulphate (5 10 %) and levelling agent to assist migration.
Acid milling dyes have good affinity for the fibre and do not migrate well at the boil.
They are therefore applied at more neutral pH (5 - 7.5 with acetic acid) in the presence of sodium acetate (2g/l) or ammonium sulphate (4 %) and levelling agent (1 2 %).
Sodium sulphate is usually avoided as it has little effect on migration and can promote uneven dye adsorption.
Levelling agents play an important role in acid dyeing.
A number of non-ionic, cationic, anionic and amphoteric surfactants belong to this category.
Chrome dyes A number of techniques have been developed for the application of chrome dyes.
The chrome mordant process relies on chroming the fibre prior to dyeing with a chromable dye; the Metachrome process applies both dye and chromium salt simultaneously.
Both processes have been largely superseded by the Afterchrome process in which the dye is applied first and the fibre is then chromed in a separate step, utilising the exhausted dyebath and thus conserving water.
Application of the dyestuff takes place fin a moderately acid dyebath (1 % acetic acid) often with an addition of formic acid towards the end of the boiling period to promote exhaustion of the dye.
The dyebath is then cooled back from the boil to approx.
80 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, the pH is lowered to approx.
3.5 with formic acid and the pre-dissolved chromium salt added.
The dyebath is then returned to the boil and boiling continued for 20 - 30 minutes.
Chromium is added to the dyebath as either sodium or potassium dichromate.
In solution the chroming species present vary according to pH, with the dichromate anion Cr2O72- predominating at pH between 3 and 7.
Although it is the chromium (VI) anion which is initially adsorbed by the wool, the dye complex is formed with chromium (III), formed by the action of reducing groups in the fibre itself.
Strong acids have an activating effect on this process; organic acids (tartaric, lactic, formic acid) or thiosulfate can also be used to enhance the degree of conversion of Cr VI. VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 55 Chapter 2 Metal-complex dyes Application of 1:1 metal-complex dyes is carried out from a strongly acidic dyebath (sulphuric or formic acid to pH 3 - 4.5) in the presence of sodium sulphate (5 %) and levelling agent.
Owing to these particular operative conditions, this class of dyestuffs is particularly suitable for piece-dyeing of carbonised wool.
1:2 two out metal-complex dyes form the most important group in this class and may be divided into sub-groups: weakly polar and strongly polar 1:2 complexes.
Application is usually carried in moderately acidic conditions: pH range between 4 and 7 (acetic acid) in the presence of ammonium acetate, for weakly polar complexes - pH range 5 - 6 (acetic acid) in the presence of ammonium sulphate, for strongly polar complexes.
The use of levelling agents is very common when dyeing with metal-complex dyes.
The groups of substances used for acid dyes apply also in this case.
Reactive dyes Reactive dyes are generally applied at pH values of between 5 and 6, depending on the depth of shade, in the presence of ammonium sulphate and the specialised levelling agents (amphoteric substances, which form complexes with the dye at low dyebath temperatures and then break down as the dyeing temperature increases).
The dyeing method may include a temperature hold step at 65 70 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, during which the dyebath is maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes in order to allow the dye to migrate without fibre reaction.
Where dyeing of the very highest fastness is required, the fibre is rinsed under alkali conditions (pH 89 with ammonia) to remove un-reacted dyestuff.
Dyestuff Acid dyes - Chemicals and auxiliaries/ typical application conditions Strongly acidic conditions for equalising dyes (by formic acid) Moderately acidic conditions for half-milling dyes (by acetic acid) More neutral conditions for milling dyes (by acetic acid and sodium acetate or ammonium sulphate) Salt: sodium sulphate or ammonium sulphate Levelling agents (not necessary for equalising dyes) pH 3 to 4.5 sodium sulphate organic acids: acetic and formic acid (tartaric and lactic acids can also be used) reducing agent: sodium thiosulphate after-chrome with Na or K dichromate pH 1.8 to 2.5 (pH 2.5 in the presence of auxiliary agents such as alkanolethoxylates) sulphuric or formic acid salt: sodium sulphate ammonia or sodium acetate can be added to the last rinsing bath pH 5 to 7 ammonium sulphate or acetate levelling agents (non-ionic, ionic and amphoteric surfactants) Technique Batch dyeing Chrome dyes (mordant) - Batch dyeing (After-chrome method) 1:1 metalcomplex dyes - Batch dyeing 1:2 metalcomplex dyes Reactive dyes - Batch dyeing pH 5.5 to 6.5 formic or acetic acid levelling agent after-treatment with ammonia for highest fastness Batch dyeing Table 2.6: Summary of the most common dyestuffs and dyeing techniques for wool fibre 56 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 2.7.5 Silk dyeing (?) 2.7.6 Synthetic fibres dyeing 2.7.6.1 Polyamide fibres Polyamide fibres (PA 6 and PA 6,6) are easily dyed with various types of dyes.
Due to their hydrophobic characteristics, they can be dyed with disperse dyes, whereas thanks to the presence of the groups NH-CO- and NH2- in the chain of the polymer, acid, reactive and 1:2 metal-complex dyes can also be used.
Before dyeing, fabrics must generally be pre-fixed to compensate for material-related differences in affinity and to reduce the sensitivity to creasing during the dyeing process.
Prefixing can be performed in a stenter frame (15 20 seconds at 190 Ã¯Â¿Â½C for PA 6 or at 200 230 Ã¯Â¿Â½C for PA 66) or in hot water (45 min at 130 Ã¯Â¿Â½C).
[ULLMANNÃ¯Â¿Â½S] Disperse dyes Disperse dyes used for polyamide fibres are mainly azo compounds and anthraquinones.
They are applied especially for lighter shades.
The material is dyed in acidic conditions (pH 5) by acetic acid.
A dispersing agent is always added to the liquor.
Acid dyes As with acid dyeing of wool, with increasing dye affinity, the ionic interaction in the initial phase must be repressed to achieve uniform absorption.
This means that for high-affinity dyes the liquor must be neutral at the start and the slowly increased to optimise exhaustion.
The level of acidity of the bath is regulated either by means of pH-controlling instruments or by adding retarding agents (acid donors, such as ammonium sulphate, sodium pyrophosphate or special auxiliaries based on esters of organic acids, which release acid during the dyeing process).
Optimal exhaustion and uniform dyeing can also be achieved by controlling the temperature profile.
Auxiliary agents (anionic, cationic, non-ionic surfactants) are normally used to improve the levelling effect.
The wet-fastness of dyeing with acid dyes on polyamide fibres is often unsatisfactory.
Aftertreatment with synthanes (synthetic tanning agents) is often necessary.
The synthanes are added to the exhausted bath or to fresh liquor at pH 4.5 by formic acid.
The material is treated at 70 - 80 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and is then rinsed.
Metal-complex dyes Among 1:2 metal-complex dyes, molecules containing sulphonic groups are the most suitable for polyamide fibres.
The absorption of the dyes increases with decreasing pH.
Dyeing conditions vary from weakly acidic by addition of ammonium sulphate and acetic acid to neutral or moderately alkaline for high-affinity dyes.
For high-affinity dyes the addition of amphoteric or no-nionic levelling agents is also necessary.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 57 Chapter 2 Reactive In principle, the reactive dyes used for wool are also suitable for polyamide.
The dyeing process is carried out in weakly acidic conditions (pH 4.5 - 5).
The process is started at 20 45 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and then temperature is increased near to boiling.
Non-ionic surfactants and sodium bicarbonate or ammonia are used in the after-treatment step.
Dyestuff Disperse - Chemicals and auxiliaries/ typical application conditions pH=5 by acetic acid dispersing agents (sulphoaromatic condensation products or nonionic surfactants) dyeing is conducted at near-boiling temperature pH conditions from acid to neutral depending on the affinity of the dye optimal bath exhaustion and level dyeing are achieved by either pH or temperature control methods (levelling agents are also used) in the acidic range, electrolytes retard the exhaustion with levelling dyes, wet-fastness is often unsatisfactory and aftertreatment with synthanes can be necessary dyes containing sulphonic groups are preferred because they are more water-soluble and produce better wet-fastness to improve absorption of low-affinity dyes (especially for disulphonic) dyeing is carried out in weakly acidic conditions using acetic acid high-affinity dyes are applied in neutral or weakly alkaline medium using amphoteric or non-ionic levelling agents in principle the reactive dyes used for wool are also suitable for PA dyeing is conducted at near-boiling temperature in weakly acidic conditions after-treatment is performed at 95 Ã¯Â¿Â½C using a non-ionic surfactant and sodium bicarbonate or ammonia Technique Batch Acid dyes Batch 1:2 metalcomplex dyes - Batch Reactive dyes - Batch Table 2.7: Summary of the most common dyestuffs and dyeing techniques for polyamide fibres 2.7.6.2 Polyester fibres Articles made of pure PES are dyed almost exclusively using batch dyeing techniques and among these, dyeing under high-temperature conditions is the most commonly applied.
Dyeing polyester fibres under atmospheric conditions (below 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) was also frequently used in the past with the aid of carriers.
Since these substances are ecologically harmful, dyeing below 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C is no longer in use today for pure PES fibres, unless the modified polyester fibres known as NCD (Non-Carrier Dyeable) fibres are employed.
Thanks to physical and chemical alterations provided to the structure of the fibre during the manufacturing process, these new fibres show a lower crystallinity and as a result are easier to dye without need for carriers.
Moreover, the use of sulphated aromatic polycarboxilic acid as co-monomers leads to an increase in the number of anionic sites, granting a better exhaustion of cationic dyestuffs.
Concerning high-temperature dyeing, the process is usually carried out in acidic conditions (pH 4 - 5) with addition of acetic acid under pressure at 125 135 Ã¯Â¿Â½C.
In these conditions levelling agents are necessary to prevent excessively rapid absorption.
Provided that alkali-stable dyes are used, dyeing in alkaline medium (pH 9 - 9.5) is also possible.
This technique has been developed in order to counteract the migration of oligomers typical of PES fibres (see Section 2.1.1.1).
In fact, oligomeric components (cyclic trimers of ethylene terephthalate are especially harmful) tend to migrate out of the fibre during dyeing, 58 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 thus forming with the dye agglomerates that can deposit on the textile or on the dyeing equipment.
To achieve level effects, ethoxylated products are used as levelling agents also in this case.
The thermosol process is another applied technique, although it is primarily used for PES/cellulose blends.
The dye is padded on the textile together with a thickening agent.
A drying step at 100 140 Ã¯Â¿Â½C is carried out.
Then the dye is fixed (200 225 Ã¯Â¿Â½C for 12 25 seconds).
An alkaline reductive after-treatment is normally carried out.
Non-ionic surfactants are usually added as dispersants to the final washing bath.

As a result, they can be dyed with disperse and cationic dyes.
Batch dyeing is commonly applied for cable or stock (package dyeing), yarn in hank form or packages and for fabric
Piece dyeing can be performed on beam, overflow, paddle (for knitwear), or drum (socks).
Stock, cable and top can be also dyed on special machine, using the pad-steam process, preferably with pressurised steam to obtain short fixing times.
Piece goods, especially upholstery material (velour), are also dyed according to the pad-steam process, but in this case fixing is carried out with saturated steam.
This implies longer fixing times, which means that rapidly diffusing cationic dyes and dye solvents are required.
Disperse dyes Disperse dyes are used to produce light to medium-deep shades.
The dyeing techniques correspond to those used on polyester fibres.
However, dyeing can be performed at temperatures 
Furthermore, due to the good migration properties of disperse dyes, levelling agents are not required.
Cationic dyes Typical recipes used in batch dyeing include an electrolyte (sodium acetate or sodium sulphate), acetic acid, a non-ionic dispersant and a retarding agent.
Dyeing is conducted by controlling the VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 59 Chapter 2 temperature in the optimum range for the treated fibre.
Finally the bath is cooled down and the material is rinsed and submitted to after-treatment.
Continuous processes commonly applied are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ pad-steam process (fixation with pressurised steam at more than 100 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) - this process has the advantage of reducing fixing time.
Pad liquor typically contains a steam-resistant cationic dye, acetic acid and a dye solvent Ã¯Â¿Â½ pad-steam process (fixation with saturated steam at 100 - 102 Ã¯Â¿Â½C) - this process requires a longer fixing time.
Rapidly diffusing cationic dyes and dye solvents, which exhibit a carrier effect, are required.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ When dyeing with basic dyes, special levelling agents (also called retarding agents) are widely used to control the absorption rate of the colorant on the fibre, thus improving level dyeing.
Dyestuff Disperse Cationic - Chemicals and auxiliaries/ typical application conditions dyeing conditions correspond to those used for polyester addition of carriers is not required Acetic acid (pH 3.6 - 4.5) Salt (sodium sulphate or sodium acetate) Retardant auxiliaries (usually cationic agents) Nonionic dispersing agents Acetic acid (pH 4.5) Dye solvent Steam-resistant, readily-soluble dyes (usually liquid) are required Dye solvent Rapidly diffusing dyes are required Technique Batch Pad-steam process with pressurised steam Pad-steam process with saturated steam Table 2.9: Summary of the most common dyestuffs and dyeing techniques for polyacrylic fibres 2.7.6.4 Cellulose acetate (AC) and cellulose triacetate (CT) In contrast to the other regenerated cellulose fibres, CA and CT are hydrophobic and therefore they can be dyed with disperse dyes under conditions which are very similar to those applying to PES fibres.
Cellulose acetate is dyed by the exhaustion method with disperse dyes in the presence of nonionic or anionic dispersing agents in weakly acidic conditions (pH 5 - 6).
Dyeing is normally done at 80 85 Ã¯Â¿Â½C. However, a series of less wetfast dyes already absorb onto the fibre at 50 - 60 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, whereas more wetfast dyes require temperatures up to 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½C. Compared to CA, CT dyeing and finishing characteristics are more similar to purely synthetic fibres.
CT, like CA, is dyed with disperse dyes in a weakly acidic medium in the presence of levelling auxiliaries.
Applied dyeing techniques for CT are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Batch dyeing process, usually at 120 Ã¯Â¿Â½C, but if these conditions are not possible a dyeing accelerant (based on butyl benzoate or butyl salicylate) is required Ã¯Â¿Â½ Thermosol process.
2.7.7 Fibre blends dyeing Natural/synthetic fibre blends are becoming more and more important in the textile industry because this allows combining the favourable technological properties of synthetic fibres with the pleasant feel of natural fibres.
60 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Of the worldwide consumption of PES fibres, 55 60 % is used in blends with cellulose fibres or wool.
About 40 % of polyamide is used in blends, while 50 % of polyacrylic fibres is used especially in blends with wool for knitwear.
[ULLMANN'S] Fibre blends can be produced according to three different methods: Ã¯Â¿Â½ fibres of different types in the form of staple fibres are mixed at the yarn manufacturing stage, during spinning Ã¯Â¿Â½ fibres of different types are separately spun and the resulting yarns are wounded together to give a mixed yarn Ã¯Â¿Â½ fibres of different types are separately spun and blended together only at the weaving stage where one fibre is used as warp and the other one as weft.
Dyeing of blend fibres is always longer and more difficult as an operation compared to pure fibre dyeing.
Despite these disadvantages, dyeing tends to be placed as close as possible towards the end of the finishing process.
In fact this enables the dyer to satisfy the requests of the market without the need to store large amounts of material already dyed in flock or yarn form in all available shades.
When dyeing blend fibres, the following methods can be applied: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the two fibres are dyed in the same tone ("tone on tone") or in two different shades using the same dyes Ã¯Â¿Â½ only one fibre is dyed (the colorant is not absorbed by the other ones) Ã¯Â¿Â½ the different fibres are dyed in different tones.
For "tone on tone" dyeing, it is sometimes possible to use the same When dyes of different classes have to be employed, the dyeing when the selected colorants have affinity only for one fibre and not however, this situation is exceptional and the dyeing of fibre operation.
dye for the different fibres. process is easier to control for the other one.
In reality, blends remains a complex Blend fibres dyeing can be done in batch, semi-continuous and continuous processes.
Batch processes include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ dyeing in one bath and one step (all dyes are added in the same bath in one single step) Ã¯Â¿Â½ dyeing in one bath and in two steps (dyes are added to the same bath in subsequent steps) Ã¯Â¿Â½ dyeing in two baths (dyes are applied in two steps in two different baths).
The most common fibre blends will be discussed in the following sections.
Polyester-cellulose blends A large part of the entire production of PES (ca. 45 %) is used to make this mixture.
Polyestercellulose blends are used for all types of clothing and for bed linen.
The cellulose component is usually cotton, but viscose staple fibres and occasionally linen are also used.
The preferred mixing ratio is 67:33 PES: cellulose (for textiles worn close to the skin), 50:50 and 20:80.
[ULLMANN'S] In dyeing PES-cellulose mixtures, disperse dyes are used for the polyester component, while the cellulose portion is usually dyed with reactive, vat and direct dyes.
Pigment dyeing is also commonly used for light shades.
Disperse dyes stain cellulose fibres only slightly and they can easily be removed by subsequent washing or, if necessary, by alkaline reduction treatment.
Most of the dyes used for cellulose stain PES only slightly or not at all.
PES-cellulose blends are commonly dyed in continuous processes.
Nevertheless, for yarn and knitwear, batch dyeing is of major importance.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 61 Chapter 2 In batch dyeing, the application of dyes can be done in one or two steps in one bath or in two different baths in subsequent stages.
The disperse dye is general applied at high-temperature (HT) conditions without use of carriers.
The one-bath/ one-step procedures are generally preferred, being more economic.
In this case special auxiliaries, so-called acid donors, are used, which lower the pH when the temperature is increased.
In this way it is possible to fix the reactive dyes in alkaline conditions and then reach the optimal dyeing conditions (pH 5 - 6) for disperse dyes by increasing the temperature.
In continuous dried and disp second dye is steam, pad-jig processes the dyes are usually applied in one bath.
The fabric is subsequently erse dye is fixed to the PES component by the thermosol process.
Afterwards, the developed according to the procedure typical of each class, using in general pador pad-batch processes.
Table 2.10 presents a summary of the most frequently applied processes is presented.
Dyes are applied according to application conditions typical of their class.
For more details regarding a given class of colorant, see the specific section.

Table 2.10: Summary of dyestuff and dyeing techniques for polyester-cellulose blends Polyester-wool blends Polyester-wool blends are widely used, especially for woven goods and knitwear.
The most frequently found ratio is 55:45 PES: wool.
Wool cannot be dyed at the high temperatures typical of the HT dyeing process for PES fibres and PES-cellulose blends.
The dyeing time should also be as short as possible so that the wool is not damaged.
For large productions it is therefore preferable to dye wool and PES separately in top, blending the two fibres at the yarn manufacturing stage.
However, quick changes in fashion and short-term planning frequently do not allow separate dyeing.
When dyeing polyester-wool blends, disperse dyes are used for polyester and anionic (acid and metal-complex dyes) for wool.
62 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Only disperse dyes that stain wool as slightly as possible or are easily removed by washing can be used for dyeing wool-cellulose blends.
Disperse dyes, in fact, tend to stain wool and a reductive after-treatment is not always possible (appropriately stable dyes are required).
PES-wool blends are typically dyed according to the following batch processes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ at boiling temperature with carriers Ã¯Â¿Â½ at 103 106 Ã¯Â¿Â½C with little carrier Ã¯Â¿Â½ at 110 115 Ã¯Â¿Â½C with the addition of formaldehyde as a wool protective agent and without carrier (HT conditions).
Because of the environmental concerns associated with the use of carriers (see Section 8.6.7) the first dyeing technique is avoided when possible.
To this respect, modified PES fibres can also be used, which can be dye at boiling temperature without use of carriers (see Section 2.1.1.1) The one-bath process method is preferred in practice; the two-bath process is applied when deep shades and high fastness are required.
The material is first dyed with disperse dyes.
Then a reductive intermediate treatment is applied before dyeing the wool part.
After dyeing, an aftertreatment is applied to remove disperse dye attached to the wool, if the dye used for wool can withstand it.
The material is treated with ethoxylated fatty amine in weakly acid liquor at 60 Ã¯Â¿Â½C. Polyamide-cellulose blends Since PA fibres have affinity for almost all dyes used for cellulose, different possibilities are available for dyeing this blend: Ã¯Â¿Â½ direct and disperse dyes (pH 8) Ã¯Â¿Â½ acid or 1:2 metal-complex dyes (pH 5 - 8) Ã¯Â¿Â½ vat dyes (exhaust and pad-steam process are used) Ã¯Â¿Â½ reactive dyes.
Application conditions are those typical of each class of dye.
They have already been described in the specific sections.
Polyamide-wool blends Blends with polyamide/ wool ratios varying from 20:80 to 60:40 are used.
This blend is particularly important in the carpet sector.
More detailed information is therefore reported in the specific section dedicated to this sector (see Section 2.13.5).
As general information about the dyeing processes suitable for this type of blend, both fibres have affinity for acid and 1:2 metal-complex dyes.
However, since PA is more accessible to the dye than wool, it is dyed more deeply, particularly in the case of light colours.
To counteract this effect, special levelling agents (also called PA reserving/ blocking agents) are used (mainly aromatic sulphonates).
These auxiliaries have a relatively high affinity for the PA fibre and retard the absorption of the colorant on this part of the blend.
Dyeing is performed in the presence of acetic acid and sodium sulphate.
Due to limited affinity of the material for acid dyes, 1:2 metal-complex dyes are required for dark shades.
[ULLMANN'S] Polyacrylonitrile-cellulose blends PAC-cellulose blends are used for household textiles (drapery and table linen) and imitation fur ("peluche" in which the pile consists of PAC fibres and the back is made of cotton).
The percentage of PAC in the mixtures varies between 30 and 80 %.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 63 Chapter 2 PAC can be dyed with cationic or disperse dyes, while direct, vat or reactive dyes can be used for the cellulose component.
The following methods are the most commonly used for dyeing this blend: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Continuous dyeing with cationic and direct dyes according to the pad-steam process (to avoid precipitation of cationic and anionic dyes present in the pad liquor at relatively high concentration, combination of anionic and non ionic surfactants are added to the solution) Ã¯Â¿Â½
Batch dyeing (usually according to the one-bath, two-steps method) with cationic and vat dyes or with cationic and reactive dyes.
Polyacrylonitrile-wool blends Among synthetic fibres, PAC fibres are the most suitable for obtaining blends with wool that keep a wool-like character.
This makes this blend widely used, especially for knitwear and household textiles.
The blending ratio of PAC to wool varies from 20:80 to 80:20.Metal-complex, chrome and acid dyes are the dyestuffs typically used for the wool part, while PAC is dyed with cationic dyes.
Cationic migrate must be wool res dyes stain wool fibre.
As a matter of fact cationic dyes attach first to wool and then to PAC fibre at higher temperature.
Even if well-reserving dyes are selected, dyeing conducted for a sufficiently long time (from 60 to 90 minutes) in order to obtain good erve [ULLMANN'S].
PAC-wool blends can be dyed using the following exhaustion methods: Ã¯Â¿Â½ one-bath one-step Ã¯Â¿Â½ one-bath two-step Ã¯Â¿Â½ two-bath.
The first one allows shorter dyeing times and lower consumption of water.
However, it is not always applicable because the simultaneous presence in the dye bath of anionic and cationic compounds can produce the precipitation of the formed adducts on the fibre.
Precipitation can be prevented using dispersing agents and selecting adequate dyes.
When dyeing with the one-bath, two-step method the use of reserve agents is not necessary.
In fact, wool absorbs the cationic dye and slowly releases it, acting as a retarding agent (exerting a retardant effect on PAC).

Due to the low vapour pressure of the substances in the dyebath, emissions to air are generally not relevant and can be regarded more as problems related to the workplace atmosphere.
A few exceptions are pigment dyeing and those dyeing processes where carriers are employed.
In pigment dyeing the substrate is not washed after pigment application and therefore the pollutants are quantitatively released to air during drying.
Emissions from carriers are to air and water.
These particular auxiliaries and the environmental concerns associated with their use are described in Section 8.6.7.
In the first part of the following discussion the environmental issues related to the substances employed will be described, while in the second part the environmental issues related to the process will be mentioned.
2.7.8.1 Environmental issues related to the substances employed Water-polluting substances in the above mentioned emissions may originate from: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the dyes themselves (e.g. toxicity, metals, colour) Ã¯Â¿Â½ auxiliaries contained in the dyes' formulations Ã¯Â¿Â½ basic chemicals (e.g. alkali, salts, reducing and oxidising agents) and auxiliaries used in dyeing processes Ã¯Â¿Â½ contaminants present on the fibre when it enters the process sequence (residues of pesticides on wool are encountered in loose fibre and yarn dyeing and the same occurs with spin finishes present on synthetic fibres).
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 65 Chapter 2 Dyes Spent dyebaths (discontinuous dyeing, residual dyeliquors and water from washing operations always contain a percentage of un-fixed dyes.
The rates of fixations vary considerably among the different classes of dyes, being especially low for reactive and sulphur dyes.
Moreover, large variations are found even within a given class of colorants.
This is particularly significant in the case of reactive dyes.
Fixing rates above 60 % cannot be achieved, for example, in the case of turquoise-green reactive dyes (where the chromophore is a phthalocyanine).
In contrast, the socalled double anchor reactive dyes can achieve extremely high rates of fixation.
The degree of fixation of an individual dye varies according to type of fibre, shade and dyeing parameters.
Therefore fixation rate values can be given only as approximations.
However they are useful to give an idea of the amount of unfixed dyes that can be found in wastewater.
Information from different authors is given in the table below.

The first undesiderable effect in the receiving water is colour.
High doses of colour not only cause aesthetic impact, but can also interrupt photosynthesis, thus affecting aquatic life.
Other effects are related to organic content of the colorant (expressed as COD and BOD), its aquatic toxicity and the presence in the molecule of metals or halogens that can give rise to AOX emissions.
These issues are discussed in more detail for each class of dyestuff in Section 9.
Only some general key issues are considered in this section.
66 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 AOX emissions Vat and reactive dyes are more likely to contain organic halogens in their molecule.
The content of organically bound halogen can be up to 12 % on weight for some vat dyes.
Vat dyes, however, show a very high degree of fixation.
In addition, they are insoluble in water and the amount that reaches the effluent can be eliminated with high efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant through absorption on the activated sludge.
Reactive dyes, on the contrary, may have very low fixation degrees (the lowest level of fixation is observed with phthlocyanine in batch dyeing) and their removal from wastewater is difficult because of the low biodegradability and/or low level of absorption of the dye onto activated sludge during treatment.
Reactive dyes very often contain halogen atoms (e.g. monochlorotriazines).
However, these halogens act as so-called "leaving groups".
In this case, if the fixation reaction takes place, the halogen enters the effluent as an ion, rather then organically bound halogen.
For the other classes of colorants the AOX issue is not relevant because, with few exceptions, halogen content is usually below 0.1 %.
Heavy metals emissions Metals can be present in dyes for two reasons.
First, metals are used as catalysts during the manufacture of some dyes and can be present as a impurities.
Second, in some dyes the metal is chelated with the dye molecule, forming an integral structural element.
Dye manufacturers are now putting more effort into reducing the amount of metals present as impurities.
This can be done by selection of starting products, removal of heavy metal and substitution of the solvent where the reaction takes place.
ETAD has established limits in the content of heavy metal in dyestuffs.
The values have been set to ensure that emission levels from a 2 % dyeing and a total dilution of the dye of 1:2500, will meet the known wastewater requirements [BASF].
Examples of dyes containing bound metals are copper and nickel in phthalocyanine groups, copper in blue copper-azo-complex reactive dyes and chromium in metal-complex dyes used for wool.
The presence of the metal in these dyes can be regarded as a less relevant problem provided that the dye is fixed on the textile good and not discharged in wastewater.
However, not all the dye in the dyebath is exhausted and dye wastes can also result from handling, weighing, drum cleaning and spills.
[EPA] Toxicity Dyestuffs showing aquatic toxicity and/ or allergenic effects are highlighted in Section 9.
Here it is also important to mention that about 60 % to 70 % of the dyes used nowadays are azo dyes.
Under reductive conditions, these dyes may produce amines and some of them are carcinogenic.
A list of carcinogenic amines that can be formed by cleavage of certain azo dyes is shown in the Table 2.13.

According to [EURATEX], more than 100 dyes with the potential to form carcinogenic amines are still available on the market.
Auxiliaries contained in dye formulations Depending on the dye class and the application method employed (e.g. batch or continuous dyeing, printing) different additives are present in the dye formulations.
Since these substances are not absorbed by the fibres, they are completely discharged in the wastewater.
Typical additives are listed in the table below.
Additive Dispersants Chemical composition Lignin sulphonates Naphthalene sulphonates condensation products with formaldehyde - Ethylene oxide/ propylene oxide copolymers Sodium sulphate, sodium chloride COD mg O2/l 1200 650 BOD5 mg O2/l 50 50 TOC elimination 15 % 15 % (1) Salts Powder binding agents Anti-foaming agents Anti-freeze agents Thickening agents Buffer systems Mineral- or paraffin oils (+ additives) Acetyl glycols Pho Glycerine Glycol Carboxymethyl cellulose Polyacrylates sphate, Acetate 1200 1600 1000 780 10 0 90 % 95 % 30 % Source [VITO] (1) Statistical elimination test (Zahn-Wellens Test) Table 2.14: Ecological properties of dye formulations additives 68 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 While these additives are not toxic to aquatic life, they are in general not readily eliminable and are poorly biodegradable.
This applies in particular to the dispersants present in the formulations of vat, disperse and sulphur dyes, which are water-insoluble and need these special auxiliaries in order to be applied to the textile in the form of aqueous dispersions.
These dispersants consist mainly of naphthalene sulphonate-formaldehyde condensation products and lignin sulphonates, but sulphomethylation products derived from the condensation of phenols with formaldahyde and sodium sulphite can also be found.
Other not readily eliminable additives are acrylate and CMC-based thickeners and anti-foam agents The difference between liquid and powder formulations should also be mentioned.
Dyes supplied in liquid form contain only one third of the amount of dispersing agent normally contained in powder dyes (see Table 2.15).
The reason for this difference stems from the manufacturing process of powder dyes: the very small particles generated during grinding must be protected during the subsequent drying process and this is possible only by adding high proportions of dispersing agents.
Formulation component Dye Dispersing agent Salts Powder binding agents Anti-foaming agents Anti-freeze agent Thickening agent Water Source [VITO]
Sulphur-containing reducing agents Wastewater from sulphur dyeing contains sulphides used in the process as reducing agents.
In some cases the sulphide is already contained in the dye formulation and in some other cases it is added to the dye bath before dyeing.
In the end, however, the excess of sulphide ends up in the wastewater.
Sulphides are toxic to aquatic organisms and contribute to increasing COD load.
In addition, sulphide anions are converted into hydrogen sulphide under acidic conditions, thereby giving rise to problems of odour and corrosivity.
Sulphur-containing reducing agents, namely sodium hydrosulphite (also called sodium dithionite) are also used in vat dyeing processes.
During the dyeing process sodium dithionite is converted into sulphite, which is toxic to fish and bacteria, and in some cases it is converted to sulphate.
In the wastewater treatment plant sulphite is normally oxidised into sulphate, but this can still cause problems.
Sulphate, in fact, may cause corrosion of concrete pipes or may be reduced under anaerobic conditions into hydrogen sulphide.
Hydroxyacetone, although it produces an increase in COD load, is recommended to lower the sulphur content in wastewater, but it cannot replace hydrosulphite in all applications.
Newly developed organic reducing agents with improved reducing effects are currently being tested.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 69 Chapter 2 Oxidising agents Dichromate is no longer used in Europe as an oxidising agent when dyeing with vat and sulphur dyes, but it is still widely used for the fixation of chrome dyes in wool dyeing.
Chromium III exhibits low acute toxicity, while chromium VI is acutely toxic and has been shown to be carcinogenic towards animals.
During the dyeing processes with chrome dyes, Cr VI is reduced to Cr III if the process is under control.
Nevertheless emissions of trivalent chromium in the wastewater have to be taken into account in this process.
It is also worth mentioning the AOX emissions that may arise from the use of bromate, iodate and chlorite as oxidising agents in vat and sulphur dyeing processes.
Salt Salts of various types are used in dyeing processes for different purposes (e.g. to promote level dyeing or increase dye exhaustion).
In particular, large amounts of salt are used in cotton batch dyeing processes with reactive dyes.
The amount of salt employed is quite significant compared to other classes of dyestuffs, for example direct dyes (Table 2.16).
Shade Paste/light Medium Dark Source [EPA] Table 2.16: Amount of salt employed in cotton batch dyeing processes with reactive and direct dyes Dye o.w.f 
Salts are not effectively removed in conventional wast therefore ultimately discharged in the receiving water.
toxicities of the commonly employed salts are very low, scale use can produce concentrations above the toxic groundwater.
Carriers The use of these auxiliaries, which were widely employed in the past, has now been reduced due to ecological and health problems.
They are still an issue in dyeing of polyester in blend in wool.
Carriers include a wide group of organic compounds, many of them steam volatile, poorly biodegradable and toxic to humans and aquatic life.
However, as the active substances usually have high affinity for the fibre (hydrophobic types), 75 90 % are absorbed by the textile and only the emulsifiers and the hydrophilic types such as phenols and benzoates derivatives are found in the wastewater.
The carriers that remain on the fibre are partially volatilised during drying and fixing operations and can give rise to air emissions.
Dyestuffs manufacturers may mix the carriers with the dyes.
In this case textile finishers will have little knowledge of the loads discharged.
[TEBODIN] ewater treatment systems and they are Although the mammalian and aquatic in arid or semi-arid regions their largelimit and increase the salinity of the 70 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Other auxiliaries of environmental interest Other substances that may be encountered in the dyeing auxiliaries and that may give rise to water pollution are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ fatty amine ethoxylates Ã¯Â¿Â½ alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEO) Ã¯Â¿Â½ quaternary ammonium compounds Ã¯Â¿Â½ polyvinylpyrrolidones Ã¯Â¿Â½ cyanamide-ammonia salt condensation products Ã¯Â¿Â½ acrylic acid-maleic acid copolymers Ã¯Â¿Â½ ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) Ã¯Â¿Â½ diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) Ã¯Â¿Â½ ethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic acid) (EDTMP) Ã¯Â¿Â½ diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenphosphonic acid) (DTPMP).
These are water-soluble hard-to-biodegrade compounds which can pass untransformed or only partially degraded, through wastewater treatment systems.
In addition, some of them are toxic (e.g. quaternary amines) or can give rise to metabolites which may affect reproduction in the aquatic environment (APEO).
2.7.8.2 Environmental issues related to the process Water and energy consumption in dyeing processes are a function of the dyeing technique and machinery employed.
Batch dyeing processes generally require higher water and energy consumption levels than continuous processes, due to the higher liquor ratios involved.
The liquor ratio may also play an important role in the level of exhaustion of the dye.
This parameter is related to the exhaustion level of the bath through the equation: E = K/(K+L), where: K (affinity) = 50 to 1000 for various dye/fibre combinations L (liquor ratio) = 5 to 50 for various machines E (exhaustion) = 0.5 to 1 (50 to 100 % exhaustion) From this equation it can be inferred that when L increases, E decreases and a lower amount of dye is absorbed onto the fibre when the equilibrium is reached.
The effect is more pronounced on low-affinity dyes.
The liquor ratio also has an influence on the consumption levels of chemicals and auxiliaries.
Most of them are dosed on the basis of the amount of bath (o.w.b) rather than the weight of the fibre (o.w.f).
For example, in a 1:5 bath ratio, 50 g/l of salt is 250g/kg of fibre, but at 1:40 liquor ratio, the same 50 g/l of salt correspond to 2 kg/kg of fibre.
Continuous and semi-continuous dyeing processes consume less water, but this also means a higher dyestuff concentration in the dye liquor.
In discontinuous dyeing the dye concentration varies from 0.1 to 1 g/l, while in continuous processes this value is in the range of 10 to 100 g/l.
The residual padding liquor in the pads, pumps and pipes must be discarded when a new colour is started.
The discharge of this concentrated effluent can result in a higher pollution load compared with discontinuous dyeing, when short lots of material are processed.
Modern continuous dyeing ranges, however, have steadily improved in recent years.
Small pipes and pumps and small pad-bath troughs reduce the amount of concentrated liquor to be discarded.
In addition, it is possible to minimise the discard of leftovers, thanks to automated dosing systems, which meter the dye solution ingredients in the exact needed amount.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 71 Chapter 2 In both continuous and batch dyeing processes final washing and rinsing operations are waterintensive steps to take into consideration.
2.8 Printing 2.8.1 Printing processes Printing, like dyeing, is a process for applying colour to a substrate.
However, instead of colouring the whole substrate (cloth, carpet or yarn) as in dyeing, print colour is applied only to defined areas to obtain the desired pattern.
This involves different techniques and different machinery with respect to dyeing, but the physical and chemical processes that take place between the dye and the fibre are analogous to dyeing.
The printing process involves the following steps: Ã¯Â¿Â½ colour paste preparation: when printing textiles, the dye or pigment is not in an aqueous liquor, instead, it is usually finely dispersed in a printing paste, in high concentration Ã¯Â¿Â½ printing: the dye or pigment paste is applied to the substrate using different techniques, which are discussed below Ã¯Â¿Â½ fixation: immediately after printing, the fabric is dried and then the prints are fixed mainly with steam or hot air (for pigments) Ã¯Â¿Â½ after-treatment: this final operation consists in washing and drying the fabric (it is not necessary when printing with pigments or with other particular techniques such as transfer printing).
When describing the different printing techniques, a distinction should be made between printing with pigments, which have no affinity for the fibre, and printing with dyes (reactive, vat, disperse, etc.) capable of diffusing into the fibre.
2.8.1.1 Printing with pigments Pigment printing has gained much importance today and for some fibres (e.g. cellulose fibres) is by far the most commonly applied technique.
Pigments can be used on almost all types of textile substrates and, thanks to increased performance of modern auxiliaries, it is now possible to obtain high-quality printing using this technique.
Pigment printing pastes contain a thickening agent, a binder and, if necessary, other auxiliaries such as fixing agents, plasticizers, defoamers, etc.
White spirit-based emulsions, used in the past as thickening systems, are used only occasionally today (mainly half-emulsion thickeners).
More information regarding the characteristics of the auxiliaries used can be found in Section 8.7.
After applying the printing paste, the fabric is dried and then the pigment is fixed with hot air.
The advantage of pigment printing is that the process can be done without subsequent washing (which, in turn, is needed for all other printing techniques).
2.8.1.2 Printing with diffusing dyes Printing paste preparation The process starts with the preparation of the paste.
Compared to pigment printing, the composition of the pastes is more complex and variable, being determined not by the dye used, but by the printing technique, the substrate, the application and the fixation methods applied.
72 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Apart from the dye, printing pastes contain a thickening agent and various other auxiliaries, which can be classified according to their function as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ oxidising agents (e.g. m-nitrobenzenesulphonate, sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide) Ã¯Â¿Â½ reducing agents (e.g. sodium dithionite, formaldehyde sulphoxylates, thiourea dioxide, tin(II) chloride) Ã¯Â¿Â½ discharging agents for discharge printing (e.g. anthraquinone) Ã¯Â¿Â½ substances with a hydrotropic effect, like urea Ã¯Â¿Â½ dye solubilisers, which are polar organic solvents like glycerine, ethylen glycol, butyl glycol, thiodiglycol etc. Ã¯Â¿Â½ resists for reactive resist printing (e.g. sulphonated alkanes) Ã¯Â¿Â½ defoamers, (e.g. silicon oils, organic and inorganic esters, aliphatic esters, etc.).
More information about the characteristics of the above mentioned auxiliaries can be found in Section 8.7.
All the necessary ingredients are metered (dosed) and mixed together in a mixing station.
Since between 5 and 10 different printing pastes are usually necessary to print a single pattern (in some cases up to 20 different pastes are applied), in order to reduce losses due to incorrect measurement, the preparation of the pastes is done in automatic stations.
In modern plants, with the help of special devices, the exact amount of printing paste required is determined and prepared in continuous mode for each printing position, thus reducing leftovers at the end of the run.
It is common practice in many printing houses to filter the printing pastes before application, using for example a filter cloth.
This operation is especially important for thickeners to prevent free particles from blocking the openings of the screens.
Printing (paste application) After preparation, the paste is applied to specific areas of the textile using one of the following techniques: Ã¯Â¿Â½ direct printing Ã¯Â¿Â½ discharge printing Ã¯Â¿Â½ resist printing Ã¯Â¿Â½ transfer printing.
In the case of direct printing the dye is applied to specific areas of a pre-treated textile substrate, which can be white or pre-dyed (in light colours).
We can speak of discharge printing, if in the fixation process that follows the application of the printing paste there is local destruction of a dye applied previously.
If the etched (discharge), previously dyed area becomes white, then the process is called white discharge.
If, on the contrary, a coloured pattern has to be obtained in the etched area after the destruction of the previously applied dye, then the process is called coloured discharge.
In this case the printing paste must contain a reduction-resistant dye along with the chemicals needed to destroy the previous one.
As a result the pre-dyed background is destroyed according to a pattern and the dye, which is resistant to reduction, takes its place.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 73 Chapter 2 Figure 2.14: Schematic representation of discharge printing In the case of resist printing, a special printing paste (called "resist") is printed onto certain areas of the fabric to prevent dye fixation.
In the case of physical resist the material is printed with a difficult-to-wet resin that inhibits the penetration of a dye applied in a second stage.
On the other hand, with a chemical resist, dye fixation is prevented by a chemical reaction.
Depending on the way the process is carried out, one can speak of pre-printing, intermediate or over-printing resists.
In the first case, which is also the most common, the resist paste is initially printed and dried, then the material is dyed in continuous mode, for example by padding.
Overprinting resists can be applied only if the dye, already present in the previously dyed and dried fabric, is still in its unfixed form, as in the case of developing dyes.
Figure 2.15: Schematic representation of resist printing The difference between transfer printing and the techniques described earlier is that with this technique the surface of the fabric is not directly printed.
Instead, the pattern is first created on an intermediate carrier (e.g. paper) using selected disperse dyes and then it is transferred from there to the fabric.
The dye is usually fixed by placing the printed paper in contact with the fabric into a thermal pressure system.
Under the influence of the heat the dye sublimates and diffuses from the carrier into the fibre of the textile substrate.
There is no need for further treatment such as steaming, washing, etc.
This technique is applied for polyester, polyamide and some acrylonitrile fibres.
Fixation After printing, the fabric is dried.
Water evaporation leads to an increase in dye concentration and at the same time prevents the colours from smearing when the fabric is transported over the guide rollers.
At this stage the dye is not yet fixed.
The aim of the subsequent fixation step is to transport as much as possible of the dye, which is retained by the thickener, into the fibres.
This is especially important with dyes, such as vat dyes, for example, that are printed in the insoluble form and are converted into the correspond soluble state only after reaction with the reducing agents during the fixation process.
74 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Fixation is usually carried out with steam.
Water vapour condenses on the printed material, swells up the thickener, heats the print and provides the necessary transport medium for the diffusion of the dye.
The distribution of the dye between fibre and thickener is an important factor in determining the fixation degree of the dye, which is called "retaining power" of the thickener.
The thickener, in fact, is often composed of polysaccharides and therefore competes with cellulose in retaining the dye.
This is the main reason why the fixation rate of a given dye is 10 % lower in printing than in dyeing.
After-treatment The last step of the printing process consists in washing and drying the fabric.
When printing with insoluble dyes such as vat dyes this operation also serves as a means to re-convert the dye to the original oxidised state.
In this case, after an initial rinsing with cold water, the printed material is treated with hydrogen peroxide.
The process is completed with a soap treatment with sodium carbonate at the boiling point.
As already explained, after-treatment is not necessary with pigment printing and transfer printing.
Ancillary operations At the end of each batch and at each colour change various cleaning operations are carried out: Ã¯Â¿Â½ the rubber belt, to which the fabric is glued during printing (see description below), is cleaned in continuous mode with water to remove excess adhesive and printing paste.
Some machines are equipped with water re-circulation systems Ã¯Â¿Â½ the printing gears (all systems responsible for feeding and applying the paste to the substrate) are cleaned by first removing as much as possible of the paste residues and then rinsing with water.
In some companies the paste residues are directed back to the appropriate printing paste batch containers for re-use Ã¯Â¿Â½ the remaining paste in the containers, in which the paste is prepared (paste vats), are in general previously cleaned up by means of sucking systems before being washed out with water.
The residual printing paste collected in this manner is then disposed of.
2.8.2 Printing technology A variety of different machines can be used for printing fabrics.
The most commonly used are described below.
Flat-screen printing Flat-screen and rotary-screen printing are both characterised by the fact that the printing paste is transferred to the fabric through openings in specially designed screens.
The openings on each screen correspond to a pattern and when the printing paste is forced through by means of a squeegee, the desired pattern is reproduced on the fabric.
A separate screen is made for each colour in the pattern.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 75 Chapter 2 Figure 2.16: Screen printing with automatic squeegee system Flat-screen printing machines can be manual, semi-automatic or completely automatic.
One type of machine, which is still commonly found in printing houses, can be described as follows.
The fabric is first glued to a moving endless belt.
A stationary screen at the front of the machine, is lowered onto the area that has to be printed and the printing paste is wiped with a squeegee.
Afterwards the belt, with the fabric glued on it, is advanced to the pattern-repeat point and the screen is lowered again.
The printed fabric moves forward step by step and passes through a dryer.
The machine prints only one colour at a time.
When the first colour is printed on the whole length of the fabric, the dried fabric is ready for the second cycle and so on until the pattern is completed.
Figure 2.17: Schematic representation of a flat-screen printing machine In other fully mechanised machines all the colours are printed at the same time.
A number of stationary screens (from 8 to 12, but some machines are equipped with up to 24 different screens) is placed along the printing machine.
The screens are simultaneously lifted, while the textile, which is glued to a moving endless rubber belt, is advanced to the pattern-repeat point.
Then the screens are lowered again and the paste is squeezed through the screens onto the fabric.
The printed material moves forward one frame at each application and as it leaves the last frame it is finally dried and it is ready for fixation.
76 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Figure 2.18: Schematic representation of "Mechanised screen printing machine with stationary screens mounted in a frame" In both machines the endless rubber belt, after pulling away the fabric, is moved downward in continuous mode over a guide roller and washed with water and rotating brushes to remove the printing paste residues and the glue, if necessary.
After this, the belt is sent back to the gluing device.
In some cases the glue is applied in liquid form by a squeegee, while in other machines the belts are pre-coated with thermoplastic glues.
In this case the textile is heated and then it is squeezed by a roller or simply pressed against the rubber-coated belt, causing the glue to soften and instantly adhere.
After printing, the screens and the application system are washed out.
It is common practice to squeeze the screens back into the printing paste mixing containers before washing them.
Rotary-screen printing Rotary-screen printing machines use the same principle described earlier, but instead of flat screens, the colour is transferred to the fabric through lightweight metal foil screens, which are made in the form of cylinder rollers.
The fabric moves along in continuous mode under a set of the cylinder screens while at each position the print paste is automatically fed to the inside of the screen from a tank and is then pressed through onto the fabric.
A separate cylinder roller is required for each colour in the design.
VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 77 Chapter 2 Figure 2.19: Schematic representation of the rotary-screen printing process Figure 2.20: Schematic representation of a rotary-screen printing machine A conventional paste feeding system for rotary-screen printing machines is represented in Figure 2.21.
A suction pipe leads from the paste vat to a pump, from where a printing hose leads to the squeegee (dye pipe with squeegee).
From here the paste is directed inside the cylinder roller.
The fill volume of this so-called printing paste input system is quite high and as a consequence the amount of paste residue that has to be removed at each colour change is also fairly relevant.
Various systems have been introduced in order to lower the volume configuration of this equipment, which also reduces the amount of such wastes.
Another possibility, which has also already been implemented in some companies, is to recover and reuse these residues for making up new recipes.
78 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Figure 2.21Printing-paste feeding system for a rotary-screen printing machine Rotary-screen printing machines are equipped with both gluing and washing devices analogous to those described earlier for flat-screen printing.
The belt is washed in order to remove the residues of paste and adhesive.
Not only the belt, but also the screens and the paste input systems (hoses, pipes, pumps, squeegees, etc.) have to be cleaned up at each colour change.
Roller printing In roller printing the print paste is supplied from reservoirs to rotating copper rollers, which are engraved with the desired design.
These rollers contact a main cylinder roller that transports the fabric.
By contacting the rollers and the fabric the design is transferred to the fabric.
As many as 16 rollers can be available per print machine, each roller imprints one repeat of the design.
As the roller spins, a doctor blade in continuous mode scrapes the excess of paste back to the colour trough.
At the end of each batch the paste reservoirs are manually emptied into appropriate printing paste batch containers and squeezed out.
The belt and the printing gear (roller brushes or doctor blades, squeegees and ladles) are cleaned up with water.
Figure 2.22: Roller printing machine VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Version February 2001 79 Chapter 2 Figure 2.23: More recent example of roller printing machine Ink-jet printing Jet printing techniques are employed for printing carpets.
Two techniques are now available: the "Millitron" and the "Chromojet" systems.
The advantages of these techniques are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ contact with the substrate is avoided Ã¯Â¿Â½ a good pile penetration effect is achieved, thanks to the high kinetic energy of the air borne dye Ã¯Â¿Â½ it is possible to use low viscosity printing pastes that are easy to fix and wash out Ã¯Â¿Â½ the cost associated with the production of the screens is eliminated, which is a considerable advantage if we think of the size of the screens that are necessary in the case of carpets.
In the Millitron printing system the injection of the dye into the substrate is accomplished by switching on and off a dye jet by means of a controlled air stream.
The carpet moves along without any parts of the machine being in contact with the face of the substrate.
Air streams hold continuously flowing dye jets, deflected into a catcher or drain tray.
This dye is drained back to the surge tank, filtered and re-circulated.
When a jet is requested to fire, the air jet is momentarily switched off, allowing the correct amount of dye to be injected into the textile substrate.
The dye is supplied in continuous mode from the main storage tank to compensate for the amount of dye consumed.
80 Version February 2001 VD / EIPPCB / txt_draft_1 Chapter 2 Figure 2.24: Schematic representation of the Millitron system In the Chromojet system the printing dyestuff is sprayed onto the face of the carpet in a given pattern by means of high-speed valves (nozzles).
The material is accumulated into a J-box, and is then steamed and brushed.
When it reaches the printing table it is stopped.
The jets are mounted on a sliding frame that can itself be moved in the direction of the warp while the carpet remains stationary during the printing process.
The printing head is equipped with 512 nozzles, which are magnetically controlled and can open and close up to 400 times a second.
This system was developed by Messrs Zimmer in Kufstein, Austria.
The TAK system is another printing system that can be found in the carpet industry.
With this technique irregular patterns can be produced.
The carpet, previously dyed with a ground shade, is provided with coloured spots through dripping.
The size and the frequency of the coloured spots can be varied by adjusting the overflow groove placed along the carpet width.

Operation TO BE COMPLETED? ? ? ? Origin of the emission ? ? Type of emission Table 2.17: Overview of typical emissions associated with printing processes Printing paste residues Printing paste residues are produced for different reasons during the printing process and the amount can be particularly relevant.
Wasted paste results, for example, from incorrect measurements, or more frequently from the common practice of calculating an extra amount of printing paste to prevent a shortfall.
Moreover, at each colour change, printing equipment and containers (dippers, mixers, homogenizers, drums, screens, stirrers, squeegees, etc.) have to be cleaned up.
Print pastes adhere to every implement due to their high viscosity and it is common practice to use dry capture systems to remove them before rinsing with water.
In this way these residues can at least be disposed of in segregated form, thus minimising water contamination.
Another potential source of printing paste comes from the preparation of sample patterns.
Sometimes they are produced on series production machines, which means high specific amounts of residues produced.
Wastewater from wash-off and cleaning operations Wastewater in printing processes is generated primarily from final washing of the fabric after fixation, cleaning of application systems in the printing machines, cleaning of colour kitchen equipment and cleaning of belts.
Wastewater from cleaning-up operations accounts for a large share of the total pollution load, even more than water from wash-off operations.
Emission loads to water are mainly attributable to dyestuff printing processes because in the case of pigment printing, apart from small amounts coming from cleaning operations, pigments are completely fixed on the fibre without need for washing-off.
Pollutants that are likely to be encountered in wastewater are listed in the table below.
