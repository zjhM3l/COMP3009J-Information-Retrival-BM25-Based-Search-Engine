S TONE , DIMENSION Production Rough stone blocks split or cut from a quarry face are transported to processing plants, frequently located at the quarry site, at least for preliminary sizing.
Further dressing, including final sizing and finishing operations, such as polishing, edging, and decorating, also may be done at the quarry site.
In 1998, granite accounted for 414,000 metric tons (t), or 37%, of the total domestic dimension stone production of 1.13 Mt, followed by limestone (33%), sandstone (16%), quartzite (4%), marble (3%), slate (3%), and miscellaneous stone (4%).
Granite accounted for $110 million, or 49%, of total domestic production of $224 million, followed by limestone (27%), sandstone (10%), slate (6%), marble (4%), and miscellaneous (4%).
Production was reported in 33 States and Puerto Rico.
Leading producer States, in descending order by tonnage, were Indiana, Vermont, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Georgia.
These States accounted for 48% of the domestic production.
The leading producer States, in descending order by value, were Indiana, Vermont, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Texas.
These States contributed 49% of the value of domestic production (table 3).
The top five producing companies, listed alphabetically, were Cold Spring Granite Co., in California, Minnesota, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas; Fletcher Granite Co., Inc., in Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Indiana Limestone Co., Inc., in Indiana; Oolitic Victor Stone Co., in Indiana; and Rock of Ages Corp., in New Hampshire and Vermont.
These companies produced more than 25% of domestic production in tonnage and value.
The leading 14 companies accounted for more than one-half the domestic tonnage and value.
Granite.--Dimension granite includes all visibly coarsegrained igneous rocks and similar metamorphic rocks.
Finer grained igneous rock is termed "traprock" and is not normally included in this classification.
Granite was produced by 37 companies operating 72 quarries in 17 States.
Production was 414,000 t valued at $110 million.
Although the value is similar to that of 1997, the tonnage decreased 7%.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Massachusetts, Georgia, South Dakota, Vermont, and North Carolina.
Massachusetts accounted for 21% of the tonnage and 16% of the value of the U.S. granite production (table 4).
The leading producers were Cold Spring Granite, Fletcher Granite, and Rock of Ages, accounting for more than one-half By Lloyd E. Antonides1 and Robert L. Virta Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Brandon P. Pfleckl, statistical assistant.
Dimension stone can be defined as any rock that has been removed from its natural place of origin for ultimate use in construction or monuments where the three dimensions of size (width, length, and thickness), together with shape and other elements of appearance, such as color, grain texture and pattern, and surface finish, are normal requirements.
Durability (essentially based on mineral composition and hardness and past performance) and strength are other important selection criteria.
Although a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are used as dimension stone, the principal rock types are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Other varieties of dimension stone that are normally considered to be special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc), and various products fashioned from natural stone.
U.S. production of dimension stone was estimated to be 1.13 million metric tons (Mt) valued at $224 million; these totals were essentially unchanged from those of 1997.
Exports increased by 9% in value, to $59.6 million, and imports for consumption increased by 27% in value, to $698 million.
Apparent consumption was estimated to be $862 million.
In recent years, most dimension stone has been used in construction applications with the largest portions being sold or used as rough block for building and construction, flagstone, curbing, and ashlars and partially squared pieces.
Monumental stone, another major type, includes memorials of various kinds.
Dimension stone production data for the United States are derived by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from a voluntary survey of U.S. quarry producers of rough and dressed dimension stone.
Data in this report cover rough crude quarried, irregular-shaped and rectangular blocks, and more highly processed stone.
A number of other terms also are used to describe further processing, such as "worked," "dressed," "finished," and "manufactured."
These and other terms used by the dimension stone industry describe such items as the mineral composition of the rock, the shape of the product, the method of finishing a stone, and the type of finished applied (Stone World Buyers Guide, 1998).
No adjustments are made in the data to account for the sometimes substantial losses in processing rough stone into dressed stone.
Sold or used data are considered to be equivalent to production because changes in stocks are not surveyed.
Of the 227 producing dimension stone operations included in the survey for 1998, 112, or 49%, responded, which represent 68% of the estimated tonnage shown in table 1.

STONE, DIMENSION--1998 73.1 of U.S. production in tonnage and value.
Limestone.--Dimension limestone comprises mainly calcite, as well as dolomitic and siliceous limestones.
The type of stone also includes travertine (a crystalline, layered variety) and other porous and clastic-granular calcareous rocks.
Varieties that can be polished are classified as marble by many producers and users.
Limestone was produced by 25 companies from 29 quarries in 9 States.
Production increased by 8%, to 373,000 t from 346,000 t in 1997, and the value increased by 17%, to $61.1 million from $52.3 million in 1997.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas, and Kansas.
Indiana produced 58% of the U.S. tonnage and 46% of the value (table 5).
The leading producers were Buechel Stone Corporation, B.G. Hoadley Quarries Inc., Independent Limestone Co., Indiana Limestone, Minnesota Quarries Inc., Oolitic Victor Stone, and Valders Stone and Marble Inc.
These firms accounted for more than 40% of the total U.S. tonnage and value.
Sandstone.--Dimension sandstone includes calcareous- and siliceous-cemented sandstones and conglomerates (rounded pebbles and cobbles cemented in a matrix of sand) and siltstone (fine quartz and clay particles), as well as quartzite, which may be described as any metamorphosed siliceous-cemented sandstone that fractures conchoidally through the grains.
Sandstone was produced by 28 companies operating 30 quarries in 15 States.
Production decreased slightly to 185,000 t in 1998 from 186,000 t in 1997.
The value decreased by 9%, to $21.8 million in 1998 from $23.9 million in 1997.
The top five producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were New York, Arizona, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and California.
New York was the leading producing State with 26% of the tonnage and 32% of the value (table 6).
The leading producers were Blaser Corp., Finger Lakes Stone Co., Johnston 
These companies accounted for more than 45% of the tonnage and value of domestic production.
Marble.--Marble covers a variety of calcareous rocks in addition to those with the primary metamorphic crystalline carbonate composition and includes serpentine (a greenish hydrated magnesium silicate commonly veined with calcareous material), all of which must be capable of taking a polish.
Marble was mined by seven companies operating nine quarries in five States.
Production was 40,500 t valued at $10.4 million, essentially unchanged from those of 1997 (table 10).
Vermont was the leading producing State, followed by Tennessee, Georgia, Colorado, and Arkansas.
The leading producers were Tennessee Marble Co., Georgia Marble Co., and Vermont Quarries Co.
Additional data have been withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary information.
Slate.--Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock derived from shale or siltstone, readily breaks or splits into thin layers along micaceous surfaces parallel to bedding planes, and comprises mostly quartz, chlorite, mica, and clay minerals.
Slate was produced by 14 companies operating 18 quarries in 5 States.
Production increased by 20%, to 30,000 t in 1998 from 25,000 t in 1997.
The value decreased by 2%, to $13.3 73.2 million in 1998 from $13.6 million in 1997 (table 12).
The producing States, in descending order by tonnage, were Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and California.
Additional data have been withheld to avoid disclosing company propriety information.
Consumption Rough stone represented 55% of the tonnage and 41% of the value of all dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports.
The largest uses of rough stone were in construction (51%) and monumental (20%) applications, by tonnage.
Dressed stone represented 45%, by tonnage, and 59%, by value of the total stone sold or used.
The largest uses of dressed stone were in flagging (26%), curbing (22%), and ashlars and partially squared pieces (19%), by tonnage (table 7).
Uses for the different varieties of dimension stone varied considerably.
The major uses of granite sold or used in 1998 were in monumental rough stone (28%), curbing (28%), rough blocks for construction (14%), monumental dressed stone (8%), and ashlars and partial squared pieces (7%), by tonnage (table 8).
Primary uses of limestone were in rough blocks for building and construction (58%) and dressed stone ashlars and partially squared pieces (12%), by tonnage (table 9).
Primary uses of marble were rough blocks for building and construction (28%), monumental dressed stone (12%), and dressed stone slabs and blocks for building and construction (11%), by tonnage (table 10).
Primary uses of sandstone were in dressed stone for flagging (58%) and rough blocks for building and construction (15%), by tonnage (table 11).
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 1998 was principally for flooring (34%), roofing (31%), and flagging (18%), by tonnage (table 12).
Overall, the apparent consumption of dimension stone in the United States was estimated to be $862 million in 1998, an increase of 20% compared with that of 1997.
Apparent consumption is defined as production plus imports for consumption minus exports.
Value data are used in the apparent consumption calculation because tonnage data are not available for imports and exports.
Also, changes in industry stocks are not considered because the data are not available.
Prices The average 1998 value for dimension stone of $198 per metric ton, based on the USGS survey, was an increase of 4% from that of 1997.
The average unit values for different types of dimension stone were granite, $266 per ton; limestone, $164 per ton; sandstone, $118 per ton; marble, $257 per ton; and slate, $443 per ton.
Price data that are available show considerable variation.
Prices are substantially different, not only for the kind of stone, but also for appearance of the same kind of stone.
Color, grain structure, and finish contribute significantly to price and marketability.
STONE, DIMENSION--1998 Foreign Trade Exports.--Total exports of dimension stone types increased in value by about 9%, to $60 million, compared with those of 1997; granite accounted for 62% of the export value.
The largest share of granite was exported to Italy (table 13).
Imports.--The value of imports for consumption of dimension stone types increased by about 27%, to $698 million.
Italy continued to be the major single source of granite, accounting for 45% of granite imports.
Brazil, Canada, and India each accounted for about 14% of granite imports (table 14).
Italy also was a major source of rough and dressed marble, slate, and travertine imports (tables 15-16).
Duties on imported dimension stone are given in table 2.
World Review World dimension stone production, excluding the United States, was estimated to be approximately 62 Mt in 1996.
Dimension stone was produced in about 30 countries.
Marble composed approximately 34% of the world production; granite, 27%; and others, 39%.
The top five producing countries were, in descending order by tonnage, India, China, Italy, Egypt, and Spain.
These countries accounted for approximately two-thirds of the world production (Napoli, 1998).
The United States was ranked 13th in the production of dimension stone in 1996.
Outlook Demand is expected to grow for dimension stone during the next 5 or more years because of improved technology and variety and the increased costs of alternative construction materials.
Additionally, for residential and office building construction, growth in use of dimension stone is expected in new prestige markets as well as in renovations to attract and keep tenants.
