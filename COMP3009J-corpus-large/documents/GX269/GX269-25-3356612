The Flag of the USA The flag of the United States has 13 horizontal stripes-- alternating 7 red and 6 white--with the red stripes at top and bottom.
The canton, or union of navy blue, occupies the upper left-hand quarter next to the staff and extends from the top to the lower edge of the fourth red stripe.
The 50 stars in the blue Union equal the number of states admitted officially to the Union.
The stars are arranged, with one point up, in 9 horizontal rows.
Rows 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 have 6 stars each.
Rows 2, 4, 6, and 8 have 5 stars each with stars centered diagonally between stars in the longer rows above and below.
The following diagram provides flag terminology and gives official dimensions of the flag: Based on taking HOIST as 1, all other dimensions of flag have a proportion as shown, regardless of variations in overall size.
PEAK "UNION" OR "CANTON" FLY OF UNION= 0.76 HOIST OF UNION=0.5385 "HOIST" IS THE VERTICAL DIMENSION = 1.0 The Flag of Minnesota The Minnesota flag, adopted in 1957, is royal blue with a gold fringe.
In the center of the flag is the state seal.
Around the state seal is a wreath of the state flower, the pink and white showy lady slipper.
Three dates are woven into the wreath: 1858, the year that Minnesota became a state; 1819, the year Fort Snelling was established; and 1893, the year the first official flag was adopted.
Nineteen stars ring the wreath, symbolizing the fact that Minnesota was the 19th state to enter the union after the original 13.
The largest star represents the North Star and Minnesota.
The central seal pictures a farmer plowing a field and an Indian riding a horse.
A red banner with yellow letters has the state motto, l'etoile du nord--French for "the star of the north."
The word "Minnesota" appears in red on the bottom of the white band surrounding the seal.
