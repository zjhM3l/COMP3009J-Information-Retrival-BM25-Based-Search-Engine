Introduction
Standards-Based Curriculum As the curriculum development process takes place, it is important to understand what is meant by the term curriculum.
Traditionally, the term curriculum has been associated exclusively with course content.
Recently, however, the term has been expanded to encompass not only content but also instructional methods and assessment strategies.
The Louisiana Mathematics Framework serves as a guide for curriculum and instruction and as a general reference to the basic principles of mathematics assessment.
Content The Framework defines five pervasive themes and six content strands with benchmarks for each content strand at three levels of education: K-4, 5-8, and 9-12.
The standards and benchmarks define what Louisiana students should know and be able to do in mathematics.
The charts below describe the pervasive themes and content strands.
The content, or what , of each course should reflect all six content strands of the Framework.
Louisiana Mathematics Framework - Pervasive Themes Mathematics as . . .
Problem Solving Numerical Intuition Enables students to . . .
Solve and generate diverse and complex problems that arise from relevant, real-life circumstances.
Develop a common sense approach to using numbers, an intuitive feel for numbers, an appreciation for different levels of accuracy needed and the ability to determine the reasonableness of answers.
Use critical thinking skills in questioning, elaborating, validating, and justifying.
See the connections among topics in mathematics, between mathematics and other subject areas and relevant real-life situations.
Communicate their mathematical knowledge through speaking, writing, and demonstrating.
Reasoning Connections Communication
Applied Mathematics III
Louisiana Mathematics Framework - Content Strands Number and Number Relations Number sense involves an intuitive common-sense approach to number relationships and operations.
It is of primary importance and should permeate every area of the mathematics curriculum.
All students should develop an understanding of numbers and how they relate to one another in terms of magnitude, order, and operations.
Algebra is a powerful language used to analyze and describe relationships and mathematical properties.
It enables students to interpret real-world experiences and gives alternative ways of solving problems.
Measurement is a vital component in connecting numbers to the real world.
The study of measurement should consist of active investigations based on real-world problems and should include the appropriate use of manipulatives and technology.
These investigations should encourage the development of communication, reasoning, and problem-solving skills.
Geometry is the study of the physical shapes of the world in which we live.
It provides an environment for the development of inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.
Data analysis involves the collecting, organizing, presenting, and interpreting of numerical information.
Probability is that branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and the likelihood of events occurring or not occurring.
Discrete mathematics involves finite sets and structure sets, including matrices and graph theory.
These three subjects are essential to help students relate mathematical thinking to real-life situations.
Patterns, Relations, and Functions involves the use of informal investigations to observe patterns created by nature and man.
Through the study of patterns, students learn to generalize, order, and make predictions.
This process leads to an understanding of mathematical relationships as students verbalize, complete, create, and analyze patterns.

Instruction Although a more delineated course content is an important step toward improving school mathematics, improved instruction, or how teachers teach, also plays an important role.
Teachers should incorporate a variety of instructional techniques in their classrooms.
Instructional strategies must complement content in a way that creates a classroom environment in which mathematical tasks engage students' interests and intellect; C classroom discourse promotes the investigation and growth of mathematical ideas; C technology and other tools and materials are used to pursue mathematical investigations; C and students work individually, in small groups, and as a whole class.
C
Assessment Assessment, or how teachers assess student learning in mathematics, is a process through which evidence is gathered about a student's understanding and ability to apply that understanding.
If real change in the mathematics curriculum is to take place, the manner in which assessment is conducted will also have to change.
Changes in mathematics content and in the way mathematics is taught must be reflected through accompanying changes in assessment.
Assessment is an ongoing, dynamic process both diagnostic and prescriptive in nature.
Assessment and instruction must be intertwined so that each supports the other in promoting the development of mathematical power for all students.
Various assessment techniques should be used to evaluate student progress and to assist in making decisions regarding individual student performance.
Some of the assessment techniques and activities that can be used include the following: C C C C C C teacher observation oral questioning written tests requiring constructed responses open-ended questions class presentations projects completed individually and collectively C C C C C journals performance tasks portfolios state assessments standardized tests
Applied Mathematics III
Technology With the infusion of technology into schools, the educational community will need to re-evaluate the content, instructional strategies, and assessment devices that are current practices in schools.
What teachers teach, how teachers teach, and the means by which teachers evaluate the relative success of teaching and learning are influenced by technology.
Some of what has been taught should be revised or eliminated.
In addition, other skills and strategies never previously needing to be taught now need to be stressed.
Recommendations from NCTM The following are recommendations from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics relating to technology.
It is important that each system assess its own program and determine the appropriate use of calculators and technology in the classroom.
C Supply a scientific calculator with graphing capabilities to each student at all times.
C Provide computer availability in every classroom for demonstration purposes.
C Provide computer access to all students for individual and group work.
C Explore and experiment with mathematical ideas such as patterns, numerical and algebraic properties, and functions.
C Develop and reinforce skills such as estimation, computation, graphing, and analyzing data.
C Focus on problem-solving processes rather than the computations associated with problems.
C Use calculators to perform the tedious computations that often develop when working with real data in problem situations.
C Use technology to gain access to mathematical ideas and experiences that go beyond those levels limited by traditional paper and pencil computation.
Continued emphasis on mental mathematics, estimation, number sense, and operation sense in curriculum and in assessment is recommended.
It is important that students know when to use various methods of computation such as mental techniques, pencil and paper algorithms, a calculator, or estimation for a given situation.
Students are expected to apply computational skills in a variety of challenging situations.
Assessment of computational skills should be made in and out of problem-solving contexts.
Applied Mathematics III
Rigorous and Relevant Learning for All Students Education exists in the larger context of society; and as that society changes, education must respond.
In the early 1900s, growing concern about the ability of immigrants to participate effectively as citizens led to modification of the school curriculum to ensure that all students obtained the reading, writing, and computational skills required for citizenship.
After World War II, Americans wanted their children to have a standard of living higher than their own without having to work so hard in the fields, factories, shops, and mills to achieve it.
Going to college was seen as the way to a better life.
Although schools did not abandon their commitment to citizenship, preparing students for higher education became the main thrust of the curriculum.
Now, America is leaving its industrial-based society behind and becoming a more complex, technological, information-based society.
The skills, knowledge, and behaviors students need to succeed in this new society are changing dramatically, with the result that C the old standards in the general track are no longer adequate to prepare students for work, continuing education, or life itself; C the college-prep track needs to be more relevant (although a strong theoretical base continues to be essential, it alone is no longer sufficient); C in addition to basic mathematical skills and knowledge, students need to be able to apply their knowledge and solve complex problems using mathematics; C the relevance of the traditional vocational education curriculum is being challenged as job-specific skills come and go with each wave of new technology; C relevance appears increasingly to be related to lifelong learning skills; C all students need to be able to reason mathematically, to communicate effectively, and to make connections with mathematics to other disciplines and to real-world situations.
Students C C C C today need mathematics courses that will provide courses of study that demand rigor in mathematics; provide relevant applications of rigorous mathematics; are designed for all students; provide students with the necessary mathematics to pursue further study, whether that study be a four year academic college, a two year technical school, on-the-job apprenticeship, etc.; C address all adult roles: work, home/family, citizenship, lifelong learning, and leisure.
Implementation of a rigorous and relevant curriculum requires a thorough understanding of (1) the technologies, procedures, knowledge, and activities in all adult roles; (2) the mathematical skills that underpin these technologies, procedures, knowledge, and activities; and (3) the ways they relate to and are interrelated with each other.
A rigorous and relevant education is mandatory if today's students are to be prepared to function and succeed in a society.
Applied Mathematics III
Applied Mathematics III Course Description
The Applied Mathematics curriculum focuses on giving students the ability to investigate the relationship of mathematical concepts to real-world applications and skills in the technical workplace.
It is designed for the average to above average student with an adequate reading level and the desire for post-secondary education.
Only teachers who have received adequate training and who promote active learning by all students should teach the course.
These courses allow students to explore and discover mathematical concepts through non-routine activities and problem-solving in a wide variety of disciplines.
Students are provided with meaningful hands-on experiences and have the opportunity to learn through teamwork and the use of technology.
It is the goal of the Applied Mathematics program that students become lifelong learners who are able to adapt to a dynamic work environment.
The teacher should provide authentic, rigorous tasks that require students to reason and communicate mathematical ideas.
By shifting from a dispenser of information to one of a facilitator of mathematics learning, the teacher provides a stimulus that promotes active learning by all students.
Teachers must strive to create an environment where students are challenged to justify their solutions, work in teams, formulate their own problems and provide multiple strategies for problem solving.
A variety of rich, meaningful activities should be chosen to connect mathematics to other disciplines and to the real world.
These activities should have the potential for being understood at many different levels and involve the use of calculators and technology.
Oral and written communication should be emphasized to enhance the understanding of the mathematical concepts.
Although application is the driving force of the course, skills must be reinforced.
Applied Mathematics should provide the experiences which enable a person to master new skills, technologies, and procedures on an ongoing basis.
Assessment is a process through which evidence is gathered about a student's understanding and ability to apply understanding.
This process should be not only be an evaluation of students' progress but also a tool to improve teaching and learning.
There is no single type of instrument to assess students' understanding.
Assessment must be varied and may include the following techniques: observations, oral questions, journals, portfolios, tests/quizzes, projects, activities, concept maps, presentations, etc.
These assessment techniques should require students to demonstrate the ability to communicate ideas effectively, to be good problem solvers who can reason critically, and to work together as teams.

Description:
1.
The students are shown drawings of several rectangles and asked to choose which one is their favorite or which one has the most pleasing shape.
Research shows that most people choose the Golden Rectangle.
2.
Explain what the Golden Ratio is and give a little of its historical background.
3.
Show the section of Donald in Mathmagic Land that discusses the Golden Ratio.
4.
Lead students through a construction of a Golden Rectangle.
5.
In groups, students measure the length and width of various rectangular objects.
They then find the ratio of length to width for each object and find an average of the ratios.
Discuss which objects are close to being Golden Rectangles.
6.
In groups, students measure the height and lower torso (belly button to floor) of each student.
They then compute the ratio and take an average.
This ratio should be close to the Golden Ratio.
Find a class average and determine the student in the class with the most "golden" proportions.
Applied Mathematics III
The Golden Ratio Thousands of years ago, the Greeks became interested in a mathematical relationship called "the Golden Section."
This special relationship is illustrated by the line segment below.
A B BC = AC AB BC The value of the ratio is approximately 1.618.
A rectangle in which the ratio of length to width is 1.618 is called a Golden Rectangle.
The Greeks felt the Golden Rectangle was the most pleasing of all rectangles.
It was used extensively in art and architecture, especially in ancient Greece and during the Renaissance.
The Golden Ratio is frequently found in nature: for example, it is found in the spiral of snails' shells, the arrangements of leaves on a branch or seeds on a sunflower, in generations of rabbits, or in the proportions of a starfish.
Ancient artists sculpted human figures so that body height to lower torso (belly button to floor) was 1.618 to 1.
In this lab you will be constructing a Golden Rectangle, finding examples of the Golden Rectangle in everyday objects, and determining whether the ratio of body height to lower torso is the Golden Ratio for each person in class.

Applied Mathematics III Sample Assessment Strategies
According to NCTM's Assessment Standards for School Mathematics, assessment is "the process of gathering evidence about a student's knowledge of, ability to use, and disposition toward, mathematics and of making inferences from that evidence for a variety of purposes."
Assessment should be an ongoing, dynamic process integrally linked to instruction and content.
A variety of strategies should be used and should match the purpose for the assessment.
When choosing an assessment strategy, consider questions such as these: C What do you want to know? C What kinds of information would be most helpful? C What is most important? C How can you judge success? C Specifically, what can you have the students do? C What are you going to look for?

Sample Assessment Strategies The New Soccer Field Your company is constructing a soccer field for a high School.
The field is 110 yards long and 80 yards wide.
You receive the following memo from your boss: The Board of Zoning requires that a 6" layer of gravel must be laid on all athletic fields before top soil is added, to give adequate drainage.
Our gravel supplier says that each truckload contains 12 cubic yards of gravel, at a cost of $9.25/cubic yard delivered.
Calculate how many truckloads of gravel we should order for the soccer field and estimate how much it will cost.
I need to have your background calculations, clearly explained, as well as the total cost in order to get budget approval.
Write a memo to your boss that fulfills this request.
After responding to the first memo, you receive the following memo from your boss: I have good news and bad news.
The good news is we may not need 6" of gravel after all.
The 6" figure applies to soils with poor drainage.
The bad news is that we will not know how thick our gravel layer must be until we receive the soil scientist's report.
Meanwhile, I need to estimate the cost of gravel in order to report on our projected expenses at tomorrow's staff meeting.
In view of this uncertainty, analyze our costs to buy gravel for various thicknesses, ranging from 1" to 8".
Construct a well-organized, understandable display of this information for the meeting.
In addition, write me a clear explanation of how you determined these costs, so I can answer any questions that arise during the meeting.
Respond to the second memo.

Writing Assignments Writing is a valuable instructional and assessment activity and can serve many purposes.
The process of writing helps students clarify their thinking and internalize what they are learning.
Carefully written journal prompts can help students connect what they are learning to concepts they have already mastered, to other areas of mathematics, and to real-life applications.
Journal writing also provides a means for teachers to discover students' attitudes and feelings about mathematics and about their own progress in class.
It can also help teachers assess students' understanding, allowing the teachers to adjust teaching methods and the pace of the class accordingly.
Reading and responding to journal entries provides teachers with opportunities to get to know their students individually, to show concern, and to provide support and assistance.
Writing activities can be used in a variety of ways.
They can be used as homework assignments, as class openers, as a wrap-up at the end of class, or as checks for understanding in the middle of a lesson.
They can vary from formal writing assignments and projects to informal responses to journal prompts.
Informal writing should not be graded for spelling and punctuation, but students should be required to take all assignments seriously and to respond appropriately.
It is important for teachers to model what they expect from students and to be very explicit about what they require and how writing will be assessed.
