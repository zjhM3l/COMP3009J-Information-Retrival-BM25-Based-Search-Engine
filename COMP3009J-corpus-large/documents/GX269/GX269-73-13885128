GENERAL INFORMATION
The Alzheimer's Disease Research Fund is supported by Illinois taxpayers' contributions through their annual state income tax return.
This fund, in existence since 1985, has supported 118 research projects in Illinois.
Grants must be used to investigate the epidemiology, etiology, pathology, diagnosis, care, treatment, evaluation, cure, social and economic impacts, or other important fields of study pertaining to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
Although many of the submitted applications are biomedical or technical in nature, research in the fields of gerontology, nursing, psychology, public health and economics is encouraged.
Research is also encouraged in the areas of respite care, in-home care, longterm care, health care finance and psychosocial issues.
Grants are only available to Illinois researchers.
The application guidelines may be copied and shared with colleagues.
Please note that most of the pages are two-sided.
II.

TYPES OF APPLICATIONS
Grants will be made allowing successful applicants to conduct research, trained inquiry or experimentation related to investigating epidemiology, etiology, pathology, diagnosis, care, treatment, evaluation, cure, social and economic impacts, or other important fields of study related to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
Although many of the applications submitted to the Alzheimer's Disease Research Fund are biomedical and technical in nature, the Fund allows for a broad range of research topics.
Research is also encouraged in the areas of respite care, in-home care, long-term care, health care finance, and psychosocial issues.
ALL RESEARCH PROPOSALS MUST BE BASED ON SOUND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY.
Initial grant awards will be for 12 months (July 1 - June 30), renewable for a second year contingent upon continued availability of funds and adequate performance/progress.
Applicants are therefore encouraged to plan in a way that each year's work, especially Year 01, can stand on its own.
Annual sums, not to exceed $30,000 for a General Research Grant and $35,000 for an Early Researcher Grant, are available.
The Department will fund research grants on an annual basis but for no more than two consecutive years.
Continuation (Year 02) projects must submit an application for review.
The exact amount and number of grants funded will depend upon the amount in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Fund and upon the number of applications received and approved.
The Alzheimer's Disease Research Fund is a special fund in the State Treasury as described in the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois [410 ILCS 410/3].
Funding will be granted to institutions and an individual or individuals under the authority of to students, residents and fellows.
Researchers Alzheimer's Disease Research Fund are eligible not individuals.

Research grants are available previously awarded monies from the to submit applications for different projects.
Early Researcher Grants will be available to support researchers who, at the time of funding, have not been principal investigators on any federally funded grant.
Also, it must be his/her final year of higher education during the grant period or no more than three years past completion of specialty training (first project year only).
The design, organization, management and overall execution of the research must be carried out by the early researcher.
Secretaries, 2
technicians, statisticians and other personnel may be used in an adjunct role, but specialized skills must be carried out by the early researcher.
The applicant must demonstrate by past achievements as well as future plans, apart from the grant project, that he/she intends to commit a major part of the future to research in Alzheimer's disease and related areas.
Early Researcher Grants are eligible for an annual award not to exceed $35,000.
General Research Grants will be available to support qualified principal investigators to investigate specific questions related to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders research.
General Research Grants are eligible for an annual award not to exceed $30,000.
Eligible applicants for either type of research grant (general or early) must meet one of the following criteria: 1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
be a physician licensed in Illinois to practice medicine in all of its branches; be a licensed hospital in Illinois; be a licensed laboratory in Illinois; be a post-secondary higher educational institution in Illinois; or be a health care professional.*
