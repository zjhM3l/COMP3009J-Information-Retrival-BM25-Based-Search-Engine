Revenue sources are on target.
At the close of the third quarter of the current fiscal year, we have spent 68.1 3% of our appropriation.
We are again below 75% due to the fact that we've had little out-ofstate travel and also due to the fact that an investigator position was vacant from July 1, 2003, to November 17.

1.
BACKGROUND
On April 24,2003, the Board of Pharmacy Examiners (hereinafter, "Board") considered a Petition for Waiver filed by Timothy G. Burke ("Petitioner").
Petitioner's request, filed April 11, 2003, seeks a waiver of administrative rule found at 657 IAC subrule 2.12(2).
II.
JURISDICTION The jurisdiction of the board to consider a request for waiver of an administrative rule arises from the provisions of Iowa Code section 17A.9A and 657 Iowa Administrative Code chapter 34.
In.
FINDINGS 1.
Petitioner is currently licensed to practice pharmacy in Iowa.
His license is scheduled for
renewal on June 30,2003.
2.
Petitioner has been diagnosed with Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Grade 3, and has had two surgeries to remove the primary and a secondary tumor.
Petitioner's mobility and strength is limited and he is not able to attend continuing education sessions or to complete continuing education course work.
3.
Petitioner's physician signed the petition for waiver, attesting to the accuracy and truthfulness of the statements regarding Petitioner's health.
IS`.
SUMMARY OF LAW 1.
Iowa Code section 272C.2 requires the Board to establish continuing education requirements as a condition to pharmacist license renewal and to adopt rules in accordance with Iowa Code
chapter 17A on matters pertaining to pharmacist continuing education.
Iowa Code section 272C.2(1), (2), 
2.
657 IAC subrule 2.12(2) provides: The nationally accepted measurement of continuing education is referred to as CEU
(continuing education unit), and the board of pharmacy examiners employs that measurement.
Ten contact hours of approved continuing education are equivalent to one CEU.
The board of pharmacy examiners will require 3.0 CEUs each renewal period.
3.
657 IAC subrule 2.12(9) provides: The board may, in individual cases involving physical disability or illness, grant waivers of the minimum continuing education requirements or extensions of time within which to fulfill the same or make the required reports.
No waiver or extension of time shall be granted unless written application is made and signed by the licensee and the licensee's physician.
The board may grant waivers of the minimum continuing education requirements for physical disability or illness for any period of time not to exceed one renewal period.
In the event that the physical disability or illness upon which a waiver has been granted continues beyond the period of the waiver, the licensee must reapply for an extension of the waiver.
The board may, as a condition of any waiver granted, require the licensee to make up all or any portion of the waived continuing education requirements by any method prescribed by the board.
4.
657 LAC 34.4(17A) provides:
In response to a petition completed pursuant to rule 34.6(17A), the Board may in its sole discretion issue an order waiving in whole or in part the requirements of a rule if the Board finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, all of the following: a.
The application of the rule would pose an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested; b.
The waiver h m the requirements ofthe rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person; c.
The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for a waiver are not specifically mandated by statute or another provision of law; and d. Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested.
5.
657 IAC subrule 34.10(2) provides: The burden of persuasion rests with the petitioner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the board should exercise its discretion to grant a waiver from a board rule.
V. CRITERIA FOR WAIVER
The application of the rule would create an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver 2
is requested:
1.
According to the facts presented by Petitioner, he is not physically able to complete the pharmacy continuing education required prior to his upcoming license renewal due to a serious health condition.
Petitioner is requesting that the requirements for pharmacist continuing education be waived for the current renewal period so that he may renew and mamtain his current, active Iowa license to practice pharmacy.
Imposing the continuing education requirement would create an undue hardship on Petitioner.
The waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person:
2.
Because the Board's rules provide for waiver of the minimum continuing education requirements in individual cases involving physical disability or illness, the Board's decision to grant the requested waiver in this case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any other person.
The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for waiver are not specifically mandated by another provision of law: 3.
The Code vests the Board with discretion to determine minimum continuing education requirements as a condition to license renewal.
Iowa Code section 272C.2.
Pursuant to this discretion, the Board has promulgated rules and standards for pharmacist continuing education, has defined the status of active and inactive licensure, and has recognized the unique situations in which imposition of Iowa's continuing education requirements on licensees may pose an undue hardship.
-657 IAC chapter 2.
The rule and standard that See Petitioner requests a waiver for are not specifically mandated by statute or other provisions of law, are specifically recognized in Board rules, and accordingly may be waived by the Board.
Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be afforded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested: 4.
The public health, safety, and welfare will not be compromised or otherwise placed at risk as a result of the Board`s granting a waiver in this case.
Board rules specifically provide for waiver of all or any portion of the required pharmacist continuing education in individual cases involving physical disability or illness.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:
The provision of subrule 2.12(2) requiring 3.0 CEUs of pharmacist continuing education shall be 3
waived as it relates to Timothy G. Burke's application for license renewal July 1,2003.
The waiver is valid for the continuing education required to be completed between July 1,2001, and June 30, 2003, and to be reported with the application for license renewal due July 1,2003.
This waiver may not be extended for additional renewal periods.

Iowa Code section 155A.6(1), (2), (3), 
2.
657 IAC 4.3(155A) provides, in part:

3.
657 IAC 4.7(155A) provides, in part:
-
The board may grant credit to a foreign pharmacy graduate, based on the candidate's experience in the practice of pharmacy, for all or any portion of the required 1500 hours of internship training.

657 IAC subrule 34.10(2) provides: The burden of persuasion rests with the petitioner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the board should exercise its discretion to grant a waiver from a board rule.
n
L
V. CRITERIA FOR WAIVER
The application of the rule would create an undue hardship on the person for whom the waiver is requested:
1.
According to the facts presented by Petitioner, there.
is not sufficient time between graduation in May and the start of her pharmacy residency program in July to complete the requirements for licensure to practice pharmacy in Iowa prior to beginning the residency program.
A license to practice pharmacy is required for a pharmacist participating in a pharmacy residency program.
Imposition of the full 1500-hour internship requirement would create an undue hardship on Petitioner.
The waiver from the requirements of the rule in the specific case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any person: 2.
B'ecause the Board`s rules provide for .the gr-anting of credit for experience in the practice of pharmacy to a foreign pharmacy graduate, hie Board's decision to grant the requested waiver in this case would not prejudice the substantial legal rights of any other person.
The provisions of the rule subject to the petition for waiver are not specifically mandated by another provision of law: 3.
The Code vests the Board with discretion to determine the standards for internship registration.
-See Iowa Code section 155A.6(3).
Pursuant to this discretion, the Board has . promulgated rules and standards for the pharmacist-intern program.
See 657 JAC chapter 4.
The rule and standard that Petitioner requests a waiver for, howeveGe not specifically mandated by statute or other provisions of law and accordingly may be waived by the Board.
Substantially equal protection of public health, safety, and welfare will be aorded by a means other than that prescribed in the particular rule for which the waiver is requested: 4.
The public health, safety, and welfare will,not be compromised or otherwise placed at risk as a result of the Board's granting a waiver in this case.
Petitioner is expected to graduate fiom the Pharm.
D. program at the Univer
Petitioner is a licensed pharmacist in Jordan, a graduate of the Jordan University of Science and Technology, and has completed 1440 hours of training in community pharmacy in Jordan.
Recognizing the fact that pharmacy practice in Jordan may be substantially equivalent, but not necessarily equal to, the practice of pharmacy in the United States, the Board feels that Petitioner's Jordan experience should not replace all of the required internship.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED: Linda Tahaineh shall be granted credit for 250 hours of internship training based on her licensure 3
and experience in Jordan.
Linda Tahaineh shall be granted credit for 1000 hours of internship training upon certification of her graduation from the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy Phm. D. program.
Linda Tahaineh shall be required to obtain 250 hours of internship training pursuant to the requirements of 657 IAC chapter 4.

Re: Pharmacist License of SCOTT W. BAINBRIDGE License No. 16549 Respondent
1 1 1 1 1 I. JURISDICTION
Case No. 2003-14 EMERGENCY ORDER
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners (hereinafter, "Board") has jurisdiction over pharmacy licensees pursuant to Iowa Code Chapters 155A and 272C (2003).
Respondent
Scott W. Bainbridge possesses pharmacist license number 16549 issued by the Board.
A Statement of Charges was filed against Respondent on April 23,2003.
After receipt and review of the Statement of Charges, and careful review of evidence relating to the Statement of Charges,
the Board has adopted the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Emergency Order.
11.
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
On January 23, 1985, the Board issued Respondent a license to engage in the practice of pharmacy as evidenced by license number 16549, subject to the laws of the State of Iowa and the rules of the Board.
2.
Respondent has most recently been employed as a pharmacist at Hartley Pharmacy, Hartley, Iowa.
3.
On February 23,2003, the board commenced an investigation of Respondent which revealed the following, which the Board hereby finds
a.
On or about August 24,2002, ,in a drug screen conducted by Respondent's thenemployer Wal-mart, Respondent tested positive for use of Nordiazepam, Oxazepam, codeine, hydrocodone and morphine. b. Respondent admited obtaining hydrocodone from a pharmacy in Moville, Iowa, shortly after the Wal-mart drug screen, without a valid prescription.
He further admits the purpose of obtaining the hydrocodone was to "explain" the presence of hydrocodone in his blood at the time of the Wal-mart drug screening.
c.
During December of 2002, a shortage of controlled substances (Adderall and hydrocodone) was discovered at the Hartley, Iowa, pharmacy where Respondent was employed.
d.
At Respondent's request, Respondent's psychiatrist called the Board of Pharmacy Examiners in February of 2003 and reported his impression that Respondent was suffering from, among other things, memory loss, depression, panic disorder, attention deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, massive guilt and severe sleep deprivation.
e.
On March 21,2003, Respondent was admitted to the Behavioral Health Unit of Mercy Medical Center - Sioux City, Iowa, after an Iowa Highway Patrol officer found him driving erratically and on the wrong side of the road and was unable to respond to questions after being stopped.
Upon hospitalization, Respondent was incoherent and suffering acute delirium.
Respondent was alleged to be "seriously mentally impaired" and "a danger to himself and others" in documents which supported the request for a court order committing Respondent to treatment.
f. Subsequently, Respondent was treated at Mercy Hospital in Iowa City, Iowa, on April 7,2003 and April 8,2003, at which time a "partial complex seizure" was confirmed by an electroencephalogram. g.
On or about April 14,2003 Respondent was again admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit of Mercy Medical Center - Sioux City for treatment of bizarre behavior.
At that time, the treating physician concluded Respondent's attention and concentration were poor, his insight and judgment impaired.
4.
The Board finds that the evidence assembled during the investigation of Respondent
supports the April 23,2003 Statement of Charges against Respondent.
The Board also
finds that Respondent has violated the provisions of Iowa Code Chapter 155A and
2
Chapter 657 ofthe Iowa Administrative Code in the manner alleged in the Statement of Charges.
5.
The Board finds that Respondent is an immediate danger to the public health, safety and
welfare for the following reasons: a.
Respondent has engaged in drug abuse (including use of hydrocodone and other controlled substances) with the potential to affect the safety of his performance as a pharmacist.
The drug screen performed by Respondent's employer on August 23,2003 accompanied by evidence of theft of drugs 
b. Respondent was hospitalized at least two - and possibly more - times during the month beginning March 21,2003.
Respondent's hospital admissions were based on disorientation, delirium, confusion, agitation and bizarre behavior.
His first hospitalization occurred after Respondent was stopped by an Iowa Highway Patrolman while Respondent was on his way to work at Hartley Pharmacy, Hartley, Iowa. c. Respondent has been diagnosed as bi-polar, with memory loss, attention deficit disorder, memory loss, seizures and a variety of other ailments and disorders.
Respondent's concentration, attention, insight and judgment are impaired due to his mental and physical condition.
d. Respondent's physical and mental condition are inadequate for work as a
pharmacist and inconsistent with a pharmacist's professional responsibilities.
Respondent's memory loss, seizures, attention deficit and other ailments could result in dispensing errors and incorrect patient counseling if Respondent were allowed to continue to work as a pharmacist.
The possibility of dispensing errors and incorrect counseling in the use of prescription medications constitute an immediate threat to the public health and welfare because an incorrectly dispensed or utilized prescription may cause serious physical harm - or even death -- to a patient.
6.
The Board finds that immediate, emergency action must be taken for the reason that if Respondent is allowed to work as a pharmacist, the public health, safety and welfare will be threatened by both his drug addiction, and his mental and physical condition which could result in Respondent incorrectly dispensing medications to members of the public
3
and failing to communicate regarding procedures for taking the medications, drug reactions, etc. 7.
The Board finds that the minimum emergency action needed to protect the public health, safety and welfare is as follows: a.
Immediate suspension of Respondent's pharmacist license.
b. Issuance of an order directing that Respondent's license shall remain suspended until satisfactory evidence of Respondent's ability to resume the practice of pharmacy has been provided to the Board.
III.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1.
Respondent's physical and mental condition prevent Respondent horn working safely as a pharmacist, in compliance with the provisions of Iowa Code chapter 155A.15 and chapter 657 of the Iowa Administrative Code.
2.
The provisions of Iowa Code 5 17A.18A (2003) permit the Board of Pharmacy
Examiners to take emergency action to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
A basis for emergency action against respondent, pursuant to the provisions of the Iowa Code and the Iowa Administrative Code, has been established by the findings of fact adopted above.
IV.
EMERGENCY ORDER The Board ORDERS as follows: a.
Pursuant to Iowa Code
5
17A.l8A, chapter 155A (2003) and 657 Iowa
Administrative Code Â§ 35, the pharmacist license of Scott W. Bainbridge is

BASIS FOR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
On or about February 5,2003, the Board commenced an investigation of Respondent which revealed the following: 1.

Records regarding the dispensing of controlled substances, required to be maintained by a controlled substance registrant, are not maintained by Respondent.
Inventories of controlled substances held by Respondent, required to be taken not less often than every two years, have not been taken.

) SUSPENSION OF CONTROLLED ) SUBSTANCE REGISTRATION
NOTICE: CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE REGISTRATION NUMBER 1511157 IS SUSPENDED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
I. JURISDICTION I
The Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners (hereinafter, "Board") has jurisdiction over those who manufacture, distribute and dispense controlled substances pursuant to Iowa Code Chapters 124 (2003) and 657 Iowa Administrative Code 5 10.12.
Emergency adjudicative actions by the Board are authorized by Iowa Code 5 17A.18A and chapter 124 (2003), and 657 Iowa Administrative Code 5 10.12(9).
Respondent Deborah Y.
Strauss possesses controlled substance registration number 1511157, issued by the Board on February 19,2003.
11.
FINDINGS OF FACT
An Order to Show Cause was filed on May
T,
2003, regarding Respondent-Deborah Y.
Strouss and controlled substances registration number 1511157, issued to Respondent.
After receipt and review of evidence relating to Respondent's use of controlled substance registration number 151157, the Board adopts the following findings of fact:
1.
On February 19,2003, the Board issued registration number 1511 157 to Respondent, permitting Respondent to dispense controlled substances, subject to the laws of the State of Iowa and the rules of the Board.
2.
3.
Respondent's registration is current and active until February 28,2005.
Respondent is a veterinarian employed at the Whitehawk Veterinary Clinic, 208 First Avenue South, Mt. Vernon, Iowa 52314.
4.
On February 5,2003, the Board commenced an investigation of Respondent which revealed the following information, which the Board hereby finds as fact: a.
During the past 13 months, Respondent wrote 176 prescriptions for a controlled substance, Demerol, which were filled by a single pharmacy.
Of the 176 prescriptions, 39 were allegedly written for animals owned by Respondent.
During the same period, the Whitehawk Veterinary Clinic purchased over 2000 syringes. b. Animals being treated by Respondent are not being administered the
Demerol purportedly prescribed for them.
Respondent has been personally using controlled substances (Dernerol and Valium) obtained for use in her veterinary medicine practice.
c. Records regarding the dispensing of controlled substances, required to be maintained by a controlled substance registrant, are not maintained by Respondent.
Inventories of controlled substances held by Respondent, required to be taken not less often than every two years, have not been prepared.
2
9
d.
Out-of-date controlled substances, located in the Whitehawk Veterinary Clinic, have not been properly disposed of.
5.
The Board also finds that Respondent's conduct, as detailed above, renders Respondent's registration inconsistent with the public interest because the conduct diverts controlled substances intended for veterinary purposes to Respondent's personal use.
6.
The Board further finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare exists for the following reasons: a.
Due to Respondent's apparent addiction to controlled substances, there exists a danger to Respondent, a danger to the animals she treats -
or fails
to treat -and a danger to the owners of animals who are purportedly j
being treated.
b. Respondent's addiction creates both the possibility for errors in treatment of animals and errors in the dispensing of controlled substances to
animals.
Animals in need of treatment which are mistreated or untreated
-constitute a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.
7.
The Board finds that the minimum emergency action needed to protect the public health, safety and welfare is as follows: a. b.
Immediate suspension of Respondent's controlled substances registration.
Issuance of an order directing that Respondent's registration shall remain suspended indefinitely until satisfactory evidence of Respondent's ability
3
to possess a controlled substance registration has been provided to the Board.
111.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.
Respondent has committed such acts as would render Respondent's controlled substance registration inconsistent with the public interest.
2.
Iowa Code
5
17A.18A and chapter 124 (2003) and 657 Iowa Administrative Code
10.12(9) permit the Board to take emergency action to suspend a controlled
substance registration in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
A basis for emergency action against Respondent's controlled substance registration number 1511 157 has been established by the findings of fact adopted above.
i
IV.

Pursuant to Iowa Code 5 17A.18A, chapter 124 (2003) and 657 Iowa Administrative Code 10.12(9), controlled substances registration number 1511 157 is suspended indefinitely.
