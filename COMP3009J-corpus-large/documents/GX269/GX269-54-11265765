Women continue to live longer than men.
However, the gap between the life expectancies of men and women, both nationally and in Minnesota has been decreasing since the 1970s.
Life expectancy in 2000 for women in Minnesota was: Â· 81.5 years at birth Â· 20.0 years at age 65 years Â· 9.6 years at age 80 years Life expectancy in 2000 for men in Minnesota was: Â· 76.5 years at birth Â· 15.9 years at age 65 years Â· 7.7 years at age 80 years

WORKLIFE Worklife factors such as employment status (e.g. working part-time or full-time), caregiving responsibilities, earnings and whether benefits such as pensions are offered impact financial status in retirement.
EMPLOYMENT STATUS Women are more likely to work part-time than men.
Of employed Minnesota women age 16 years and over, one-third (33.7%) worked part-time in 1999.
In 1999, one-half (49.8%) of employed Minnesota women age 16 years and over worked full-time, year-round.

EARNINGS
The gap between men's and women's work-life earnings (estimated earnings during a hypothetical 40-year work-life period from age 25 years through age 64 years) is substantial.
Educational attainment has a major impact on earnings over a work-life as earnings differences compound over time.
Men's work-life earnings were higher than women's work-life earnings for workers at all levels of educational attainment.
For example, women full-time, year-round workers with a bachelor 's degree may expect to earn an estimated $856,131 less from age 25 through 64 years than comparable men with the same level of educational attainment.
PENSION BENEFITS In 2000, 18 percent of U.S. women age 65 years and over were receiving their own pensions compared to 31 percent of men.
Nearly one-half (47 percent) of those participating in employer pension plans were women in 2000.
In 1995, about 7 in 10 women and men were employed in a company offering a pension plan.
Just over three-fourths (75.0%) of women enrolled in these plans, compared to over four-fifths (82.1%) of men.
