LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS Aging Issues and Long-Term Care In 1998, Iowa ranked number one nationally in the percentage of population over 85 years of age, number three in the percentage of population over 75 years of age, and number five in the percentage of population over 65 years of age.
As the baby boom generation gets older, the need for both paid and unpaid caregivers will increase.
In 1998, the average hourly wage for paid caregivers, 89.8 percent of whom are women in positions of nursing aide/orderly, was just $7.94 with few benefits and high turnover.
A typical family caregiver for dependent adults is female, married, 50-60 years of age, and works full time outside the home.
To address the needs of paid and unpaid caregivers for dependent adults, the ICSW supports: 1.
Increased funding for long-term care workers
with assurance that wages of direct care workers are increased to a liveable wage and benefits are affordable.
2.
Higher educational standards for direct care workers.
3.
Legislation to assure protection of vulnerable persons who are being abused but who do not fit within Iowa's current criteria.
4.
Amendment of state tax policy in the Code of Iowa Chapter 422.9(2)(e) regarding tax deduction to include spouse, brother, and sister for whom inhome care is given.
5.
Appropriation to provide a system of assistance for immigrant, mature workers, and welfare recipient populations entering the direct care work force.
6.
Appropriation for long-term care staff retention program.

Section 2 Economics In 1999, Iowa women made 73 cents for every $1 earned by men.
Sixty-four percent of females working full-time earned less than $25,000 compared to 33 percent of males (1999).
Of all adults living in poverty in 1990, 61.9 percent were women.
The situation for female-headed households, no husband present, was even more tenuous with 45.1 percent of those with children under the age of 18 living in poverty.
To address the economic needs of Iowa women, the ICSW supports: 1.
Development of a plan to achieve pay equity for employees in private industry thereby eliminating wage discrimination on the basis of gender.
2.
Legislative action on child care in Iowa with a focus on employment-related child care issues, including: a.
Measures designed to guarantee affordable, quality child care, in particular for women seeking training and/or employment; b. Increase in income eligibility for child care assistance programs to 85% of the state median income; c. Adequate compensation, including benefits, for child care workers; d. Need-based child care centers of adequate size at state educational institutions; e. Increased funding for child care subsidy programs for low-income Iowans; f. Improved supply of quality child care by increased funding for local Child Care Resource and Referral services for programs such as providing parent/ consumer information and odd hour, out of school time, and infant and toddler care; g. Increased training and education for child caregivers/funding for professional development training; h. Funding for family child care "home consultants" to work in targeted areas to increase the capacity and improve the quality of child care for low-income working families; k. Adequate rate structure and a quality child care grant program that will provide more stable income for child care programs, and allow child care providers effective training and direct financial support to attain higher standards and accreditation; and j. Programs that assure affordable, quality child care for working parents and ease of access for families eligible for child care subsidy programs.

Increased funding for displaced homemaker/ Iowans in Transition program grants through the ICSW to serve more individuals and to keep up with the rising costs of services.

Education Females are still clustered into secondary and postsecondary courses that reflect the traditional occupational specializations of women and that are characterized by low pay, low benefits, and low mobility.
A lack of female administrators and teacher role models in traditionally male-dominated fields, sexual harassment (affecting 83 percent of Iowa high school females in 1994), and gender role stereotypes all impact the educational experience of females.
In support of excellence and equity in education, the ICSW recommends: 1.
State funding to provide staff and support for the provision of technical assistance on educational equity for school districts and to monitor implementation of Iowa's multicultural, gender-fair curriculum requirement as well as Title IX. 2.
Legislation to increase teacher pay.

Development of a plan for extending a comparable worth policy to all public employees in Iowa, with state assistance to local government entities in conducting comparable worth studies and a plan for making state revenue-sharing monies at future dates contingent upon adopting comparable worth pay schedules for local government employees.
3.
A requirement that credit be given for skills developed through volunteer and homemaker work experience for purposes of qualifying for hiring and promotion in all personnel selection systems in Iowa state government, its political subdivisions, and all businesses/parties that contract with the state government.

Health A 1996 study shows that 9.1 percent of Iowa women did not have a health care plan.
A higher percentage of women than men, in all age groups, were unable to see a doctor due to cost.
In 1996, women between the ages of 25 to 34 were particularly affected with 13.6 percent of those unable to see a doctor for financial reasons.
The ICSW supports: 1.
Focusing on health care reform until health care coverage is accessible to all Iowans.
2.
Full funding and implementation of the State's Children's Health Care Initiative (HAWK-I), with consideration of available options.
3.
Sustained funding for Primary Care Recruitment and Retention Endeavor (PRIMCARRE) with a two-year service requirement.

Justice Women in Iowa have unique needs relative to the administration of justice in all areas, including legal assistance.
The female prison population in Iowa is on the rise, climbing from fewer than 100 in 1985 to 540 at midyear 1999, peaking at 616 in 1998.
Women of color are disproportionately represented in Iowa's prisons.
In June 1999, for example, African-American women represented approximately 21 percent of the state's female prison population while only one percent of Iowa's female population.
The ICSW supports: 1.
Funding for a full-time position to coordinate, develop, and manage legal assistance to meet the needs of low-income women.
2.
Increased state funding for community treatment programs for women convicted of nonviolent crimes.

SECTION 3: Programs and Projects
The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women (ICSW) works on numerous projects and programs in seeking to advance the status of women.
It collects employment related information and works toward pay equity; strives to equalize women's participation in policy-making positions in the government and private sectors; recognizes Iowa leaders through the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame, the Write Women Back Into History Essay Contest, and the Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice; and addresses issues relating to female adolescents.
EMPLOYMENT PROJECT The Employment Project of the ICSW is funded by state appropriation and by occasional grants to conduct various employment-related programs to assist women statewide.
Publications How to Get Your Bearings - How to Get a Job: The guide, for Iowa women who are looking for a job or who are seeking a better job, includes information on how to write a resume, conduct an interview, obtain personal counseling if needed, fix a car, find housing, etc.
Containing one-third more information than previous editions, the guide, revised by Dr. Judith Anne Conlin, is distributed primarily through the displaced homemaker programs across the state and FaDSS.
Funding for the guide was provided by Iowa Workforce Development and the Carl D. Perkins Applied Technology and Vocational Education Act.
projects (dv/sa) across the state.
The study revealed significantly low wages across the board, with many employees living at, below, or barely over the poverty line.
Because of the increase over the past several years in federal and state monies available to dv/sa projects, the ICSW made, in its report of the study, wage recommendations for specific job descriptions, using comparable jobs in state government as a comparison.
The response was overwhelming.
In a 1998 ICSW follow-up to the study, the Commission's study was credited for approximately $112,000 in pay increases in dv/sa jobs statewide.
This study and follow-up survey continue to be distributed and influence wages and benefits for employees in dv/sa projects.
Wage Survey: In 1993, the ICSW initiated a Department of Employment Services study on gender-wage disparity in Iowa.
That report revealed, among other things, that Iowa women, on average, made 68 cents per dollar that Iowa men made.
The ICSW requested that Iowa Workforce Development conduct research to update the 1993 study.
The results of the 1999 study showed that women, on average, earn 73 cents per dollar that Iowa men made.
The study also found that 64 percent of women earned annual wages of $25,000 or less, while 67 percent of males earned $25,000 or more.
Nationally, women earned 72 cents for every dollar a man made in 1999.

Section 3 Contingency Employment Wage Study: The ICSW initiated a study of contingency workers' wages with Boddy Media Group in late 2000.
The study, which will report information on women in contingency jobs (such as temporary, part-time and contractual work), will address the concern that contingency jobs are femaledominated occupations, have few to no benefits, and have no job security.
Employers will use the information obtained to attract and retain workers.
Lt. Governor Pederson endorsed the study in 2000.
Support for the study comes from United States Department of Labor, Women's Bureau; AFSCME; and Perkins money from Indian Hills Community College.
CHALLENGE GRANT The ICSW's initiative specifically aimed toward Iowa's girls is the Challenge Grant Project, which addresses the needs of adolescent females involved with or at risk for involvement in the juvenile justice system.
Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force The ICSW renewed its intra-agency contract with the Iowa Division of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning (CJJP) to provide staff support to the Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force funded through a U.S. Department of Justice Challenge Grant.
A co-employee with the Commission fulfills the contract terms, including convening the monthly Task Force meetings and supporting other Task Force activities.
The Iowa Juvenile Justice Advisory Council developed the Task Force to oversee CJJP's and the State Advisory Group's activities as well as make recommendations related to gender-specific services.
The Task Force involves key stakeholders in Iowa's juvenile justice system, particularly service providers who want comprehensive system change that reflects gender equity for girls and young women.
The ICSW made periodic presentations to the Iowa Juvenile Justice Advisory Council on the progress of the Challenge Grant Project.
Family-Friendly Initiatives Equal Pay Day: The ICSW commemorated Equal Pay Day on May 11, 2000, marking the date that women, on average, had finally made the same amount that men, on average, earned in 1999.
In other words, women had to work more than four additional months to earn the amount men made in twelve months.
In addition to writing an opinion/editorial piece for leading newspapers around the state, a press release regarding Equal Pay Day was distributed.
A press release and pay equity advertisement were also sent to select women and other organizations state wide that have an interest in pay equity.
On May 11, the ICSW, in collaboration with several Iowa organizations and the National Committee on Pay Equity, held a commemoration and press conference on pay equity.
Governor Vilsack signed a proclamation of Equal Pay Day and results of the 1999 Wage Disparity Study were released.
Partners in the event were AFSCME Iowa, American Association of University Women -- Iowa, Business and Professional Women -- Iowa, Des Moines Metro League of Women Voters, Iowa AFL-CIO, Iowa Commission on Latino Affairs, Iowa Commission on the Status of African-Americans, and Iowa Workforce Development.
"Whispers and Screams" Conference Directed by the Task Force, the ICSW coordinated the April conference, Whispers

Keynote speakers were Dr. Meda Chesney-Lind, nationally recognized for her work on women and crime, and psychologist Dr. Charlotte Sophia Kasl.
The ICSW also began coordination for the fifth annual conference to be held in May 2001, Whispers 
Five staff inservice programs were presented on "Creating a New Context for Girls' Anger."
One presentation focused on strategies that girl-serving programs in the juvenile justice system can utilize to serve girls in more equitable ways.
The presentations complemented and utilized the information provided in the desk protocol, Providing Gender-Specific Services for Adolescent Female Offenders: Guidelines 
Assistance on gender-specific services was also given to the Sioux City Task Force in creating their strategic plan.
Promising Directions: Programs that Serve Iowa Girls in a Single-Sex Environment A resource guide intended for professionals across the state who seek girl-serving resources in their communities was printed in September 2000.
The guide describes services provided in single-sex environments for girls and young women involved with or at risk for involvement with the juvenile justice system, and lists programs that serve girls in a coed environment and other resources.
Other: The ICSW reviewed Department of Human Services grants for gender-specific aftercare services for girls; reviewed formula grant proposals for Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning; participated in the Restorative Justice Initiative in Polk County; and wrote four editions of The Girl Connection for publication.
"Using Circle Groups with Girls: Juvenile Justice Applications" Intensive Retreat The ICSW coordinated an intensive retreat for members of the Iowa Gender-Specific Services Task Force and other invited professionals, which was led by Minnesota Department of Corrections staffers Susan Stacey and Paula Schaefer.
The retreat, held on October 12-13, combined experiential learning and research-based presentations to support participants in exploring programmatic approaches to using circle groups with girls.
RECOGNIZING IOWA LEADERS The ICSW believes that in order to advocate for the full participation by women in the political, economic, and social life of the state, leaders in those areas need to be identified, recognized, and promoted as role models.
Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice This award was established in 1982 and honors the woman who served on the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women and who first chaired the statutory Commission.
From 1972 to 1976, Cristine Wilson led the Commission in combatting sex discrimination and in promoting equal opportunity.

Held at Younkers Tea Room in Des Moines, the luncheon featured Beverly Everett, Hall of Fame member, as the speaker.
State officials, Hall of Fame members, and Commissioners were specially recognized at the event, and the Friends of ICSW endowment fund winners were announced.
Suzanne O'Dea Schenken was honored with the medal at the 2000 Iowa Women's Hall of Fame Ceremony, Des Moines.
Schenken is a feminist scholar and activist.
Her newest publication, From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics, is a two-volume reference guide listing people and events that have influenced the role of women in the United States.
Legislators and Politicians: Iowa's Women Lawmakers delves into the experiences of the women who have served in Iowa's General Assembly.
However, Schenken's work for women does not stop with research alone.
She worked tenaciously on two campaigns for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and the successful campaign in 1998 to Add Women to the Iowa Constitution.
As a member of its advisory board, Schenken has fostered the mission of the White House Project to have more women run for public office by coordinating a local initiative to mentor young women interested in holding elective office.
She has served on the Friends of the Iowa Commission on the Status of Women since 1992 and been president for the past six years.
As a fundraiser for the group, Schenken wrote Iowa Women of Achievement and edited a weekly planner featuring Iowa Women's Hall of Fame inductees.
Currently, she is part of a group raising money to build a sacred place at the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women in Mitchellville.
Iowa Women's Hall of Fame The Iowa Women's Hall of Fame was established by the ICSW in 1975 to honor outstanding Iowa women.
Each year four women, living or deceased, are recognized for their significant contributions to our society.
The 26th Annual Iowa Women's Hall of Fame Ceremony was held in Des Moines on Saturday, August 26, 2000 at the State Historical Building of Iowa, Des Moines.
The reception held in the atrium following the ceremony was funded by the Friends of the ICSW.
This year the ceremony was held on Women's Equality Day, which commemorates the day in 1920 when American women first received the vote.
At the ceremony, the Lt. Governor read the Women's Equality Day Proclamation.
Awards were presented to the recipients by Lt. Governor Sally Pederson, Commission Chairperson Lisa Greeen, and Hall of Fame Nominating Committee Member, Shawn Mullen.
The 2000 Hall of Fame Nominating Committee was composed of Lisa Green, committee chair; Judge Brown, commissioner; Shawn Mullen, commissioner; Kathryn Burt, commission chairperson, ex officio; Patricia Ohlerking, State Historical Society of Iowa; and Suzanne O'Dea Schenken, Des Moines author.
The honorees represented a wide range of interests and accomplishments and have made extraordinary contributions in their various fields.
The following are biographies of the 2000 inductees.

The Roster of Qualified Women has contributed significantly to the expanding role of women in government.
Since the need was perceived and the Roster was developed, the number of appointments of women has increased dramatically.
Since 1987, gender balance on boards and commissions has been mandated, a legislative change for which the Commission advocated.
Women and Minorities on Corporate Boards of Directors Project The idea for increasing the number of women and minorities who serve on corporate boards of directors evolved from a 1995 survey conducted by the ICSW and the Iowa Department of Economic Development.
Results showed that less than 7 percent of board members in Iowa's 47 largest publicly-owned corporations were female; none were women of color.
Similarly, only a handful of men of color were represented.
As a result, the ICSW researched the possibility of establishing a database of women and minorities who want to serve on corporations.
In 1999, Governor Vilsack endorsed the project.
Task Force/Steering Committee: The ICSW and representatives of Drake University's School of Business and Public Administration met several times and established a steering committee to discuss the feasibility of such a database.
The database would be designed in cooperation with Drake University to help break the "glass ceiling" by identifying Iowa women and minorities who wish to sit on corporate boards of directors and matching them with appropriate businesses, thereby increasing their representation on those boards.
WOMEN IN POLICY-MAKING POSITIONS While the ICSW works hard at eliminating the "sticky floor"--women who are stuck in lowpaying jobs with few benefits and opportunities for advancement--it also recognizes the need to break the "glass ceiling" in government and private sector policy-making positions.
It has projects aimed at accomplishing both.
Roster of Qualified Women In 1970, the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women assumed responsibility for developing a roster of Iowa women qualified for appointments to paid and volunteer positions on state boards and commissions.
When the Commission was made statutory in 1972, it continued to develop the roster and to submit names for the Governor's consideration in making appointments.
Appointment resume forms are provided upon request; they include biographical information, educational background, work experience, organizations, and information on areas of interest.
Each year it advertises the availability of appointment resumes in the IoWoman, the Friends of ICSW newsletter that is

Advocacy Directory Originally undertaken jointly by the American Association of University Women, Iowa Division, and the ICSW, with updating funded by the Family Community Leadership, the statewide advocacy directory was designed to provide a computerized guide to networks on women's issues in Iowa.
In 2000 the directory was continually expanded and updated; approximately 6,200 persons are in the database for one or more of the 66 categories of interest and/or experience.
As an ongoing commission program, the directory will continue to expand its database and its usefulness throughout the state, and additional persons and organizations will be identified on a regular basis.
Printouts of category lists are available for a minimal fee from the ICSW; the Iowa women's organizations listing is free.
Internship/Volunteer Opportunities The ICSW mailed announcements about available internships in its office to all four-year colleges and universities statewide.
Interns were selected for both the spring and summer semester.

SECTION 5: Contractual Agreements The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women (ICSW) has contractual agreements to administer state fund appropriations to public and private nonprofit programs providing services to Iowans in Transition (displaced homemakers and female offenders) and to administer state fund appropriations to the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault (IowaCASA) for training on issues related to domestic violence and sexual assault.
IOWANS IN TRANSITION GRANTS During fiscal year 2000, the ICSW administered $189,972 in state fund appropriations as grants to 11 public and private nonprofit programs providing services to displaced homemakers and female offenders, or Iowans in Transition.
Displaced homemakers are individuals who have worked principally in the home providing unpaid household services for family members.
They are persons who are unemployed or underemployed; have had or would have difficulty finding appropriate paid employment; and have been dependent on the income of another family member or on government assistance, and are no longer supported by that income.
Programs that work with displaced homemakers and female offenders help them deal with the trauma of their situation and prepare them for education and training toward self-sufficiency.
Reports from the programs with grants during fiscal year 2000 show a total of 2,166 (2,050 displaced
homemakers and 116 female offenders) were served with counseling (1,990 persons); support services (679); workshop seminars (809); ABE, GED, and English as a Second Language (259); academic upgrading (285); and training for a degree (740).
At intake, 731 persons were receiving welfare.
Since July 1999, 13 of the 23 programs serving displaced homemakers in Iowa have closed.
Eight of those programs had received ICSW Iowans in Transition grant funding.
Fiscal Year 2001 Grants: The ICSW administered $198,500 in grants for fiscal year 2001.
Applicants for the grants were accepted from freestanding entities and subgroups or special programs sponsored by a larger organization.
Twenty-five applications were received from the programs located statewide.
In June, the six-member Displaced Homemaker Advisory Committee met and made grant recommendations.

Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001: The ICSW administered state fund appropriations of $9,500 to ICADV to provide training to community professionals and the general public, $6,250 to provide training to service providers, and $5,250 to provide training to criminal justice system personnel on issues of domestic violence.
IowaCASA was funded through state appropriations of $9,665 to provide training to service providers, $5,667 for training of community professionals, and $5,668 to provide general public education on issues of sexual assault.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Addressing the priority area of violence against women is done through a cooperative relationship with the Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault (IowaCASA).
Resources and information are shared among the offices, thereby enhancing the ICSW's ability to carry out its responsibilities through interaction with these private, nonprofit agencies.
Together, they work to strengthen efforts to prevent sexual assault and domestic violence, and to support programs that provide services to victims.
