CANDIDATE'S GUIDE TO THE TEXAS PHARMACYJURISPRUDENCE EXAM As required by the Texas Pharmacy Act, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy administers a Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam to candidates for licensure in Texas.
TEXAS PHARMACY JURISPRUDENCE EXAM - The Board uses the services of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), and administers their Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE).
Although the MPJE is developed for use by multiple states, all of the exam questions on the Texas version of the exam are applicable to pharmacy practice in Texas.
This exam is a comprehensive exam, which includes questions on both federal and state statutes and rules pertaining to the practice of pharmacy in Texas.
- The exam is designed to measure each applicant's knowledge of pharmacy law.
Candidates should be aware of conflicting areas between Texas and Federal laws and rules and should answer exam questions on the basis of the more stringent statute or rule.
You will be given 2 hours to answer 90 multiple choice questions .
- Since the exam is a qualifying exam, applicants are not competing against each other for a passing score.
An applicant is required to attain a score of no less than 75 on the exam.
The score is calculated by first determining the candidate's ability level on the MPJE, and then comparing the candidate's ability level to the predetermined minimum acceptable ability level established for the MPJE.
An applicant who passes NAPLEX but fails the Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam is required to repeat only the Jurisprudence exam.
If an applicant passes the Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam but fails NAPLEX, the applicant may use the passing grade on the Jurisprudence examination for licensure purposes for a period of two years from the date of passing the exam.
COMPETENCY OBJECTIVES - The MPJE Competency Statements, found in the MPJE Registration Bulletin, serve as the blueprint for the topics covered on the Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination.
The competency objectives contained in this document are a detailed supplement to the MPJE Competency Statements.
- The attached list of competency objectives provides a guide to the facts and information that you should be prepared to apply to practical situations.
Although the exam is a multiple choice exam, the competency objectives are written in an essay format.
Test experts believe that one of the best ways to prepare for an exam, is to prepare for an essay exam.
