S TONE , DIMENSION Description and Terminology There is overlap between scientific and commercial descriptions of various dimension stone types.
The scientific description of dimension stone types is focused primarily on the stone's locality and mineralogical composition, whereas the commercial description is focused primarily on the locality and color of the stone.
Furthermore, various combinations of the scientific and commercial descriptions are used by stone producers to effectively market their stone products.
The descriptions that follow were adapted from Barton (1968, p. 28) and Currier (1960, p. 1-10).
Granite.--Commercial granites include all feldspathic crystalline rocks of mainly interlocking texture and with individual mineral crystals that are visible to the naked eye.
This category includes rock types such as anorthosite, gneiss, granite, granodiorite, monzonite, syenite, and all other intermediate rock types.
Primary colors of granites are gray, pink, red, and white with brown and green being secondary colors.
Black granites (which are not true granites mineralogically but rather mafic rocks such as diabases, diorites, gabbros, and similar rocks) are also included in this category and range in color from dark gray to black.
Limestone.--Commercial limestones are rocks of sedimentary origin primarily composed of calcium carbonate or calcium and magnesium.
Included in this category are calcitic limestone, dolomite, dolomitic limestone, and travertine (a rock that forms from evaporation of surface waters rich in calcium carbonate or chemically precipitated from hot springs).
Marble.--Commercial marble includes metamorphosed limestones and serpentine rocks--all capable of taking a polish.
An important member of this classification is serpentine marble, also known as verde antique, which is composed of green to black serpentine (a hydrous magnesium silicate mineral), crisscrossed by veins of lighter minerals such as calcite or dolomite.
Sandstone.--Commercial sandstone is a lithified sand composed chiefly of quartz or quartz and feldspar of fragmental (clastic) texture.
Sandstone contains interstitial cementing materials such as calcite, clay, iron oxides, or silica.
Arkose (abundant feldspar grains), conglomerates, and graywacke (abundant rock fragments) are included in this category.
Other members of this category include bluestone (a dense, hard, finegrained feldspathic sandstone, which splits easily along planes into thin, smooth slabs), brownstone (feldspathic sandstone of brown to reddish-brown color, owing to abundant iron oxide), and flagstone (a sandstone or slate that splits into large, thin slabs).
By Thomas P. Dolley Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Brandon P. Pfleckl, statistical assistant.
Dimension stone can be defined as natural rock material quarried for the purpose of obtaining blocks or slabs that meet specifications as to size (width, length, and thickness) and shape (Barton, 1968, p. 4).
Color, grain texture and pattern, and surface finish of the stone are also normal requirements.
Durability (essentially based on mineral composition and hardness and past performance), strength, and the ability of the stone to take a polish are other important selection criteria.
Although a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are used as dimension stone, the principal rock types are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Other varieties of dimension stone that are normally considered to be special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc), and various products fashioned from natural stone.
U.S. production of dimension stone in 1999 was estimated to be 1.25 million metric tons (Mt) valued at $255 million--a 13% increase in value compared with that of 1998.
Additionally, U.S. production of dimension stone in 1999 was the largest amount reported since 1993.
Exports decreased by 8.6% in value, to $54.5 million, and imports for consumption increased by 16% in value, to $808 million.
Apparent consumption was estimated to be $1.01 billion.
In recent years, most dimension stone has been used in construction applications with the largest portions being sold or used as rough block for building and construction, flagstone, curbing, and ashlars and partially squared pieces.
Monumental stone, another major type, includes memorials of various kinds.
Dimension stone production data for the United States are derived by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from a voluntary survey of U.S. quarry producers of rough and dressed dimension stone.
Data in this report cover rough crude quarried, irregular-shaped and rectangular blocks, and more highly processed stone.
A number of other terms also are used to describe further processing, such as "worked," "dressed," "finished," and "manufactured."
These and other terms used by the dimension stone industry describe such items as the mineral composition of the rock, the shape of the product, the method of finishing a stone, and the type of finish applied (Stone World, 1999, p. 96-126).
No adjustments are made in the data to account for the sometimes substantial losses in processing rough stone into dressed stone.
Sold or used data are considered to be equivalent to production because changes in stocks are not surveyed.
Of the 230 producing operations included in the survey for 1999, 99 or 43%, responded, which represents 64% of the tonnage; the remainder was estimated (table 1).
STONE, DIMENSION--1999 73.1 Slate.--Commercial slate is a microgranular metamorphic rock formed by the recrystallization of clay sediments (shale, siltstone, or claystone).
Characterized by excellent parallel cleavage, slates may be easily split into relatively thin slabs.
Greenstone.--Commercial greenstones are the result of the metamorphism of basaltic rocks.
Greenstone is named because of the predominance of greenish minerals such as actinolite, chlorite, or epidote.
Basalt and Traprock.--Commercial basalt and traprock includes igneous rocks that are too fine grained to be termed black granite.
The name traprock is derived from the term "trappa," meaning stairway--the characteristic terraced or steplike appearance of certain basalt lava fields.
This category includes extrusive igneous rocks (such as andesite, basalt, or dacite) and intrusive igneous rocks (such as amphibolites, diabase, diorites, fine-grained gabbros, peridotites, and pyroxenites).
Miscellaneous.--This category includes dimension stone types that do not easily fall into the aforementioned categories, such as soapstone, talc, or steatite (rocks containing various amounts of talc).
Additional miscellaneous dimension stones include diatomite, mylonites, pumice, schist, tripoli, tuff, porous or scoriaceous volcanic rocks, or any other rocks used as building stones.
Production Rough stone blocks split or cut from a quarry face are transported to processing plants, frequently located at the quarry site, at least for preliminary sizing.
Further dressing, including final sizing and finishing operations, such as polishing, edging, and decorating, also may be done at the quarry site.
In 1999, limestone accounted for 446,000 metric tons (t), or 36%, of the total domestic dimension stone production of 1.25 Mt, followed by granite (35%), sandstone (16%), marble (3%), slate (2%), and miscellaneous stone (8%).

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK--1999 Consumption Rough stone represented 57% of the tonnage and 40% of the value of all dimension stone sold or used by domestic producers, including exports.
The largest uses of rough stone were in construction (49%) and monumental (19%) applications, by tonnage.
Dressed stone represented 44%, by tonnage, and 60%, by value of the total stone sold or used.
The largest uses of dressed stone were in flagging (25%), ashlars and partially squared pieces (19%), and curbing (10%), by tonnage (table 7).
Uses for the different varieties of dimension stone varied considerably.
The major uses of granite sold or used in 1999 were in monumental rough stone (29%), rough blocks for construction (21%), curbing (12%), monumental dressed stone (8%), and ashlars and partially squared pieces (6%), by tonnage (table 8).
Primary uses of limestone were in rough blocks for building and construction (47%) and irregular-shaped stone (13%), by tonnage (table 9).
Primary uses of marble were rough blocks for building and construction (29%), tile (16%), and monumental dressed stone (12%), by tonnage (table 10).
Primary uses of sandstone were in dressed stone for flagging (57%) and rough blocks for building and construction (15%), by tonnage (table 11).
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 1999 was principally for flooring (37%), roofing (36%), and flagging (7%), by tonnage (table 12).
Apparent consumption is defined as production plus imports for consumption minus exports.
Overall, the apparent consumption of dimension stone in the United States was estimated to be $1.01 billion in 1999, an increase of 16% compared with that of 1998.
Value data are used in the apparent consumption calculation because tonnage data are not available for imports and exports.
Also, changes in industry stocks are not considered because the data are not available.
Prices The average 1999 value for dimension stone was $204 per metric ton--an increase of 3.6% from that of 1998, based on the USGS survey.
The average unit values for different types of dimension stone were granite, $263 per ton; limestone, $168 per ton; sandstone, $132 per ton; marble, $237 per ton; and slate, $490 per ton.
Price data that are available show considerable variation.
Prices are substantially different, not only for the kind of stone, but also for appearance of the same kind of stone.
Color, grain structure, and finish contribute significantly to price and marketability.
Foreign Trade Exports.--In 1999, total exports of dimension stone types decreased in value by about 9%, to about $55 million, compared with those of 1998; granite accounted for 59% of the export value.
The largest share of granite was exported to Italy (table 13).
Imports.--The value of imports for consumption of dimension stone types increased in 1999 by about 16%, to $808 STONE, DIMENSION--1999 million.
Italy continued to be the major single source of granite, accounting for 45% of granite imports.
Brazil, Canada, and India each accounted for about 14% of granite imports (table 14).
Italy also was a major source of rough and dressed marble, slate, and travertine imports (tables 15-16).
Duties on imported dimension stone are given in table 2.
World Review World dimension stone production, excluding the United States, was estimated to be approximately 60 Mt in 1998 and preliminary numbers indicate that this total is unchanged for 1999.
Although some small-scale production probably occurs in the majority of the world's nations, dimension stone was produced and officially reported in about 34 countries.
The top five producing countries in 1998 were, in descending order by tonnage, China (13.0 Mt), Italy (9.89 Mt), India (8.57), Iran (6.50 Mt), and Spain (5.56 Mt)--these countries accounted for about 73% of the world production.
The United States was ranked 11th in world production of dimension stone in 1998 (Internazionale Marmi e Macchine Carrara S.p.A., International Quarry Production, accessed August 15, 2000, at URL http:// www.immcarrara.com/stats/english-version/indexstone-sector.html).
Outlook Demand is expected to grow for dimension stone during the next 5 or more years because of improved technology and variety and the increased costs of alternative construction materials.
Additionally, for residential and office building construction, growth in use of dimension stone is expected in new prestige markets as well as in renovations to attract and keep tenants.
