Plant Inspection Guidelines General Appearance (661.04) The general appearance of a plant is the quickest way to judge its health and vigor.
Be sure that the plant:
-- -- -- -- -- -- --
is healthy, typical of their species or variety and have a normal growth habit meets the minimum dimensions given in the General Notes container is not cracked or severely dented container is weed free is generally symmetrical with no large gaps in the branching structure has no broken limbs is free of excessive bark damage
The foliage of the plant should be:
-- -- -- --
erect and firm (except for weeping type plants) a uniform green color (except for fall color) vigorous, healthy and robust free of wilting, yellowing and browning.
NOTE: Inspection of the plants before unloading from truck will save time and effort.
Plants do not need to be individually inspected; a random inspection will be OK.
The source of supply should be verified from the shipping ticket and compared to the plant material list ( CMS 661.05) as submitted earlier.
Plants not meeting spec or that differ in source of supply is justification for non-acceptance.
Problem Signs Substantial amounts of brown or yellow foliage indicate the plant may be experiencing stress or shock.
(Be aware that some trees, depending on whether they are deciduous or evergreen, may change color during the fall.)
Wilted foliage probably indicates a lack of water during shipping or storage.
All plants must be completely covered during shipping (CMS 661.07).
A thorough watering should restore the foliage to a healthy appearance within a couple of days.
If not, the plant should be monitored for a few more days to see if it recovers before planting.
If the condition does not improve, reject the plant.
Broken and dead limbs indicate poor growing or handling conditions.
Page 2
Testing for Dead Plants or Limbs It is not always easy to tell if a plant is alive, particularly during the winter if the plant is a deciduous variety and has shed its leaves.
Some of the techniques listed below will help to determine if a plant (or a part of the plant) is alive.
--
Using your fingernail, pocket knife or other sharp object, scratch the bark on the trunk or limbs.
A living plant will be light-green and moist just below the soft bark.
If the bark is hard and the scar is brown, that part of the plant is dead.
A random check of other areas will help to determine if the plant is vigorous and healthy.
Wrinkled bark that is off-color is an easy visual clue to dead parts of a plant.
Plant roots should be white beneath the outer bark.
Dark brown or blue-black roots indicate damaged or dead roots.
Healthy limbs are flexible.
They can be bent without breaking.
Dead limbs are dry and brittle.
-- -- --
Container Grown Plants The roots of a container grown plant should:
-- -- --
be growing throughout the growing medium bind all the soil together be white in color and moist; dark brown or blue-black roots indicate damaged or dead roots.
Testing for adequate root system: inspecting the root systems of plants is very important.
It is not necessary to test all the plants; random checks will be sufficient if all the plants are from the same grower.
If the plants are provided from more than one supplier or grower, be sure to random-check each group.
Also inspect any plants that appear different or out of character with a group of like plants.
--
For shrubs, hold the plant at the base of the trunk and gently lift the plant a few inches out of the container.
If the entire contents of the container moves and holds its shape in a firm mass of roots, the plant is properly "rooted-out" and ready for planting.
For trees, lay the container on its side, hold the tree at the base of the trunk as close to the soil level as possible and gently slide the tree from the container a few inches.
If soil is left in the container or it the root system is not growing throughout the entire container, the plant is not ready for planting and should be considered for rejection.
--
This method is not possible for large trees.
Instead, dig two to three inches into the soil at the very edge of the container and look for a firm mass of small roots.
Page 3
Root-bound Container Plants If plants have been growing in their container for a long time, the roots will wrap around the inside of the container.
These roots need to be cut or sliced prior to planting.
These cuts should be made along the sides and bottom.
Cutting these circling roots will enable the plant to produce new root offshoots and grow without problems.
Checking Container Sizes.
The size of large plastic containers may be indicated on the handle.
Since these are nominal volume sizes only, there may be some variation in actual size even though the containers from two different growers are labeled as being the same volume.
Refer to Appendix for the minimum acceptable size ranges for containers without sizes printed on them or for wooden or metal containers.
Soil Condition in Containers.
Check for the following soil conditions:
--
The soil level should be within a couple of inches of the top of the container.
It should be a light (by weight) soil mix of mostly bark mulch and perlite or vermiculite (small white or silver particles that help hold water).
If you see clay, burlap or wire in what is supposed to be a container grown plant, inspect closer to determine if the plant has been dug from the field and the n placed in the container.
The root development test described previously should determine this.
A containerized plant in lieu of a container grown plant is not acceptable and must be rejected.

-- -- -- -- --
a firm, tight ball with no roots protruding outside the wrapping wrapping that is snug and free of rips and holes cracked balls or balls that are soft and look like a bean bag (these should be rejected) damage to the base of the trunk caused by wire or string used to secure the wrapping moist soil
Soil Condition of the Rootball.
The soil in a B
This is necessary so that the soil will hold its shape during digging, as well as hold water during shipping and storage.
Rootballs that are mostly sand may crack and break easily, possibly exposing roots to heat and dry air.
Plants with a sand rootball should not be accepted.
The rootball must be moist and shaded for protection at all times when shipping or storing.
Measuring Caliper.
This is measured 6 inches above the ground (or top of root ball) up to and including 4 inch caliper size and 12 inches above the ground for larger sizes.
Measurement should be taken with "pincher" type caliper or diameter tape.
Page 5
Proper Habit of Growth: If a particular habit, i.e. single stem, multiple stem, etc., has been specified, be sure to obtain plants that conform to this requirement.
Height of branching should bear a relationship to the size and kind of tree, also, so that the crown of the tree will be in good balance with the trunk as the tree grows.
Example: 2 in. caliper =12 to 14 ft. average height; 16 ft. maximum height Shade and flowering trees should have top growth symmetrically balanced.
Shade trees should have a single leader.
The branching should be well developed and characteristic of the species.
Example: 3/4 in. caliper=7 or more branches Multi-stem trees can be defined as Clump or Shrub form.
Clump form is a tree having two or more main stems arising from the root crown.
Shrub form has multiple stems arising from the root crown in the manner of a shrub.
Multi-stem trees are measured by height; taken from the ground level (or top of root ball) to the average uppermost point of growth of the plant.
Evergreen trees and shrubs should be full foliaged plants with uniform density.
Sheared plants, such as pines sheared for Christmas trees, must be avoided unless specified.
Most evergreen shrubs, such as juniper and yew, are measured by spread and should be the average of the plant.
Evergreen trees like pines and spruces are measured by their height.
Deciduous shrubs should be well branched and full wit h no large holes from missing branches.
Most are broad upright type plants and are measured by their height.
Well grown material should have a height equal to if not greater than the spread.
However, the spread should not be less than two-thirds of the height.
Rejected Plants: Plants rejected for the project should be removed as soon as possible.
They should be marked to preclude the possibility of their installation on the job.
Since discarded plants are the property of the contractor, they should not be marked or mistreated in such a way as to make them unfit for other uses.
Page 6
Insects (661.04) Do not allow the contractor to deliver any plants to the site that are infested with harmful insects.
Harmful insects are those that eat or bore into the plant, including:
-- -- -- -- -- --
caterpillars borers aphids scale mealy bugs bagworms
When inspecting for insects, look for:
--
the insects themselves.
Most insects that suck plant juices usually do so from the undersides of leaves, particularly tender new leaves.
Be sure to check these areas: aphids 
-- -- -- --
Beneficial insects can include Lady Bugs and Butterflies.
If insects are found, and it is unknown whether they are harmful or beneficial, the inspector can call the Central Office Horticulturist or the County Extension office.

Inspection During Planting The purpose of this part is to serve as a guide for an inspector who may not have the experience to determine that planting operations at the construction site are being properly completed in conformance with contract plans and specifications and good horticultural practices.
Planting stock should be inspected upon delivery.
This will insure that the plants delivered meet the requirements of the contract planting plans and specifications.
If plants are delivered before the site is ready for planting, a location should be chosen to store the plants until time to plant.
This site should be away from construction traffic and protected from direct sun and wind.
Asphalt or concrete areas are not acceptable as storage locations.
Plant root balls should be covered entirely with mulch approximately 3 inches deep.
Plants should be watered as necessary (see watering table) while in this temporary location.
Preliminary Preparation: 1.
The inspector and contractor should jointly review and become familiar with all plan sheets, quantities, details, specifications, and other provisions of the contract.
At this time, questions or interpretations can be answered or problems resolved through discussion with the landscape architect, horticulturist, or other authorized persons.
Sources of materials other than plants required for planting operations should be submitted for approval prior to use in the planting operation.
Some of the materials that may require approval prior to use are topsoil, peat materials, (peats, mosses, humus, and related projected), compost, fertilizer, lime, mulch, stakes, wire and hose, and wrapping material.
The inspector (or approve d other) should check and approve the stakeout of all planting areas and planting pit locations prior to excavation.
Minor relocation of planting areas and pits can be done at this time to avoid utility lines, rock outcrops, drainage ditches, existing plants or impervious or wet soil conditions.
If minor relocations of planting is not possible, the inspector should contact the landscape architect to adjust the design requirements.

3.
Site Preparation: Prior to installing plant stock at the construction site, the following preparation mus t be completed according to the requirement of the contract plans and specifications.
1.
2.
Excavation of planting pits, pockets, or beds to the required size and depth and spaced as shown on the plans.
Onsite preparation of backfill mixture as called for by contract specifications.
Page 9
Planting Operation: Unless in conflict with the contract specifications, the following check list of horticultural practices may be used by the inspector.
This information pertains to new or replacement nursery stock and not to large, mature plants.
1.
Planting should be performed only during the specified planting season (see CMS 661.06).
The inspector should check for proper positioning of the plants.
After plants are set, burlap and any twine should be loosened, laid back and cut away, if bulky, without damaging the ball.
Non bio-degradable materials should not be used in lieu of burlap.
Check for correct depth of the plant crown.
Depth of crown will vary for different soil conditions.
See enclosed LA-1.2M or pages 28 - 31 for details.
Place approved backfill material around plant roots or plant balls, being careful not to damage the ball or the fine root system.
Backfill which is frozen or too wet is not acceptable.
Eliminate air pockets in the backfill by filling, tamping, and watering as required by the specifications.
It is best to water plants thoroughly before backfilling.
Container plants should be moist at the time of planting.
When the above operations have been completed, unless otherwise specified, place a berm of soil around the perimeter of the pit to form a basin or saucer to facilitate watering and retention of moisture.
Mulch all plants to the specified depth with approved material.
The use of mulches prevents rapid temperature fluctuation, reduces moisture loss, and aids in weed control.
process is critical to a project's success or failure.
Because the nature of this work is based upon the end result, i.e. plants live or die, inspectors need to watch the installation cl osely.
If the inspectors have any questions during the installation work, they should contact the project designer or other knowledgeable personnel as soon as possible.

NOTE: Installation can directly affect a plants survival rate.
Concentration on the installation
Page 10
Wrapping, Staking, and Pruning All plants should be wrapped, staked, and pruned as specified.
1.
Drive stakes solidly into the ground and guying installed to prevent movement of the plant until the root system is firmly established in the new planting location.
See LA1.2M or pages 32 - 35 for details.
Wrap trunks or stems of plants from the root crown to the lower limbs with approved material to protect against drying or other physical damage.
Wrapping should not be done prior to planting on deciduous trees.
Plants should be pruned at planting time to restore a balance between the root and top growth.
Tops should be pruned to compensate for the partial loss of roots when the plant was removed from the nursery, and in a manner that will retain the characteristic shape of the plant.
Broken or damaged branches must be removed.
The central leader of a deciduous tree should never be trimmed or removed.
Deciduous trees with competing leaders should not be accepted for the project.
Prune all broken, torn, or damaged roots, leaving a clean cut surface to help prevent rot and disease.
Prune deciduous shrubs if only branches are broken during installation.
Coniferous evergreens normally should not be pruned except for broken branches, unless otherwise specified or directed.
Trees may be pruned before planting to save time and trouble.
At this time, hand clippers can be used to cut closer than can be done with pole pruners - usually used for trees in an upright position.
Pruning may be done under inspector's supervision prior to planting.
The planting operation is completed by watering all plants as specified.
Pruning diagram is enclosed.

Page 14
Hand Watering (662) When watering by hand, attention should be given to the type of device used to apply the water.
If the water is applied at too high a rate, the force of the water will displace mulches, soil and expose roots.
All equipment used to direct water into the watering basin should have a flow-control device that will break the impact of the water so that it will flow gently into the basin.
Water should not be applied to where runoff will occur.
If the plant is newly planted, too much water can erode the watering basin and allow water to escape before it can soak down into the soil.
If this occurs, the basin should be repaired before the next watering.
Water-related Stress Symptoms Symptom Leaves are slightly drooping, soft, hazy-green color.

Planting Period Establishment Inspection Warranty Periods (661.17) Landscape projects normally include a period of establishment.
During this time, all planting on the project shall be under the care of the contractor.
This period begins immediately upon completion of the planting operation for any plant or species group and continues until October 1, but no less than one growing season (i.e. June 1 to October 1).
The stress caused by improper handling may not show its effect immediately.
Plants (particularly large trees) may be under stress for months before showing obvious signs.
By then, it is difficult to relate the damage to the plant installation phase rather than the maintenance it has received.
Again, this points out the need for care early in the installation to make sure that the quality of plants is the highest and the care they receive is the best.
Page 16
Plant Establishment Period - Final Inspection This inspection should include a plan-in-hand review of each planting area or bed to determine the arrangement, number and species of plants called for on the planting plans are present.
If all plants have been properly installed, there should be minimal settlement of the backfill.
Proper mulch depth should also be checked as this will affect plant survival.
Since this inspection is of major importance to the ultimate success if the project, the contractor, inspector and designer should be members of the inspection team.
All plants rejected during the inspection should be removed and replaced by new plants which meet all of the requirements of the project and specifications.
The final acceptance of the project should not have been completed until all plant replacements have been satisfactorily made.

Plant Substitution List Occasionally, landscape contractors may need to make recommended substitutions to the plant material list.
This can occur if the plants are not available locally, there's not enough to meet the project requirements, or the specified size is no longer available.
These substitutions should be preapproved by the designer before the contractor purchases the plants.
Listed below is a chart to keep records on these substitutions.

DEFINITIONS: Amendments - mixed with the soil removed from the plant hole; to improve the soil texture, ph or add organic material; sphagnum peat moss, shredded pine bark, yard waste compost, and sand are all accepted amendments.
Backfill - this soil and amendment mixture is placed back into the hole after the plant has been set (see CMS 611.11) Balled and Burlapped - this is one kind of method for digging field-grown plants with a ball of earth still intact in which they are growing; can be supported by a wire basket and or burlap and laced with baling twine; often denoted as B
Bare Root - plants shipped by this method are done so without the soil from which they were grown; this type of plant can be seedlings, perennials, roses, fruit trees etc.; roots should be white and unbroken.
