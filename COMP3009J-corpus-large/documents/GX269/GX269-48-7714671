Chapter 4 Overall Strategies for Each Water Resource Specific Strategies Chapter 4 consists of four separate strategies, each pertaining to a different water resource.
Strategies include information on Nonpoint Source (NPS) issues specific to that water resource and recommended action steps for protection.
4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 Ground Water Strategy Lakes Strategy Rivers and Streams Strategy Wetlands Strategy
Hydro-modification Hydro-modification is an issue relating to all four strategies of Chapter 4.
In Minnesota, it's estimated that hydro-modification is the second leading source of pollutants causing impairment of fresh waters.
Activities used to assess and moderate impacts from hydromodification are discussed below.
Projects involving channelization, channel modification, dams, streambanks and shoreline erosion are regulated by various local, state and federal programs in Minnesota.
Programs are a combination of both regulatory and nonregulatory approaches to erosion and sediment control and water quality management.
Federal Level The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) are the primary federal agencies involved with water resources protection and regulation in the state of Minnesota.
The USCOE administers the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act (Section 10) and the 1972 Clean Water Act (Section 404) permit programs for projects that affect Minnesota's waters.
USEPA oversees the administration of the Clean Water Act (Section 404) and provides comment and oversight to the USCOE on Section 10 and Section 404 permit applications.
The USFWS also provides review and comment to the USCOE on projects that will affect Minnesota's water resources.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in Minnesota.
Communities that participate in the NFIP must maintain the carrying capacity of altered watercourses to FEMA's satisfaction.
Water Resource Strategies
4 -1
State Level The primary state agencies involved in the protection and regulation of Minnesota's water resources are the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Department of Agriculture (MDA), and Department of Health (MDH).
The DNR administers the Protected Waters Permit Program for activities that will alter the course, current or cross-section of Minnesota's public waters and wetlands, and the Water Appropriation Permit Program for projects appropriating in excess of 10,000 gallons per day or one million gallons per year.
Under the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA), BWSR oversees local government units (LGUs), which regulate wetland areas outside of the DNR's jurisdiction.
Projects conducted under WCA require mitigation to compensate for wetland losses.
Local Level At the local level, Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), under Minn.
Stat. ch. 103C, assist landowners in the implementation of plans to conserve and protect soil and water resources.
SWCDs can provide cost-share assistance to landowners for implementing soil and erosion control best management practices and projects.
Counties (under Minn.
Stat. ch. 394) and municipalities (under Minn.
Stat. 462) have implemented shoreland, floodplain and wetland ordinances, in addition to their own building and zoning codes, to control development and protect the environment.
An integral part of all local zoning regulations is the requirement for erosion and sediment control plans for construction and/or land disturbance activities, especially in shoreland district areas.
The shoreland district, under local zoning authority, is defined as one thousand feet around lakes, and three hundred feet or the one hundred year flood plain, whichever is greater, for streams and rivers.
Under Minn.
Stat. 103F, DNR oversees the adoption of local controls and local zoning decisions within shoreland and floodplain areas.
The authority for drainage and construction of drainage projects is found in Minn.
Stat. ch. 103E.
Communities that have adopted state-approved floodplain management ordinances have provisions in place that maintain the conveyance capacity of altered watercourses as well as the receiving waterbody.
Increased flood discharges and/or velocities will not be allowed that increase damages/losses in upstream, adjacent or downstream areas.
Existing regulatory and nonregulatory programs are tied together by Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs).
Existing MOAs between the USCOE, DNR, MPCA, MDA, MDH and BWSR ensure coordination between state and federal permitting agencies.
New MOAs can be implemented on an as-needed basis in areas that need more coordination.
Most programs administered by LGUs (e.g., shoreland and floodplain zoning, sanitary, septic and water supply, tanks and spills, etc.) have state agency oversight.
Permit applicants for work that would alter the course, current or cross-section of protected waters or wetlands must complete the Combined Joint Notification form.
This application form is accepted by local, state and federal agencies.

Johnson, MPCA Jeff St. Ores, NRCS Nancy Radle, MnDOT Charles Regan, MPCA Brian Rongitsch, MDNR-Waters Dale Setterholm, MGS David Southwick, MGS Jim Stark, USGS Joe Zachman, MDA
Introduction Ground water supplies drinking water to almost 100 percent of the rural population of Minnesota and to 932 of 956 community water supply systems.
Concerns over the impacts that land use and improper waste disposal practices have on ground water quality have resulted in broad-based ground water protection laws in Minnesota.
The importance of potential ground water contamination through nonpoint source (NPS) activities is currently recognized in several Minnesota laws and programs (e.g., the 1989 Minnesota Ground Water Protection Act and the Clean Water Partnership Program).
Monitoring during the past two decades has indicated widespread contamination by improper management of nonpoint sources.
For example, studies conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) and the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) indicate that certain pesticides are present in Minnesota ground water, some in hydrogeologically sensitive areas.
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the MDA concluded from examination of nitrate data from over 25,000 Minnesota wells that nitrate contamination of ground water is clearly a problem in many areas of Minnesota.
Water Resource Strategies
On a statewide basis, potential NPS activity contributing to ground water contamination include: 1) nutrients and pesticides applied to agricultural fields and to turf; 2) feedlots and manure storage/spreading; 3) uncontrolled urban runoff; 4) construction activities; 5) on-site wastewater disposal systems, 6) illegal dumping; 7) road salt; 8) small generators of organic chemicals or metals in waste products; and 9) storm water retention or infiltration ponds.
At the local level, general awareness and understanding of NPS impacts on ground water is increasing through county level water planning efforts, local ground water protection efforts such as the Clean Water Partnership (CWP) program, and by increased education and outreach programs.
The Ground Water strategy presents: 1) A general review of how goals and action steps from the 1994 Nonpoint Source Management Program Plan (NSMPP) were addressed;
4.1 -1
2) The basis for prioritizing NPS activities related to protecting or improving ground water quality; 3) Identification of high priority ground water protection activities needed to manage and minimize NPS pollution and; 4) Direction for coordinating the many agencies and programs associated with NPS ground water issues.
In particular, different levels of government can do a better job of coordinating efforts to 1) prioritize areas needing greater controls over nonpoint sources, and 2) implement nonpoint source control measures.
In order to focus limited resources, further improvements to existing activities such as the CWP program, Wellhead Protection Program, and the Minnesota Nitrogen and Pesticide Management Plans are needed.
These programs can focus on protecting a particular aquifer or recharge area through land use controls and implementation of best management practices (BMPs).
Protection efforts in the state are already underway, and are steadily increasing.
Some of these efforts are described below.
Local Government's Role is Critical Local governments (county, city, etc.) have crucial roles in ground water protection.
This is in part because of their authority to manage land use activity through planning and zoning restrictions, but also because ground water impacts are usually local in scope.
Individuals need to understand how their behavior and activities impact their local ground water resources, and protection programs must continue to be developed at the appropriate local level.
The state has developed a number of programs to encourage local protection efforts, including local water planning (county-based comprehensive surface and ground water management in the 80 Greater Minnesota counties, and county-based ground water management in the 7 Metropolitan Area counties).
These local plans are designed to be comprehensive in scope and most recognize the importance of managing nonpoint sources of contamination.
In order to assist local government and individuals, most state agencies already recognize that state resources and technical expertise must increasingly be available to local government programs.
State assistance needs to be provided in the form of guidelines, technical and financial assistance, and sample regulations to assist local government efforts.
Assistance must also be available through expanded and innovative means to fund local efforts, as well as the state programs that support local efforts.
GENERAL APPROACH TO GROUND WATER ISSUES: CURRENT AND FUTURE While Minnesota recognizes the critical need for adequate protection and management of all ground water resources in the state, it is clear that some regions of the state are more likely to have contamination problems.
Overall, most ground water quality in the state is good at this time, but there are areas where contamination is a problem.
Some of the poor quality ground water is contaminated with naturally occurring substances (e.g., iron, manganese, sulfates, radon, or arsenic), but there are also areas where ground water is contaminated through human activity, or is vulnerable to human-caused sources of contamination.
Many of the human activities that can cause ground water contamination are considered NPS activities.
Protection and Management Approaches There are a number of tools already used to manage ground water protection.
They include the following:
Water Resource Strategies
4.1 -2
Land Use Planning: Land use restrictions are becoming recognized as a major tool for managing some categories of NPS contamination.
Strong front-end land use planning, with environmental consideration included, is being increasingly used.
Zoning and development restrictions, however, need to increasingly include consideration of the degree of environmental risk before decisions are made.
In addition, effective local management tools need to be developed or improved by local governments.
Emphasis on Prevention and Use of a Hierarchy of Strategies: Minnesota recognizes that prevention is the best strategy for ground water quality protection.
It is becoming increasingly clear both locally and nationally that ground water contamination is exceedingly difficult and expensive to correct, and sometimes impossible to accomplish.
Minnesota's ground water prevention policy is articulated in Minn.
Stat. Â§ 103H.001, which states: "It is the goal of the state that ground water be maintained in its natural condition, free from any degradation caused by human activity.
It is recognized that for some human activities this degradation prevention goal cannot be practicably achieved.
However, where prevention is practicable, it is intended that it be achieved.
Where it is not currently practicable, the development of methods and technology that will make prevention practicable is encouraged."
In practical application, this policy means that: 1) All ground water is protected (not just current and future drinking water supplies); 2) The protection goal is to maintain natural quality where possible, and minimize impacts where not; and 3) Additional protective measures may need to be applied in sensitive areas.
There is an increasing use of preventionbased controls for ground water contamination, including reducing or Water Resource Strategies
eliminating potential contaminant releases.
A hierarchy of activities has been developed and needs to be expanded.
The following description and accompanying diagram (Figure 4.1) describe the hierarchy of activities.
In The Absence Of Contamination: In order to protect existing good quality ground water, a variety of prevention and conservation strategies, including BMPs, are being or have been developed.
More will continue to be developed, but it is important that those developed by different parties be consistent, and that all be implemented to the maximum extent possible.
Implementation is likely to remain primarily voluntary.
It is also imperative that local government is particularly diligent in protecting their currently pristine ground water, since many state efforts are currently directed toward preventing further contamination or remediating already impacted resources.
If Contamination Is Detected: The 1989 Minnesota Ground Water Protection Act describes an escalating level of effort, depending on existing conditions, which must be undertaken by state and/or local agencies if contamination is detected (Minn.
Stat. Â§ 103H.275).
In order to prevent further contamination and potentially achieve a return to better quality ground water, a "state agency or political subdivision that regulates an activity causing or potentially causing a contribution to the pollution identified shall promote implementation of BMPs to prevent or minimize the source of pollution to the extent practicable."
These BMPs are designed to be voluntary, so education of the land users is critical.
If Implementation Of The BMPs Is Proven Ineffective: The MPCA (for nonagricultural practices), or the MDA (for agricultural chemicals) may adopt mandatory requirements (called "water resource protection requirements") which are "designed to prevent and minimize the pollution to the extent practicable" and "to 4.1 -3
Figure 4.1
Water Resource Strategies
4.1 -4
prevent the pollution from exceeding the health risk limits."
The health risk limits (also called HRLs) are drinking water based ground water limits promulgated by the MDH for substances found to be degrading Minnesota's ground water (Minn.
Stat. Â§ 103H.201).
A Balance of Regulatory and Nonregulatory Programs: State agencies recognize the need for nonregulatory programs to protect ground water, especially for addressing nonpoint sources of contamination.
Regulatory programs are effective for point sources and some aspects of NPS controls, but many nonpoint sources are too diffuse and/or numerous to be easily regulated.
A balance is needed between regulatory and nonregulatory approaches, including controlling contamination sources through permitting authorities, performance standards, enforcement and compliance activities, landuse regulations, facility siting restrictions, promotion of BMPs, incentives, educational programs, and promotion of water conservation.
Use Of Direct And Indirect Ground Water Protection Measures: Minnesota's NPS ground water protection efforts include formally adopted measures such as facility standards; ground water protection limits; HRLs; Water Resource Protection Requirements; water quality standards, and where public water supplies are potentially affected, federal Maximum Contaminant Levels.
Indirect measures are also needed for their important role in NPS control, and these would include: BMPs, technology standards, conservation, siting criteria and construction standards.
Protection Efforts are Proactive and Long-term: Once water and any contaminants become part of the ground water system, removal of the contaminants can be difficult, if not impossible.
Because of these potentially long-term impacts to Minnesota's ground water resources, protection efforts need to be proactive and farreaching.
They need to be based on long-term costs and benefits, not short-term demands and Water Resource Strategies
crises.
Management needs to anticipate and address problems before widespread degradation occurs.
IDENTIFYING GROUND WATER RESOURCES THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY NPS CONTAMINATION The geologic materials comprising aquifers range from unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits to soluble carbonate rock and fractured bedrock.
The distribution of these aquifers is not uniform across the state.
These diverse geologic settings (along with precipitation gradients across the state and changing soil types and soil depths) influence the quality and quantity of Minnesota's ground water resources.
Identifying Geologically Sensitive Areas - Of particular importance for addressing NPS contamination is knowing where aquifers may be susceptible to contamination from land use practices.
With respect to identifying ground water contamination susceptibility, three significant efforts are under way: 1) development of formal criteria for assessing geologic sensitivity and for mapping nitrate contamination of ground water resources, 2) mapping of geologically sensitive areas, and 3) mapping of areas where ground water used for drinking is being impacted by nitrate nitrogen.
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) prepared criteria for assessing geologic sensitivity that all state agencies must use when addressing ground water contamination (Minn.
Stat. ch. 103H).
MDNR and Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS) staff provides technical assistance to county staff who is assessing the geologic sensitivity of local aquifers.
The MDH convened an interagency advisory group in 1998 to prepare a methodology for mapping nitrate impacts on ground water that used the MDNR sensitivity criteria as a starting point.
MDH staff provides technical assistance to county health and environmental staff to: 1) compile databases of nitrate and water well data, 4.1-5
and 2) prepare maps showing where ground water used for drinking is being impacted by nitrate nitrogen.
This information is available to the general public and MDH is moving ahead to serve it out using an Internet site.
County Geologic Atlases - In 1982, the first county geologic atlas was published by the Minnesota Geological Survey.
A county geologic atlas is a systematic study of a county's geologic and ground water resources.
Data pertinent to resource issues, including management of NPS contamination, are presented at a design scale of 1/100,000.
This level of detail is sufficient to assist with regional planning, but is not sufficient for making site-specific decisions.
However, the databases and geological expertise developed during the completion of an atlas can support local decision making.
Among the atlas plates is a map of the geologic sensitivity that is based on criteria developed by the MDNR.
From 1989 to 1991 representatives from nine agencies developed criteria and guidelines for assessing geologic sensitivity in an effort to encourage a consistent approach to assessing geologic sensitivity in Minnesota.
Geologic sensitivity is based on the potential for surface contamination to reach ground water resources due to the geologic characteristics of the overlying material.
To date, eleven county geologic atlases have been completed, four are nearing completion and a number of other counties are designated as priorities for future completion (see Figure 4.1).
In addition, preliminary sensitivity ratings have been conducted for several counties and have been requested by several other counties.
Completion of county-scale geologic sensitivity maps and their future update is critical for making land and water-use decisions, including targeting of NPS management activities.
Ensuring and accelerating completion is therefore listed below as a priority under Goal 3.
Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment Program - The Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment (RHA) Program complements the Geologic Atlas Program and is implemented through MDNR and MGS.
An HRA is a less detailed, reconnaissance overview of near surface geologic and hydrologic conditions of a multiple county area, and includes a geologic sensitivity map.
HRA mapping has been completed for the Anoka Sand Plain and the extreme southwestern part of the state.
Four other areas are currently being mapped in the western half of the state (see Figure 4.2).
Mapping Nitrate Impacted Ground Water The efforts noted above evaluate ground water sensitivity to contamination by focusing on the inherent characteristics of the aquifer itself and overlying geologic material (e.g., soil permeability, confining layers, etc.).
Mapping of nitrate contamination potential enhances geologic sensitivity mapping by addressing land uses and uses nitrate nitrogen analyses from water wells as a calibration tool.
MDH is preparing nitrate probability maps to address federal mandates to assess the vulnerability of public water supply wells.
These maps can also be used to: 1) evaluate areas where NPS controls for addressing nitrate contamination should be stressed, and 2) identify areas where long-term monitoring of ground water is needed to determine their effectiveness.
MATCHING NPS CONTROLS TO NEEDS AND ASSESSING RESULTS The variability of factors including hydrogeologic conditions, land uses, water use, existing NPS controls for protecting ground water, and the level of education regarding NPS impacts on ground water resources dictates that the approach to implementing and assessing NPS controls must be customized on a local basis.
Although identifying where ground water resources may be susceptible to NPS contamination is a logical first step, several other factors must be considered when determining how to implement protection or remediation efforts.
4.1-6
Water Resource Strategies
Figure 4.2
Water Resource Strategies
4.1-7
Prioritize Resources To Meet State-Wide Needs - It is anticipated that the resources available to implement NPS controls for protecting susceptible ground water resources will not be sufficient to meet local and state needs for 2001 - 2005.
Therefore, criteria need to be developed for funding agencies to prioritize: 1) geographical areas for implementing NPS controls, 2) basic research needed to understand ground water resources and the effectiveness of NPS management measures, 3) education and outreach efforts that effectively communicate with land owners, and 4) data management efforts that will provide needed information in a reliable and cost effective manner.
Developing such criteria is a high priority task that needs to be addressed early in the 2001 Â­ 2005 Needs, Priorities and Milestones Action Steps table.
Evaluate The Effectiveness Of Existing NPS Controls To Meet Local Ground Water Protection Needs Â­ Management practices have been developed that are often broad based and may not be an exact match for local geologic, soils, and land use conditions.
It is very important to determine the technical merits of existing NPS controls so that: 1) resources are not wasted implementing ineffective NPS controls, 2) modifications to existing controls are made to meet local needs, and 3) realistic expectations over specific NPS control measures can be integrated into local and state NPS strategies for protecting ground water resources.
Increase Monitoring To Ensure That NPS Control Measures Are Having A Positive Impact On Protecting Or Remediating Susceptible Ground Water Resources Monitoring the effectiveness of NPS control measures is essential to determining their worth.
For example, the MESA studies conducted by the USGS indicate that BMPs were not effective in controlling nitrate nitrogen loading of ground water to levels below drinking water standards.
It is not a wise use of resources to promote the implementation of NPS controls without Water Resource Strategies
monitoring: 1) the degree to which land owners are implementing them, 2) long-term changes in ground water quality, and 3) the degree to which specific control measures are actually implemented.
Monitoring is often viewed as a luxury but is as critical to ground water resources protection as implementing NPS control measures.
Support Research Needed To Understand The Impacts That NPS Contamination Have On Susceptible Ground Water Resources - It is not possible to adequately protect a resource that you do not understand.
Funding must be made available to collect the basic information needed to understand local ground water resources and the impacts of NPS contamination on ground water quality.
Also, resources must be available to integrate basic research to everyday applications once it's been proven effective.
Develop And Maintain Easily Accessible Data Systems - Many of the basic data management techniques have been developed to store ground water resource data and to track implementation of NPS controls.
However, additional funding is needed to: 1) enter data, 2) make it accessible on the Internet, 3) integrate it with other state and local agency databases, 4) educate agency staff and the public regarding the uses and limitations of specific types of data, and 5) evaluate the cost effectiveness of data collection and storage methods.
Criteria need to be developed to set standards for collecting data related to implementing NPS controls and tracking their effectiveness.
This should receive a high priority and needs to be addressed early in the 2001 - 2005 Needs, Priorities and Milestones Action Steps table.
REVIEWING PROGRESS ACHIEVED FROM 1994 NSMPP A great deal of effort was directed toward addressing NPS impacts on susceptible ground water resources during the past six years.
The number of projects and the cooperation between federal, state, and local 4.1-8
agencies on a wide variety of topical areas indicates the level of interest and dedication to protecting Minnesota's ground water resources (Figure 4.1).
In addition to 319 funds from the federal Clean Water Act, support for these efforts came from local, state, and federal budgets.
More detailed explanation about each effort can be obtained by contacting the lead agencies listed.
NEEDS, PRIORITIES, AND ACTION STEPS FOR 2001 - 2005 The five-year Action Plan provided below summarizes the goals and milestones which have been identified in the preceding sections.
The work group felt that all of the following goals and action steps are needed to address NPS contamination of the state's ground water resources.
Therefore, there is no priority given to the order in which they appear in this report.
Projects being considered for Section 319 funding should be ranked by the number of action steps under this section that are included.
It must be emphasized that many of the milestones listed below, as well as the implementation of specific projects, are contingent upon adequate funding and local involvement.
Although much progress has been achieved, there is still a need to improve inter-agency cooperation and understanding of each other's efforts.
The NPS plan provides a mechanism to help ensure that this occurs and was a significant factor in the progress achieved over the previous six years.
It cannot be overstated that ground water protection efforts are directly tied to NPS activities.
These include the NPS Management Program, the Nitrogen Fertilizer Management Plan, the Pesticide Management Plan, and the CWP program.
All of these programs need to be coordinated with each other, as well as with other more indirectly related programs occurring in the state.
Some of those other efforts include the Comprehensive State Ground Water Protection Program, Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment programs, and basic research programs conducted by MDNR, MGS, and the U.S. Geological Survey.
It is critical that efforts be consistent and coordinated to the extent possible.
In addition to coordination of programs that address different segments of the NPS spectrum, coordination is needed between government and non-government efforts.
Although some coordination already exists, more partnerships must be formed to foster cooperation not only among all levels of government, but also with universities, the nonprofit sector, interest groups, industry, and business.
It is important to recognize the differences between NPS management efforts that are designed to protect surface waters and those which are designed to protect ground water because cross-media contamination needs to be prevented.
Currently, some practices designed to minimize contamination of surface water may increase ground water contamination and vice versa.
This needs to be recognized and prevented.
Provisions need to be in place and implemented across programs to avoid cross-media contamination during management activities.
4.1-9
Goal 1: Continue the Coordination of NPS Activities with Existing and Planned Ground Water Protection Efforts in the State.
There was a great deal of progress achieved over the past six years regarding coordination between federal, state, and local agencies.
New efforts for controlling NPS contamination came on line, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Minnesota Pesticide Management Plan.
Existing efforts such as the Clean Water Partnership (CWP) program and county level water planning expanded their roles to more closely address local NPS impacts on ground water resources.
The Project Coordination Team chaired by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency provided a means to focus interagency cooperation.
Water Resource Strategies
Action Steps 1) Integrate NPS control efforts with basin planning carried out under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act and the State Water Plan.
2) Integrate NPS related ground water protection efforts with county level water planning activities 3) Develop statewide priorities for funding NPS controls that are directed towards protecting or improving the quality of the state's most vulnerable ground water resources.
4) Ensure that NPS efforts to protect vulnerable ground water resources used for drinking water are reflected in wellhead protection plans prepared under the state's wellhead protection rules.
5) Develop technical criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of NPS controls directed towards protecting or improving the quality of the state's ground water resources.
6) Review the adequacy of local, state, and federal legal authorities and capabilities to implement NPS controls related to ground water protection or remediation efforts.
7) Integrate the implementation of NPS controls with federal, state, and local permitting and environmental review efforts.
understand how ground water functions or how easily it can be impacted by their individual activities.
Public education efforts must 1) help citizens understand how their individual behaviors and activities impact their local ground water resources, and 2) provide the information regarding management of those practices and activities which cause contamination.
There is a growing trend to focus educational efforts addressing NPS contamination of ground water resources on individuals.
For example the FANMAP program implemented by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture provides individual analyses of farming practices for landowners.
Nitrate clinics sponsored by counties and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture helps well owners recognize the degree to which local aquifers may be impacted by nitrate contamination.
Children's ground water festivals provide an excellent opportunity for school age children to learn about NPS impacts on ground water and to take this knowledge back to their parents.
Local wellhead protection teams learn from local and state staff about options for managing NPS sources that may impact community water supply wells.
Internet sites such as those of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the USGS provide a wealth of information about ground water resources that the public can easily access.
Although a great deal has been accomplished by a variety of education and outreach efforts over the previous six years, much more can be done.
The following action steps focus on aspects of education and outreach that have not been adequately addressed to date.
Goal 2: Promote Education and Outreach Efforts for Implementing NPS Controls that Protect Ground Water Resources.
Involvement by Minnesota's citizens is vital to effective ground water protection and management efforts.
However, because neither ground water nor the impacts to it can be easily observed, most citizens do not Water Resource Strategies
Action Steps 1) Identify NPS controls and associated educational delivery mechanisms for specific audiences that are most cost effective for protecting or improving ground water quality.
4.1-10
2) Establish education and outreach approaches for specific audiences that are geared toward the NPS control needs identified by basin planning efforts.
3) Develop a statewide bibliography of educational materials and technical expertise that can be used at state and local levels to address NPS related ground water contamination.
4) Require that an evaluation of education and outreach efforts be incorporated into reporting how effective federal and state funding has been in implementing NPS controls.
5) Establish priorities for funding education and outreach efforts for controlling NPS impacts on the state's vulnerable ground water resources.
6) Encourage the participation of the widest possible range in special interest groups in developing approaches to implementing education and outreach efforts related to protecting vulnerable ground water resources.
7) Ensure that adequate delivery systems for disseminating information regarding the effectiveness of NPS controls are made available to local governments and to the general public.
of glacial deposits has steadily increased since 1994 and needs to be incorporated into assessing the effectiveness of best management practices.
The availability of geologic sensitivity maps is an essential element of overall efforts to implement effective NPS controls for protecting the state's ground water resources.
Action Steps 1) Support basic research needed to identify areas where ground water resources are susceptible to NPS contamination.
2) Develop statewide criteria and a formal technical review process at the state level for identifying ground water resources that are susceptible to NPS contamination.
3) Identify priority areas for funding efforts to identify and map ground water resources that are susceptible to NPS contamination.
4) Establish a web site where the public can access information describing susceptible ground water areas.
5) Ensure that existing designations of susceptible areas are updated and refined as new information or techniques for mapping these areas become available.
6) Establish statewide criteria for identifying priority areas within susceptible areas where public health concerns will be most readily addressed through implementation of NPS controls.
Goal 3: Continue Identification of Geologically Sensitive Areas to Help Prioritize Protection Efforts Where Ground Water Resources are Most Susceptible to NPS Contamination.
The state has made substantial progress in mapping geologically sensitive areas since 1994, but many counties do not have sensitivity maps and regional hydrologic assessments that provide the detail for making countywide land and watermanagement decisions.
Also, older county sensitivity maps need to be revised because new subsurface geological information is now available.
Furthermore, knowledge regarding the composition and distribution Water Resource Strategies
Goal 4: Focus Resources on Areas Where Ground Water Protection Efforts Relating to NPS Contamination are Most Worthwhile.
Minnesota must expand prevention-based control of potential sources of ground water contamination, including reducing or 4.1-11
eliminating potential environmental releases that may adversely impact ground water quality and increasing the use of BMPs.
It is also important to recognize that current state law (Minn.
Stat. ch. 103H) emphasizes state action where contamination is already known to occur.
Action Steps 1) Develop criteria for determining the merits of funding requests for implementing NPS controls related to ground water protection.
2) Ensure that state and federal agencies coordinate efforts to review and fund requests to implement NPS controls for protecting or improving ground water quality.
3) Develop criteria for identifying the types of NPS contamination that present the greatest threats to susceptible ground water resources at regional or county levels.
4) Integrate the results of mapping susceptible areas with allocating resources for implementing NPS controls for protecting or improving ground water quality.
For example, the effects that agricultural irrigation on ground water quality has not been adequately determined in all geologic settings, nor has the effectiveness of some best management practices for certain irrigated crops been established.
The interconnection between surface water and ground water in some irrigated areas may result in potential negative impacts of agricultural irrigation being transferred from surface water to ground water and vice-versa.
Action Steps 1) Establish a mechanism for formal identification of NPS contamination sources that are not being adequately addressed.
2) Develop statewide criteria for evaluating whether a potential NPS contamination source or contaminant is not being adequately addressed.
3) Identify the parties responsible for developing NPS control measures or for implementing these measures to adequately address NPS contamination.
4) Integrate improperly addressed NPS contamination into setting statewide priorities for implementing NPS controls.
Goal 5: Identify NPS Contamination Sources that are Not Being Adequately Addressed by Local, State, or Federal Efforts.
Because of the high cost and/or impossibility of ground water cleanup, protection and management needs must be anticipated and problems addressed before widespread degradation occurs.
Efforts need to be developed to control sources of ground water contamination which are not addressed by 1) federal statute or regulations or 2) implementation of management controls such as best management practices.
Goal 6: Promote Hydrologic UnitBased Management where it Provides a Mechanism for Effectively Addressing NPS Contamination of Ground Water Resources.
Because actions at one site can locally affect a large part of an aquifer, aquifers and their recharge areas must be managed and protected as hydrologic units.
Maps depicting several types of hydrologic units have been prepared and need to be assessed for their applicability in implementing NPS controls for protecting ground water resources.
Water Resource Strategies
4.1-12
Action Steps 1) Evaluate various approaches to designating hydrologic units to determine which make the most sense relative to: 1) evaluating NPS impacts on ground water resources, and 2) implementing effective NPS control measures.
2) Ensure that hydrologic unit-based management for controlling NPS impacts on ground water is integrated into basin and county level water planning efforts.
3) Identify hydrologic unit-based management areas that have the highest priority for receiving funding to implement appropriate NPS controls.
Action Steps 1) Recognize and support basin and county level water planning efforts to identify priority areas for implementing NPS controls that coincide with state criteria for defining these areas.
2) Recognize state approved wellhead protection plans that utilize NPS controls for protecting susceptible ground water resources used for drinking water.
3) Promote local implementation of NPS controls in areas where ground water resources are designated susceptible to NPS contamination.
4) Assist local governments with developing databases needed to track the effectiveness of NPS controls for protecting or improving ground water quality.
Goal 7: Assist Local Governments with Developing and Implementing Ground Water Protection Programs.
Participation by local governments is essential to achieving comprehensive implementation of NPS controls for protecting ground water.
For example, as the state Wellhead Protection Program rule is promulgated by the MDH, local governments will need assistance with developing effective local programs.
In addition to needing management tools, jurisdictional issues are likely to be a significant obstacle to public water supply managers who find that they have no authority to control land use around their wells (e.g., municipalities whose wells are located outside of city limits).
Development of source management tools and model ordinances are needed to assist these local efforts, and address multijurisdictional issues.
Many of the contaminant source management tools developed for use in wellhead protection areas can also be used to protect ground water resources elsewhere.
Goal 8: Implement Management Strategies for Controlling NPS Impacts on Ground Water.
The state needs to increase its emphasis and rate of progress on preventing impacts from pesticides and fertilizers, not only those used in agricultural practices but also those applied in residential lawn and gardens.
One of the major tools used to prevent degradation of water quality from pesticide and fertilizer use is the use of BMPs.
BMPs need to be written to protect both surface water and ground water from the impacts of these chemicals.
(Also see Chapters 9 and 10 on Nutrient Management and Agricultural Pesticides.)
Action Steps 1) Ensure timely and impartial review of management strategies to ensure they are effective in minimizing NPS impacts on the state's ground water resources.
Water Resource Strategies
4.1-13
2) Develop effective NPS control measures that reflect the state's diversity in climatic, land use, ground water use, soils, and hydrogeologic conditions.
3) Ensure that state or federal funding reflects state criteria for priority setting and the technical merits of implementing these strategies.
4) Ensure accountability by anyone receiving funding to implement NPS strategies for addressing NPS impacts on ground water resources.
controls for addressing local ground water quality concerns.
4) Identify priority areas for allocating resources to implement NPS controls for protecting the state's ground water resources.
Goal 10: Provide Information Needed to Effectively Implement NPS Controls for Protecting or Remediating Susceptible Ground Water Resources.
Providing the information needed to understand the impacts that NPS contamination has on ground water quality is an important step in obtaining local acceptance for implementing controls.
Also, data must be readily available to demonstrate the long-term benefits of implementing controls for decision-makers to support control efforts.
Several significant trends in managing data have occurred since 1994 that must be recognized.
First, individual computers now provide the storage and retrieval capabilities that large main frame computers had a decade ago.
Second, the Internet provides a mechanism for anyone to access a variety of data sources without the need for a central clearinghouse.
Third, geographic information system software has advanced to the point where the average person can combine spatially oriented data to meet individual needs.
All of these advances in data management need to be considered when developing a strategy for managing data related to managing NPS contamination that may impact ground water.
Goal 9: Define Measurable Objectives for Controlling NPS Impacts on Ground Water and Conduct Adequate Monitoring to Assess Results.
Programs aimed at prevention, control, and remediation of NPS contamination must have measurable objectives in order to monitor program success or failure.
Monitoring needs to include appropriate ground water quality monitoring and, especially in the cases of voluntary management efforts, assessing the degree and extent of implementation of the management tools (i.e., implementation of BMPs).
(Also see Chapter 5, Monitoring and Assessment.)
Monitoring protocols need to ensure the long-term nature of response to BMPs and whether conditions are accounted for when monitoring success or failure of BMPs.
Action Steps 1) Develop statewide criteria for evaluating the impacts of NPS controls related to ground water protection.
2) Develop standards for determining the suitability of NPS controls relating to local hydrogeologic conditions.
3) Establish an interagency advisory group to provide guidance to local groups regarding the most effective NPS Water Resource Strategies
Action Steps 1) Develop criteria for storing and sharing data generated by NPS-related projects funded using public money.
2) Establish a data standards group that reviews funding requests to ensure that data storage and sharing standards will be adequately addressed.
4.1-14
3) Identify existing data management systems and databases that can serve to store ground water data needed to support the implementation of NPS control measures.
New data management systems and databases should be supported only if existing systems and databases are deemed inadequate by the data standards group.
