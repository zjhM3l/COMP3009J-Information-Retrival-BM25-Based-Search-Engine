Appendix 2 GEM Community Involvement Plan Regional Capacity Survey The GEM Regional Capacity Survey for Community Involvement was carried out to support development of a GEM Community Involvement Plan (EVOS Project 030575) by the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies, the Chugach Regional Resources Council, and the Prince William Sound Science Center.
Objectives The objectives of the GEM Community Involvement Survey were to: 1) assess the regional capacity for community involvement in GEM Program activities.
2) identify potential community partners for the GEM program, assess their interest in participating in a spectrum of potential GEM community involvement opportunities and specifically, their interest in and capacity for participation in community- based monitoring and research.
3) identify important community issues and concerns that could be addressed by GEM monitoring and research.
Methods The survey occurred in December 2002 and January and February, 2003 and was conducted by staff members of Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies (CACS), Prince William Sound Science Center (PWSSC), and Chugach Regional Research Commission (CRRC) under the guidance of the GEM Community Involvement Plan Project Team.
1 The Project Team developed a target list of 164 potential GEM organizational partners within the geographic scope of the GEM area.
Organizations that were targeted included: Ã˜ Environmental interest organizations in local communities Ã˜ Regional or national environmental interest organizations with a focus on GEM region Ã˜ Organizations with educational facilities that focus on Gulf of Alaska Ã˜ Tribal governments and organizations Ã˜ City and Borough governments Ã˜ Commercial fishing and aquaculture organizations Ã˜ Research organizations with community involvement projects or programs Ã˜ Natural resource or land - managing agencies with community involvement projects or programs Ã˜ University programs with a focus on community involvement The compiled list was divided into four categories based on the survey methods to be used and the amount of follow- up that was planned after an initial request for response.
The four categories were: Key Respondents, Tribal Respondents, Agency Respondents, and General Respondents.
The Key Respondent list (Addendum A) was selected by the 1
Project Team members: Marilyn Sigman, CACS; Nancy Bird, PWSSC; Mimi Hogan, Paul McCollum, CRRC; He nry Huntington, Joseph Spaeder, Christine Celentano, Pat Norman, Gary Kompkoff
Project Team based on their knowledge of the current programs and/or partnerships and relevance to the GEM Program.
CRRC Project Team members were responsible for the selection of the organizations for the Tribal Respondent list (Addendum B).
The Agency Respondent list (Addend um C) was composed of agencies with community involvement programs.
Organizations on the General Respondent list (Addendum D) were a mix of various organizations ranging from city/borough governments to commercial fishing and aquaculture organizations.
The survey project staff developed the survey questions (Addendum E) under the guidance and review by the Project Team.
The survey was conducted primarily as an online survey but was supplemented by faxed or mailed surveys when email addresses could not be obtained or the respondent identified "hard copy" surveys as the preferred method.
The most common reason for this request was expressed discomfort with being unable to view the entire survey or look ahead for related questions.
CRRC staff determined the appropriate survey method for the Tribal list, supplementing online surveys with faxed or mailed "hard copy" surveys and one - on- one interviews to improve the response rate.
Development and reporting from the online survey was contracted to the SurveyMonkey, a computer services company, after their services had been used successfully by Kachemak Bay Research Reserve staff to conduct a statewide inventory of organizations concerned with coastal management issues.
The Survey Monkey method employed tools that controlled the survey flow with custom skip logic based on responses to specific questions.
The online survey required selecting contact persons in each organization and obtaining email addresses.
A personalized email (Addendum F) was sent to the contac t person in each targeted organization describing the GEM Program briefly (with a link to the EVOS WEB site to obtain further information), the purpose of the survey, the overall GEM Community Involvement Plan Project, and the project partners.
The letter then urged the recipient to take the survey via a web link.
The survey was managed through the SurveyMonkey website.
The results of surveys that were not completed online were entered into the online database by project staff.
A Microsoft Excel database of survey results was created by the online survey service with files that could be easily downloaded for further analysis.
Survey Effort Two reminder email messages were sent to Agency and General respondents if no response occurred following an initial email.
The web link to the online survey was included in the email message.
CACS and PWSSC project staff followed- up with additional email and phone messages to the key respondents to encourage completion of survey.
CRRC staff made follow- up phone calls to tribal respondents who had not responded to email or "hard copy" surveys and assisted respondents with filling out surveys through interviews.
Results Responses were received from 95 of the 164 target organizations.
Six of the respondents identified themselves but either did not fill out the survey or responded that they did not wish to participate in the survey.
Response rates of the remaining 89 organizations, by respondent category, were 82% of the key respondents (44 of 54), 41% for tribal respondents (8 of 15), 39% for general respondents (27 of 64) and 45% for agency respondents (14 of 29).
Three key respondents who did not reply to the survey had previously expressed interest in involvement with the GEM program during an interview conducted by EVOS staff (Shester 2002).
Geographic versus Community Focus In response to questions #2- 4 concerning the organization's geographic or community area of interest, most respondents chose geographic area (75%) for question #2 and many indicated more than one ge ographic area in response to question #3.
Of the 68 respondents that chose geographic area, over half (53%) indicated a statewide interest, while the remainder provided a similar number of responses to the three geographic categories of Gulf of Alaska (35%), Cook Inlet (34%), and Prince William Sound (31%) (See Figure 1).
Twenty- one responded that their focus was on specific communities.

Interests in a Spectrum of GEM Community Involvement Activit ies Interest in becoming involved with the GEM Program was assessed through question #5.
Respondents were asked to choose among ten different involvement categories.
Survey respondents could select one or more of the ten different categories.
Only three of the 95 respondents indicated no interest in participating in the GEM program.
All other respondents checked at least one category and a number checked as many as six.
Throughout the survey process, the online responses indicated a markedly high interest (85- 90%) in the category "Being on a GEM Program Email/mailing List for Announcements of Meetings and Availability of Publication."
The final positive response
rate was 82%.
The second highest category for community involvement interest, at 62%, was "Participating in Community- based Research or Monitoring Activities".
Other community involvement types that more than 50% of the respondents indicated interest in included: "Providing Input to GEM Advisory Committees" (61%), "Participating in Annual Meetings to Learn about the GEM Results" (58%), and "Receiving and Disseminating GEM Synthesized Information" (57%) (See Figure 2).
Close to half of the respondents, 49%, responded with interest in both "Setting GEM Program Priorities and Identifying and Incorporating Specific Community Issues and Concerns."
All categories received expressions of interest with no category receiving fewer than 21 positive responses.

Interests in GEM Community- based Research and Monitoring Activities The 55 organizations that responded that they were interested in Participating in Community- based Research or Monitoring Activities were asked an additional question with 11 options for how they would like their organization to be involved in these activities (See Appendix E for full question and complete responses).
The highest response rate, 88%, was to "Having access to data generated by GEM scientists and community- based research and monitoring".
Many responding organizations (77%) expressed interest in providing "Training and support of citizens (including K- 12 students) in the collection of data and local knowledge ".
Many of the organizations also responded with interest in opportunities to present their findings.
Seventy- three percent of the organizations responded that they are interested in providing their organization's findings to state and/or local governments, while 69% are interested in presenting specifically at local meetings.
The same percentage of respondents (69%) were interested in collecting data as those interested responding with interest in presenting at local meetings (See Figure 3).

Priority Needs and/or Issues of Concern Related to GEM Monitoring and Research The survey also attempted to survey attitudes about important needs and/or issues rela ted to environmental monitoring and research that could be addressed by the GEM Program.
An open- ended question (#7) was included that asked respondents to identify their organizations' top three priority needs and/or issues of concern.
The open- ended ques tions were binned into general categories outlined in Table 1.
In Table 1, the general categories have been bolded along with the total number of times it has been selected.
Beneath the totals are sub - categories and their total number of selections, which were then summed in the category total.
The survey respondents described diverse needs and/or issues of concern.
The largest number of responses (more than 20 each) were binned into the "habitat concern/issue" and "human impact concern/issue" categories.
Nineteen and eighteen responses were binned into the "fisheries" and "fish and wildlife populations" categories, respectively.
Due to the subjective nature of the binning process and the broad nature of the categories relative to the variety of responses, however, the original responses better reflect the array of concerns and issues considered important by the survey respondents.

Number of times Selected
A follow- up open- ended question (#8) asked how needs and issues were determined.
Sixty- four of the 95 survey respondents answered this question.
Responses were also binned.
The majority of organizational respondents said that the needs or issues they stated related directly to their mission statement, requests from Board of Directors, or organizational priorities (38%).
The next highest response, at 23%, was "from experience".
Some respondents stated that the specific needs they identified were a perceived gap in the work of their organizations or in the community (17%).
A near equal number of respondents (16%) said that they determined the needs through disc ussions, meetings or scoping sessions.
Only two of the 64 organizations said that they had determined these needs or issues of concern through a survey.
Involvement of volunteers and youth
Questions #8- 10 requested information on participation by volunteers, paid staff, and youth.
The majority of responding organizations (49 of 82, or 60%) had a combination of paid staff and volunteers, but 6 (7%) were volunteer organizations.
Of 52 organizations with citizen volunteers., 37 (71%) chose the category 1- 25 as the number of active volunteers, 9 (17%) chose the category 26- 50, and 6 (6%) indicated more than 50.
Of the 75 organizations who responded to the question regarding youth involvement in their community involvement programs (#11), 50 (76%) responded that that they did have school classes (K - 12) or youth involved in their programs.
Existing Community- based Research and Monitoring Programs Of the 95 respondents, 78 responded to question #13 that asked whether or not their organization has an existing co mmunity- based research and monitoring program.
Thirtyeight organizations (49%), replied positively (see Table 1).
The responses from the cities of Homer, Soldotna, and Whittier, however, overlapped other responses by mentioning programs within their city limits that had also completed the survey.
Therefore, the total number of existing community- based research and monitoring programs in the GEM region identified by survey respondents is 35.

0 Monitoring and Research Types
The organizations that responded that they have a community involvement program related to research and monitoring were asked a follow- up question (#14) about the which of the four GEM habitat types habitats they monitored.
Watersheds were by far the most common habitat response (76% of responses), followed by the nearshore (50%).
Question #15 asked how organizations involved community members in their monitoring and research programs.
Responses generally fell into 5 categories.
The most common was data collectio n (40%), followed by education (20%).
Interestingly, 12% said meetings and another 12% specified receiving input from community members, which occasionally included input like local and traditional knowledge.
Only 8% of the organizations stated that they involved community through publications.
Conclusions 1.
The online survey method supplemented with other methods to follow up on key and tribal respondents proved a cost- effective survey method for a diverse audience.
The one feature of the survey method that proved to be a barrier for some people was the fact that they had to answer each question sequentially and could not read through the entire survey before completing it or look ahead for related questions.
2.
The survey results demonstrate the substantial c urrent and potential capacity in the region for community involvement in the GEM Program.
A significant number of organizations expressed interest in participating in the GEM Program in a variety of ways.
When presented with a spectrum of opportunities ranging from relatively
passive involvement, such as being on the GEM Program mailing/email list for announcements, to active involvement, such as participating in community- based research and monitoring, 89 survey respondents selected at least one, and many selected six ways they would like their organization to participate in GEM community involvement activities.
3.
Fifty- five organizations stated an interest in participating in community- based research and monitoring.
Thirty- five programs currently exist in the GEM region which could provide potential partnerships and relevant data- sharing.
The higher number of organizations interested in participating in research and monitoring, coupled with responses from 12 organizations that "monitoring" was a need they believed should be addressed by GEM, demonstrates the large potential for these types of community- involvement programs as part of GEM. 4.
The results of the survey provide a framework for development of an interested GEM network based on a foundation of existing programs and partnerships.
In addition, the survey results provide the GEM Program with information on interests, needs and issues of concern during the process of creating and implementing a community involvement plan.
5.
The survey identified habitat and "habitat" and "human impact" as broad common concerns of a number of respondents but did not serve to identify more specific common issues of concern throughout the region.
More work is needed to identify the priority issues of individual communities, local and tribal governments, and organizations.

Addendum F: Email Message Sent to Respondents Hello , My name is Bree Murphy from the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies.
I am contacting you on behalf of the Gulf of Alaska Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) Community Involvement Program.
GEM is a unique, long- term monitoring program supported by an endowment of Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) settlement funds.
Planning is underway to develop a program that will incorporate public involvement, interagency cooperation and collaboration, and accessible, informative data and information on the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem.
We are conducting a survey to evaluate: 1) the interest in specific types of community involvement and 2) the current and potential regional capacity for participation in community- based research and monitoring.
At the suggestion of Marilyn Sigman, Exe cutive Director with the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies, your organization has been listed as a potential partner in this program, because your community is within the GEM area or because your regional, statewide, or national scope encompasses the GEM area.
Please take a few minutes to complete the linked survey, before January 17th 2003, so that we can assess your organization's interest in participating in the GEM community involvement program, http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=99938152148.
If you would like to learn more about GEM, please browse the website at http://www.oilspill.state.ak.us/gem/.
If you cannot or wish not to participate in our online survey, I can send you the survey as a hard copy in the mail, or FAX it to you.
If you would like the survey in an alternative form, please reply by indicating which version you would like and sending pertinent mailing information.
Feel free to contact me for any questions about the GEM community involvement program or our survey.
Thank you for your participation.
Bree Murphy
