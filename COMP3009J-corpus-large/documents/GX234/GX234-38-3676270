What do I do if I believe I am the victim of Identity Theft?
You should first contact your local law enforcement and your credit bureau to notify them that you believe you are the victim of identity crime.
Our Office is concerned with helping all Virginians avoid becoming victims of identity theft.
You may request the booklet " How To Avoid Identity Theft - A Guide for Victims of Identity Theft" which serves as a guide for victims, as well as providing information to safeguard against identity theft.
If you are disputing fraudulent debts and accounts opened by an identity thief, the Identity Theft Affidavit now simplifies the process.
Instead of completing different forms, you can use the Identity Theft Affidavit to alert companies where a new account was opened in your name.
The company can then investigate the fraud and decide the outcome of your claim.
The Identity Theft Affidavit is found at the back of this booklet.
You may print a copy of this booklet or request a hard copy by e-mailing us at cybercrime@oag.state.va.us.
You may also be interested in more information about Attorney General Kilgore's Taskforce on Identity Theft - Attorney General Kilgore's Taskforce on Identity Theft or in the law passed by the 2003 Virginia General Assembly: The Identity Theft Protection Act.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also is actively involved in fighting identity theft.
Visit the U.S. Government central web site (maintained by the FTC) for more information about identity theft.

What is the Attorney General's Identity Theft Passport?
An Identity Theft Passport is available to any Virginian who: * Has filed a police report because they believe they are a victim of identity crime; and/or * Has obtained a court order expunging their record as a result of identity crime.
If you have filed a police report because you are a victim of an identity crime or you have obtained an expungement order, you may apply for an Identity Theft Passport from the Office of the Attorney General.
The Office of the Attorney General will record the fact that you have filed a police report or obtained an expungement order and will issue you an Identity Theft Passport stating that.
The Office of the Attorney General will also keep a record of your application for an Identity Theft Passport and your information on file.
The Identity Theft Passport is designed to serve as a shield to protect victims from unlawful detention or the arrest for crimes committed by someone else under a stolen identity.
