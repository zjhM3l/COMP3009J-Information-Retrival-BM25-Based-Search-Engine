August 1, 1997
FY 1997 Mass Media Regulatory Fees The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in FY 1997.
If you are a licensee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review this Public Notice.
WHO MUST PAY REGULATORY FEES IN FY 1997 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in FY 1997.
This Public Notice concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM 
Noncommercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations, remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly owned non-commercial educational stations.
Emergency alert system (EAS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees.
Governments and nonprofit entities (exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code) are not required to pay regulatory fees and should not submit payment.
However, the Commission is currently considering a proposal which would require that each exempt entity submit, or have on file with the Commission, a current IRS Determination Letter documenting its nonprofit status, a certification of governmental authority, or certification from a governmental authority attesting to its exempt status.
If the Commission decides to adopt the proposal under consideration, the place and date for submission of the required documentation will be announced by a separate Public Notice.
In the event that there has been a change in ownership of a system after the effective date, but before the date payment is due, responsibility for payment of the regulatory fees rests with the owner of record on the effective date noted below.
A regulatee will be relieved of its fee payment requirement if its total fee due, including all categories of fees for which payment is due by the entity, amounts to less than $10.
WHY THE COMMISSION MUST COLLECT REGULATORY FEES The requirement to collect annual regulatory fees is contained in Public Law 103-66, "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993."
These regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, are used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public information, international and policy and rulemaking activities.
These fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission.
WHEN FEES WILL BE DUE Fee payments must be received by the Commission during the period beginning September 15, 1997, and ending September 19, 1997, in order to avoid a 25% late payment penalty.
FCC FORM 159 Regulatory fee payments must be accompanied by FCC FORM 159 ("FCC Remittance Advice").
This form has been revised and you must use the version dated July 1997.
A copy of this form, with specific instructions, is attached to this Public Notice and may be used to submit fees.

Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.

You are strongly urged to submit your payments on time and accurately in order to avoid a penalty.
Additionally, the Commission will invoke any lawful authority it may possess under the Debt Collection Act to collect any fees due or outstanding against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.
WAIVERS, REDUCTIONS AND DEFERMENTS OF REGULATORY FEES The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary and compelling circumstances only , upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory costs.
Timely submission 4
of the appropriate regulatory fee must accompany requests for waivers or reductions.
This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied.
The regulatory fee will be refunded later if the request is granted.
Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver or reduction request.
All requests for deferments must be received before September 19, 1997 , in order to avoid the 25% late-payment penalty.
