James Dodd, _ Appraiser Analyst Sanford: Re: Civil Air Patrol This is in response to your letter to Richard Ochsner dated De
The facts are as follows: The Ventura County Assessor has for many years levied a possessory interest assessment against the Civil Air Patrol.for an aircraft " tie down," This year the Civil Air Patrol has protested the assessment on the ground that it is an instrumentality of the United States pursuant to 10 U.S.C. section 9441(c) and that its property is therefore immune from taxation.
As you know, property owned by federal instrumentalities is immune from taxation by the states unless Congress has consented to taxation (Ehrman and Flavin.
Taxinq California Property (2d ed. 1979); sections 513, pp.-112, 113.)
5.2, An be a federal instrumentality fcr Erie organization may, however, purpose but not a federal instrumentality for other purposes.
For example, In Lewis v. United States 680 F.2d 1230 (9th Cir. 19821, the United States Court of Appeals acknotiledged that Federal Reserve Banks are deemed to be federal instrumentalities for purposes of immunity from state taxation but held they are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act.
section 10 U.S.C. " [tlhe Secretary 9441(c) may use cited by taxpayer provides that the services of the Civil Air Patrol Hon. R. J. Sanford L -2- April 22, 1987 in fulfilling the noncombat mission of the Department of the and for purposes of determining the civil liability Air Force, of the Civil Air Patrol (or any member thereof) with respect to any act or omission committed by the Civil Air Patrol (or any member thereof) in fulfilling such mission, the Civil Air Patrol shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the United States."
The foregoing statutory provision as amended in 1980 makes it clear that the Civil Air Patrol is a federal instrumentality for purposes of tort liability but it does not answer the question of b;hethrr the Civil Air Patrol is a federal instrumentality for purposes of immunity from local taxation.
The Civil Air Patrol was created by an Act of Congress July 1, 1946 and declared to be a body corporate, with perpetuai and various powers including the power to sue and be succession to acquire and hold property: to accept gifts, legacies sued; to establish and maintain offices for the conduct and devises: of the affairs of the corporation in the District of Columbia and in the several States and Territories of the United States; and to do all acts and things necessary and proper to carry into effect the objects and purposes of the corporation (36 U.S.C.A. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 201, 205).
The objects and purposes of the corporation are to provide an organization to encourage and aid American citizens in the contribution of their efforts, services and resources in the development of aviation and in the maintenance of air to encourage and develop by example the voluntary supremacy; contribution of private citizens to the public welfare; to provide aviation education and training; to encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities and to provide an organization of private citizens with adequate facilities to assist in meeting local and national emergencies (36 U.S.C.A.

section 9441 beginning in Congress later amended 10 U.S.C.A. 1980 to further provide that the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize the payment of aircraft maintenance expenses relating to various Civil Air Patrol missions, expenses of placing into serviceable condition major items of equipment furnished to the Air Patrol by the Air Force, reimburse the Civil Air' Civil Patrol for costs incurred for the purchase of such major items of equipment necessary for the Civil Air Patrol to carry out and to furnish articles of the Air Force uniform its missions: to Civil Air Patrol cadets without cost to such cadets.
Congress enacted 10 U.S.C.A. section.
9442 to provide In 1984, that the Secretary of the Air Force may arrange for the use by the Civil Air Patrol of such facilities and services under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or the head of any other department or agency of the United States as the Secretary of the Air Force considers to be needed by the Civil Air, Patrol to carry out its mission subject to necessary government approvals.
230 F.2d 243 (10th Cir. 19561, the States, In Pearl v. United court considered those of the foregoing provisions which were then in effect and held that because Congress' control over the Civil Air Patrol was limited and the corporation was not designated as a wholly owned or mixed ownership government corporation under former 31 U.S.C. sections 846 and 856, the independent entity and thus corporation was a nongovernmental, under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Hon. R. J.

The court in Lewis in holding Federal Reserve aanks not to be federal instrumentalities for purposes of the Federal Tort noted that the Civil Air Patrol is, a nonprofit, Claims Act, federa.lly chartered corporation organized to serve the public welfare and closely resembled the status of the Federal Reserve Banks which it acknowledged are deemed to be federal instrumentalities for purposes of immunity from state taxation.
In Department of Employment v. United States (1966) 385 U.S. 355, the United States Supreme Court held that the American Red Cross is clearly an instrumentality of the United States for purposes of immunity from state taxation levied on its There are many similarities between the Red Cross operations.
