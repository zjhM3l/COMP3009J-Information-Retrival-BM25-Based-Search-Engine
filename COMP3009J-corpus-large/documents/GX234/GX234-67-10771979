virginiAVIATION nov/dec 2003 VIRGINIA AVIATION j Page Published by THe Virginia Department of Aviation Nov/Dec 2003 Centennial Celebration of Flight: The Wright Way Wind, sand, and the dream of flight brought Wilbur and Orville Wright to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where they achieved the first successful airplane flights on December 17, 1903.
With courage and perseverance these self taught engineers relied on teamwork and the application of scientific process.
What they achieved changed the world forever! They had seemingly settled into respectability as proprietors of a small business.
But the Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio nurtured a barely respectable dream; the possibility of flight.
Wilbur, four years older, quiet and intense, a dreamer who could lose himself in books.
Orville was outgoing, talkative, and an immaculate dresser.
Both combined intuitive mechanical ability with analytical intelligence.
In 1892 they opened a bicycle shop and prospered, but they were restless, especially Wilbur.
Their energies were focused by two events of 1896; the death in a flying accident of Otto Lilienthal, the celebrated experimenter with gliders, and the successful launching of powered models by Samuel Langley.
The Wright's serious work in aeronautics began in 1899 when Wilbur wrote the Smithsonian for literature.
Dismayed that so many great minds had made so little progress, the brothers were also exhilarated by the realization that they had as much chance as anyone of succeeding.
Wilbur took the lead in the early stages of their work, but Orville was soon drawn in as an equal collaborator.
They quickly developed their own theories, and for the next four years devoted themselves to the goal of human flight.
glider mostly as a kite, working the control surfaces from the ground.
Wilbur's time aloft in free flight totaled only 10 seconds.
They went home somewhat discouraged, but convinced they had achieved lateral and longitudinal control.
1899 The Wrights knew that the solutions to lift and propulsion needed only refining, but no one had achieved lateral control.
Rejecting the principle of inherent stability -- the conventional wisdom - they wanted control to depend on the pilot.
Wilbur hit upon the idea of warping the wings - sparked by his observation of birds and the idle twisting of a box - to rotate the wings and stabilize flight.
They tested wing-warping the forerunner of ailerons - on a 5-foot biplane kite.
1901 This was the year the Wrights sharpened their focus.Trying to overcome the lift problem, they increased the camber of the 1901 glider.
They also lengthened its wingspan to 22 feet, making it the largest glider anyone had attempted to fly.
But, at their new Kill Devil Hills camp, lift was still only a third of that predicted by the Lilienthal data upon which the wing design was based.
And the glider pitched wildly, climbing into stalls.
When they returned to the earlier camber, they achieved longitudinal control and eventually glided 335 feet.
But the machine was still unpredictable.
When the pilot raised the (see Centennial cont. on Pg. 2)
1900 Confident their design was sound, the Wrights built a 17-foot glider with an unusual forward elevator.
They went to Kitty Hawk hoping to gain flying experience, but the wings generated less lift than expected, and they flew the

The engine drove two pusher propellers with chains, one crossed to make the props rotate in opposite directions to counteract a twisting tendency in flight.
A balky engine and broken propeller shaft slowed them, until they were finally ready on December 14.
Wilbur won the coin toss, but lost his chance to be the first to fly when he oversteered with the elevator after leaving the launching rail.
The flyer, climbed too steeply, stalled, and dove into the sand.
The first flight would have to wait on repairs.

left wing to initiate the expected right turn, the machine instead tended to slip to the left (adverse yaw).
This failure, and the realization that their work had relied on false data, brought them to the point of quitting.
Instead they built a wind tunnel and produced their own data.

1902 The 1902 machine embodies the Wrights' research.
They gave it efficient 32-foot wings and added vertical tails to counteract adverse yaw.
The pilot moved a hip cradle to warp the wings.
Some 400 glides proved the design workable, but still flawed.
Sometimes, when the pilot tried to raise the lowered wing to come out of a turn, the machine instead slid sideways toward the wing and spun into the ground.
Orville suggested a movable tail to counteract this tendency.
After Wilbur thought to link the tail movement to the warping mechanism, the plane could be turned and stabilized smoothly.
If others had thought about steering at all, it was by rudder - a marine analogy unworkable in the air.
The Wrights saw that control and stability were related, that a plane turned by rolling.
Six hundred more glides that year satisfied them that they had the first working airplane.
December 17, 1903
Three days later, they were ready for the second attempt.
The 27-mph wind was harder than they would have liked, since their predicted cruising speed was only 30-35 mph.
The headwind would slow their groundspeed to a crawl, but they proceeded anyway.
With a sheet they signaled the volunteers from the nearby lifesaving station that they were about to try again.
Now it was Orville's turn.
Remembering Wilbur's experience, he positioned himself and tested the controls.
The stick that moved the horizontal elevator controlled climb and descent.
The cradle that he swung with his hips warped with wings and swung the vertical tails, which in combination 1903 turned the machine.

The Wright machine had flown.
But it would not fly again, after the last flight it was caught by a gust of wind, rolled over, and damaged beyond easy repair.
With their flying season over, the Wrights sent their father a matter-of-fact telegram reporting the modest numbers behind their epochal achievement.

Danville Regional chosen for SATS demonstration in 2005 Members of NASA and the National Consortium for Aviation Mobility (NCAM) recently announced Danville Regional Airport will be the site of the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) project demonstration in 2005.
The plan is to develop four to eight passenger jets that would service suburban and rural communities at low rates, thereby relieving problems associated with highway gridlock and airport delays.
The jets under development will be fuel efficient and carry a relatively low $850,000 price tag.
The aircraft, which would be flown by a single pilot, will take off and land from short runways at small airports.
The end result is to eventually build aircraft that will be simple enough for the average person to own and operate.
Virginia Tech, Old Dominion University, Ohio University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will join Averett University as research partners in the Virginia SATS Lab.
There also are SATS labs located in North Carolina, Maryland and Michigan with other states taking interest in the concept.
For more information on SATS please visit www.sats.nasa.gov.

NASA installs `Centennial of Flight' exhibit at Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport To commemorate the 100th anniversary of powered flight, NASA Langley Research Center has created an exhibit for the CharlottesvilleAlbemarle Airport that clearly defines the impact of the Wright Brother's first flight in 1903 on aviation.
tory and the science of flight.
The exhibit will also include a continuously running documentary of the Wright Brother's historical quest, courtesy of the Discovery Channel entitled, "The Wright Stuff".
The `Centennial of Flight' exhibit features five unique showcases, each depicting a significant era of time that shaped the aviation industry.
Two other features of this exhibit include the "Future of Flight" display and the "Women of NASA" panel exhibit.
The "Future of Flight" panel exhibit is being seen for the first time at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport.
It is a brand new addition to NASA's traveling exhibitions.
The exhibit pays homage to the past, present programs and accomplishments, and highlights research developments that will drastically change the future of aerospace.
Women's contributions to the aviation industry are highlighted in the "Women of NASA" panel exhibit.
Although women have flown since 1908, nearly all of them were restricted to general aviation, i.e., private planes, or support jobs.
By 1958, women had already made their mark, not just in support roles, but as pioneering engineers, mathematicians, scientists, and technicians.
The "Women of NASA" panel exhibit is a celebration of their contributions to the aviation industry.
The "Centennial of Flight" exhibition will be on display at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport from now until the end of January 2004.
From the Wright Flyer to the Space Shuttle, visitors to the CharlottesvilleAlbemarle Airport will explore the his-
18th Annual Aviation Career Day held at Richmond International Airport The 18th Annual Aviation Career Day was held recently at Richmond Jet Center at Richmond International Airport, drawing high school students from across the region including the city of Richmond and the counties of Charles City, Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, and New Kent.
The event has been organized annually over the last 18 years by the Sandston, Henrico East, and New Kent Rotary Clubs.
Attending students were exposed to aviation career opportunities ranging from commercial passenger and cargo airlines and military aviation, to law enforcement and college-level aviation programs.
Students toured facilities at RIC, visited static displays of aircraft such as an F16 and a Blackhawk helicopter, and had the opportunity to hear speakers including Dr. William J. Bosher, Jr., Distinguished Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Education and Center for Public Policy.
Exhibitors included Averett College, the Aviation Institute of Maintenance, Delta Airline Consultants, Dominion Aviation Services, Ethyl Aviation, Falwell Aviation Services, the FAA's Richmond Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), the Florida Institute of Technology, Helo Air, Henrico County Police Department, Martinair, Million Air Richmond, the National Weather Service, Petersburg Radio Control A/C, Richmond International Airport (Human Resources Dept.), Sundance Aviation, the Virginia Air National Guard, the Virginia Army National Guard, and the Virginia Department of Aviation.
