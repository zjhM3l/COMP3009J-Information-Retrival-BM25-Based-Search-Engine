Unit 3 The Future Lunar Land Use Life Support Systems Lunar Biosphere The activities in this unit spark interest in responsible land use and sustainable human settlements on the Moon.
Each activity uses and reinforces all the knowledge the students have been gaining about the Moon and Earth from Units 1 and 2.
These activities require teamwork, research, and development of model systems.
The maps produced by Clementine and Lunar Prospector will be useful for planning other types of missions, such as automated sample returns, robotic rovers, or human exploration.
The chemical data allow sensible choices of landing sites to be made to optimize the scientific or industrial return from future missions.

Life Support Systems Purpose To design and build models of life support systems for a settlement on the Moon.
Background
[also see "Teacher's Guide" Pages 14, 15]
A future lunar base will have to be a self-contained habitat with all the life support systems necessary for the survival of people, animals, and plants.
In this series of activities, the students will be designing and building models of nine life support systems which are crucial to our successful settlement of the Moon.
The nine life support systems are: "Air Supply," "Communications," "Electricity," "Food production and delivery," "Recreation," "Temperature control," "Transportation," "Waste management," and "Water supply."
This activity is based on the Marsville activity on life support systems developed by the Challenger Center and is used with permission.
Preparation Review and prepare materials listed on the student sheets.
Separate student activity sheets are included for each of the nine life support systems.
Spaces for answers are not provided on all sheets, so students will need extra paper.
In Class After dividing students into teams, you may want to have each person assume a role on the team, e.g., organizer, recorder, researcher, builder, artist, writer, etc.
Distribute a student activity sheet to each team.

Life Support Systems Each team must define the requirements of their system, exploring how these requirements are currently being met on Earth.
Team members will research the limitations and/or opportunities posed by the Moon's environment.
The "Moon ABCs Fact Sheet" and maps of the Moon should be used as resource materials.
Each team will decide how the system will operate and what it will contain.
A key part of the problem-solving process is the students' ability to evaluate the system solution in terms of whether it provides the greatest good and least harm to the persons and things affected.
Each model of a life support system must incorporate at least four facts from the "Moon ABCs Fact Sheet."
Models do not have to function physically, but each team member must be able to explain how the models should function.
Wrap-up Have each team share what they have learned with the entire class.
1.
Did the students find that the Moon's environment placed limits on their designs of life support systems? 2.
Did the students find opportunities for development on the Moon that could not happen on Earth? 3.
Summarize the aspects and conditions of the Moon which make life support such a challenge.

2 .
With your class, make a list of the foods and liquids everyone consumed in the past 24 hours.
Organize your list in the following way: Put each food group in a different column; then cross out all the items you consider "junk food" and cross out each item made from an animal which must eat another animal to live.
3.
We know that, with the exception of carnivores, animals eat plants.
But what do green plants "eat" in addition to carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water? Include in your answer a discussion of the nitrogen cycle.
4 .
It is likely that space in the Moonbase will be limited.
Protein sources like cattle and vegetable sources like corn require substantial space for production.
Reviewing your list from Question 2, what are other sources of protein which take less space? What fruits and vegetables could be produced in limited space?

Waste Management Purpose To design and build a model waste management system for a human settlement on the Moon.
Key Words recycling biodegradable materials nondegradable self-sustaining
Procedure 1.
Your school, in many ways, is like a miniature town.
It has a system for governance, health care, traffic control, a work schedule for its inhabitants, recreation, AND waste disposal.
To get a better idea of how much waste your school generates every week, find out how many students plus teachers, administrators, other staff (and animals, if any) are regularly in the buildings.
2.
Next, interview the cafeteria staff and the custodial staff for the answers to these questions: (a) What gets thrown away? (b) How many pounds get thrown away every week? Calculate how many pounds of trash this is for every person in the school.
(c) Are there any items which can be recycled before disposal? If yes, what are the recycled items? (d) What items are biodegradable? (e) What is the garbage/trash packed in for removal? (f) Where is it taken? (g) According to building codes, how many toilets must there be to accommodate all the people? 3.
Waste is a "hot" topic in our society.
Why? Discuss what you know about the following phrases: Excessive packaging, landfills, toxic waste, disposable plastic goods, nondegradable material, water pollution, and air pollution.

Waste Management 4.
In movies like those starring "Indiana Jones," well preserved, ancient artifacts are often found in the desert.
Scientists also find preserved artifacts in polar ice; for example, mastodons or ancient people.
Why aren't they decayed? 5.
Review the "Moon ABCs Fact Sheet."
The Moonbase must be an enclosed, self-sustaining settlement.
Just like your school, it must perform the basic functions of a town.
Other teams are responsible for designing and constructing several other types of systems (air supply, communications, electricity, food production and delivery, recreation, temperature control, transportation, and water supply).
Your team's job is to dispose of the waste which could be generated by these systems.
Design a waste disposal system for the Moonbase.
Be sure to decide what importance, if any, will be given to biodegradable materials, recycling, and the Moon outside of the constructed settlement.

It holds and sustains all life known to humanity.
As men and women look to traveling and living beyond our blue planet, we see conditions that are too harsh to sustain life as we know it.
Conditions on the Moon are not favorable for sustaining life because of the absence of water, organic topsoil, and atmosphere.
Also lunar days (equal to 14 Earth days) and nights are very long.
Water must be brought from Earth or made using oxygen from lunar regolith and hydrogen from Earth.
Nutrients need to be added to lunar regolith and plants have to be grown in a self-enclosed system.
What's more, artificial light must be used during the long, dark periods.
This activity challenges students to create a working model of a lunar biosphere that is a balanced, self-enclosed living system able to run efficiently over a long period of time.
Preparation Review and prepare materials listed on the student sheet.
Here are some suggestions.
Seedlings: About two weeks prior to this activity, sprout the seedlings for use in the biospheres.
Successful biospheres have been made using mung, radish, and peanut.
Tomato seedlings can also be used, as well as ferns, vines, and simple garden weeds.
Soil materials: Collect bins or bags to hold the variety of soil materials: vermiculite, permiculite, cinder, gravel, sand, silt, clay, and fertilizer.
Animals: Students should collect live critters to live in the biospheres.
These can include -- insects (ants, cockroaches, beetles, etc.), mollusks (snails, slugs, etc.), arachnids (spiders, etc.), and crustaceans (sow bugs).
Plastic bottles for biospheres: Use 2-liter soda bottles with the black base.
Remove the black base by submerging it in a large pot of hot (but not boiling) water.
This softens the glue holding the base onto the bottle without melting the plastic.
Take off the label.
With an exacto knife or razor, cut off the top spout of the bottle.
For safety, it is best not to allow students to do the cutting.
You may place the spout with your other plastic recyclables as it will not be used in this activity.
Prepare one container per student.

Lunar Biosphere The students will plug the holes in the black base with wax, tape, or clay.
The base must be watertight.
They will then fill the base with a predetermined soil mixture.
They will add water, seedlings, and animals as decided by the team.
Finally, they will invert the plastic container into the base, seal it with clear, plastic tape, and label it.
The label should include the student's name, names of team members, date, and time the biosphere was sealed.
In Class After discussing the background information and purpose of this activity, divide the class into cooperative teams of 4 students each.
Biosphere mobiles Have each team create a hanging mobile with the theme "Biosphere."
Each hanging component represents one part of the living Earth system, e.g., water, plants, animals, people, air, Sun, soil, etc.
After mobiles have been balanced and hung from the ceiling, have the students predict what would happen if one part were removed or just shifted.
Ask the students to shift or remove one part.
Does the biosphere remain balanced? Ask the students to try to rebalance and hang their mobiles.
Have them relate what they see to what might happen if a part of any biosphere is changed or removed.
Materials cardboard or heavy-weight paper markers or crayons string something to use as the frame -- wooden chopsticks, other kinds of sticks, plastic drinking straws, hangers, etc.

Lunar Biosphere Making Biospheres After discussing the importance of a balanced biosphere, you may choose to have the students number themselves from 1 to 4 for a role assignment within each team: 1 = Botanist - person who studies plants, 2 = Agronomist - person who studies soils and crops, 3 = Science Specialist - person who relates conditions of soil and water to optimal plant growth, 4 = Zoologist - person who studies animals.
Distribute the "Team Member Information Sheets."
Students are responsible for reading and sharing the data contained on their own sheets.
Have them log their shared information on their worksheet -- as outlined in Question 3 on page 133.
Before the actual construction, each team must decide the following for their lunar biospheres: 1.
best lunar soil mixture for example, vermiculite, permiculite, cinder, sand, gravel, fertilizer, etc. 2.
amounts of each type of soil material for example: 10 Tablespoons of sand 10 Tablespoons of silt 10 teaspoons of vermiculite 1/2 teaspoon of fertilizer 3.
optimal lighting for example: direct sunlight, shade, artificial lamp, etc. 4.
optimal amount of water to add to the biosphere before sealing it for example: 5 Tablespoons of water 5.
kinds and amounts of seedlings and animals to include inside for example: mung, radish, peanut seedlings -- use just one type or a combination.
If these are not available, then other seedlings can easily be used.
Other examples include ferns, vines, and garden weeds.
Have students explain why they made their choices.
Students can also do preliminary research on their organisms.
Note: Each lunar biosphere must include plants and animals.

Teacher Page
Lunar Biosphere After teams have discussed and decided these five points, then each student will make his/her own biosphere.
The biospheres must be completely sealed with clear, plastic tape.
No air or other materials can go in or out.
Once the biosphere is sealed, it cannot be opened again.
Each lunar biosphere should be labeled with the student's name, names of team members, date, and time it was sealed.
Put this label on the black base.
After the biospheres are built, they should be set under the lighting conditions chosen by the teams.
A "Data Sheet" and an "Observation Sheet" are provided for student use.
Wrap-up Are some lunar biospheres doing better than others? What are some of the factors leading to the success or failure of the biospheres? Based on this experience of making a model lunar biosphere, what is your opinion on the potential success of actual self-contained habitats on the Moon?

Team Member Information Sheet for Botanist Mung bean, Phaseolus aureus origin: India, central Asia
The mung bean, a bushy annual which grows 76 - 90 meters tall, has many branches with hairy bean-like leaves.
Flowers are yellowish-green with purple streaks and produce long, thin, hairy pods containing 9 - 15 small yellow seeds.
Seeds are used to produce bean sprouts.
Radish, Raphanus sativus origin: temperate Asia
The radish produces white, red, or black roots and stems under a rosette of lobed leaves.
It is an annual or biennial plant, which grows several inches high.
Radishes should be planted 1 cm deep, and will sprout in 3 - 7 days.
When planted together with other root crops, radishes can be used to decoy pests, and the spaces left in the soil when they are pulled out provide growing room for the other root crops, which grow more slowly.
Peanut, Arachis hypogaea origin: South America
The peanut, an annual vegetable which belongs to the pea family, grows from 15 - 76 cm tall.
Flowers are small yellow clusters that grow on stems called pegs.
Pegs grow downward and push into the soil.
Nuts develop from these pegs 2.54 - 7.6 cm underground.

Soil has four functions: 1) 2) 3) 4) supply water to plants, supply nutrients (lunar regolith, however, needs to have nutrients added to it), supply gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), and support plants.
The ideal soil holds moisture and nutrients while letting excess water drain to make room for air.
Types of soil: clay sand silt loam small particles, less than 1/256 mm, which pack closely.
Poor drainage.
irregular particles between 1/16 mm and 2 mm.
Holds very little water.
between clay and sand-size particles.
Not very fertile, packs hard.
a mixture of clay, silt, and sand.
The best kind of soil.

Growing Conditions Mung bean - grows best in full sun, in a rich, well-drained soil.
It shouldn't be allowed to dry out completely.
Radish - is a cool season crop, and can take temperatures below freezing.
It can tolerate partial shade.
Soil should be well-drained.
If water supply gets low, then radishes become woody. - needs lots of Sun and warmth.
It is relatively tolerant of dry soil.
These seeds are very sensitive to fertilizer.
Peanut
Soil
- can be improved by the addition of fertilizers, which provide nutrients to the plant.
This makes the plant healthier, and better able to resist disease and pest attacks.
Vermiculite and perlite are "puffed up" minerals that are used to lighten heavy clay soils with air spaces, or to help sandy soils hold more water.
They do not directly provide nutrition to the plants.

NASA Resources for Educators NASA's Central Operation of Resources for Educators (CORE) was established for the national and international distribution of NASA-produced educational materials in audiovisual format.
Educators can obtain a catalogue and an order form by one of the following methods: Â· NASA CORE Lorain County Joint Vocational School 15181 Route 58 South Oberlin, OH 44074 Â· Phone (440) 774-1051, Ext. 249 or 293 Â· Fax (440) 774-2144 Â· E-mail nasaco@leeca.esu.k12.oh.us Â· Home Page: http://spacelink.nasa.gov/CORE
Regional Educator Resource Centers (RERCs) offer more educators access to NASA educational materials.
NASA has formed partnerships with universities, museums, and other educational institutions to serve as RERCs in many states.
A complete list of RERCs is available through CORE, or electronically via NASA Spacelink at http://spacelink.nasa.gov NASA On-line Resources for Educators provide current educational information and instructional resource materials to teachers, faculty, and students.
A wide range of information is available, including science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education lesson plans, historical information related to the aeronautics and space program, current status reports on NASA projects, news releases, information on NASA educational programs, useful software and graphics files.
Educators and students can also use NASA resources as learning tools to explore the Internet, accessing information about educational grants, interacting with other schools which are already on-line, and participating in on-line interactive projects, communicating with NASA scientists, engineers, and other team members to experience the excitement of real NASA projects.
Access these resources through the NASA Education Home Page: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/education
Educator Resource Center Network To make additional information available to the education community, the NASA Education Division has created the NASA Educator Resource Center (ERC) network.
ERCs contain a wealth of information for educators: publications, reference books, slide sets, audio cassettes, videotapes, telelecture programs, computer programs, lesson plans, and teacher guides with activities.
Educators may preview, copy, or receive NASA materials at these sites.
Because each NASA Field Center has its own areas of expertise, no two ERCs are exactly alike.
