As a Texan, I want our communities to be safer.
As your Attorney General, I am taking action.
I have formed and launched a new Fugitive Unit, with a focus on child sexual predators.
Our initial mission is to locate, arrest and send back to prison convicted predators who have violated the conditions of their parole.
Just weeks into the program we're already making neighborhoods safer.
In recent weeks, my investigators with the Fugitive Unit have arrested 14 of these child sex offenders wanted for parole violations.
Each of these men had convictions for sex crimes against children.
One such felon was arrested while watching children play on a busy playgound.
The Attorney General's Office is not targeting offenders who comply with the terms of their parole and abide by the law.
In order to be a target of the Fugitive Unit, a person must be a child sex offender who has violated the terms of his or her parole.
The recent arrests continue a long string of apprehensions of child predators by the Attorney General's Office.
Our Cyber Crimes Unit, formerly the Internet Bureau, was already in existence before the formation of the Fugitives Unit.
My investigators in that unit target child predators who hunt for victims in Internet chat rooms.
So far, the Cyber Crimes Unit has successfully facilitated the arrest and indictment of fifteen men.
Each of the men used chat rooms to solicit sex with individuals whom they believed to be underage girls or boys.
Unknowingly, the men were actually setting up meetings with Attorney General investigators.
They were arrested when they showed up to meet the "children" in person.
One of the more recent arrests occurred in Bastrop County on September 5.
Donald Lee Westbrook III, an employee at Selectron, an Austin high-tech company, was arrested at a restaurant along Texas Highway 71 as he arrived to meet a 13-year-old "girl" he had met in an Internet chat room.
The Bastrop County Sheriff's Office assisted in this arrest.
Westbrook has since been indicted.
Our record of success in arresting these individuals shows that the problem exists on a scale some parents may not realize.
In fact, we may just be scratching the surface.
That is why the Attorney General's office will continue to work side by side with local law enforcement officials and with parents to safeguard our children.
We are confident that the number of these arrests made by the Fugitives Unit and Cyber Crimes Unit will continue to grow.
We are very pleased that our efforts to date have been successful, but we will not rest on our laurels in our quest to remove child predators from chat rooms and neighborhoods.
We must all remain vigilant and united in the protection of our children.

Texas Adopts New Anti-Spam Laws
By Greg Abbott Attorney General of Texas
Electronic mail has made personal and commercial correspondence expedient and convenient.
Unfortunately, e-mail has also made it easy for businesses and individuals to inundate consumers with unwanted advertisements and solicitations.
That is why the 78th Texas Legislature passed a new anti-spam law to protect Texas consumers and precisely why I plan to enforce it.
The new law does not make unsolicited e-mail advertisements illegal.
However, effective September 1, 2003, it does provide penalties for failing to meet certain requirements.
Texas law now bans people from sending e-mails that contain false, deceptive or misleading information in the subject line, or from falsifying the e-mail address.
E-mail advertisers must also include a working e-mail address so that consumers can ask to be removed from the advertising list.
If you make such a request, the advertiser must remove your e-mail address within three days.
Normally we recommend that you do not use the remove feature.
When you respond this way you are indicating that your e-mail address is an active one.
Instead of getting less spam, you are likely to get even more.
In the past, spammers have also been known to use this feature to commit a certain kind of identity theft.
Spammers can actually use your valid e-mail address as the apparent source of their advertisements.
With the new law in place, you may want to consider using the remove feature for e-mails received from reputable companies and not using it for e-mails where the sender is not identifiable.
You should use your best judgment when exercising this option.
Unsolicited e-mail advertisements must also include the letters "ADV" in the subject line.
If the message contains pornographic material, "ADV: Adult Advertisement" must be included in the subject line.
Spammers who break the law by sending obscene materials without a label face being charged with a Class B misdemeanor and may spend up to 180 days in a county jail and be fined up to $2,000.
Unsolicited obscene e-mails are a great nuisance to parents everywhere.
While the new law is a step in the right direction, we are not out of the woods yet.
It is believed that much of the pornographic e-mail is produced in Eastern Europe and Russia.
Ideally, the new law should be followed by all businesses and individuals that send unsolicited e-mail to and from Texas.
Realistically, only reputable, law-abiding businesses and people will follow the law.
The newly enacted legislation may not deter illegal spam from other states or countries where spam laws may not exist or where enforcement is a low priority.
Nigerian Fraud (also known as advance fee fraud) and foreign lottery scams are prime examples of spam that will probably not be slowed by anti-spam legislation.
These solicitations are based out of foreign countries, which makes enforcement and prosecution extremely difficult.
Our office continues to urge consumers NOT to send money to e-mailers who claim that you have won a large prize and not to provide your personal identifying information (i.e. credit and Social Security card numbers).
These spammers, mainly from Canada and Europe, have robbed thousands of Texans.
Cooperation among states and countries is crucial to curtailing illegal spam.
While spam laws will be challenging to enforce, rest assured that our office is firmly committed to protecting Texas consumers.
We will work to find the most effective, reasonable method of enforcement.

Parental Involvement Means More Than Just Paying Child Support
By Greg Abbott Attorney General of Texas
When parents are involved in their lives, children have a better chance at growing up healthy, happy and well adjusted.
Most parents instinctively understand this and do what is needed to provide the foundation for success.
However, sometimes a healthy reminder, doesn't hurt.
President Bush recently set aside "Family Day" for the nation to engage in activities "to strengthen the relationships between parents and children."
In issuing his proclamation, the President noted that parents play a central role in steering their children toward healthy behaviors and clear of harmful ones.
Simple activities such as sharing a meal or going to a ball game together provide ideal opportunities for this kind of interaction.
While the September 22 observance has passed, parents really can choose any day ideally, all days as their own Family Day.
As the one charged with ensuring that Texas children receive the financial support they need from parents, I see every day the need for fathers and mothers to be involved in their kids' lives.
This starts with regular child support payments.
Children depend on child support to provide basic needs like food, shelter, health care, and clothing.
Research shows that children who receive regular child support reap intangible benefits as well, such as making better grades in school, being more likely to finish high school and attend college, and even having fewer behavior problems at school.
Without a doubt, paying child support is one critical way parents can demonstrate their love for their children.
But money is only part of the equation.
Too often, children would benefit from more, not less, involvement from the parent who pays their child support.
My office is working across Texas to encourage parental involvement through such programs as the Parenting and Paternity Awareness Program (P.A.P.A.), which teaches middle and high school students about responsible parenting and the skills needed to build strong, stable families.
We are partnering with teachers and other groups in many communities to bring P.A.P.A. to students in area school districts.
President Bush noted that children from two-parent families have increased chances for success in life because they are less likely to end up in poverty, become addicted to drugs, suffer abuse, or have a child out of wedlock.
I agree with his assessment, and so does social research.
In some instances where the safety of mothers and their children is in danger, marriage may not be suitable.
But where appropriate, programs produced by my office -- such as P.A.P.A. -- extol the benefits of getting married before becoming parents.
Parental involvement can thrive the most where both parents are present.
I am thankful that most parents faithfully carry out their responsibilities to their children, doing such things as paying court-ordered child support each month.
All children deserve the security that comes from knowing their parents care enough to make regular child support payments.
For those parents who need extra encouragement, I have several enforcement measures at my disposal that can remind them of their duty to pay.
My hope, however, is that more parents will truly understand just how necessary they are to the success of their children.
I look forward to the day when we won't have to have a Family Day to remind us of that.

CHILD SUPPORT EVADER: JERRY DALE KEEFER
[keefer.jpg] Owes: $31,280 Last Address: San Marcos, TX Occupation: Laborer Born: 05/13/66 Height: 5' 6" Weight: 170 Color of Eyes: Brown Color of Hair: Brown Race: Caucasian
Attorney General Greg Abbott needs your help to find Child Support Evader Jerry Dale Keefer, one of the Most Wanted Child Support Evaders in Texas.
Keefer owes more than $31,000 in past-due child support for the care of his three children, who live with their mother in Kyle.
Keefer was added to the Attorney General's Top Ten List in October 2002.
He has gone underground to elude officials and willfully avoid arrest on his Attorney General child support case.
In October 1996, a Hays County judge found Keefer $2,000 behind in child support, and ordered the delinquent father to pay $368 a month to cover current support and the arrearage that he owed.
Keefer, who did not follow the judge's order, was sentenced to jail in December 1999, and ordered to participate in a work release program.
Keefer refused to cooperate and was released from jail after serving a maximum sentence of 180 days.
Keefer failed to appear at a subsequent hearing to address his failure to pay child support, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
Due to missed payments and interest that accrues on unpaid child support, Keefer now owes $31,280 in unpaid child support.
Evader Keefer may be hiding in San Marcos, and is most likely working for cash to avoid garnishment of wages to pay child support.
Based on tips from concerned citizens, we believe Keefer has shaved his head and moustache to avoid detection.
He may be driving a gray Chevy pickup truck with Arizona license plates.
Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Jerry Dale Keefer is encouraged to contact the Attorney General's Office at 1-866-EVADERS (382-3377).
Child Support Evaders on the Top Ten list are being singled out because they have the ability to take responsibility for their children, but refuse to do so.
Incarceration is the only option for parents who flagrantly ignore a court's order to pay child support.
The Attorney General's Office helps parents who lack the ability to pay child support by referring them to job training and employment services.
Visit the agency's Web site www.oag.state.tx.us to find out about other Child Support Evaders, and to obtain information about the Attorney General's Child Support Division.
