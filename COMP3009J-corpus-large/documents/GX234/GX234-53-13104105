Feast Early Human Habitation
People first reached Florida at least 12,000 years ago.
The rich variety of environments in prehistoric Florida supported a large number of plants and animals.
The animal population included most mammals that we know today.
In addition, many other large mammals that are now extinct (such as the saber-tooth tiger, mastodon, giant armadillo, and camel) roamed the land.
The Florida coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico was very different 12,000 years ago.
The sea level was much lower than it is today.
As a result, the Florida peninsula was more than twice as large as it is now.
The people who inhabited Florida at that time were hunters and gatherers, who only rarely sought big game for food.
Modern researchers think that their diet consisted of small animals, plants, nuts, and shellfish.
These first Floridians settled in areas where a steady water supply, good stone resources for tool making, and firewood were available.
Over the centuries, these native people developed complex cultures.
During the period prior to contact with Europeans, native societies of the peninsula developed cultivated agriculture, traded with other groups in what is now the southeastern United States, and increased their social organization, reflected in large temple mounds and village complexes.
Ponce de Leon European Exploration and Colonization
Written records about life in Florida began with the arrival of the Spanish explorer and adventurer Juan Ponce de LeÃ¯Â¿Â½n in 1513.
Sometime between April 2 and April 8, Ponce de LeÃ¯Â¿Â½n waded ashore on the northeast coast of Florida, possibly near present-day St. Augustine.
He called the area la Florida, in honor of Pascua florida ("feast of the flowers"), Spains Eastertime celebration.
Other Europeans may have reached Florida earlier, but no firm evidence of such achievement has been found.
On another voyage in 1521, Ponce de LeÃ¯Â¿Â½n landed on the southwestern coast of the peninsula, accompanied by two-hundred people, fifty horses, and numerous beasts of burden.
His colonization attempt quickly failed because of attacks by native people.
However, Ponce de LeÃ¯Â¿Â½ns activities served to identify Florida as a desirable place for explorers, missionaries, and treasure seekers.
In 1539 Hernando de Soto began another expedition in search of gold and silver, which took him on a long trek through Florida and what is now the southeastern United States.
For four years, de Sotos expedition wandered, in hopes of finding the fabled wealth of the Indian people.
De Soto and his soldiers camped for five months in the area now known as Tallahassee.
De Soto died near the Mississippi River in 1542.
Survivors of his expedition eventually reached Mexico.
No great treasure troves awaited the Spanish conquistadores who explored Florida.
However, their stories helped inform Europeans about Florida and its relationship to Cuba, Mexico, and Central and South America, from which Spain regularly shipped gold, silver, and other products.
Groups of heavily-laden Spanish vessels, called plate fleets, usually sailed up the Gulf Stream through the straits that parallel Floridas Keys.
Aware of this route, pirates preyed on the fleets.
Hurricanes created additional hazards, sometimes wrecking the ships on the reefs and shoals along Floridas eastern coast.
In 1559 TristÃ¯Â¿Â½n de Luna y Arellano led another attempt by Europeans to colonize Florida.
He established a settlement at Pensacola Bay, but a series of misfortunes caused his efforts to be abandoned after two years.
Spain was not the only European nation that found Florida attractive.
In 1562 the French protestant Jean Ribault explored the area.
Two years later, fellow Frenchman RenÃ¯Â¿Â½ Goulaine de LaudonniÃ¯Â¿Â½re established Fort Caroline at the mouth of the St. Johns River, near present-day Jacksonville.

First Spanish Period These French adventurers prompted Spain to accelerate her plans for colonization.
Pedro MenÃ¯Â¿Â½ndez de AvilÃ¯Â¿Â½s hastened across the Atlantic, his sights set on removing the French and creating a Spanish settlement.
MenÃ¯Â¿Â½ndez arrived in 1565 at a place he called San AugustÃ¯Â¿Â½n (St. Augustine) and established the first permanent European settlement in what is now the United States.
He accomplished his goal of expelling the French, attacking and killing all settlers except for non-combatants and Frenchmen who professed belief in the Roman Catholic faith.
MenÃ¯Â¿Â½ndez captured Fort Caroline and renamed it San Mateo.

French response came two years later, when Dominique de Gourgues recaptured San Mateo and made the Spanish soldiers stationed there pay with their lives.
However, this incident did not halt the Spanish advance.
Their pattern of constructing forts and Roman Catholic missions continued.
Spanish missions established among native people soon extended across north Florida and as far north along the Atlantic coast as the area that we now call South Carolina.
Spanish Mission The English, also eager to exploit the wealth of the Americas, increasingly came into conflict with Spains expanding empire.
In 1586 the English captain Sir Francis Drake looted and burned the tiny village of St. Augustine.
However, Spanish control of Florida was not diminished.
In fact, as late as 1600, Spains power over what is now the southeastern United States was unquestioned.
When English settlers came to America, they established their first colonies well to the Northat Jamestown (in the present state of Virginia) in 1607 and Plymouth (in the present state of Massachusetts) in 1620.
English colonists wanted to take advantage of the continents natural resources and gradually pushed the borders of Spanish power southward into present-day southern Georgia.
At the same time, French explorers were moving down the Mississippi River valley and eastward along the Gulf Coast.
The English colonists in the Carolina colonies were particularly hostile toward Spain.
Led by Colonel James Moore, the Carolinians and their Creek Indian allies attacked Spanish Florida in 1702 and destroyed the town of St. Augustine.
However, they could not capture the fort, named Castillo de San Marcos.
Two years later, they destroyed the Spanish missions between Tallahassee and St. Augustine, killing many native people and enslaving many others.
The French continued to harass Spanish Floridas western border and captured Pensacola in 1719, twenty-one years after the town had been established.
Spains adversaries moved even closer when England founded Georgia in 1733, its southernmost continental colony.
Georgians attacked Florida in 1740, assaulting the Castillo de San Marcos at St. Augustine for almost a month.
While the attack was not successful, it did point out the growing weakness of Spanish Florida.
British Florida
Britain gained control of Florida in 1763 in exchange for Havana, Cuba, which the British had captured from Spain during the Seven Years War (175663).
Spain evacuated Florida after the exchange, leaving the province virtually empty.
At that time, St. Augustine was still a garrison community with fewer than five hundred houses, and Pensacola also was a small military town.
The British had ambitious plans for Florida.
First, it was split into two parts: East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine; and West Florida, with its seat at Pensacola.
British surveyors mapped much of the landscape and coastline and tried to develop relations with a group of Indian people who were moving into the area from the North.
The British called these people of Creek Indian descent Seminolies, or Seminoles.
Britain attempted to attract white settlers by offering land on which to settle and help for those who produced products for export.
Given enough time, this plan might have converted Florida into a flourishing colony, but British rule lasted only twenty years.
The two Floridas remained loyal to Great Britain throughout the War for American Independence (177683).
However, Spainparticipating indirectly in the war as an ally of Francecaptured Pensacola from the British in 1781.
In 1784 it regained control of the rest of Florida as part of the peace treaty that ended the American Revolution.
Battle of Pensacola
Second Spanish Period
When the British evacuated Florida, Spanish colonists as well as settlers from the newly formed United States came pouring in.
Many of the new residents were lured by favorable Spanish terms for acquiring property, called land grants.
Others who came were escaped slaves, trying to reach a place where their U.S. masters had no authority and effectively could not reach them.
Instead of becoming more Spanish, the two Floridas increasingly became more "American."
Finally, after several official and unofficial U.S. military expeditions into the territory, Spain formally ceded Florida to the United States in 1821, according to terms of the Adams-OnÃ¯Â¿Â½s Treaty.
Andrew Jackson On one of those military operations, in 1818, General Andrew Jackson made a foray into Florida.
Jacksons battles with Floridas Indian people later would be called the First Seminole War
.
Territorial Period
Andrew Jackson returned to Florida in 1821 to establish a new territorial government on behalf of the United States.
What the U.S. inherited was a wilderness sparsely dotted with settlements of native Indian people, African Americans, and Spaniards.
As a territory of the United States, Florida was particularly attractive to people from the older Southern plantation areas of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, who arrived in considerable numbers.
After territorial status was granted, the two Floridas were merged into one entity with a new capital city in Tallahassee.
Established in 1824, Tallahassee was chosen because it was halfway between the existing governmental centers of St. Augustine and Pensacola.
As Floridas population increased through immigration, so did pressure on the federal government to remove the Indian people from their lands.
The Indian population was made up of several groupsprimarily, the Creek and the Miccosukee people; and many African American refugees lived with the Indians.
Indian removal was popular with white settlers because the native people occupied lands that white people wanted and because their communities often provided a sanctuary for runaway slaves from northern states.
Osceola Among Floridas native population, the name of Osceola has remained familiar after more than a century and a half.
Osceola was a Seminole war leader who refused to leave his homeland in Florida.
Seminoles, already noted for their fighting abilities, won the respect of U.S. soldiers for their bravery, fortitude, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances during the Second Seminole War (183542).
This war, the most significant of the three conflicts between Indian people and U.S. troops in Florida, began over the question of whether Seminoles should be moved westward across the Mississippi River into what is now Oklahoma.
Under President Andrew Jackson, the U.S. government spent $20 million and the lives of many U.S. soldiers, Indian people, and U.S. citizens to force the removal of the Seminoles.
In the end, the outcome was not as the federal government had planned.
Some Indians migrated "voluntarily."
Some were captured and sent west under military guard; and others escaped into the Everglades, where they made a life for themselves away from contact with whites
.
Today, reservations occupied by Floridas Indian people exist at Immokalee, Hollywood, Brighton (near the city of Okeechobee), and along the Big Cypress Swamp.
In addition to the Seminole people, Florida also has a separate Miccosukee tribe.
By 1840 white Floridians were concentrating on developing the territory and gaining statehood.
The population had reached 54,477 people, with African American slaves making up almost one-half of the population.
Steamboat navigation was well established on the Apalachicola and St. Johns Rivers, and railroads were planned.
Street Scene
Florida now was divided informally into three areas: East Florida, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Suwannee River; Middle Florida, between the Suwannee and the Apalachicola Rivers; and West Florida, from the Apalachicola to the Perdido River.
The southern area of the territory (south of present-day Gainesville) was sparsely settled by whites.
The territorys economy was based on agriculture.
Plantations were concentrated in Middle Florida, and their owners established the political tone for all of Florida until after the Civil War.
Seal Statehood
Florida became the twenty-seventh state in the United States on March 3, 1845.
William D. Moseley was elected the new states first governor, and David Levy Yulee, one of Floridas leading proponents for statehood, became a U.S. Senator.
By 1850 the population had grown to 87,445, including about 39,000 African American slaves and 1,000 free blacks.
The slavery issue began to dominate the affairs of the new state.
Most Florida voterswho were white males, ages twenty-one years or olderdid not oppose slavery.
However, they were concerned about the growing feeling against it in the North, and during the 1850s they viewed the new anti-slavery Republican party with suspicion.
In the 1860 presidential election, no Floridians voted for Abraham Lincoln, although this Illinois Republican won at the national level.
Shortly after his election, a special convention drew up an ordinance that allowed Florida to secede from the Union on January 10, 1861.
Within several weeks, Florida joined other southern states to form the Confederate States of America.
Civil War and Reconstruction
During the Civil War, Florida was not ravaged as several other southern states were.
Indeed, no decisive battles were fought on Florida soil.
While Union forces occupied many coastal towns and forts, the interior of the state remained in Confederate hands.
Troops
Florida provided an estimated 15,000 troops and significant amounts of supplies including salt, beef, pork, and cottonto the Confederacy, but more than 2,000 Floridians, both African American and white, joined the Union army.
Confederate and foreign merchant ships slipped through the Union navy blockade along the coast, bringing in needed supplies from overseas ports.
Tallahassee was the only southern capital east of the Mississippi River to avoid capture during the war, spared by southern victories at Olustee (1864) and Natural Bridge (1865).
Ultimately, the South was defeated, and federal troops occupied Tallahassee on May 10, 1865.
Before the Civil War, Florida had been well on its way to becoming another of the southern cotton states.
Afterward, the lives of many residents changed.
The ports of Jacksonville and Pensacola again flourished due to the demand for lumber and forest products to rebuild the nations cities.
Those who had been slaves were declared free.
Plantation owners tried to regain prewar levels of production by hiring former slaves to raise and pick cotton.
However, such programs did not work well, and much of the land came under cultivation by tenant farmers and sharecroppers, both African American and white.
Beginning in 1868, the federal government instituted a congressional program of "reconstruction" in Florida and the other southern states.
During this period, Republican officeholders tried to enact sweeping changes, many of which were aimed at improving conditions for African Americans.
At the time of the 1876 presidential election, federal troops still occupied Florida.
The states Republican government and recently enfranchised African American voters helped to put Rutherford B. Hayes in the White House.
However, Democrats gained control of enough state offices to end the years of Republican rule and prompt the removal of federal troops the following year.
A series of political battles in the state left African Americans with little voice in their government.
Train Florida Development
During the final quarter of the nineteenth century, large-scale commercial agriculture in Florida, especially cattle-raising, grew in importance.
Industries such as cigar manufacturing took root in the immigrant communities of the state.
Potential investors became interested in enterprises that extracted resources from the water and land.
These extractive operations were as widely diverse as sponge harvesting in Tarpon Springs and phosphate mining in the southwestern part of the state.
The Florida citrus industry grew rapidly, despite occasional freezes and economic setbacks.
The development of industries throughout the state prompted the construction of roads and railroads on a large scale.
Beginning in the 1870s, residents from northern states visited Florida as tourists to enjoy the states natural beauty and mild climate.
Steamboat tours on Floridas winding rivers were a popular attraction for these visitors.
The growth of Floridas transportation industry had its origins in 1855, when the state legislature passed the Internal Improvement Act.
Like legislation passed by several other states and the federal government, Floridas act offered cheap or free public land to investors, particularly those interested in transportation.
The act, and other legislation like it, had its greatest effect in the years between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of World War I.
During this period, many railroads were constructed throughout the state by companies owned by Henry Flagler and Henry B. Plant, who also built lavish hotels near their railroad lines.
The Internal Improvement Act stimulated the initial efforts to drain the southern portion of the state in order to convert it to farmland.
These development projects had far-reaching effects on the agricultural, manufacturing, and extractive industries of late-nineteenth-century Florida.
The citrus industry especially benefitted, since it was now possible to pick oranges in south Florida; put them on a train heading north; and eat them in Baltimore, Philadelphia, or New York in less than a week.
In 1898 national attention focused on Florida, as the Spanish-American War began.
The port city of Tampa served as the primary staging area for U.S. troops bound for the war in Cuba.
Many Floridians supported the Cuban peoples desire to be free of Spanish colonial rule.
By the turn of the century, Floridas population and per capita wealth were increasing rapidly; the potential of the "Sunshine State" appeared endless.
By the end of World War I, land developers had descended on this virtual gold mine.
With more Americans owning automobiles, it became commonplace to vacation in Florida.
Many visitors stayed on, and exotic projects sprang up in southern Florida.
Some people moved onto land made from drained swamps.
Others bought canal-crossed tracts through what had been dry land.
The real estate developments quickly attracted buyers, and land in Florida was sold and resold.
Profits and prices for many developers reached inflated levels.
The Great Depression in Florida
Floridas economic bubble burst in 1926, when money and credit ran out, and banks and investors abruptly stopped trusting the "paper" millionaires.
Severe hurricanes swept through the state in the 1926 and 1928, further damaging Floridas economy.
Seabreeze
By the time the Great Depression began in the rest of the nation in 1929, Floridians had already become accustomed to economic hardship.
In 1929 the Mediterranean fruit fly invaded the state, and the citrus industry suffered.
A quarantine was established, and troops set up roadblocks and checkpoints to search vehicles for any contraband citrus fruit.
Floridas citrus production was cut by about sixty percent.
State government began to represent a larger proportion of its citizens.
Female citizens won the right to vote in 1920, when the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution became law.
In 1937, the requirement that voters pay a "poll tax" was repealed, allowing poor African American and white Floridians to have a greater voice in government.
In 1944 the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed a system of all-white primary elections that had limited the right of African Americans to vote.
World War II and the Post-war "Boom"
World War II spurred economic development in Florida.
Because of its year-round mild climate, the state became a major training center for soldiers, sailors, and aviators of the United States and its allies.
Highway and airport construction accelerated so that, by wars end, Florida had an up-to-date transportation network ready for use by residents and the visitors who seemed to arrive in an endless stream.
World War II Training Camp, Miami
One of the most significant trends of the postwar era has been steady population growth, resulting from large migrations to the state from within the U.S. and from countries throughout the western hemisphere, notably Cuba and Haiti.
Florida is now the fourth most populous state in the nation.
The people who make up Floridas diverse population have worked to make the Sunshine State a place where all citizens have equal rights under the law.
Since the 1950s, Floridas public education system and public places have undergone great changes.
African American citizens, joined by Governor LeRoy Collins and other white supporters, fought to end racial discrimination in schools and other institutions.
Since World War II, Floridas economy also has become more diverse.
Tourism, cattle, citrus, and phosphate have been joined by a host of new industries that have greatly expanded the numbers of jobs available to residents.
Electronics, plastics, construction, real estate, and international banking are among the states more recently-developed industries.
shuttle Several major U.S. corporations have moved their headquarters to Florida.
An interstate highway system exists throughout the state, and Florida is home to major international airports.
The university and community college system has expanded rapidly, and high-technology industries have grown steadily.
The U.S. space programwith its historic launches from Cape Canaveral, lunar landings, and the development of the space shuttle programhas brought much media attention to the state.
The citrus industry continues to prosper, despite occasional winter freezes, and tourism also remains important, bolstered by large capital investments.
Florida attractions, such as the large theme parks in the Orlando area, bring millions of visitors to the state from across the U.S. and around the world
Today, Floridians study their states long history to learn more about the lives of the men and women who shaped their exciting past.
By learning about our rich and varied heritage, we can draw lessons to help create a better Florida for all of its citizens.
