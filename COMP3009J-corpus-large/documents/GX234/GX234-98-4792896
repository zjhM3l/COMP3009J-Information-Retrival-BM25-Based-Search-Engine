49 52 53 54 55 56 56 57 57 ii Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Overall Executive Summary National City, California is a San Diego County municipality located 10 miles north of the international border with Mexico.
The National City Public Library serves 56,4001 residents living in eight square miles, who face challenges including the County's lowest median income2 and among its highest crime rates and housing density; 36% illiteracy, low rate of high school completion (57.2%), and low educational attainment (only 9% hold a baccalaureate degree); and a significant percentage (70.2%)3 of non- or limited English speaking residents.
With 65% renters and 35% homeowners, National City's transient population is the exact inverse of U.S. housing tenure overall.
Nevertheless, the vibrant multiethnic, multi-lingual community exhibits great pride in its historic City incorporated in 1887, deep respect for the power of education as a source of personal empowerment, and a desire to improve the City's ability to retain young adults as lifelong residents.
Eighty percent (80%) of National City residents are non-white.
A microcosm of America's future demographics, the ethnic distribution is 60% Latino (compared to 26% countywide), 20% Asian, 14% white, and 6% African American.
According to projections, Latinos will comprise 76% of San Diego County youth ages 0-17 by 2010.
National City's median age is young at 28.7; while the median age of the City's Latinos and blacks is even younger, at 23 and 24, respectively.
With birthrates high among Latinos and declining among blacks, the Latino youth population here is sure to continue dramatically higher than county, State or national averages well into the future.
Sadly, Latino and African American high school students are less likely than whites to graduate,4 and Latinos and African Americans are less likely to have home Internet access than whites,5 linked to low academic achievement.
National City Public Library (NCPL) often serves as an extension of family homes, playing an enormous role in its users' ability to improve their economic, academic, and personal life standing.
The library is known throughout the City as a safe, positive place for families and young people who have few other healthy options for recreation and personal development.
Serving the City from one main facility, the Library has steadily developed modern technology services, literacy programs, and children's programs in direct response to community need.
Many residents are lifelong library customers who now bring their grandchildren.
NCPL's reach extends beyond its physical walls through many partnerships; most substantially through a 20-year service partnership with National School District (NSD) at NSD's 10 elementary schools that today includes, as examples, a shared electronic catalog, video reference services, and after school literacy services.
The library's inadequate overall size and condition severely and increasingly constrain these positive and crucial library services.
Historically NCPL staff have created more from less and stretched dollars thinner than imaginable.
At 22,444 square feet, the facility is far too small to fully accommodate the community's current and encroaching needs for meeting space, computer use, and expanded collections.
The City will soon be unable to sustain the current high quality of library services, leading to the loss of one of its most important and cost-effective resources for individual and municipal enrichment.
The City of National City has taken action to mitigate this threat, culminating in this application to construct a new library through the California Reading and Literacy Improvement and Public Library Construction and Renovation Bond Act of 2000 (Proposition 14 or Library Bond Act).
As a 1998-2001 1 2 Public Library Foundation certified service population.

Greene, High School Graduation Rates in the United States, The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, November 2001 5 American Library Association, Library Advocate's Guide to Building Information Literate Communities, 2001 1 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library beta test site for LibrisDESIGN library building program software, NCPL had a dynamic building program that helped determine that constructing a new library is more cost- and service-efficient than remodeling the existing facility.
The City selected a new site and hired a library consultant and architects to help assess and corroborate community need and vision for the new library's optimal function and use of space.
This resulting Needs Assessment verifies widespread support for a new library, with consensus of users and leaders in education, service, and government, who collaborated fully in decisions about the new library's services and design.
The voting public approved all four recent State, county, and City library improvement propositions, including a 73.5% majority for the City's March 2002 bond measure to raise the Proposition 14 match.
Although near the existing library site, the new site features an average daily traffic count of 15,000 vehicles and a bus stop within 100 feet of the entrance.
Key service findings of this assessment include two important points.
1) NCPL staff understands its users' culturally specific service and interpersonal expectations and needs.
User trust and confidence in the staff is imperative because customers routinely come to the library for assistance with basic, potentially embarrassing personal needs, such as reading a bus schedule or locating social services.
2) The primary reason for library non-use is lack of transportation access for eastern neighborhood residents.
The Library's WOW (Words on Wheels) Mobile, introduced in 2001 helps overcome this barrier while reaching the estimated 50-60% of preschool children not enrolled in an educational program and extending literacy, health, and child development programs provided by NCPL and collaborative partners.
The building's physical and service limitations are legion.
Nothing about the building contributes to ease of use, smooth program operation, streamlined, efficient and ergonomic tasking or heightened aesthetics.
Through exceptional effort and dedication, NCPL staff puts every inch of space into serving the public, at the expense of their own workspace need.
Staff is increasingly stressed by the growing materials processing backlog, a direct result of space constraints.
Dated furnishings and worn finishes contribute to an overall shabby atmosphere in the 48-year old building.
Other problems include lack of structural continuity due to piecemeal expansion; no public stairway between floors; rampant ADA noncompliance; a Community Computer Center located in a basement never intended for public use; and risky housing of the main computer servers and router in a retrofitted closet with a water pipe and HVAC coolant lines directly overhead.
Student Needs Almost 75% of National School District (NSD) students scored below grade level in reading on the 1998 SAT9.
Nearly 60% (3,676) of NSD K-6 students are English language learners compared to 25% statewide.6 In nationwide rankings, NSD second and third graders were in the 21st; fifth graders in the 25th, and sixth graders in the 30th percentile, respectively.
Since 1982 NCPL and NSD have had a reciprocal cooperative relationship demonstrating sustained ability to respond to K-6 student needs in areas including learning English, reading, and computers; accessing books and interacting with adults to practice English and reading skills; and overcoming poverty-related barriers.
A joint use Family Literacy Center is planned for the new library.
The new Library will ensure continued services that help National City citizens successfully overcome obstacles to self sufficiency and educational and occupational success, significantly improve their quality of life, and make a lasting positive difference in their children's education.
Visionary planning today will ensure the new facility will not suffer the piecemeal expansion of its predecessor.
California can be sure that its investment in the National City Public Library will yield strong returns in educational, cultural, and social enhancements.
6 Sonya M. Tafoya, "The Linguistic Landscape of California Schools," Public Policy Institute of California, California Counts, February 2002 2 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Needs Assessment Methodology Executive Summary The City of National City and National City Public Library (NCPL) involved community members, library users, community and government leaders, NCPL Board Members, NCPL staff, Friends of the Library members, and representatives from the National and Sweetwater Union High School Districts to appraise current library conditions and determine appropriate steps to correct documented deficiencies.
The Needs Assessment and conceptual design process strongly emphasized community input through four public meetings and numerous stakeholder interviews to guarantee optimal health and potency of transferred programs and services in their new home.
Anne Campbell, NCPL's City Librarian, is in daily contact with community organizations and currently serves on the National School District Board of Education.
She is past chair of the South Bay Region Boards of Education and National City Maytime Band Review, and a member of the National City Chamber of Commerce.
As past president of the California Library Association (full term served 19982000), Ms. Campbell actively supported political and economic steps to improve public library services.
For over two decades, Ms. Campbell and her staff have successfully implemented Public Library Association (PLA)-based strategic planning methods and managed numerous federal, state, and local grants, developing and updating an ongoing plan of service based on user needs.
NCPL continually assesses user needs and evaluates programs to develop services and to inform efforts to obtain and sustain outside funding.
NCPL uses typical survey methods, such as mail surveys, focus groups (especially for technology users), and committee meetings, as well as more specialized ones, such as engaging San Diego State University (SDSU) research interns to evaluate the community's technology needs.
Collaborative partners have also conducted community needs assessments on an ongoing basis since 1993.
From the first assessment National City residents have articulated their need for information.
When interviewed, one resident replied that the only way she knew to obtain information was to call 911.
Surveys consistently verify that NCPL users seek help from the Library for basic needs related to their daily lives that are often profoundly personal and survival-related.
For example, users need help reading a bus schedule, finding doctors and other health care, finding and connecting to local job opportunities, parenting, and child care.
They need continual help improving their English and literacy skills, and they need access to computers and computer training to achieve basic competitiveness as job seekers.
Parents consistently seek out child-raising topics and educational support for their children.
Interacting with NCPL staff necessarily lays bare their lack of skills, requiring a significant measure of trust in the staff's professionalism and confidentiality.
As a result of this continual canvassing of area residents, NCPL operates numerous programs directly tied to customer needs, such as expanded children's programs and after-school programs, the WOW (Words on Wheels) Mobile, Literacy Services, and the Community Computer Center (CCC).
The CCC, serving approximately 200 people every day, illustrates NCPL's success in matching services to evolving community need, ensuring free access to technology and training as an up-to-the-minute basic daily need.
Access to technology is one of the community's most pressing needs; residents need e-mail, word processing, and access to employment databases.
NCPL is closely tied to local community-based organization (CBO) efforts and has successfully combined services to extend the Library into satellite neighborhood sites, such as the Family Resource Centers and all 10 National School District elementary schools.
NCPL has a strong presence throughout the City.
Local community leaders consistently name Ms. Campbell and the Library as a primary daily resource for residents and CBOs alike.
3 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library National City's demographics and most recent public canvassing consistently validate the need for past and present Library Services.
In two recent County ballot initiatives (1996 and 1999) that failed countywide, 70% of National City voters supported sales tax increases to fund library services.
They overwhelmingly supported Proposition 14.
In March 2002, 73.5% of voters approved Proposition H, a City bond measure, to procure the 35% match needed for the Library Bond Act funds.
Voter approval, focus groups, customer interviews, and public meetings about the new Library strongly underscore the project's need and timeliness.
Subsequent to the Proposition 14 application process, LibrisDESIGN software designer Richard Hall chose NCPL as a beta test site for the software program.
In 1998 he visited National City, working with City Librarian Campbell to use LibrisDESIGN to create a building program for NCPL.
The City then hired a library consultant to reassess the potential for the existing structure to be expanded, versus the costs and potential for constructing a new building on a new site.
The resulting report concluded that the new building was the City's the best option, and City Council agreed, electing to pursue construction of the new facility.
Construction alternatives are detailed in this document's Summary of Methods Used.
Site Selection National City's City Council voted unanimously in early September 2001 to construct a new library on a City-owned leveled 1.93-acre (84,000 square feet) parcel of land at 1401 National City Boulevard between 14th and 15th Streets, just south of City Hall.
Key site-related considerations are summarized in National City's Proposition 14 Application Form and this document's Summary of Methods Used.
Proposition 14 In fall 2001, NCPL and the City assembled a team comprised of Carrier Johnson architects, The Fromm Group (TFG) library consultants, and City and Library staff to prepare the California Literacy and Reading Improvement Library Construction and Renovation Bond Act of 2000 application and accompanying materials.
The team assessed the existing facility, confirmed community expectations and need, and integrated public and student needs into the deliverables required to support the application package.
NCPL and the consultants began assessing the community's library service needs and NCPL's corresponding services, studying the condition of the current facility and initiating the architectural planning process.
Carrier Johnson worked closely with the community to develop and refine the facility conceptual plans, including holding three public meetings.
To assess community need, TFG walked through the facility, held numerous conversations with library staff and community stakeholders, and conducted a Community Council focus group.
TFG also studied the Library's Community Computer Center and Literacy Services.
The previous LibrisDESIGN Library Building Project Final Report summarized and documented detailed square footage recommendations for each function of the library.
All parties, including Library staff, revisited the original building program to verify and re-establish appropriate space allocations, corroborated by community need.
The final space assessment synthesizes conclusions into a comprehensive projection of the new library's physical building program and Plan of Service indicators.
The team revised the Building Program numerous times as community and library needs were refined and compared against nationally accepted public library space planning standards.
4 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Community Involvement Public Input Meetings National City Public Library architects and the library consultant conducted four public input meetings, held December 17, 2001, February 8, 2002, March 21, 2002, and April 4, 2002.
The meetings helped gather public evaluation of the current library, as well as goals and vision for the future library.
Community needs and ideas influenced the estimated space required for various functions and helped shape the building's conceptual plans and functional adjacencies.
The architects focused on building consensus for the conceptual design, and participants in the two later meetings expressed satisfaction with how their input was heard and translated into ideas.
Conceptual designs evoked images of shipbuilding (a National City industry), a beacon of light, and a landmark focal point for the City.
The architects specifically responded to the community's desire to discourage graffiti by identifying exterior finishes that can be used to repel permanent markings.
The community is pleased with the resulting conceptual design and library functions.
Both make the most of the site adjacent to Kimball Community Park.
The public is satisfied that the new library will reflect its family-oriented, friendly personality, while simultaneously symbolizing a forward-thinking City with a hopeful future.
During public input meetings, attendees suggested opportunities for the new Library facility to promote services and improve overall access.
Particular desires include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Embrace Kimball Park in the design; Promote pedestrian and mass transit access; Develop it as a focal point for literacy services in the community; Promote education by connecting it with future Education Village to the north; Give it civic character; Incorporate opportunities to announce events using colorful banners or equivalent methods.
At the December 2001 meeting held in the Library's community room, 13 members of National City's Community Council (see below), all female, offered their visions and hopes for the new NCPL.
These women embodied NCPL's friendly, unpretentious clientele.
During the meeting, their children played quietly nearby or focused on homework projects.
The children shyly declined a request to contribute to the meeting.
All 13 participants in the December 2001 meeting were women; most represent the Latino and Filipino community.
The 11 Latino women on the Council chose to speak Spanish, which NCPL's Principal Librarian interpreted.
Their comments are summarized under Analysis and Discussion of Community Characteristics.
Previous National City Public Library surveys of library non-users verify that the two primary factors affecting non-use are lack of transportation and immigrant acculturation issues that complicate residents' confidence in approaching municipal and social services.
Non-users are further addressed under Analysis and Discussion of Community Characteristics.
National City Community Council In 1998, a local leadership development group formed the Community Council, an ethnically diverse group of women and men highly representative of the ethnic breakdown of National City.
The Council 5 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library chose the National City Public Library (NCPL) as its first priority project.
Recognizing the Library's breadth of resources and its intimate role in residents' life, the Council wanted to expand NCPL's open hours and actively encourage the Latino community's involvement in library advocacy.
The Council and NCPL staff worked together closely.
The project resulted in increased library hours, increased participation from the non-white community to solicit donations through fundraising efforts, increased collaboration with the Friends of the Library, and increased overall volunteer participation.
The experience helped establish an awareness of the Library as a critical resource that, like other non-profits, is in need of financial and volunteer support.
Expanded participation took the form of involvement at literacy events, such as book drives at schools and the annual Literacy Fair, membership in Friends of the Library, and helping with fundraisers, such as book sales and raffles.
Overall, the Community Council has generally improved the comfort level of the non-white groups to participate in library advocacy.
The Council noted the exceptionally positive way NCPL staff received the project, immediately establishing a mutually satisfying partnership.
The Community Council also wrote letters to Spanish and Filipino newspapers in support of Proposition H to construct a new facility.
Customer Involvement During the Proposition 14 application process, NCPL conducted a walk-in customer survey primarily to determine the means of transportation library customers use to get to the library.
At the same time, customers were also asked, "Why does National City need a new library?" The top three answers were: 1.
Would like more/new books 2.
Need a new building/larger facility 3.
Need a larger computer center with more computers.
NCPL staff interacts with customers on a profoundly personal level.
On any given day, 22-plus programs are in progress, including general literacy services, family literacy programs, the WOW Mobile, and after school programs.
They serve a critical social service function and are privy to users' most basic daily weaknesses in reading skills and acculturation to life in the United States.
Conversations with NCPL customers consistently underscore the library's social function as a gathering place.
Customers made the following statements during discussion of the new Library: our source of entertainment."
girls and I use the computers."
Library always has what we need."
never go to the video stores and get all our videos at the National City Library.
We check out all kinds of videos, including the documentaries.
We just checked out a video on butterflies."
"The library is somewhere to go for our family; we hang out at the library."
"We didn't have very much money (growing up in National City)."
"We hung out at the library during the summer because we were low income.
It was our source of refuge when we didn't have money."
The new library should be a "relaxing" place.
"My nieces live closer to another library but like the National City library the best because it is friendly and relaxing and has a small town feel."
"The children's area is too small.
There are lots of kids in the children's area and it is very, very small."
"I love the computer lab--but it needs to be bigger.
People are always waiting."
"I raised four children in the library."
"It is "My "The "We 6 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library These needs are further analyzed under Analysis of Library Service Needs.
Community Organization Involvement The following National City community leaders were contacted for this Needs Assessment: Scott L. Lowther, Director of the National City Collaborative Melanie Goodyear, Community Mobilization Specialist, at Paradise Valley Hospital Jose Cruz, Director, California Literacy, Inc.
(Former Director, San Diego Council on Literacy, also former staff member of NCPL Literacy Program) Many City, non-profit, educational and health services programs serve the National City population.
The collaborative effort focuses on literacy and job skills, often synchronizing with Library efforts and resources.
Recently their work has focused on eliminating the "digital divide," a term that denotes inequitable access to computer technology between higher- and lower-income groups.
National City's disproportionately high numbers of blacks, Latinos, and other traditionally underserved groups, as well as low-income households, are less likely to have Internet access at home.
Community leaders emphatically stressed NCPL's commitment to the public and Anne Campbell's initiative and support of area partnerships and technology access for residents.
NCPL makes highly visible efforts to penetrate the community with needed services.
The Library offers computer training through the Family Resource Centers (FRC), scattered strategically throughout National City.
Its WOW Mobile especially meets the needs of people who do not own cars and live off the main public transportation path by bringing computers into the neighborhoods.
Joint Venture School District Involvement This library project benefits strongly from the high level of strategic partnering between NCPL and the K6 National School District (NSD), which includes three existing contracts.
The District encompasses preschool through grade six in 10 schools.
Of 6,605 students, 3,957 (59%) are English Language Learners.
The two entities share the goal of improving student literacy skills, always extending these opportunities to the students' parents and caregivers.
They work together primarily by sharing resources and offering literacy programs.
NCPL Director Anne Campbell serves on NSD's Board of Education.
The District's school library services are electronically connected with NCPL, sharing the library's online catalog.
Students can search the public library's holdings at their schools; the public can search the schools' holdings from the library or other remote access.
Daily delivery of materials from NCPL to the schools enhances resource sharing and helps overcome student families' lack of transportation.
Furthermore, the two entities use desktop video cameras installed on computers to conduct digital video reference interviews.
The library's technology constraints are detailed later in this document.
Plan for Library Services In 1998 Anne Campbell joined a steering committee that developed and wrote NSD's Plan for Library Services, a three-year strategic plan intending to expand student access to "ideas and information that provide a foundation for lifelong learning in a technology-rich environment."
The plan outlines goals and actions for maximizing space, purchasing resources, improving collections, involving parents and community members, provide necessary training, and continuing to work closely with NCPL. 7 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Steering Committee members include 10 NSD staff members and one Media Service Specialist from the San Diego County Office of Education.
Although the Plan for Library Services is a healthy ongoing collaboration, NCPL's physical and service limitations threaten to erode the progress NSD has achieved in improving students' and parents' English literacy and computer skills.
The two entities display collaborative initiative and follow-through-- especially in using emerging technologies--that will soon be beyond the current building's capabilities.
Proposition 14 timing is excellent for the Library and the District to capitalize on the new building's modern amenities to ensure both entities' continuing success in offering ongoing professional library services in the school environments.
NSD staff attended public meetings regarding the new Library and met or spoke individually with NCPL staff and the library consultant.
The two entities continually evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Study Teams (FaST) program, created with California State Library English Language and Literacy Intensive (ELLI) funds and now in its second year at NCPL.
This requires assessment of need and contact with the Community Council, NSD parents, and NSD personnel.
FaST groups meet for twiceweekly 90-minute sessions that incorporate stories, reading and small group literacy activities.
Sessions are held each week at nine of the District's 10 elementary schools, plus one group held at NCPL's community room.
As the Library's meeting space is highly constrained, constructing the new Library offers an opportunity for a proactively developed Joint Venture Program offering a Family Literacy Center with appropriate well-planned amenities.
The Joint Venture ensures continued student literacy programs independent of outside funding sources; it also helps programs such as FaST ensure continued success.
8 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Summary of Methods Used National City Public Library (NCPL), the City of National City, and chosen consultants used the following methods to assess current conditions, canvass community needs, and synthesize related data: National City Public Library Ã¯Â¿Â½ Completed a comprehensive Library Building Program as beta test site for LibrisDESIGN software.
The U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services funds the LibrisDESIGN project under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), administered in California by the State Librarian.
The test site information was later transferred over to the newest release version 2.3.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Continually evaluated NCPL services, including documentation of quantitative data from NCPL's myriad community outreach programs and services in literacy, education, and technology.
City Librarian Campbell participated on the California Library Association's (CLA) Proposition 14 Committee; attended all regulatory development hearings in Sacramento and submitted comments to public hearings.
City of National City Ã¯Â¿Â½ Analyzed options and cost effectiveness to renovate the existing building.
National City commissioned a detailed report documenting considerations for expanding the current facility, rebuilding on the existing site, or building a new library on an alternate site.
The report discussed the following options and their estimated costs: 1) A two-story addition adjacent to the existing facility.
Drawbacks included the limited parking and need for temporary relocation of library services; 2) An addition over the existing facility.
Drawbacks included limited parking, expensive modifications required to accommodate the added weight, need for temporary relocation of library services, and increased staffing costs associated with the third floor addition; 3) Demolish and rebuild on existing site.
Drawbacks included limited parking and need for extended temporary relocation of library services.
4) Construct a new library on the National City Boulevard site being considered by the City.
Cost analyses showed this option to be comparable in cost to the above three.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Selected the 1401 National City Boulevard site and elected to pursue Proposition 14 funding.
Key site considerations include: For the past 100 years NCPL has been located on Kimball Park, a recognized City recreational and cultural site.
National City Boulevard is the primary automobile and mass transit route (north-south, paralleling Interstate 5) in National City, featuring access to the San Diego Trolley and three bus routes and 15 transit stops within 1/4 mile of the site.
The new site is prominent and visible from National City Boulevard.
In all three recent library Propositions (Prop.
A in 1996, Prop. L in 1999, and Prop. 14 in 2000) National City voters overwhelmingly supported a new library facility for this proposed site.
9 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The new site is within walking distance of eight area schools.
The new site completes a mixed civic and recreational use complex (with City Hall and the Community Center) that revitalizes the southwest corner of Kimball Park by opening new portals and integrating views to the recreation areas.
The geographic center of National City is inappropriate as a Library site because it is zoned for tax-generating retail stores and will soon feature a Wal-Mart.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Voted to place a $6 million General Obligation Bond on the March 2002 ballot to provide the local match needed for Proposition 14 funding.
This ballot measure, Proposition H, passed with 73.5% of the vote.
Resolved unanimously on May 21, 2002 to commit the Library Bond Act 35% match to construct the new National City Public Library.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Consultants Ã¯Â¿Â½ Involved NCPL staff in needs assessment and building program process, including the following managers: Anne Campbell, City Librarian Lupe Sanchez, Principal Librarian Lupe Hernandez, Technical Services Maria Marmolejo, Circulation Services Laura Sanchez, Information Technology Monica O'Hara, Literacy Services, Community Computer Center Kenna Payne, Children's Librarian Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Interviewed key community group leaders, school district contacts, and stakeholders identified by NCPL.
Visited the Library to observe visitor patterns, document physical limitations, and interview staff.
Facilitated Community Council focus group meeting to draw out and define service needs.
Facilitated three public meetings with community stakeholders to summarize specific National City traits, interests, and ambitions as they relate to the new public library and to elicit feedback on site utilization and building design options.

11 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Community Analysis Executive Summary Venerable Victorian houses still grace the classic neighborhoods of this second oldest city in San Diego County.7 They mix with the bungalows, Section 8 (government subsidized) housing complexes and occasional adobe-style homes that reveal stages of the City's 115-year history.
Developing rapidly before the 20th century, National City became a popular destination and hosted many illustrious visitors and residents.
The City played an active part in the war effort during World War II, in part because it had the deepest port in the San Diego area.
Shipbuilding brought growth and many new residents to National City.
In the 1970s many large apartment complexes were built.
During this time the predominately white City experienced substantial white migration out of the area, and dramatic increases in minority and immigrant populations.
Today, 86% of the population is non-white.
National City is very poor, with a 1990 and 2000 per capita income of approximately half that of California or the United States.
Census 2000 figures show that National City's median income of $29,826 is the lowest of 18 San Diego County municipalities, including unincorporated rural County.8 It is transient, with 65% renters and 35% homeowners; the exact inverse of the housing tenure in the U.S. overall, underscoring municipal service needs relating to housing and job seeking.
The National School District (NSD) serves approximately 6,605 students, of which 3,957 (59%) are English Language Learners.
Nearly 30% of the students in the Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD) are English Language Learners.
Plagued by pervasive problems associated with low socioeconomic conditions and low parental educational attainment, many students struggle to achieve academically.
Collectively, National School District students scored below grade level in reading in every grade (2-6) on the 1998 STAR test Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition (SAT9).
In a national comparison, National School District second and third graders ranked in the 21st percentile, fifth graders at the 25th percentile, and sixth graders in the 30th percentile.
To summarize, approximately 75% of the district's students scored below grade level in reading on the 1998 STAR test (SAT9).
The Role of the Library The Library is an established, highly used community facility.
It is an anchor source for information, events, and training options for residents, schools, City management and agencies, and for many community service organizations.
The Library is a sustained public service--not a pilot program--that must offer reliable daily services that directly affect users' quality of life.
The Library interacts constantly with the City, the schools, and community organizations.
On any typical day NCPL oversees two WOW Mobile programs, 10 school-age literacy programs at 10 sites, 3-6 adult literacy activities, three computer literacy programs, and a family literacy event, in addition to serving over 200 people in the Community Computer Center.
City departments increasingly use the Library for research, to locate quick reference information, such as addresses, and to make City plans or reports available for public review.
The City needs better visibility for these surveys to encourage residents to participate in the civic planning process.
The Library's afterwork hours are critical to the City's ability to reach these people.
The City is highly aware of the new library's potential to increase citizen interaction with local government.
7 8 After San Diego's Old Town San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) 12 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library NCPL's Community Computer Center (CCC) offers software and online resources to learn and improve typing, phonics, spelling, alphabet recognition, and other basic literacy skills.
The CCC accounts for much of NCPL's 72% increase over three years in in-library use.
The Library's technology extends to the 10 National School District (NSD) schools and the National City Adult School.
The NSD schools, for example, have video cameras mounted on computers to allow NCPL librarians to conduct visual reference interviews (videoconferencing) with students, staff, or teachers.
NCPL and NSD enjoy a strong, ongoing relationship that includes a shared library database, innovative use of technology, and distance learning programs.
Between 2000 and 2001 the schools slowly improved their SAT9 scores, while also reducing the computer-to-student ratio and offering a variety of grants and programs, which NCPL often shares.
The District and Library together use English Language Learning Intensive (ELLI) funding to run the after school Family Study Teams (FaST) program, held daily at school sites and at NCPL is enormously successful, serving a combined 1,775 students and parents in FY 2000-2001.
For the past 10 years, the Library and the School District together have promoted literacy to the community every May and October during National City Literacy Days.
Each event attracts up to 5,000 children and adults.
Activities include storytelling, art and writing displays and craft activities, with Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) book distribution to K-12 students as a highlight event.
The Friends of the National City Library (FOL) contribute significant volunteer support to this event and other reading advocacy activities.
In 2001 the National City Community Council, a local leadership development group, helped NCPL and the Friends plan and execute Literacy days, purposefully recruiting new volunteers from the non-white community in the process.
National City's government, schools, and community organizations focus on ways to help the population overcome traditional barriers to success, such as lower income and literacy rates.
Like the Library, these entities must find ways to maximize dollars and resources.
They often work closely with NCPL toward this goal and have made strides with projects such as the WOW (Words on Wheels) Mobile, library materials placed at Family Resource Centers in neighborhoods and schools, and efforts to provide children with books, computers and software training.
National City is moving forward rapidly with plans for increased presence of higher education and adult vocational training.
Higher education seems poised as the next "frontier" for NCPL services, though basic literacy and general information will continue to be a primary focus.
Collaborative efforts in National City are extensive and have been commended for success in pooling resources to maximize funding.
The Library is one of over 51 City, County, educational, military, political, social service, and grass-roots organizations forming a partnership called the National City Collaborative.
As an umbrella entity, the Collaborative's overall goal is to improve the well being of the community.
The Collaborative ensures that these organizations are linked closely to express community needs by conducting frequent community forums.
The Collaborative's oversight also helps to avoid duplication of effort and saturation of services.
The library's goals are motivated by the reality of economic and academic barriers faced by National City residents.
Community leaders consider the Library a "respite" from the pressures of poverty, and residents consider it relaxing and welcoming.
NCPL's bilingual, bicultural staff members are thoroughly immersed in the cultural milieu of their customers; thus they have earned the respect of immigrant and bicultural customers.
Unfortunately, as relentless heavy use pushes the facility to its limits, NCPL's overall program quality increasingly suffers.
13 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Governmental Agencies National City incorporated in 1887 and today is a General Law city with an elected Mayor and fourmember Council.
The Council appoints a City Manager, who is charged with the responsibilities of managing the delivery of public services.
National City employs 360 City employees in 11 City departments, including the National City Public Library (NCPL).
In January 2002 National City's Mayor, George H. Waters (elected in 1986) served alongside Council Members Ron Morrison, Mitch Beauchamp, Nick Inzunza, and Rosalie Zarate.
City Council has been supportive of NCPL and of the Community Computer Center and has increased the library's personnel budget to cover CCC staffing costs.
City Council carefully studied alternative possibilities for expanding the existing library or rebuilding on the same site.
In September 2001 Council formally elected to move forward with plans to seek Library Bond Act grant money to construct a new facility at 1401 National City Boulevard.
The City and Library then ran a successful campaign to pass Proposition H, a bond act to raise the 35% matching funds, passed on March 5, 2002 by an overwhelming 73.5% majority.
On May 21, 2002, the City resolved to commit the funds required for the Library Bond Act's 35% match to construct the new library.
Of City Manager Tom McCabe's office, Stephen M. Kirkpatrick, Assistant Director of Public Works, oversaw the Proposition 14 application project.
City Librarian Anne Campbell prepared or oversaw the preparation of the required application and supplemental materials.
The City anticipates using the new Library in many ways, including: Planning: The Planning Department often uses the Local History Room of the Library.
Police: The City recently used the Library to help develop a history of the police department.
City Attorney: This office can occasionally use the library for historical and research purposes.
The new location is more convenient than the South Bay Law Library.
Human Resources: The Personnel office has used NCPL to research questions for written exams in a variety of positions.
Risk Management: NCPL assists with locating addresses and providing back issues of newspapers for researching claims.
Community Development: The City uses NCPL for historical research, as extra space for a "plan check" room when projects are out to bid and as a place where the public can review draft reports placed out for public comment.
The City envisions NCPL can help serve as a one-stop shop from which residents can obtain all City documents, plans, reports and forms either out of a database or in hard copy.
This would save City staff time during normal business hours and the Library's extended hours would allow residents greater access to City plans, reports and forms when the City would otherwise be closed.
In general, the City turns to NCPL for historical research, because other area libraries do not focus on National City's heritage.
Finally, the City uses the library as a public information tool, to elicit public feedback on City projects, such as displays.
14 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Library Board of Trustees As a general law City, National City has an administrative library Board of Trustees.
In early years, board members were elected, but in recent years, the Mayor, with the consent of the City Council, appoints Library Board members.
Board members set all NCPL policy and procedure, and the City Librarian is accountable to the Board for all library operations.
Board members represent the National City community, playing a significant leadership role in attaining a new National City Public Library.
Beginning the process with discussions over five years ago, the Board has worked to pass local elections, to inform City Council on library-related issues, and to bring resident input to the City Librarian.
The current Board has a strong education and community involvement background, and members have proven especially articulate in assisting the library with planning and executing National School District (NSD) joint use projects and agreements.
Board Member Lily Fernandez-Martin Charles Howrey Zelva Moeser Delton "Rip" Reopelle Maureen Wisener, Appointed Background and experience 06/06/2000 Retired teacher 06/12/2001 Strong community involvement in parenting and athletic organizations 06/12/2001 Retired teacher 07/18/2000 Retired educator; former NSD teacher, principal, and superintendent 07/27/1999 Young parent, actively involved in community; past president of Rotary, employed at Paradise Valley Hospital; connected to most community organizations School Agencies National School District: George Cameron, EdD, Superintendent Ellen Curtin, EdD, Assistant Superintendent Anne Campbell, Member, Board of Trustees Rita Palet, Teacher on Special Assignment, CBET (Community Based English Tutoring) Program Clint Taylor, Extended Learning Opportunities Coordinator (Library After School Programs) National School District (NSD) has a preschool-6th grade student population of 6,605 and a yearly operating budget of $33 million.
Superintendent Dr. George Cameron is bilingual/bicultural, as are six out of nine principals.
Over 38% of the teaching staff is bilingual.
The Bilingual Liaison Committee, an advisory group formed of experienced and exemplary bilingual teachers, works with the Bilingual Program Coordinator to assist and train teachers and advise District administration.
Proportionally there are far more English Learners (ELs) in National City than statewide.
The District's 3,957 English Language Learners account for 60% of total enrollment, and three quarters of the enrolled population is of Latino background.
In comparison, ELs account for approximately 25% of California's public school students.9 The majority of ELs in National City and in California speak Spanish as a primary language.

The District does not consider these collections "true media centers," because they lack substantial reference collections.
The District relies on NCPL for reference materials, such as homework and research resources.
The Public Library and NSD have a long-term cooperative relationship.
NCPL Director Campbell has served on the NSD Board of Trustees for 15 years.
Ms. Campbell has encouraged and initiated cooperative library services with all of the District's school libraries.
NCPL and NSD have long since established many of the types of joint use services described in the Library Bond Act regulations, and each of these services is already constrained by NCPL inadequacies.
Specifically, the schools increased reliance on computer services and distance learning using NCPL technology will soon overwhelm NCPL's fragile technical infrastructure.
The after-school Family Study Teams (FaST) programs constantly suffer from the poor location and small size of the Library meeting room.
As the need for many of these programs is increasing--or only now emerging, all of the library's limitations contribute to NCPL's generally poor capacity to meet anticipated school demands within the next 10 years.
Through these collaborative efforts, NSD has been able to make slow but sure improvement in academic testing, due in part to expansion of the after-school programs, including literacy tutors from NCPL.
NCPL also supports the District's Community Based English Tutoring (CBET) program and the Family Study Teams (FaST), which serve students' parents and caregivers.
These successful efforts between the two entities will be continued in the new library facility, including the translation of current efforts into a formal strategic Joint Venture Project.
The Joint Venture Project and all existing programs are described in detail in National City Public Library's Library Plan of Service.
In brief, existing programs include but are not limited to: 16 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Years Collaborative Program implemented WOW Mobile beginning 2nd year of success 1 Shared certificated librarian 1 Shared reference services with desktop video reference from NCPL to each school 2 California State Library English Language and Literacy Intensive (ELLI) Family Study Teams (FaST) 2 CBET (Community-Based English Tutoring Program) for parents 2 Shared Statistical Data (three year grant) to track student achievement 3 Connectivity Through San Diego County Office of Education 6 Shared catalog and automation system with book delivery to schools from NCPL 6 Christopher Ewing Writing Contest 6 Clerical Library Assistance 6 Reading is Fundamental (RIF) book distribution 10 Family Literacy 15 The CBET program is a good illustration of robust collaboration in National City.
It serves 300 adult learners each month, who take 12-20 hours per week of class at NSD school sites, as well as at the Family Resource Centers run by the National City Collaborative.
It is unique in offering childcare for preKindergarten children while parents, primarily mothers, learn English.
It is funded in part through Proposition 227 (English language immersion) funds.
The program relies heavily on the library.
These adult students take field trips (by carpool and walking) to NCPL to supplement classroom teaching and help students obtain library cards.
The program's coordinator works closely with NCPL's Literacy Services staff to coordinate types of resources and the students' access to them.
The program brings literacy full circle by requiring adult students to practice English literacy by teaching English language skills to children, such as by reading books to them.
To do this, the students use the Library to find books, tutoring resources, and staff knowledgeable in English language teaching.
They also use the Community Computer Center.
Finally, the Library's WOW Mobile supplements the program's health education component by bringing resources to the school and Family Resource Center sites for coordinated presentations.
Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD) Ed Brand, EdD, Superintendent Lilian Leopold, Director of Grants Sweetwater Union High School District employs 3,000 people on 24 campuses, serving approximately 33,000 seventh-through-twelfth graders and 34,000 adult students.
National City's middle and high school students attend Granger Junior High, National City Middle School and Sweetwater Senior High School, all of which are within National City boundaries.
The three secondary schools also have high percentages of English learners.
Most of these are native Spanish speakers followed by Tagalog (Filipino) speakers.
The schools' API scores and 2000/2001 enrollments are: 2000/2001 National City Secondary School API Score Enrollment Granger Junior High 576 1,165 National City Middle School 543 904 Sweetwater Senior High 521 2,535 Total 4,604 17 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The District welcomes targeted public library services to secondary school students.
The schools have libraries of various sizes, staffed by school media specialists.
Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD) has partnered with NCPL on many projects, especially in the areas of literacy and technology.
The three secondary schools in National City play a large role in the two major literacy celebrations held each year, sponsored by the Library and the National City Literacy Task Force.
SUHSD officials assisted with the creation of NCPL's Community Computer Center (CCC), serving on the Advisory Committee and supplying hardware and software to the CCC.
They use the CCC to train and disseminate laptops to students for educational use.
In 1999 SUHSD received a California State Technology Literacy Challenge Grant for Log On To Literacy.
National City Middle School and Granger Junior High participate in this program, the first of its kind in San Diego, which provides 7th and 8th grade students with a computer and Internet access at no cost.
Students are required to take care of the computer and complete all of their assignments, and parents must attend four hours of training and meetings.
NCPL collaborated on the grant and provides laptops for students to borrow from the Library.
Also under SUHSD purview, the National City Adult Education Center (NCAEC) serves 9,000 adults in National City.
This Adult Education Center (also called Adult School) is the largest of four adult education centers in the greater South Bay Area.
Together the Centers serve 43,000 adults, making it the largest adult school system in the State of California.
The Centers offer open entry, open exit classes, helping people improve prospects for employment, get back on track after setbacks, learn recreational skills, and also prepare for the general equivalency diploma (GED).
In a unique partnership, the National City Adult Education Center's technology training program provides NCPL's Community Computer Center with trained technicians that support the Library's technology infrastructure.
Adult learners in National City need basic library materials as well as distance learning technology.
Many of the Adult Education Center's students go to NCPL to use the computers.
The distance learning technologies connect National City students to online classes from any one of the four South Bay Centers.
Sweetwater Union High School District will continue to assist in the development of adult learning materials, especially literacy materials.
Through the three secondary schools and the National City Adult Education Center, it will recruit youth and adults into collaborative programs.
Private Sector Partnerships Pacific Bell's Education First initiative was designed to provide educational institutions (schools and libraries) with access to technology and provide assistance with developing and providing tools that enable access to online resources, videoconferencing, and other electronic learning applications.
NCPL has partnered with Education First since 1994.
Education First has provided support for development of the Library's technology infrastructure, the development of the CCC, and most recently assisted with the installation of videoconferencing equipment.
Education First consultants will continue to assist with research and support the development of adult and youth learning materials for ongoing partnership programs.
Private Schools and Home School Students National City Public Library serves home-schooled students daily and serves as the de facto library for students from Southport Christian Academy, enrollment 150.
Occasionally the staff puts craft packets together for home-schooling parents.
These parents and students often join Library events and use the Library for school assignments.
18 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Community Organizations Friends of the National City Library (FOL) The FOL, a non-profit, tax exempt organization, actively promotes the library and raises approximately $5,000 annually, mostly through membership fees and book sales.
The group has 120 members, and maintains a mailing list of over 300 supporters.
A group of 16 active members serve on the board, regularly operate the in-library book sales, and coordinate other special events.
The FOL contribute financially to: fifth grade class visits to the library, summer and school-year reading programs, family nights that celebrate literacy, such as Fiesta Biblioteca, young adult programs, and three Literacy Celebrations per year, one of which includes a chili cook-off.
During the Literacy Celebrations, the FOL help distribute Reading is Fundamental (RIF) books.
At least two FOL members are lifelong residents of National City and consider the library indispensable to the low-income community.
The Friends organize an ongoing book sale from a small cart in the library's lobby and from two small study rooms located along the back wall of the library.
Donated books in storage occupy a full wall of shelves in the library staff's technical processing area.
Increased fundraising through book sales is not possible in the small space allotted.
Operating from three separate locations in the library greatly dilutes the FOL's efficiency and effectiveness as a library advocacy group.
The FOL supported the City's Proposition H ballot measure to raise the Proposition 14 required 35% match by writing and sending a special letter to FOL members reminding them of the urgency to support the construction of the new facility.
National City Chamber of Commerce The National City Chamber of Commerce and NCPL have a long history of interaction.
The Chamber supports the Library's Literacy Services program by participating in the Literacy Celebrations, including a first place win in the chili cook-off salsa division one year.
The Chamber's membership in the National City Literacy Task Force results in expanded opportunities for literacy awareness and program support.
The Chamber advertises Library events in its monthly newsletter and solicits Chamber members in support of the Library's programs.
The Chamber participates in NCPL technology programs, providing opportunities for Chamber members to partner with National City youth in project development.
The Chamber will continue to assist in marketing Library programs and working with youth, providing both groups the opportunity to develop technical skills simultaneously.
National City Community Development Commission: Education Village National City's Community Development Commission (CDC) is charged with attracting and keeping business, improving neighborhoods, and making housing available to low-and moderate-income families.
The CDC administers redevelopment projects, Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), and housing programs, contributing $25 million per year of primarily grant money to the community.
Key projects over the next five years include the Q Avenue revitalization project that combines low-income housing and a community center, a marina-style harbor district, and the $22 million National City Education Village project, scheduled for completion in December 2004.
The Village is approximately four blocks north of the new Library site; the new Library will likely play a key role serving the expected 10,000 students of Education Village.
Education Village includes a 100,000 square-foot academic building with classrooms, laboratories, and support facilities, as well as a 300-seat multipurpose auditorium/video conference center for theater groups, civic meetings and conferences.
Planners expect the project will contribute to the rejuvenation of 19 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library the downtown core, stimulating the economy by attracting the private sector into 20,000 square feet of commercial space.

U.S. Navy, Fleet and Family Support Center The Collaborative's mission is to form and maintain a partnership of organizations and community residents working together to provide accessible, neighborhood-based services to families that focus on prevention or early intervention.
The Collaborative is especially focused on locating services in neighborhoods to help residents overcome transportation barriers.
Collaborative partners envision and encourage National City residents to progress from being clients in a service environment, to becoming full partners in building on community and individual strengths toward the improvement of both.
The Collaborative initiated and operates four Family Resource Centers (FRCs) located in bungalows in National City neighborhoods or on school sites.
The FRCs are integrated service hubs that deliver a cross-section of critical support services, such as health training, social services intake and referral, job skills, crisis prevention and intervention training and support, computer access training and more.
Working with NCPL is critical to the FRCs success in offering state-of-the-art information services to residents.
Most recently, NCPL's WOW Mobile began a regular schedule of visits to the FRCs so that adults and children can attend programs at coinciding times.
The Collaborative is also key to NCPL's efforts to recruit adults and youth for partnership programs today and in the new library.
San Diego Community Technology Group (SDCTG) NCPL hosted the first meeting of the San Diego CTG in 1999.
The group is an informal volunteer clearinghouse of digital divide efforts.
The Technology Group meets quarterly, bringing together businesses, government, nonprofit organizations and educational institutions to learn from each other.
It has a mailing list of 300 and an active e-mail listserve of 95, and initiated production of a regional map of community technology centers.
SDCTG and other sponsors of community technology centers rely on the Library as a community resource for computers and training, outreach, and to serve as a satellite center with distance learning technology.
20 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Demography (1) Population Characteristics National City's Census 2000 population of 54,260 residents lives within 9.2 square miles.
Since incorporating in 1887, the City's demographics have changed to becoming one of the most ethnically diverse areas in San Diego County.
The built-out City's rate of growth has slowed to 2% over the past decade, and the population includes young, transient renters as well as established homeowners.
The population's ethnic breakdown is 60% Latino, 14% White, 20% Asian (predominately Filipino) and 6% Black or African American.
Unless otherwise noted, National City and San Diego regional or City demographics were obtained from: San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), the County's Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) U.S. Census Bureau State of California Department of Finance State of California Department of Employment Development National City's literacy rate from San Diego Council on Literacy State of California and U.S. demographics were obtained from: U.S. Census Bureau U.S. estimated literacy rate from National Institute for Literacy (2) Data Not Available Most Library Bond Act-required data for this Needs Assessment are available from either the 1990 or 2000 Census and are labeled by year.

This is the lowest literacy rate of the County's 23 municipalities.
23 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Estimates of the percentage of adults who are at Level 1 Literacy (loosely defined as able to read at 4th grade level or lower) are summarized in the following chart.
National City Estimated % of adults at Level One Literacy Unemployment Rate According to Census 2000, a higher percentage of National City residents were unemployed than in the State of California or in the nation.
National City Unemployment Rate (Census 2000) Occupational Breakdown The majority of National City's employed persons work in administrative support, sales, service, and production jobs, with smaller percentages in executive or professional positions.
The combined percentage of National City employees in executive, managerial, and professional jobs is less than half that of the San Diego region, California, or the nation.

Nearly 43% of adults lack a high school diploma and 22.6% completed less than 9th grade.
Educational Attainment (Census 2000) Percent High School Graduate or Higher Percent Bachelor's Degree or Higher National City 57.2 9.0 California 76.2 23.4 U.S. 75.2 20.3 24 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Analysis and Discussion of Community Characteristics In addition to quantifiable demographics, National City displays certain intangible personalities, or traits, that stand out to residents, visitors, or neighboring areas.
Such qualities drive the character of the Library Plan of Service, requiring staff to demonstrate interpersonal skills, social protocol, and style of reference service that responds appropriately to the user population.
NCPL's staff, for example, understands the social protocol of the Latino population and incorporates this population's expected level of personal conversation and exchange into standard library services.
Staff also understands the deference that many immigrant cultures have for government services; style of service and facility design must both inspire user confidence when approaching staff.
On the other hand, National City library users' reticence to ask for help often reflects an intense quest for self-sufficiency, which can be aided through signage, end-user help tools, and library research training opportunities.
At a December 2001 meeting, 13 National City Community Council members described their community using the following words: Community spirited Competitive Family oriented Friendly Has a certain mystery and magic Helping people Historical In progress/evolving/continuing Interesting Pretty Ready Sharing Supportive Very diverse Very unique Welcoming Wonderful place to be Economic disadvantages and language barriers do not diminish the positive feelings this community has for its multi-cultural and historic City.
Council members would like to keep these positive qualities integrated into the Library's overall aesthetics and service.
The Community Council affirmed that National City is a transient community; thus, municipal services, including the Public Library, serve a high number of unique individuals, in addition to longtime regular users.
New users to the library require more assistance, direction, and training.
Other characteristics of National City that affect the City's public library planning process include pride in cultural heritage, high motivation for self-paced learning, family-based living with older teens staying in the home, and the fact that students who do attend college do not typically move back into the City.
The Community Council is strongly concerned that the City's library planning be future-oriented, educating children to help them stay away from negative factors.
They have a long-term desire to plant the seed in young people to achieve educational and career success and then find ways to give back to their home city.
Non-library users NCPL has approximately 32,300 cardholders, representing just over half the City population.
Recent library efforts to reach non-users have focused on bringing services into neighborhoods to reach people without cars or pedestrian access to public transit stations.
The WOW Mobile helps mitigate this problem; it issued 338 cards between July 2001 and March 2002.
The library is closer to neighborhoods and schools in the west side of the City.
Users on the City's east side can benefit from interacting with the Library through the WOW Mobile and through distance learning equipment, such as increased live 25 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library communication between students and NCPL staff using the video cameras installed on school or Family Resource Center computers.
NCPL has surveyed non-users in the past and still finds today that immigrant acculturation accounts for a large portion of library non-use.
National City is an entry point for many new immigrants to the United States.
Many of these people have little or no understanding of the free public library system; however, they have the same needs as other residents for literacy skills, medical care, jobs, and childcare.
NCPL continually tries to reach new users, most successfully through the schools.
As students are introduced to public library services and programs, so their parents are invited to attend and use the library to meet their own unique needs.
As users come to the library for assistance, such as free tax preparation programs, NCPL staff promotes other services to them, bringing them back again.
These services must be high quality and reliable to be effective in attracting and sustaining high use levels.
Public libraries near National City include Chula Vista Public Library system, Paradise Hills Branch of San Diego Public Library, and the San Diego Public Main Library.
Conversations with NCPL customers indicate that NCPL's friendly, relaxing feel causes this library to stand out from others.
They say the staff knows individual customers, makes them feel at home, and makes them feel comfortable using the library.
26 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Analysis of Library Service Needs Executive Summary This Community Library Needs Assessment uncovered no major user needs not already identified and addressed in current National City Public Library (NCPL) services or planning.
On the contrary, National City's demographics, community characteristics, and patterns of library use reveal that NCPL can and does play a pivotal role helping residents overcome practical obstacles to self-sufficiency and a better life.
The new Library's Plan of Service is the blueprint for the transfer of the existing library's materials and services to a facility that will maximize the reach, range, and outcome of every amenity and resource.
The new Library's Plan of Service will additionally incorporate several needed services currently unavailable or offered at a minimum level because of the constraints on the existing facility.
It is no exaggeration that the library serves this population at a very personal, almost intimate level, often as a first point of contact for finding other social service professionals.
National City Public Library users often lack literacy in their native language as well as English.
They often have no car, nor money for public transportation.
Many cannot afford to pay overdue fines; they often use materials in the library rather than check them out and risk being charged.
One user's statement, "I raised four children in the library," aptly conveys how, for many families, NCPL is a virtual home away from home.
NCPL users need a wide range of general materials for adults, children, and young adults.
They need a library whose facilities, collection development, reference services, data processing systems, public programs, and fair access conform to the highest possible standards, to maximize service opportunities on a par with those enjoyed by more affluent communities.
To improve their ability to acculturate to the United States and raise their standard of living, National City residents need access to basic legal, business, and government information, as well as information literacy skills to translate research into practical use.
To extend their personal and family resources, they need recreational reading materials and audio-visual.
They also need referrals to social services and academic resources that supplement their educational goals.
NCPL offers National City's many traditionally underserved and economically disadvantaged residents a safe, place to find free information and a variety of programs to attend that truly enhance their life experiences.
This Needs Assessment identifies the following broad needs in National City, listed in alphabetical order.
In this section, each need is evaluated for anticipated 10-year demand and NCPL's assessed ability to meet the demand.
Additional analysis of inadequate ability to meet demand will be discussed under Service Limitations of the Existing Library and Physical Limitations of the Existing Library.

Specialized programs amplify the Library's general library services and collections.
Many of these needs can be considered essential or survival needs.
The Library's vigorous response to residents' needs has resulted in thriving programs addressing literacy, computers, distance learning and remote access, family needs, and over twelve collaborative programs on 10 school sites.
The Community Computer Center alone serves well over 50,000 users each year.
NCPL has organized and deployed staff, expenditures, collections, technology, programs, and space to meet premium service needs.
In addition to the 12 daily programs at 10 school sites described under School Agencies, National School District, above, NCPL offers a combined total of 552 children's and adult programs annually.
Attendees at community meetings expressed a desire for the new NCPL to be developed as a focal point for literacy services in the community and to promote education by connecting it with future Education Village to the north.
This opportunity to construct a new Library will open virtually unlimited opportunities to meet and exceed these and other needs of the National City community.
Adult literacy services Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing National City's 36% illiteracy rate is the highest in San Diego County.
Residents speak little English and often cannot read in their native language.
They need focused and prolonged individual help learning to read.
They need a variety of resources, from tutoring to computer options, as well as help setting and meeting goals for achieving literacy skills that will help them acculturate and gain self-sufficiency.
Children's services Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing National City is a young population; the median age is 4.7 years younger than that of neighboring Chula Vista and San Diego.
Latino and black populations are even younger.
The need for overall children's services will increase as young families have children and as literacy programs continue to target preschool children.
NCPL prides itself on the high quality of its children's programming.
The Children's department works hard to provide opportunities for young people to increase their literacy skills and become active participants in enriching, entertaining and educational experiences.
The Library partners with other organizations and schools to provide programs such as career days, guest speakers from various professions, and college fairs for teenagers.
College preparation and higher education support Anticipated 10-year demand: Emerging The recently opened Adult Education School under the Sweetwater Union High School District and the planned Education Village, an association between the local Community College District and San Diego State University being built with redevelopment funds, mark a turning point for higher education in National City and an opportunity for NCPL to serve an emerging user population of 10,000 students.
The new library site is located only four blocks from the new Education Village, and less than a mile from the Adult Education Center.
Slowly, these education facilities will influence change in the neighborhoods and will help serve as a catalyst for more young people to pursue higher education.
The library must be able to offer resources that help people begin and sustain a higher education program.
29 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Common areas to meet and study Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing National City's predominantly low-income residents need free or low-cost places to gather.
NCPL is frequently their venue of choice for relaxation, family togetherness, reading practice, and to use computers.
Jose Cruz, Director of California Literacy, Inc., and former NCPL Literacy Program staff member affirms that NCPL is very much an extension of the family, especially to Latino families, who value education as a way of improving themselves.
One lifelong NCPL customer remembers "hanging out" at the Library when she was young.
"It was our source of refuge when we didn't have money," she said.
Another customer mentioned that all her friends walk to the Library and she sees them there.
Existing space does not support users' varied needs for gathering space.
Computers and computer Training Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing NCPL's continually used Community Computer Center (fully described in the Library Plan of Service) is testimony to residents' voracious need for computers and technology.
They need computers to produce resumes, cover letters, and e-mail correspondence directly linked to job searches.
They also need computers to enhance learning English and learning to read.
Children need computers to expand their skills options for learning letters and words.
The technology-driven 21st century demands that employees have--at a minimum--basic computer skills.
To increase earning potential, employees must ever improve these skills.
Service and production industry jobs typically do not require computer skills; few National City residents receive computer training on the job and must rely on free training available from sources such as the public library.
They must feel comfortable with group training options, and must have self- training options as well.
National City's residents need Internet resource training targeting ethnic populations, for example, Internet resources tailored to the African American community or in Spanish.
Economically disadvantaged residents need access to computer technology that more affluent populations may have at home.
Focus Groups with NCPL Community Computer Center have influenced NCPL's specific technology services.
Their ideas and NCPL plans for improved services underscore the urgency for more space, more reliable infrastructure and custom responses to National City's unique technology needs.
Input includes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Continue CCC service; this is the only place they know to use computers and the Internet; Offer more time for Internet sessions; Offer demonstrations or workshops on using scanners, looking for jobs on the Internet, and creating web pages; Develop bilingual (English-Spanish) computer classes; Strengthen the connection between Literacy Services and the CCC, for example, by training literacy students to use computers as part of the tutoring process; Attract parents and caregivers to the CCC through family technology programs 30 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Culturally competent service; Bilingual/multi-lingual staff Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable This impoverished City with a multi-lingual population and 36% illiteracy depends on the Library for survival-related information, programs, and assistance.
National City's diverse populations must feel comfortable and supported in their quests for resources to support and enhance their personal and academic achievement or the Library becomes yet another barrier for residents to tolerate or overcome in their quest for education and social services.
Library staff sensitive to culturally embedded values and interrelationship styles are crucial to NCPL's mission and practical service.
Again and again, users relate their comfort with the NCPL staff as a source of information and support, ensuring that users will move from a superficial interaction with the Library to a deeper and repeat relationship that fosters lifelong learning.
Educational support (K-6 public school library support) Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable to increasing Students in National City face daily challenges of learning English and learning to read, and overcoming poverty, limited access to healthcare, and limited transportation options.
They need maximum exposure to literacy services and extended options for using computers and borrowing books and materials that students in more affluent areas are likely to own.
NCPL's sustained successful partnership with National School District includes components unique in San Diego County, such as the shared online catalog and video-conferencing reference services.
Cuttingedge services to the school district benefit the general public and are especially effective in drawing parents and caregivers to the Library to seek solutions to their own literacy improvement needs.
These programs are listed under School Agencies and will be transferred to the new Library.
The Library Plan of Service details these programs.
Low cost recreational options Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable Library users of all ages depend on the Library to offer free access to books, magazines, computers and computer games, and activities and events.
They need space, seating, and privacy for the kinds of socializing and interaction that people in National City seek out.
Information Literacy Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing Access to computers does not alone guarantee successful use of technology.
Library users depend on NCPL to help them learn to use electronic information effectively to create a practical benefit.
They need sustained formal interaction with reference librarians to develop good searching and data interpretation skills, using print and non-print resources.
Reliable and ongoing training in research skills will lead to improved user self-sufficiency, improved personal, academic, and job decisions and an overall economic benefit of library cost-effectiveness.
Government, legal and business resources All communities community with "system."
They specific reference service referrals.
Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable have needs for government, legal, and business resources, but National City is a poor large numbers of immigrants and unskilled workers who need help navigating the need to learn how to identify social service resources and identify and use subjectbooks and databases.
This need overlaps with needs for information literacy and social 31 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Multicultural appreciation and celebration of heritage Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing NCPL's Local History room highlights the City's late 19th century origins.
The dramatic shift in demographics since then has left a gap in relevant cultural and local heritage services.
The Library anticipates increased demand for collections and art, music, and literature programs that celebrate the City's current ethnic and linguistic mix.
Audio-visual collections in English and Spanish Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable Language barriers and low literacy in National City spur an interest in audio-visual resources.
Families and individuals demand a large video collection in English and in Spanish, borrowing primarily documentaries and feature films.
Their future needs will require access to new technologies, such as music CD ROMs and DVDs.
Social services referrals Anticipated 10-year demand: Stable National City Public Library users approach the Library as an initial connection to the larger world of social services.
Staff is familiar with local social services, health care organizations, and communitybased information and referral organizations.
They can steer users to the type of organization best suited to meet their needs and can offer flyers, telephone numbers, and even individual contacts.
Transportation to the library Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing Extensive needs assessments in National City conducted by community-based organizations such as those belonging to the National City Collaborative consistently reveal the dire need for residents to overcome their limited means of transportation.
The densely populated neighborhoods in the City's east side have few public transit options; many of these are women with preschool children.
Multifunctional bookmobile service through the WOW Mobile has only just begun reaching its potential for serving these residents.
Vocational and career planning; job information Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing National City residents work primarily in service and production jobs.
They need access to resources that help identify options for education, career changes, and ongoing training.
They also need reference and computer support for adult classes they may take at the Higher Education Center or the Adult School.
They need some of these resources in Spanish.
Young Adult Services Anticipated 10-year demand: Increasing Latinos are the fastest-growing ethnic group in California and the nation.
With 60% Latino residents, National City's population of teens and college age customers is growing rapidly.
Teens have special needs for gathering places, print and non-print materials, computers and low-cost recreational options.
Their literacy and English learning skills need fine-tuning, but they are not attracted by children's programs.
Young adults benefit especially from multi-cultural programming, since many teens are unaware of their cultural history.
In National City, many teens must work to support their families or supplement family income.
This reality leads to a need for options for paid internships or work-study opportunities.
32 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Service Limitations of Existing Library Facility Executive Summary National City Public Library (NCPL) provides today's services in yesterday's building.
Although staff has responded to user needs by maximizing resources to the fullest possible extent --especially in literacy and computer services--the building was not intended to originate the services the Library offers today.
To stay ahead of the curve--to leverage its significant strengths toward providing tomorrow's services-- this visionary and successful public library needs an environment indicative and supportive of progress and achievement.
The chart in the previous section's Executive Summary illustrates how facility limitations are the primary factor for NCPL's poor ability to meet 10-year projected need.
Collections, readers' seats, staff offices, technology, and meeting space are all severely constrained by the inadequate condition and size of the existing library.
These constraints limit the Library's ability to capitalize on its current successes as a community resource.
For example, limited space for processing new acquisitions and virtually nonexistent available shelving space for new items make it difficult to update the collections efficiently or effectively.
Service limitations may be directly tied to National City's identified user needs; however, all limitations affect daily overall library operations.

The outdoor patio consists of space remaining after building expansions, covered with corrugated plastic, making marginal use of the mild, sunny San Diego coastal climate.
Staff space in the basement is so overcrowded that library workers are forced to maneuver storage boxes and bins out of the way to circulate properly through their workspace.
The upstairs staff area is also overcrowded.
Temporary storage boxes and collection materials being processed reduce aisles to 24 inches in several areas.
The functions of the Library's two floors were developed separately, leading to inefficient operations and relationships between departments.
For example, the primary public meeting room is separated from the public restrooms by the Library's technical processing department and the Children's section.
NCPL has devoted maximum effort to providing access to state-of-the-art computers and related technology, such as desktop video cameras enabling users to communicate with staff upstairs.
These amenities are offered from a cramped basement originally intended for storage.
The Friends of the Library (FOL) operate from three separate locations.
This lack of cohesion limits the group's ability to advocate visibly and strongly for improved public literacy.
The entire collection in the Local History Room is separate from the library proper, limiting hours of use and staff efficiency.
Needed services that are currently unavailable include a young adult area with expanded collections, a separate career planning resource area, including materials in foreign languages, and new audio-visual collections.
NCPL does not currently offer books on CD, music CDs or DVDs.
NCPL also needs areas designed, furnished, and decorated specifically for children.
Student (K-8) services needed but unavailable may be derived from the 2001-2002 update to National School District's (NSD) Plan for Library Services.
The District plans to create and implement strategic collection development plans for each school site, especially updating biographies, social studies and science resources, based on a district wide teacher survey.
Collection development will also focus on computer software and hardware acquisitions to supplement school curricula.
The District is particularly interested in using NCPL's video conferencing capabilities to make the technology they already have useful to students.
To that end, it has entered into a Joint Use Cooperative Agreement with NCPL that, in part, will focus on effective use of Shared Electronic Services, including videoconferencing.
Library staffing continues to challenge the District.
NSD has only a part-time Lead Librarian and would very much like to afford a full-time credentialed Librarian.
The District also needs a substitute Library Media Specialist to ensure all 10 school libraries are open and available when personnel are ill.
Staff training and development are an ongoing need.
34 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Detail of Service Limitations of Existing Library a.
Collections National City Public Library (NCPL) is a main City Library fully operated by the City of National City.
The current building totals 22,444 square feet on two stories.
All of NCPL's collections are housed on the main floor, that is, 154,000 items are housed within 17,611 square feet.
At a general estimate of 10 square feet per item, the collection occupies 15,400 square feet of floor space, leaving a mere 2,226 square feet available for general library operations and community meeting space.
The basement level comprises Literacy Services and the Community Computer Center.
The Library's total collection equals 2.8 items per capita.
Books comprise 93% of the total holdings.
Circulation in FY 2000-2001 reached 5.8 per capita.
The number of registered borrowers in 2000-2001 was 29,153, or 54% of the population, showing opportunity to reach an additional 46%.
Collection allocation is shown in the Space Needs Assessment.
Since FY 1998/1999 the Library's overall circulation increased 16% from 274,485 to 318,388.
The collection circulates at five items per capita annually and has the fourth highest circulation per hour (144) of California public libraries serving populations of 40,000 to 60,000.12 Constraints The general collection stacks are 100% full; there is no capacity for additional material.
The Library's floor plan--with its many walls and divided spaces--precludes expanded shelving.
To add needed materials, such as young adult collections, the Library must discard existing collections.
Book stacks layout is confusing, due to the piecemeal expansion of the building since 1954 (see Physical Limitations of the Existing Library).
Videos NCPL has a large and very popular videocassette collection, circulating at 51,000 annually.
The public stacks hold only numbered video cases; staff retrieves customer-requested videos from a room off the main Library floor.
This results in a video collection using double the required space.
Though the library holds 6,000 videos, approximately 1,500 of these are not available to the public because they are not yet processed.
Lack of workspace contributes to this growing backlog.
New videos are stored and actually processed in a closet in the community meeting room, away from main staff work areas (see Staff Offices, below).
It is unlikely that the main public floor could accommodate the 1,500 video backlog collection, once processing is completed.
Local History Room National City's founder, Frank A. Kimball, and his family left a set of 163 leather-bound pocket diaries describing the origins of National City and the concurrent political, agricultural, and social history of the area.
Frank Kimball was personally responsible for extending the Santa Fe Railroad to National City in 1882.
The diaries and other City archival materials are housed in NCPL's Local History Room, and were microfilmed and formally archived in 1997 with a grant from the California State Library under the Federal Library and Services Construction Act Grant.
12 FY 1998-1999 statistics as reported in California State Library Statistics, 2000 35 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Elementary and secondary school students use the Local History Room to complete local history reports.
The collections in the Local History room are oversized, oddly shaped, and/or require special handling.
They include many exhibits of art or historic paraphernalia.
The Library's existing room was built as the Thelma Hollingsworth addition in 1978.
Its location is to the far left of the library entrance at the back wall of the fiction stacks.
Its low visibility and few open hours (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 2:006:00 p.m.) contribute to low use.
Patrons must often return to use the Local History Room during its open hours.
The Local History Room often serves as a supplemental meeting room for Library administration; however, low lighting and lack of modern meeting room amenities (such as audio-visual equipment), as well as the inability to serve refreshments near archival materials, detract from its utility.
Appropriate use of the Local History Room's unique collections must increase to improve cost effectiveness of this 1,545 square-foot room.
Twentieth century local heritage items representing today's ethnic mix in National City must also be incorporated into the Library's collection and aesthetic design to make the City's more recent history relevant to today's population.
Foreign Language The overall foreign language section must be updated to reflect the reading needs of the multi-cultural public.
NCPL has attempted to increase the number of books in Spanish; however, poor overall quality and fewer printings by publishers hinder the ability to meet demand.
Lack of space for collections and impeded technical processing steps contribute to a reduced foreign language collection size.
Children's Collections The children's collection needs more juvenile books in Spanish and more English picture books.
The children's librarians would like to expand the parenting resources.
Latinos comprise 46% of San Diego County children ages zero to five.
The percentage of National City children in this age group is much higher, and many parents of young children speak limited or no English.
Consequently, parenting resource materials in Spanish are badly needed.
b. Readers' Seating NCPL today provides roughly 175 readers' seats and miscellaneous seating, plus 75 stacking chairs in the meeting room.
This number does not include public access computer seating.
There is no programming seating available for the Children's Library, in which the 40 wooden chairs are routinely rearranged for events and after-school programs.
Specific inadequacies include: Study tables are poorly lit and placed in high traffic areas.
Study tables are located toward the center of the building rather than near windows.
Individual study carrels or tutoring areas are non-existent.
Seats, tables, and sofas are not located within sight of staff areas; staff must patrol regularly.
The children's area has improperly sized furniture (adult-size chairs and tables).
The Local History Room has a disproportionately high number of seats for current low levels of use.
NCPL's readers' seating and tables are allocated as follows: 36 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Area Total Adult Reading Areas Children's Room Patio Area Literacy Work Room Learning Center Local History Room Tables Chairs Other (Described) 18 66 7 upholstered lounge chairs 5 42 1 built-in reading nook 3 10 4 benches (capacity 2 per bench) 1 6 6 14 3 18 3 upholstered lounge chairs 1 Microfiche reader 1 Typewriter station Community Computer Center 3 1 sofa Meeting room 75 capacity with audience seating Total 36 161 c. Staff Offices, Workstations, and Visual Supervision Administrative Offices National City's comprehensive City Library employs a staff of 70 full- and part-time workers, with 4.81 full-time equivalent (FTE) American Library Association (ALA) accredited librarians and 5.31 FTE librarians total.
Staff office size has been decreased to make room for materials processing areas and storage space.
Eight work cubicles share one 1,280 square-foot room on the ground floor that also contains the returned books sorting area, all book processing shelves, newspaper back issues and Friends of the Library used books.
In the basement, seven cubicles are squeezed into one 868 square-foot staff area.
Facility limitations negatively impact staff ability to provide streamlined, orderly services throughout the library.
The City Librarian's office on the ground floor shares adjacency with no other staff area, including her own administrative assistant.
The Director must use the telephone or walk to the general work area, a distance of more than 150 feet, to communicate with, supervise, or assist her staff.
Technical Services Just as NCPL has made the most of its public spaces by using every available inch, so it has arranged and rearranged the technical services areas, going so far as to remodel a staff bathroom into a closet for the photocopier.
The critical path of materials through the ordering, receiving, and cataloging process is severely handicapped by the lack of space and shelving in proportion to the volume of work, resulting in significant backlogs.
Critical Path Daily deliveries are made through the staff entrance, where the of counter space behind the cubicle of the City Librarian's Ad always block staff pathways, and must be piled up to move them is conducted in and around staff work cubicles, where every occupied.
Efficient processing requires easy access to supplies are available in the existing work area.
shipping and receiving amenities consist ministrative Assistant.
Delivered boxes out of the way.
All materials processing inch of available space and shelving is and ample workspace, neither of which In 2001, staff cataloged an average of 1,000 books per month for NCPL.
Through NCPL's cooperative contract with National School District, staff processed and cataloged an additional 7,000 books between 37 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library January and March 2001 for the Family Study Teams (FaST) under the three-year State Library English Language Literacy Incentive Grant.
Though this arrangement between NSD and NCPL is extremely positive, the arrival of 2,300 extra books per month for three months severely strains the already loaded system.
To keep the FaST books separate from the general collection, staff lines them along the narrow hallway between the main work area into the community room approximately 20 feet away.
This results in constant rearranging or moving boxes to free the community room for scheduled meetings.
Impediments to Technical Processing The lack of space in the operations area negatively impacts NCPL's customer service by prolonging the time between receiving and shelving the new books and videos.
The current area does not "mirror" the steps of the technical operation by establishing clear and orderly "assembly line" areas.
As a result, the Technical Services Manager relies on mental gymnastics, assisted by sticky notes everywhere to identify piles and shelf areas.
The Library needs larger, more process-efficient workspace to help meet the NCPL's number one customer request for more new books and videos in a timely manner.
WOW Mobile operations The WOW Mobile, one of NCPL's most successful new ventures, presents challenging operational issues.
The vehicle is parked overnight and serviced in the City's public works yard.
Due to site constraints, the closest the WOW Mobile can get to NCPL's facility is on East 12th Street in front of the library, to the west approximately 50 yards away.
To prepare the WOW Mobile for its neighborhood rounds, staff must pack all books and materials into boxes and take them through the community meeting room doors or rear staff delivery doors on dollies or carts.
Supplies The most state-of-the-art library automation systems have not eliminated the need for handling and identifying individual library items, requiring copious types and numbers of supplies.
NCPL staff stores the usual myriad requisite supplies wherever they can, in corners, hallways, and high-traffic staff areas.
The community room holds overflow storage out in the open, as well as in cupboards and closets.
The room houses a large mobile videoconference station and a variety of large boards, boxes, and tables.
Meetings, public or staff, are routinely interrupted when items need to be retrieved from this room.
Alternatively, staff removes the storage items before the meeting, placing it in offices and non-secure hallways.
Multiple storage locations result in non-ergonomic movement and wasted time.
The required tasks need coordinated storage options, facilitating a streamlined system.
Clearly marked work areas and storage also facilitate employee training.
Children's staff stores many craft and programming items in tall cupboards lining the walls in the children's reference corner, with overflow stored openly along the shelves of the community room.
Storage in the children's section is severely compromised by lack of space.
Staff lounge and meeting space 38 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library NCPL's staff lounge and kitchenette measures approximately 160 square feet.
Into this space is squeezed a sofa, a counter, and a small kitchen area with cupboards, and a sink.
The room's refrigerator is located at the opposite end of the room from the kitchen area.
The kitchenette also serves the main community meeting room.
There is virtually no place for staff to be secluded from the administrative area for a snack or meal break.
The presence of more than three people in the lounge at one time necessitates navigation around chairs and legs.
The lounge's window offers a view of the staff parking area and service delivery.
Spontaneous staff meetings, such as to view the architect's conceptual plans for the new library, pack people into the lounge like sardines.
Meetings with more advance planning take place in the Local History room, with its inherent faults, or in the community meeting room, which must be vacated by library open hours.
Visual Supervision Poor sight lines are the rule in the library, mostly due to piecemeal expansion.
It is impossible to supervise the library's public spaces from the main staff office area, due to lack of glass walled areas.
The enclosed patio is visible through windows on two walls; however staff must leave their stations at reference or circulation to check the Library's many hidden areas.
The circulation desk requires continuous staffing and must be constantly monitored by back up staff to determine needs.
This can only be done by physically walking to the area to check.
The sorting shelves for returned materials are out of sight of the circulation desk.
Neither the circulation desk nor the reference desk can view the non-fiction stacks.
Though these stacks are near the City Librarian's office, the office is not a continuously staffed supervisory point.
Supervision from the reference desk is limited.
The reference desk faces into the building, and the primary fiction book stacks are parallel to the desk behind it, completely obscuring patrons from reference staff's sight.
The main online public access catalogs (OPACs) are also behind the reference desk, obscured from view.
In the children's section, separated from the main library, the book stacks are 54" high, obscuring children from view of the children's reference desks.
d. Technology NCPL offers a variety of state-of-the-art technology, including virtual reference and video teleconferencing, both in the main Library and in the Community Computer Center (CCC).
Plans to install much of the technology necessitated a total building re-wiring project in 1996.
The following charts show the current technology infrastructure.

One NCPL Information Technology support technician 2 scanners Technology Constraints National City Public Library (NCPL) has achieved remarkable success as an early provider of patron technology services in spite of a physical facility suffering from age, small size and deferred maintenance.
Several factors severely limit resource availability or unnecessarily increase staff support time and costs.
NCPL's modern technology is installed in an aging building never intended for computers.
Consequently, installing, accessing, and supporting the systems is hindered by less-than-ideal technical infrastructure.
The building's main server and routers are housed in a converted closet directly beneath a water pipe.
The HVAC unit on two occasions in the last year leaked coolant down onto the servers and routers resulting in four full day shut downs of technology services.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The main server room--a retrofitted closet in the community meeting room--is extremely small, increasing maintenance and support difficulty.
The main server room required a supplemental HVAC system that was poorly designed and located, resulting in frequent breakdowns and equipment overheating incidents.
The power to the building is inadequate in capacity and location to support the technology systems.
The horizontal cabling pathways are difficult to access and inadequate to accommodate facility growth, resulting in increased cost for expansion.
Storage and maintenance space for technology services is non-existent.
Computer locations are secondary to the building's original purposes and are not ideal.
The building's slab foundation forced the retrofitted wiring to be installed in the front perimeter walls, which are lined with windows.
These PCs--in the Children's room and near the main fiction book stacks--are lined up against the front wall of windows, exposing the units to too much heat and producing excessive glare, which compromises monitor screen visibility.
Computer workspaces are cramped, with little room for backpacks.
This results in customers' backpacks and other personal belongings blocking the main passage behind chairs when computers are in use.
Computers in the Children's section are for ages 12 and under and have no Internet access.
They provide a variety of CD ROM games, which the children choose from a list and borrow from the Children's desk.
41 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The eight Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) and networked computers in the main library are difficult to supervise.
They also are lined up against a wall of windows, suffering the same overexposure to heat and glare as those in the Children's Room.
There are no options to relocate these computers.
The 50 workstations in the Community Computer Center (CCC) have minimal space between them.
Space for shared use is at a premium.
The constraints in the CCC are further described under Physical Limitations of the Existing Library.
In proportion to the amount of technology NCPL offers, it's ability to provide adequate training space and equipment is severely compromised.
Training rooms consist primarily of small quarters in Literacy Services that house literacy computers and group videoconferencing equipment.
There is no way to divide the CCC into smaller, temporary training rooms so classes may be conducted without disrupting computer users.
e. Meeting Rooms As a community gathering space, NCPL has many drawbacks.
The pieced-together building has no core area to welcome people in and invite them to stay awhile.
The main entrance has no lobby, is confined, and forces the visitor to choose from too many options immediately upon entering the building.
Library-sponsored events and small community groups need formal meeting space designed to accommodate everything from hands-on craft demonstrations to audience seating for lectures.
The NCPL community room is used every open hour of every day.
When not being used for programs or meetings, NCPL staff members borrow the room to store, retrieve, or organize materials.
National City's lively, friendly population must conduct library-related business in a branch-sized (1,160 square feet) meeting room that acts as a hallway between the Children's section and staff kitchen, has no access to public restrooms, holds storage of all types, and provides the only access point for the Library's main technology equipment.
From the main Library, sole public access to the community room is through the Children's section.
The Children's Room has no story time area, so staff must move seats around for programming.
programs with large attendance, NCPL uses the main space in front of the adult periodicals disrupting the entire main floor of the Library.
NCPL's children's programs suffer greatly from the layout and lack of dedicated group space in the children's room, and from lack of appropriately and/or innovative children's seating.
For area, poor sized Regular use by Family Study (FaST) Teams limits the availability of the community room.
Program materials and supplies line the walls.
Currently, the room is booked solid for library purposes such as literacy programs, which severely limits availability for outside groups.
Amenities for the community room consist of the adjacent staff kitchenette, in which very limited refreshments may be prepared and served.
Finally, NCPL has no space for tutors to meet privately with their students; in the Literacy Services Room, tutor-student pairs compete for space and meet within earshot of other tutor-student pairs.
f. Special Purpose Space Special purpose space, defined first as the space occupied by items not considered furniture or equipment, is at a premium at NCPL.
Typically, public library space planning guidelines allocate 10% of total 42 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library assignable square footage to these items.
Over the years since its construction in 1954, NCPL has accumulated many items to improve technical processes or public services that would be considered "special purpose."
These items have necessarily been crowded into the building.
Librarian Campbell creatively converted a restroom into a photocopier room, using it to store reams of paper.
It doubles as a cubby area that staff uses to store personal belongings for which there is no space at their workstations.
As staff has carved out space in this manner, remaining rooms, such as the only staff restrooms on the main floor, have shrunk considerably.
Special purpose space, defined secondly as space for special services or departments, has similarly been carved out of the building's nooks and crannies.
The Literacy Services department stretches along the length of the Community Computer Center's east-west wall, consisting of a succession of rooms culminating in a tiny office.
Constraints on the WOW Mobile service are detailed above.
Friends of the National City Library (FOL) The constraints faced by this group have been documented under Community Organizations.
In general, space inefficiencies greatly hinder the FOL's effectiveness, while simultaneously resulting in loss of precious library space.
Services needed but unavailable Needed services that NCPL is currently unable to offer include a young adult area with expanded collections, a separate career planning resource area, including materials in foreign languages, and new audio-visual collections.
NCPL does not currently offer books on CD, music CDs or DVDs.
NCPL also needs areas designed, furnished, and decorated specifically for children.
Student (K-8) services needed but unavailable may be derived from the 2001-2002 update to National School District's (NSD) Plan for Library Services.
The District plans to create and implement strategic collection development plans for each school site, especially updating biographies, social studies and science resources, based on a district wide teacher survey.
Collection development will also focus on computer software and hardware acquisitions to supplement school curricula.
The District is particularly interested in using NCPL's video conferencing capabilities to make the technology they already have useful to students.
To that end, it has entered into a Joint Use Cooperative Agreement with NCPL that, in part, will focus on effective use of Shared Electronic Services, including videoconferencing.
Library staffing continues to challenge the District.
NSD has only a part-time Lead Librarian and would very much like to afford a full-time credentialed Librarian.
The District also needs a substitute Library Media Specialist to ensure all 10 school libraries are open and available when personnel are ill.
Staff training and development are an ongoing need.
43 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Physical Limitations of Existing Library Facilities Executive Summary NCPL's existing facility provides approximately 22,444 square feet of interior space.
The building's current deteriorated condition, along with the number, type, and condition of additions built over the last 40 years limit the structure's functionality and preclude its renovation as a state-of-the-art library.
During the architect's first public visioning workshop the public was asked their dislikes of the existing library.
Their answers included: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ No window views to the park behind the library.
Main entrance is out of sight of the parking area.
Night lighting is inadequate.
People circulation space is tight with no room to move.
The building is "image challenged" or not recognizable as a library.
Poor way-finding; for example the Community Computer Center is hidden.
Inadequate elevator and no public stairs.
Construction History 1953 1969 Library original building construction completed.
Today, this houses the Children's room, main fiction and non-fiction book stacks, staff workroom, and community room.
Two-story addition added to the south.
Basement space was built as storage; today, the ground floor holds non-fiction book stacks, the City Librarian's office, and two small study rooms filled with FOL books for sale.
One-story addition for the Thelma Hollingsworth Local History Room added to the east.
Public restrooms added (two toilets) and remodeled main entry to the north.
Electrical and telecommunication upgrade for the basement.
1977 1987 1996 Carrier Johnson Architects compiled this synopsis of the building's current condition and limitations for expansion by walking through the facility, interviewing NCPL librarians, and reviewing available architectural drawings of the building.
The following conditions are inadequate, hazardous, ineffective, or inefficient: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Incongruent use of space: at least 50 to 75 people (staff and public) continually occupy the basement, which houses NCPL's Community Computer Center.
The basement was constructed 35 years ago as a storage site not intended for public use and clearly not intended as a computer lab.
Access is marginal and the areas are poorly ventilated.
Lack of a public stairway between floors: public and staff use a 35-year-old single hydraulic elevator that is slow, very small, and badly located.
When the elevator is out of order, the public must walk 580 feet around the building and through the park to the lower level staff door to the outside, creating bottlenecks and hampering work flow.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 44 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Ã¯Â¿Â½ Rampant ADA13 and seismic code non-compliance as a public library: book stack aisles narrower than 36"; tiny public and staff restrooms, and interior door clearance.
Overhead bracing struts attached to book stacks do not meet current seismic requirements.
Lack of structural and functional continuity severely impairs efficient use by both the public and staff.
NCPL has been pieced together over the last 40 years with five separate additions and one wiring upgrade.
Risky computer equipment storage: Main computer server and router are located in a retrofitted closet with a water pipe directly overhead, and inadequate ventilation for equipment.
Inappropriate aesthetics: worn interior finishes and old carpet; no individual study areas, overall dated atmosphere.
Inadequate lighting, resulting in glare and potential damage to Local History Room contents.
Marginally operative heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), resulting in moldy odors, poor ventilation, and temperature fluctuations.
Lack of fire sprinkler system and fire alarm of unknown age.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 13 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 45 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Specific Limitations by Category a.
Structural Original Building 1953 The existing library was erected in 1953 as a one-story building, using non-rated, wood frame construction.
This type of construction is often used for small commercial and residential projects due to lower costs, but is limited in allowable area.
Its structural system is wood bearing walls with slopedwood roof rafters and interior steel columns and beams.
The current condition appears to be "as constructed" and very likely does not conform to current seismic safety codes.
First addition - 1967 In 1967 a non-rated, two-story addition was attached to the existing library's south wall; the upper story is ground level and the lower story is basement.
The lower story was intended for storage and the stairway and elevator were intended for staff-only access to this area.
This addition appears to have no structural modifications or improvements.
Second addition 1977 The second addition, on the east side, offered the public a Local History Room.
It appears to be wood framed, one-story, non-rated construction.
Third addition 1987 The final addition consisted of installing two public restrooms on the north side of the building, immediately adjacent to the main Library entrance.
It also was built as wood framed, non-rated construction on a structural slab.
Although each addition appears to have met code requirements in place at the time, the existing building is a patchwork, without structural continuity.
Each subsequent addition was a "stand-alone" that did nothing to strengthen previous construction.
No visible cracks or apparent structural defects suggest the structural system is failing, but it is very likely the entire structure does not meet current building code specifications.
The existing construction drawings reveal no allowance for 2nd story expansion; therefore any vertical addition would require new foundations, columns, and floor systems.
Enlarging the existing library to accommodate current and new programs would require a complete structural renovation in order to double the size; effectively this is the equivalent of demolishing the structure and re-building.
b. Energy Conservation and Exterior Enclosure The exterior is a combination of painted Concrete Masonry Units (CMU), stucco, and wood siding in varying condition.
Glazing is predominantly single-thickness clear glazing with some single thickness tinted glazing in the east addition.
There is little or no thermal insulation in the original building or the 1967 addition.
Later additions were insulated.
The sliding entry doors offer ease of access but waste energy.
The building envelope and lighting system are very substandard, in terms of meeting the current Title 24 energy conservation code.
Most of the roof areas are sloped with asphalt shingles and appear to be in good condition.
There are no obvious signs of water leakage into the building through the roof, but a musty odor noticeable in some areas suggests that moisture has accumulated in the walls or ceiling construction over time.
46 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library c. Health and Safety Security Library customer and staff security and theft protection is compromised by a variety of factors: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Multiple additions resulting in an abundance of exterior exit doors spread throughout the building, including eight unmonitored emergency exits.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Limited staff sight lines from the circulation desk to the stacks.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Irregular and non-congruous building geometry makes it difficult for staff to monitor patrons.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Unsecured electrical panel in the community computer lab.
The public location of the unsecured electrical panel potentially compromises library operations, service, and overall security, should an unauthorized individual turn off the power.
Interior finishes throughout the facility are significantly worn.
Ceilings, lighting, and public furniture are nearing the end of their useful life.
Some staff workstations and the computer lab furniture are relatively new, but the remainder of staff and public furniture is very worn and potentially hazardous to patron and staff safety.
Flooring in some areas is original vinyl asbestos tile, while in others is relatively new carpeting.
Fire safety is compromised by lengthy successions of rooms in the basement, overly crowded aisles throughout the staff work areas, and use of the only staircase as a storage area.
d. Disabled Access The original basement and first floor restrooms do not meet ADA standards and are too small to adapt.
The newer restrooms are not in compliance with ADA standards but appear to meet the general legislative intent to provide adequate access by removing impediments.
Spacing between stacks throughout the facility does not meet current ADA 36-inch minimum aisle requirements.
Stacks appear original and have overhead bracing struts, which likely do not meet current seismic safety specifications.
Relocation to meet ADA standards should also trigger seismic safety upgrades.
A significant percentage of the stacks are located in the original main library, where the foundation slab--at four inches--is very thin.
This would make seismic safety upgrades difficult and cost-prohibitive.
A number of interior doors do not meet ADA clearance requirements, due to building layout or stack arrangement.
Exterior exit doors have non-complying operating hardware, per current building/fire codes and ADA requirements.
e. Acoustics There is adequate separation between the often-noisy children's area and the "quiet" adult reading areas.
The lower level computer lab is noisy, due to the large number of seats in a small area.
Large areas of single pane glass and sliding entry doors allow street noise into the library.
The community room has no acoustical treatment.
47 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library f. Space Flexibility/Expandability It is not cost-effective to remodel or enlarge the existing building.
Enlarging the existing library to accommodate current and new programs would require complete structural renovation--effectively equivalent to demolition and reconstruction.
g. Functional Spatial Relationships Entry and Circulation desk The building entry area is very small, with approximately five feet between the entry doors and the circulation counter, creating an awkward traffic flow pattern as patrons enter and leave the building.
The staff work area at the circulation counter has adequate space because it originally held a card-based checkout system.
Today, however, staff members waste a lot of movement behind the desk because computer stations are far apart.
Customers address staff from both ends of the long counter; this tends to require extra staff back up.
Reading and Book Stacks An exterior covered court bisects the reading and stack areas.
This configuration makes it difficult to organize the collections logically, creating challenges for both staff and users.
The exterior court is utilitarian, used as a vending area and lounge.
The south wing of the general collection is difficult for staff to monitor due to building geometry, and it has extremely limited natural lighting.
The video collection has expanded so much that approximately one-quarter of it must be stored in the community meeting room closet.
This results in functional conflicts between meeting room users and staff when materials need to be retrieved for patrons.
Children's area The community meeting room is accessed through the Children's area, which disrupts story time and other children's activities when the community room is in use.
Additionally, with community room access restricted to the building interior, use of the meeting room is limited to library hours.
Basement Level The lower level, formerly a storage basement, has been converted into three disunited areas: staff workspace, the Community Computer Center, and Literacy Services.
Literary Services includes an additional small office.
The hallway to the elevator is yet another distinct space; none of the rooms is visible from the others.
Ability to exit the Literacy Services area is marginally adequate.
The building's main electrical distribution panel is located in the small hallway; very inconvenient to staff offices upstairs.
A private staircase links the librarian's office on the ground floor to the downstairs staff area but is not available to the public.
The staircase is currently used as storage space.
There is no public stairway to the lower level from the upper level.
The staff room exit door to the outside is used as an emergency entrance to the lower level when the elevator is out of operation.
This occasional need creates serious logistical issues for the staff, due to bottlenecks and customers walking through office space already crammed with desks and shelving.
The little natural light in this area further reduces the usability of the basement space.
The basement has good emergency exiting capacity but maintaining exit door security is limited by staffing constraints.
Staff cannot control exiting in non-emergency situations, so security is marginal.
48 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The Local History Room The Local History Room, a wing on the building's east side, is located at the rear of the adult fiction collection book stacks, removed from the main entrance out of patron traffic flow.
As staff at the circulation desk or reference desk cannot observe patrons inside the room, NCPL must both hire Local History Room personnel and limit the room's open hours.
The wing is also overcrowded, with overflowing collections.
Archival material is stored in an old photo dark room, which is substandard in overall quality.
The Local History Room appears to have its own mechanical zoning that allows separate control, but the amount of daylight introduced and the orientation and size of the windows creates problems with glare so that ultra violet light threatens the collection.
h. Site Constraints NCPL is located two blocks east of the City's main thoroughfare, National City Boulevard.
It is surrounded by residential neighborhoods to the north and by Kimball Community Park behind it extending to the east.
The City's community center is immediately adjacent on the west.
The building sits atop a hill overlooking Kimball Community Park to the south and east.
Two adjacent community buildings are to the southwest and west.
Site topography, existing building additions, and adjacent structures preclude horizontal growth.
The only option for expanding the existing facility is to build vertically by adding an upper story.
This would require complete demolition and reconstruction, and temporary relocation of the current library, along with attendant operational costs.
After thorough study in May 2001, a library consultant, architect, and information technology consultant team determined this option to be significantly more expensive than constructing a new building on a different site.14 Parking Space for additional parking to support a larger facility is not available at the present location.
There are eight staff parking spaces and 10 public spaces in the existing on-site parking lot.
A small loading area at the rear of the building also serves as the access aisle for employee parking.
It is not possible for staff to get into their parking spaces when vehicles are unloading library materials and/or supplies.
Approximately 50 parking spaces are within 500 feet of the library on surrounding streets, but neighborhood residents use 40-50 percent of these.
Library patrons sometimes use the 46-space parking lot at the community center immediately adjacent to the Library, but spaces are seldom available except after hours.
Community center users also utilize library parking spaces.
An absence of patron complaints over the years may indicate that available parking is adequate.
The existing parking ratio is approximately 0.70 spaces per 1,000 square feet of building for on-site parking, and approximately 1-2 spaces per 1,000 square feet of building for adjacent street parking.
i.
Other Considerations Mechanical The heating/ ventilation/ air conditioning (HVAC) system serving NCPL consists of multiple rooftop air conditioning (AC) units, as well as split-system heat pump units most of which are very old.
The latest HVAC renovation in 1987 included two split-system units for the basement.
Multiple rooftop AC units 14 City of National City Library Building Project Final Report 49 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library manufactured by Lennox serve the library's first floor.
One exception is the Local History Room, which holds antique collections and is served by a dedicated rooftop HVAC unit.
The HVAC equipment is in very poor overall condition.
Deterioration is most evident in the main AC units and the exposed ductwork on the roof, which exhibit significant corrosion.
Due to their age these AC units are not operating at original design capacities and airflows.
The AC unit serving the History Room is in better condition; however, it should also be inspected for deterioration and operational defects.
The two split-system units serving the basement are approaching the end of their normal service life and are in marginal operating condition.
Air distribution throughout the library is inadequate.
The Local History Room has a moldy odor.
The basement and the City Librarian's office, both served by the two split-system AC units, do not receive adequate outside air supply.
In general, significant sections of the library suffer from poor ventilation and lack of good temperature control.
Overall, the existing HVAC system is in marginal physical and operational condition.
It cannot be modified for a major library expansion because: 1.
Existing rooftop units would have to be removed to accommodate vertical expansion.
1.2.
Existing AC units have insufficient capacity for a larger building.
3.
Exposed ductwork on the roof has deteriorated beyond repair.
4.
Existing AC units have deteriorated to the extent that they no longer operate at their original rated heating and cooling capacities.
5.
It does not incorporate the minimum amount of outside air required to ensure proper indoor air quality.
6.
The air distribution control system is inadequate to ensure patron and staff comfort.
7.
Its age and operational condition preclude repair.
8.
It is energy inefficient and therefore costly to operate.
Plumbing and Fire Protection The number and size of public and staff toilet facilities are inadequate for the building's daily use, and they do not meet ADA specifications.
The 1987 restroom addition created two small public restrooms, but the number of fixtures remains substandard for the size of the current building.
Plumbing that supports the mechanical system appears to have reached the end of its service life.
The building has no fire sprinkler system, both a fire code violation and a safety hazard.
Any expansion would require the facility to be retrofitted with sprinklers throughout.
The fire alarm system also appears inadequate and its operational capability is questionable.
Electrical and Telecommunication There is a mechanical unit above the new main distribution frame (MDF) where data equipment is located.
Leaks from overhead piping or the MDF unit itself could ruin the data equipment.
50 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Existing MDF space is inadequate for expansion to accommodate additional required data networking equipment or servers.
The intermediate distribution frame (IDF) data panel located in the mechanical closet in the lower level is inadequately ventilated.
The existing main electrical service equipment is unsecured and located in the basement level exposed to all library personnel and public traffic.
While not in conflict with electrical codes, it is not acceptable practice to locate this equipment in unsecured areas unless in an enclosed, locked cabinet.
The building electrical distribution system appears in good repair.
Recent upgrades included additional circuits for new computer stations, but few branch circuit spaces are available for future computer stations.
Interior lighting fixtures are mostly fluorescent.
Exterior lighting fixtures are in need of replacement.
Exterior lighting levels are very low.
Elevators The existing elevator does not meet the ADA required size (2,500 lbs. versus minimum 3,000 lbs.).
It is marginally operative, breaking often.
Replacement parts are not available.
The basement pump room is poorly isolated acoustically.
Operating noise negatively affects adjacent staff and public areas.
51 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Space Needs Assessment The use of the LibrisDESIGN software, specifically developed for library building programs, facilitated the space assessment process.
As a beta test site librarian for Libris, City Librarian Campbell had worked with software designer Richard Hall in 1998-2000 to create a building program for National City Public Library (NCPL).
Subsequent to the Proposition 14 Needs Assessment process, a Library Building Project Final Report summarized the options for the new building and documented detailed square footage recommendations for each part of the library.
This Library Bond Act Needs Assessment estimates space needs based on formulas used for public library standards recommended by Anders C. Dahlgren (shown below) and by factoring in National City community library service needs.
The final Proposition 14 Building Program, created with LibrisDESIGN and transferred to the updated version of the software during May 2002, documents the building's required detailed final square footage allocations.
Library staff and Carrier Johnson architects worked together closely with the public to allocate the new Library's space for optimal efficiency and effectiveness.
They also incorporated the Joint Venture Project physical requirements into the final Building Program.
Following this Space Needs Assessment, required detailed allocations are attached in the form of LibrisDESIGN reports generated from the National City Public Library Building Program.
Estimated building size and overview of projected space allocation The current building totals 22,444 square feet on two stories.
The proposed building will require two stories and at least double the floor space of the existing library.
To estimate the appropriate size library needed to serve National City, the library consultant used standards from Anders C. Dahlgren, Public Library Space Needs: A planning Outline /1998.
This widely accepted public library space planning method helps planners estimate the general range of space needed for each of six primary categories: 1.
Collections 2.
Reader's seats 3.
Staff offices and workspace 4.
Technology 5.
Meeting rooms 6.
Special purpose space Using Dahlgren's formulas (or variations as applicable) results in the following total estimated square footage required for the new National City Public Library.
These totals are summarized in the chart below and explained in more detail in the pages to follow.

Library Collections The Library's current total collection numbers 154,000 and the total projected collection will be 210,517 books and non-print materials.
This number is based on current usage and budget, taking into account current and projected percentage in circulation.
The total number represents an overall 37% increase in materials.
The existing Library cannot accommodate this growth, primarily because of the number of immovable interior walls.

Growth is expected in foreign languages, audio-visual, and young adult categories.
NCPL's Library Plan of Service shows the implementation plan designed to achieve the full projected collection.
(3) Summary of all projected collections The collection allocation is shown in the above chart and also in the attached report "Allocation of the Library's Book Collection."
Libris software was used to project all collection space needs for the new building.
The following chart shows the volumes per linear foot (on 36" wide shelving sections) for each format.
Type Adult Fiction/Non Fiction/YA Reference Children's/Juvenile Fiction Juvenile Fiction and Non-fiction Magazines, Newspapers Multimedia Local History Collection Reference (override) Local History Collection (override) Number per linear foot 8 6 20 13 1 10-25 2 3 Generally speaking, book stack shelving in NCPL's LibrisDESIGN is allocated at 15 square feet per single face unit and 18 square feet per double face unit, resulting in a minimum of 36" aisles between book stacks.
(4) Chart showing calculations used to calculate estimated space needs Using a guideline of 10 square feet per volume, and shelving 80% of the collection at any one time, the Library can assume an estimated 16,800 assignable square feet for the collection: 210,000 x .80 = 168,000 168,000 divided by 10 = 16,800 The final Allocation of the Library's Book Collection is included in the Library Building Program, "Shelving The Library's Collection."
Actual assignable square footage required to shelve the collection is 13,920 square feet. b. Readers' Seating (1)(1) Projected numbers, types, allocations, and calculations Of the existing library's approximately 170 reader's seats, 43 are located in special use areas, such as Literacy Services and the Local History Room.
Thus, they are not accessible in the main library reading areas.
Furthermore, all library seating doubles as programming seating.
54 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The new Library will have approximately 220 readers' seats, distributed more effectively among departments and adding young adult seating.
Community meeting room seating will also be more effectively allocated among four main meeting areas (see Meeting Rooms, below).
Actual allocation is shown attached under "Allocation of the Library's Reader's Seats."
(2) Standards used to determine amount of seating Dahlgren's recommendation of three seats per 1000 users served in populations of 50,000 users determined the estimated seating required, results in an approximate requirement of 169 seats.
56,400 divided by 1000 = 56.4 56.4 x 3 =169 Assigning an average conversion factor of 30 square feet per seat results in a estimated required 5,100 square feet.
(2)(3) Conversion factors National City Public Library used standard square footage allocated by the LibrisDESIGN program, as shown in the following chart: Type of seating Lounge chair Reader's chair Task chair Child's lounge chair Sofa (2 seat) Juvenile chair Juvenile lounge chair Reader's wood carrel Coffee table Group study table with chairs Assigned square footage 35 20-25 Depends on function 20 55 20 25 40 50 120-145 NCPL has a high volume of in-library use.
The Building Program actually allocates approximately 220 reader's seats, an increase of 26%.
Actual assigned square footage required for reader's seating is 5,747 square feet. c. Technology (1) Number and types of technology equipment required Public access computers NCPL currently offers approximately 71 computers Community Computer Center, which will transfer to of approximately one computer for every 20 visits, should offer at least 40 computers in the main library, for public use, including the 50 computers in the the new library.
Using Dahlgren's recommendation with an average daily visitor count of 800, NCPL plus the 50 Community Computer Center.
55 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The library's detailed technology plan in the Library Plan of Service lists all required technology equipment.
The LibrisDESIGN report, "Allocation of the Library's Technology," below, details the equipment's conversion to square footage.
That report includes some staff technology; however this space assessment includes staff technology under Staff Offices and Workstations, below.
(2) Dahlgren recommends allocating 50 square feet per computer workstation to estimate assignable square footage.
LibrisDESIGN typically allocates 45 square feet per computer workstation.
As computer terminals, especially networked computers, are getting smaller and more portable, this space assessment estimates 45 square feet per workstation.
90 public technology stations x 45 = 4,050 assignable square feet.
Actual technology assignable square footage in NCPL's Building Program totals 5,469, which includes some staff workspace square footage. d. Staff offices and workstations (1) Projected staff organization The existing NCPL staff organization will transfer to the new building.
Staff structure is detailed in the Library Plan of Service, Staffing.
(2) Number of workstations required and (3) calculations and conversions all assigned to computers not of Service and estimate staff NCPL will require approximately 35 individual workstations (functional workstations, not employees) to fully operate the new library.
Many of these workstations include room for included under Technology.
Staff proposed allocations are detailed in the Library Plan Technology Plan.
Dahlgren recommends a conversion factor of 150 square feet to workspace needs.
35 workstations x 150 square feet = 5,250 square feet.
Actual NCPL Library Building Program allocation of staff workspace is shown below under "Allocation of the Library's Staff Workspace."
Total assignable square footage required is 5,469 square feet. e. Meeting room requirements (1) Number and capacity of meeting rooms proposed: To remedy the lack of space for the many and varied NCPL programs, the new library should allocate meeting rooms as follows: General public meeting space Children's programming space Literacy Services (distance learning and literacy instruction) NCPL's public these programs General public and equipment meeting space will continue to focus on library-specific events and programming.
All of require appropriate space and dÃ¯Â¿Â½cor to reach their full potential as community services.
meeting space should accommodate approximately 120 people, plus kitchenette amenities storage.
Children's programming space includes the Joint Venture Project's Family 56 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library Literacy Center, which must accommodate up to 60 children, seated audience style.
In Literacy Services, space should be allocated for computer training and distance learning.
Staff also require a small conference room to plan services and double as tutoring space.
(2) Conversion factors used to determine square footage Dahlgren's recommendations for determining meeting space depend on the type of seating.
General meeting space uses 10 square feet per person, seated in an audience.
At 10 square feet per person, the library should allow 1,200 square feet for a meeting room, plus another 300 for various amenities and storage (total 1,500).
In the Children's Library 60 children at 10 square feet results in 600 square feet of meeting space.
Finally, special use meeting space, such as conference rooms and distance learning rooms, should equal approximately 700).
The estimated required assignable square footage totals 2,800.
NCPL's final Building Program allocates meeting space as shown under the report, "Allocation of the Library's Meeting Rooms."
Total actual allocated square feet for the meeting rooms comes to 2,659.
f. Special purpose: miscellaneous space needs (1) Other use of space and how it supports plan of service National City needs a larger library in part because it has been forced to cram special purpose items such as copiers, recycle bins, technical processing equipment, kitchen supplies, storage cabinets, file cabinets, book trucks, computer repair equipment, and many other critical items into a facility already bursting with library materials and seating.
The new library's special purpose space is being proactively planned into the facility to ensure optimum space for all people and supporting amenities that make a new library effective and attractive for users and staff, alike.
(2) Conversion factors Dahlgren recommends calculating special purpose space at 10% of allocated assignable space.
For the space assessment, the estimated assignable square footage for special purpose space is 3,408 square feet.
National City Public Library's Building Program uses a 10% of assignable space allocation for special use space.
Actual total square footage comes to 3,740 square feet. g. Non-assignable space The Space Needs Assessment assumes a 25% net-to-gross non-assignable square footage, the default used by LibrisDESIGN.
This percentage was not overridden.
National City's Library Building Program did not change this percentage.
This space assessment arrives at a total estimated assignable square footage of 37,488.
At 25% net to gross non-assignable square footage, the total gross building square footage totals 49,984.
41,140 (0.75) = 54,853 gross square feet required 54,853 41,140 = 13,713 non-assignable square feet 57 Community Library Needs Assessment City of National City National City Public Library The final allocation of non-assignable square footage in the Building Program is 12,375.
The Library Bond Act identifies non-assignable space for the "utility areas of a building, including stairways, elevators, corridors and interior walkways, public lobbies, restrooms, duct shafts, mechanical rooms, electrical closets, telecommunications closets for voice, data, electric, security, and fire systems, janitor's closets, fireplaces, interior and exterior wall thickness, and exterior amenities that are part of the building but not enclosed, such as loading docks and covered patios, porches and walkways."
