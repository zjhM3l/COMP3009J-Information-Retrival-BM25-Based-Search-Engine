While bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) does not appear to pose an immediate threat to Nebraska, it underscores our vulnerability to novel, previously unrecognized infectious agents.
The Nebraska death certificate database from 1990 through 1994 has been analyzed to identify decedents with a diagnosis of CJD (ICD9-CM code '046.1').
This diagnosis was sought whether the disease was cited as the cause of death, a contributing cause of death, or an underlying illness that was neither the cause nor a contributing cause of death.
The review identified 10 individuals with this diagnosis during this five-year period, for a statewide mortality rate of 1.2 per million per year.
A similar review of the Nebraska hospital discharge database which includes Nebraska hospital discharge data for a 12-month period from May 1994, through April 1995, identified one person with CJD.
No additional information is currently available on these people.
The average age of the people identified in the analysis of the Nebraska death certificate and the hospital discharge databases was 72 years (range, 58-88).
Veterinarians and physicians need to be aware of the manifestations of this disease, consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients and cattle with neurologic symptoms consistent with BSE/CJD, and pursue diagnostic tests that firmly establish the presence or absence of the disease in their patients or animals.
The Nebraska Health and Human Services System will continue to update the physician and veterinary communities of developments in this area.

There are different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of BSE.
The epidemiologic data suggests that BSE in England may have been caused by feeding cattle rendered protein produced from the carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- March 25, 1996 In 1990, the government of Great Britain established the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) to provide scientifically based advice on the implications for animal and human health of different forms of spongiform encephalopathy, including specifically Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.
Also in 1990, the government of Great Britain re-instituted active epidemiologic surveillance studies of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) with the specific aim of detecting possible changes in the epidemiological or clinicopathological features of CJD should this occur as a result of the theoretically possible transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to the human population.
On March 20, 1996, SEAC, which consists of non-government experts in neurology, epidemiology, and microbiology; advised the government of Great Britain that it had become concerned about 10 cases of CJD that might be linked to the BSE outbreak, although it also reported that there was no direct evidence for such a link.
These cases had been identified through national surveillance and had occurred over no more than a two year period.
The basis for the Committee's concern was: 1.
the group of 10 CJD patients were younger than normal; they ranged in age from the late teens to the early 40s; 2.
the CJD neuropathology in these patients appeared distinguishable from that observed in other CJD patients; and 3.
a review of these patients' medical histories, genetic analysis and consideration of other possible causes "failed to explain these cases adequately."
The data was preliminary.

Questions and Answers regarding Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Great Britain and Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease in the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- March 25, 1996
What is BSE? BSE is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle which results from infection by an unconventional transmissible agent.
During the period from November 1986, (when BSE was first identified as a separate disease entity) until December 1995, an estimated 155,600 head of cattle in almost 33,000 herds were diagnosed with BSE in Great Britain.
The epidemic peaked in January 1993, at almost 1,000 new cases per week.
Currently fewer than 300 cases are occurring per week.
The epizootic may have resulted from the feeding of scrapie-containing sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle, but was probably amplified later by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.
The nature of the transmissible agent is unknown but currently the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal cell surface component known as the prion protein, a pathogenic form of the protein that is both less soluble and more resistant to enzyme degradation than the normal form.
Is BSE occurring in the United States? As of December 1995, nearly 2,660 specimens from 43 States had been received by an ongoing BSE surveillance system in the United States and no evidence of BSE was seen.
Further to prevent BSE from entering the United States, severe restrictions exist for the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from countries where BSE is known to exist.
Is BSE a food borne hazard in the United States? As indicated above, BSE has not been shown to exist in the United States.
Thus it is extremely unlikely that BSE would be a food borne hazard in this country.
Is BSE a food borne hazard in Great Britain? The statement today from SEAC indicates that this committee is concerned that before 1989, when a ban was placed on the practice of feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves, that BSE may have been a food borne hazard in Great Britain.
It is this possible hazard that SEAC indicates may account for the 10 unusual cases of CJD in Great Britain described above.
If indeed this hazard did exist, the control measures already instituted in Great Britain would have greatly reduced that risk today.
Because of the SEAC statement, BSE control measures in Great Britain are being tightened even further.
Milk and milk products are unlikely to pose any risk for human exposure to the BSE agent.
Is there any monitoring of the incidence of CJD in the United States? Yes.
Although there is no direct evidence that BSE can spread to humans, this theoretical possibility has focused increased attention on the desirability of national CJD surveillance.
Today, CDC monitors the trends and current incidence of CJD in the United States by analyzing death certificate information from US multiple-cause-of-death mortality data, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC.
These data indicate that the annual CJD mortality rates in the United States between 1979 and 1992, have been relatively stable ranging between only 0.8 cases per million in both 1979 and 1990, and 1.1 cases per million in 1987.
These relatively stable overall rates for over a decade and the consistently very low rates in the population under 50 years old provide baselines that would make it possible to detect unusual national increases in the number of CJD deaths, particularly if they occurred in people under 50 years old.

BSE Fact Sheet
USDA, APHIS, Veterinary Services -- March 1996
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a chronic degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle.
The disease was first diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain.
The British sometimes call BSE "mad cow disease," a term that could be confused with rabies in cattle if used in the United States.
BSE has had a substantial impact on the British livestock industry.
The disease also has been confirmed in domestic cattle in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland and in cattle exported from England to Oman, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is enforcing import restrictions and is conducting surveillance for BSE to ensure that this serious disease does not become established in the United States.
Clinical Signs Cattle affected by BSE experience a progressive degeneration of the nervous system.
Affected animals may display changes in temperament, such as nervousness or aggression; abnormal posture; incoordination and difficulty in rising; decreased milk production; or loss of body weight despite continued appetite.
Affected cattle die.
The causative agent of the disease is not completely characterized, and there is no treatment.
The incubation period (the time from when an animal becomes infected until it first shows disease signs) is from 2 to 8 years.
Following the onset of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until it either dies or is destroyed.
This usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months.
Most cases in England have occurred in dairy cows between 3 and 5 years of age.
Currently, there is no test to detect the disease in a live animal; veterinary pathologists confirm BSE by postmortem microscopic examination of brain tissue.
BSE is so named because of the spongy appearance of the brain tissue of infected cattle when sections are examined under a microscope.
Related Diseases BSE is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).
TSE's are caused by similar uncharacterized agents that produce spongiform changes in the brain.
Specific types of TSE's include: * scrapie, which affects sheep and goats; * transmissible mink encephalopathy; * feline spongiform encephalopathy; * chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk; and * kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome -- three rare diseases in humans.
Other cases of spongiform encephalopathies have been reported in Great Britain in kudus, an eland, a nyala, and a gemsbok.
Although there is no direct evidence of a link between BSE and CJD, the evaluation of 10 CJD cases in Great Britain identified a new variant of this disease.
The most likely explanation at present is that these cases may be linked to exposure to BSE before the 1989 introduction of the specified bovine offal (SBO) ban in 1989.
The SBO ban excluded brain, spinal cord, and other organs with potential BSE infectivity from human consumption.
Because of growing public concern about BSE, USDA epidemiologists are carefully monitoring all new scientific data about TSE's from around the world.
Epidemiology
There are different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of BSE.
The epidemiologic data suggests that BSE in England may have been caused by feeding cattle rendered protein produced from the carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep.
An alternate theory is that BSE had existed in undetectable levels in the British cattle population prior to 1986.
The practice of using products such as meat and bonemeal in cattle rations as a source of protein has been common for several decades.
Scrapie has a long incubation period -- up to 60 months -- and has been endemic in Great Britain for centuries.
Changes in rendering operations in the early 1980's -- particularly the removal of a solvent-extraction process that included a steam-heat treatment -- may have played a part in the appearance of the disease and the large number of cases that developed.
There is no evidence that BSE spreads from unrelated cattle to cattle or from cattle to other species by contact.
Epidemiologic evidence suggests that maternal transmission is rare if it occurs at all.
The extremely small infectious agent responsible for BSE and scrapie, although not completely characterized, has been theoretically classified as a "slow virus," a "prion," or a "virino."
This agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization processes.
It also does not evoke a detectable immune response or inflammatory reaction in host animals.
The BSE agent has been found only in brain tissue and the spinal cords of cattle naturally affected with BSE.
In an experimental study of the disease's biological route of development in cattle, traces of the BSE agent were detected in the small intestines and retina of calves that had been fed large doses of material from BSE-infected animals.
Evaluation of the presence of the BSE agent in tissues is complicated by the lack of a definitive laboratory test.
Failure to identify the agent in tissues may indicate either a true absence of the agent or simply a decreased sensitivity of current diagnostic methods.
History
During the period from November 1986 (when BSE was first identified as a separate disease entity) until December 1995, an estimated 155,600 head of cattle in almost 33,000 herds were diagnosed with BSE in Great Britain.
The epidemic peaked in January 1993, at almost 1,000 new cases per week.
Agricultural officials in Great Britain have taken a series of actions to eradicate BSE, including making BSE a notifiable disease, prohibiting the inclusion of ruminant-derived proteins in ruminant feed, and destroying all animals showing signs of BSE.
As a result of these actions, the rate of newly reported cases of BSE is decreasing.
Currently, fewer than 300 cases are occurring per week.
USDA Actions in Response to BSE To prevent BSE from entering the United States, APHIS has restricted the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from countries where BSE is known to exist.
Other products derived from ruminants, such as fetal bovine serum, bonemeal, meat and bonemeal, bloodmeal, offal, fats, and glands, also cannot be imported into the United States from these countries, except under a special permit for scientific research purposes.
As part of increased surveillance for BSE, APHIS veterinarians are tracing 499 head of cattle imported from Great Britain between 1981 and 1989 (before the ban on imports went into effect) to check their health status.
As of January 1995, 464 of the animals had been accounted for, and no signs of BSE had been found.
Efforts continue to trace the 35 remaining cattle.
In addition to international importation restrictions, APHIS has increased surveillance efforts to detect BSE if it is accidentally introduced into the United States.
More than 250 APHIS and state veterinarians specially trained to diagnose foreign animal diseases regularly conduct field investigations of suspicious disease conditions.
APHIS veterinary pathologists and field investigators also have received training from their British counterparts for diagnosing BSE.
These pathologists examine brain tissue from cattle over two years of age that show signs of neurological disease.
APHIS leads an interagency effort to coordinate surveillance for BSE.
Officials of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service notify APHIS of cattle exhibiting neurological signs at slaughter.
State diagnostic laboratories and public health officials also submit the brains of rabies-negative cattle to National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for testing.
More than 60 veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United States are participating in the BSE Surveillance Program along with NVSL.
As of December 1995, nearly 2,660 specimens from 43 States had been received, and no evidence of BSE had been seen.
Getting the Word Out As part of the increased surveillance activities, APHIS is continuing an education effort to inform U.S. cattle producers and veterinarians about this new disease.
Numerous briefings have been held for industry groups.
In addition to press releases and fact sheets, a British videotape on BSE and an information packet were distributed to all APHIS field offices, State veterinarians, extension veterinarians, colleges of veterinary medicine, and industry groups.
