Comment: Raise the driving age to 18... we pay taxes for school buses; why should we subsidize, in terms of every 16 year old's desire to drive, the excess pressure on our transportation systems, not to mention emissions.
Not to mention, they are the most dangerous drivers on the road.

Comment: Two ideas: 1) Give companies financial incentives to encourage telecommuting.
2) Limit access to the freeway for single passenger cars during rush hour to those people who have lived here the longest.
Since all of the on-ramps have traffic lights on them why not combine that with limits to who can drive when.
Basically limit the freeway during part of the peak rush hour to people who have lived here over 10 years.
People less than five years can't drive during one hour of rush hour unless they pay a small fee that will be mailed to them.
Use a camera on the on-ramp to get their license and bill them.
They already use bar codes on the express lanes in California so this is very easy to do.
People who have lived here less than two years can't drive during rush hour without a larger fee to encourage them to pay for the transportation they are requiring.
I realize that people will be upset or cheat, but the people who paid for the roads should be allowed to use them first and companies should be required to pay for the increased cost of congestion if they want to build in areas that don't have the means to get their workers to work.
Just as an aside, most women don't want mass transit.
It's not safe for us to ride at night and it rarely makes the cross town trips we need.

Comment: I recently reviewed the article in the Madison Park Times regarding the Trans-Lake project.
It mentions the intention of building a tunnel under MadisonPark/Madronna.
I have read lots of correspondence from the Trans-Lake Project and never once do I remember that as a alternative nor allusion to that in any previous articles.
Please let it be known to you that everyone I know in this community and I will fight you vigorously if you have any plans to disrupt our neighborhood further with such a horrendous assault on the quality of our and our children's lives.
We already bear the brunt of much of the Trans-Lake traffic problems.

Comment: While reviewing the various plans for the SR 520 bridge it occurred to me that there is a much cheaper solution (and speedier): Use the money to double the bus service and make more lanes bus only... i.
Then middle of the I-90 bridge should be buss only (or rubber wheel rail) ii. Faster busses means that more trips can be made per bus... saving money.
iii. Mercer Island needs to have more frequent bus service and perhaps the xx people who live there require nicer bus stops to encourage them. iv.
There ought to be a program wherein residents can easily get permits and perhaps building materials to design and build nice buss stops! v.
The 520 bridge should eventually have two of its four lanes converted to bus only. vi.
It has been demonstrated in cities all over the world that more lanes only bring more traffic and discourage bus usage.
Furthermore more lanes will encourage more sprawl. vii. Seattle has become very polluted in just the past ten years!!! The future is not with more SOVs...
The U district and downtown are already over flooded with traffic from 520 and 90...
If cars come off of those bridges in greater floods the city streets and residential areas will become even more clogged with commuters.
viii.
A light weight wooden bridge for bikes could be attached to the south side of the bridge.
Cheap and fast.

Comment: Dear Sir/Madam: Your writer, a retired CPA, attended the March 6, 2001, open house at the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle, also have read the comments published regarding the rush hour crossing of Lake Washington.
A number of the alternatives being considered seem to have some validity, though an additional bridge between SR 520 and I-90 is NOT wanted, nor one north of SR 520.
Your writer became an avid bus rider in the 1973/74 gas shortage.
My viewpoint is traffic congestion should be alleviated by moving people, not vehicles.
Roadway congestion may be impossible to relieve; however, moving people other than roadway will provide relief to those using such an alternative.
Passenger vessels may be an answer, they substituting bus travel.
The recent study of the Kirkland-U of WA passenger vessel was totally impractical in recommending catamaran vessels of 49 and/or 149 capacity with three crew members on each, this too high a labor application for such capacities.
A visit to the U.S. Coast Guard gives the manning requirements for Small Passenger Vessels (SPV) (Under 100 GT).
The crew reduction is made by maintaining one passenger level.
The enclosed sheets give the regulations, also some nautical terminology.
Please obtain some passenger vessel potential, this requiring naval architects.
Simple type vessels should be capable of direct across Lake WA routes, the Kirkland-U of WA route being some four miles of open lake and about two miles of 7 knot speed from the U of WA to higher speed area.
Yours very truly, [signature] [inserted nautical and Small Passenger Vessel information- 3 pages]
You know the bus #3358 East to Mercer Island Bellevue.
I was born March 6, 1958 Providence Hospital, Seattle Washington.
If you thought getting to the moon was tough try crossing Lake Washington during rush hour.
As you know, I am a temp Labor Ready, 6 years and I travel all over Washington on Job Assignments.
I help build saddle back park Newport, Bellevue and worked on buildings in Mercer Island and Bellevue.
I feel proud to be able to travel the State of Washington and construct the Emerald City.

Comment: To address the traffic problem will clearly require using multiple approaches including demand-management and land-use strategies.
But to replace the existing bridge without adding one general purpose and one HOV lane in each direction (plus a bike lane) seems very shortsighted.
Anything less than four lanes in each direction won't even address the current traffic volumes, let alone allow for future increases.

Comment: I agree with most of what has been said so far, but I think the people living next to 520 on both sides of the lake will have to put up with some noise unless an I-90 Mercer Island type lid is added Â­ too expensive? My suggestions: Add one general purpose and one HOV lane in each direction.
Trains are too expensive and inflexible Â­ use buses, you can add more or change routes as demand changes.
