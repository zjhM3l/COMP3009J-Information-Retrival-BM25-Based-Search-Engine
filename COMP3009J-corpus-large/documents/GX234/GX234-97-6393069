Science Science is a way of making sense of the natural world.
Scientists seek to describe its complexity, to explain its systems and events, and to find the patterns that allow for predictions.
Science is the basis for the design of technologies that solve real-world problems.
Not all students will become scientists or engineers.
But science and technology occupy ever-expanding places in our everyday lives.
As citizens, we are asked to make decisions about social issues that involve science and technology.
As workers, we have occupations that increasingly involve science and technology.
In the 21st century, adults will need to be comfortable and competent in a complex, scientific and technological world.
Schools have the responsibility of preparing students for the future.
Schools must prepare all students -- regardless of their future aspirations -- to be scientifically literate.
Therefore, all graduates of our schools should be: knowledgable about the important concepts and theories of the three major branches of scientific study: earth, life, and physical sciences; able to think scientifically and use scientific knowledge to make decisions about realÂ­world problems; able to construct new knowledge for themselves through research, reading, and discussion; familiar with the natural world, and respectful of its unity, diversity, and fragility; able to make informed judgments on statements and debates claiming to have a scientific basis; and, able to reflect in an informed way on the role of science in human affairs.
To make this happen, education needs to: 1.
emphasize understanding, not content coverage; 2.
promote learning that is useful and relevant; 3.
emphasize scientific literacy for ALL students; and, 4.
promote interdisciplinary learning.
The "Michigan Content Standards and Benchmarks" describe three broad categories of activities that are common in scientifically literate individuals: using scientific knowledge; constructing new scientific knowledge, and reflecting on scientific knowledge.
The content strands are directly related to these types of activities.
Vision Statement
Overview of the Science Content Strands Strand I. Constructing New Scientific Knowledge Scientifically literate students are learners as well as users of knowledge.
With scientific literacy comes the ability to ask questions about the world that can be answered by using scientific knowledge and techniques.
Scientifically literate students can also develop solutions to problems that they encounter or questions they ask.
In developing solutions, scientifically literate students may use their own knowledge and reasoning abilities, seek out additional knowledge from other sources, and engage in empirical investigations of the real world.
They can learn by interpreting text, graphs, tables, pictures, or other representations of scientific knowledge.
Finally, scientifically literate students can remember key points and use sources of information to reconstruct previously learned knowledge, rather than try to remember every detail of what they study.
Standard I.1 Constructing New Scientific Knowledge All students will ask questions that help them learn about the world; design and conduct investigations using appropriate methodology and technology; learn from books and other sources of information; communicate their findings using appropriate technology; and reconstruct previously learned knowledge.
There is one standard under Constructing New Scientific Knowledge.
This standard incorporates the ways that scientists and individuals investigate and learn about the world.
Strand II.
Reflecting on Scientific Knowledge Scientifically literate students can also "step back" and analyze or reflect on their own knowledge.
One important type of analysis is the justification of personal knowledge or beliefs using either theoretically or empirically based arguments.
Scientifically literate students can also show an appreciation for scientific knowledge and the patterns that it reveals in the world; this often involves seeing connections among different areas of knowledge.
They may be able to take a historical and cultural perspective on concepts and theories or to discuss institutional relationships among science, technology, and society.
Finally, scientifically literate students can describe the limitations of their own knowledge and scientific knowledge in general.
Standard II.1 Reflecting on Scientific Knowledge All students will analyze claims for their scientific merit and explain how scientists decide what constitutes scientific knowledge; how science is related to other ways of knowing; how science and technology affect our society; and how people of diverse cultures have contributed to and influenced developments in science.
There is one standard under Reflecting on Scientific Knowledge.
This standard incorporates the nature of the
scientific enterprise, its strengths, limitations, and connections to other ways of knowing.
Strand III.
Using Scientific Knowledge in Life Science Scientifically literate students and adults can use their knowledge to understand the world around them and to guide their actions.
Important types of activities that use scientific knowledge include description and explanation of real-world objects, systems, or events; prediction of future events or observations; and the design of systems or courses of action that enable people to adapt to and modify the world around them.
In the life sciences, real-world contexts in which scientifically literate people use knowledge are often described in terms of systems and subsystems, such as cells, organisms, and ecosystems.
There are five standards under Using Scientific Knowledge in Life Science: Standard III.1 Cells All students will apply an understanding of cells to the functioning of multicellular organisms; and explain how cells grow, develop and reproduce.
Cells are the basic living unit of which all organisms are composed.
Standard III.2 The Organization of Living Things All students will use classification systems to describe groups of living things; compare and contrast differences in the life cycles of living things; investigate and explain how living things obtain and use energy; and analyze how parts of living things are adapted to carry out specific functions.
Organization of living things occurs both across species (as in taxonomic organizations) and within organisms (their structures and processes).
Standard III.3 Heredity All students will investigate and explain how characteristics of living things are passed on through generations; explain why organisms within a species are different from one another; and explain how new traits can be established by changing or manipulating genes.
Heredity is the means by which traits are transmitted from one generation to the next.
Standard III.4 Evolution All students will explain how scientists construct and scientifically test theories concerning the origin of life and evolution of species; compare ways that living organisms are adapted (suited) to survive and reproduce in their environments; and analyze how species change through time.
Evolution explains the diversity of living things and the changes seen in them over time.
Standard III.5 Ecosystems All students will explain how parts of an ecosystem are related and how they interact; explain how energy is distributed to living things in an ecosystem; investigate and explain how communities of living things change over a period of time; describe how materials cycle through an ecosystem and get reused in the environment; and analyze how humans and the environment interact.
It is within ecosystems that communities of living things interact.
Strand IV.
Using Scientific Knowledge in Physical Science In the physical sciences, the specification of real-world contexts often focuses on phenomena, such as motion, electromagnetic interactions, or physical, chemical, and nuclear changes in matter.
Four standards are under the broad heading of Using Scientific Knowledge in Physical Science: Standard IV.1 Matter and Energy All students will measure and describe the things around us; explain what the world around us is made of; identify and describe forms of energy; and explain how electricity and magnetism interact with matter.
Matter and energy are the fundamental entities of the physical universe.
Standard IV.2 Changes in Matter All students will investigate, describe and analyze ways in which matter changes; describe how living things and human technology change matter and transform energy; explain how visible changes in matter are related to atoms and molecules; and how changes in matter are related to changes in energy.
Physical, chemical, and nuclear interactions of matter and energy bring about all of the changes we observe in the physical world.
Standard IV.3 Motion of Objects All students will describe how things around us move and explain why things move as they do; demonstrate and explain how we control the motions of objects; and relate motion to energy and energy conversions.
Motion of objects is accounted for by gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear forces.
Standard IV.4 Waves and Vibrations All students will describe sounds and sound waves; explain shadows, color, and other light phenomena; measure and describe vibrations and waves; and explain how waves and vibrations transfer energy.
Sound, light, and electromagnetic waves are the means by which energy and information are propagated.
Strand V. Using Scientific Knowledge in Earth Science In the earth sciences, real-world contexts are often described in terms of systems and subsystems, such as atmospheric systems, crustal systems, solar systems, or galaxies, which are useful in explaining phenomena, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, thunderstorms, and eclipses.
Four standards are under the broad heading of Using Scientific Knowledge in Earth Science: Standard V.1 The Geosphere All students will describe the earth's surface; describe and explain how the earth's features change over time; and analyze effects of technology on the earth's surface and resources.
The geosphere includes earth's surface and geological processes.
Standard V.2 The Hydrosphere All students will demonstrate where water is found on earth; describe the characteristics of water and how water moves; and analyze the interaction of human activities with the hydrosphere.
The Hydrosphere includes all forms of water.
Of particular interest in Michigan is the water environment in the Great Lakes region.
Standard V.3 The Atmosphere and Weather All students will investigate and describe what makes up weather and how it changes from day to day, from season to season and over long periods of time; explain what causes different kinds of weather; and analyze the relationships between human activities and the atmosphere.
Weather is composed of patterns of moisture, temperature and pressure which move through the atmosphere.
Standard V.4 The Solar System, Galaxy and Universe All students will compare and contrast our planet and sun to other planets and star systems; describe and explain how objects in the solar system move; explain scientific theories as to the origin of the solar system; and explain how we learn about the universe.
We learn about neighboring and remote celestial bodies through our observations and exploration of space.
Note: Essays associated with each of these standards can be found in the 1991 publication Michigan Essential Goals and Objectives for Science Education, available from The Center for Career and Technical Education at Michigan State University, (800) 292-1606.
Each essay describes how learners encounter the standard in real-world contexts, key characteristics of scientifically literate performance of the standard, and how, with successful teaching, learners' performance of the standard becomes more sophisticated over time.
