Colorado State Flag Department of Law line graphic __________________________________________________________________ December 14, 2001 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WARN OF GIFTING PROGRAM PYRAMID SCHEMES Attorney General Ken Salazar, 10th Judicial District Attorney Gus Sandstrom, 11th Judicial District Attorney Ed Rodgers, Canon City Police Chief Martin Stefanic, Florence Police Chief Mike Ingle, Fremont County Sheriff Ivan Middlemiss, Salida Police Chief Darwin Hibbs, and Chaffee County Sheriff Ron Bergman today issued an alert to consumers warning them to be wary of pyramid schemes being promoted as "gifting programs" among Pueblo, Fremont and Chaffee County communities.
Pyramid schemes are illegal in Colorado.
Today's alert is based upon information that Pueblo, Fremont and Chaffee County law enforcement agencies in the area are receiving that alleged pyramid schemes are being promoted in the three counties.
These schemes use various names such as "Women Empowering Women", "Private Gifting", "Gift Givers", "The Original Dinner Party", "Garden Club", and similar names.
Similar pyramid schemes promoted as "gifting programs" have arisen in other Colorado counties, including the Western Slope and the Boulder County area.
Last year Attorney General Salazar and the Mesa, Gunnison, and Boulder County District Attorneys, along with the Sheriffs for Ouray, San Miguel and Mesa Counties jointly issued similar alerts regarding these pyramid schemes.
Additionally, participants in these schemes have falsely represented that the United States Attorney's Office, the 10th and 11th Judicial District Attorney's Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have sanctioned these activities as lawful endeavors.
Citizens are warned that such representations by pyramid scheme promoters are not true.
Under Colorado law, Â§ 6-1-102(9), Colorado Revised Statutes, a pyramid promotional scheme is defined as any program utilizing a pyramid or chain process by which a participant in the program gives valuable consideration in excess of fifty dollars for the opportunity or right to receive compensation or other things of value in return for inducing other persons to become participants for the purpose of gaining new participants in the program.
This means that if you make a payment to a group with the expectation that you will receive money as additional members are recruited into the group, then this conduct constitutes participation in an illegal pyramid scheme, a program which derives its funding primarily from money paid by newly recruited members and not from the actual sale of products or merchandise to individuals outside of the program.
It does not matter that the group is called a "club", or that the payments are called "gifts" or "contributions".
The schemes as reported to local law enforcement appear to fit the classic money chain or pyramid scheme in which there are several levels of participants, with one person at the top.
New members are required to "gift" a certain amount of money to the top person.
The programs do not produce or sell any goods or services-- the only source for the promised payoff for participation is through the requirement of new persons willing to invest.
As law enforcement officials have previously noted, as the pool of potential new investors dries up, later participants will necessarily lose their money.
Anyone who has not previously cashed out will lose their money.
The attorney general has previously noted that these type of investment schemes are illegal in Colorado and the longer they exist the greater the likelihood that a large number of people will lose a lot of money.
Of particular concern is the possibility that some participants in these schemes go into significant debt by obtaining loans and even cash advances from their credit card accounts in order to join.
Â§ 6-1-114, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides that any person who promotes a pyramid scheme commits a class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by up to eighteen (18) months in jail.
The promoters of an illegal pyramid scheme can be subjected to significant civil penalties as well as the previously mentioned criminal penalty.
Promoters and participants can also be subject under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, to civil liabilities to those below them in the scheme, including possible liability for triple damages.
Liability for taxes on the payoffs may also exist.
Anyone with information concerning pyramid schemes should contact their local law enforcement agencies.
