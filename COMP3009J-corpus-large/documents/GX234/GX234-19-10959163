1.
Does Virginia have a "Do Not Call" List?
No.
The Commonwealth of Virginia does not have a state-maintained "Do Not Call" List.
However, Virginia consumers can register for the National Do Not Call Registry created by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Registration for the National Do Not Call Registry is free.
Telemarketers subject to the FTC's jurisdiction will be required to comply with the registry as of October 1, 2003.
They will be required to compare their call lists to the National Do Not Call Registry and remove registered telephone numbers at least once every 90 days.
Consumers should know that not all telemarketers are under the FTC's jurisdiction and subject to its rules.

On June 26, 2003, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved revising its regulations to prohibit telemarketing calls to telephone numbers on the FTC's National Do Not Call Registry.
This revision should cover telemarketing calls made by telephone carriers, banks, and many of the other telemarketers not subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.

Virginians, and other consumers nationwide, can register for the National Do Not Call Registry online by clicking below:

Consumers need an active e-mail address to register online.
Telephone registration for the National Do Not Call Registry first opened to consumers in states west of the Mississippi River on June 27, 2003.
Virginians, and others living east of the Mississippi, can register by telephone beginning on July 7, 2003.
The toll-free telephone registration number is 1-888-382-1222 (TTY 1-866-290-4236).
To register by phone, consumers must call from the number they want to register.
Registration for the National Do Not Call Registry is free.

What other protections against unwanted telemarketing calls do I have under state law?
The Virginia Telephone Privacy Protection Act provides the following protections against unwanted telemarketing calls to Virginians: * prohibits telephone solicitation calls to residences at any time other than between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.; * requires telephone solicitors to identify themselves by first and last name and by the name of the company for which they are calling; * prohibits telephone solicitors from intentionally blocking caller identification services; * prohibits telephone solicitors from calling a telephone number when someone at that number has stated that he or she does not wish to receive solicitation calls by or on behalf of the company for which the call is being made; * permits individuals to sue to enjoin violations, recover damages of $500 for each violation or up to $1,500 for willful violations, and recover their attorney's fees and court costs; * authorizes the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to inquire into possible violations and the Attorney General to issue civil investigative demands; and * authorizes the Attorney General, Commonwealth's Attorneys, and attorneys for any county, city, or town to sue to enjoin violations, recover damages for affected citizens of $500 for each violation, recover a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each willful violation, and recover attorney's fees and expenses.
Attorney General Kilgore has announced that he will propose legislation to the 2004 General Assembly to amend the Virginia Telephone Privacy Protection Act to prohibit telemarketers from calling anyone who has placed his telephone number on the National Do Not Call Registry created by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The legislation will make the National Do Not Call Registry the do not call registry for the Commonwealth.

How do I file a complaint about unwanted telemarketing calls I've been receiving?
The Virginia Telephone Privacy Protection Act (VTPPA) became law on July 1, 2001.
This statute provides important protections to Virginians with respect to unwanted telemarketing calls.
We have prepared a synopsis of the VTPPA as well as a Telemarketing Notepad.
Feel free to copy and reproduce it.
The sheets of the Telemarketing Notepad can be used for recording information about the telemarketing calls you receive and for documenting your requests not to be called again.
If you have requested to be placed on a company's "Do Not Call" list and that company calls you again, you may file a complaint with the Virginia Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA).
OCA serves as a central clearinghouse for the collection, evaluation, investigation or referral of consumer complaints.
OCA's mission is to provide protection to consumers against fraudulent, deceptive and illegal practices in the marketplace.
If OCA has reason to believe a pattern or practice of deception, or other wrongdoing, in violation of our consumer protection statutes -- including the Virginia Telephone Privacy Protection Act -- is occurring, OCA has authority to investigate and refer its findings to this Office or other appropriate governmental offices for a potential enforcement action.
Before it can initiate an inquiry on your behalf, OCA must receive a completed complaint form from you.
Consumers may find out more information about OCA's services and download a complaint form by visiting OCA's Consumer Assistance Portal.
If you have registered for the National Do Not Call Registry created by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), please note that telemarketers subject to the FTC's jurisdiction will not be required to comply with the list until October 1, 2003.
If you registered for the National Do Not Call Registry between June 27 and August 31, 2003, and you receive a telemarketing call after October 1, 2003, you may file a complaint at any time after October 1, 2003.
If you register for the FTC's National Do Not Call Registry AFTER August 31, 2003, it will take three months from the date of registration before telemarketers must stop calling you.
If you receive a telemarketing call three months after you register, you may file a complaint.
Complaints regarding telemarketing calls made to consumers who registered for the National Do Not Call registry can be filed with the FTC by clicking below:

What can I do about all the unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam) I'm receiving?
A) NEVER RESPOND TO SPAM
They say they'll take your name off the list.
What they really want to do is confirm that they've got a live address.
Also, if you respond, they'll sell your address to every other spammer meaning you'll soon be flooded with even more spam.
B) DON'T POST YOUR ADDRESS ON YOUR WEB SITE
It seems like a good idea at the time, but posting your e-mail address on your personal home page is just an invitation to spammers.
Spammers and the people who sell spamming as a business have software that "harvests" e-mail addresses from the Net.
This software crawls through the Internet seeking text strings that are -something-@-something-.-something.
When it finds one, it catalogs it on a database of other e-mail addresses to be used to send spam.
C) USE A SECOND E-MAIL ADDRESS IN NEWS GROUPS
Newsgroups are the great e-mail address gathering ground for spammers.
If you post to a group, you are going to get spam -- it is just a matter of time.
So how are you supposed to participate? Use a different e-mail address than the one you use for talking to friends and relatives.
In other words, have a public address and a private address.
You'll just have to deal with the spam in your public account.
Back to Top
D) DON'T GIVE OUT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW IT WILL BE USED
If a web site is asking for your e-mail address, they want to use it for something.
Be sure you know what.
Read the terms of use and privacy statements of any site before telling them your address.
Ask yourself some simple questions.
Are they going to share or sell my address? Do I want e-mails from this web site? Do I trust them? Is it worth the risk? If you can't answer these questions satisfactorily, and if you can't find their privacy statement, don't give them your address.
E) USE A "SPAM" FILTER
While there is no such thing as a perfect filter, anti-spam software can help keep spam at manageable levels.
Some of it is cumbersome, some works better than others, some even requires that you let your e-mail messages go through another system for storage and cleaning.
But right now, that's the way it works.
F) NEVER BUY ANYTHING ADVERTISED IN SPAM
The reason that people spam is because they can make money.
They make money, like all advertisers, by convincing people to buy a product.
If no one buys the things advertised in spam, companies will stop paying spammers to advertise their products.

G) ASK YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP) TO BLOCK ALL FUTURE E-MAIL FROM THE SENDER
This is an important step that can help you and thousands of other subscribers.
Once an ISP has reason to believe their network is being used to send unlawful unsolicited commercial e-mail, they can block all further e-mail sent to its subscribers from the address or domain name of the sender.
H) CONTACT THE DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION'S E-MAIL PREFERENCE SERVICE (e-MPS)
Consumers are encouraged to contact the Direct Marketing Association's E-Mail Preference Service (e-MPS).
When consumers register through e-MPS, their e-mail address is removed from the marketing lists of DMA members.

What can I do about unsolicited faxes?
Virginia Code Â§ 8.01-40.2 regulates unsolicited transmission of advertising materials by facsimile machine.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules prohibit sending unsolicited advertisements, also known as "junk faxes," to a fax machine.
This prohibition applies to fax machines at both businesses and residences.
Get Consumer Facts from the FCC concerning unsolicited faxes.
Consumers who have received unsolicited faxes are encouraged to contact the FCC regarding the incident(s).
You may need to provide documentation in support of your complaint, such as copies of the fax(es) you received.
You can file a complaint about unsolicited faxes by completing the FCC's on-line Consumer Complaint Form or by calling or writing:
FCC Consumer Center: 1-888-CALL-FCC (1-888-225-5322) TTY: 1-888-TELL-FCC (1-888-835-5322)
Federal Communications Commission Consumer 
You may also wish to consult with a private attorney to discuss your options.
If you find that you need to consult with an attorney familiar with this area of the law, you may contact the Virginia Lawyer Referral Service, sponsored by the Virginia State Bar (VSB).

What do I do if I have received a suspicious e-mail (such as FROM Nigeria or Lagos)?
Letters and e-mails, like the one you received, are often referred to as "Nigerian Scam" letters or "419" letters after the Nigerian statute that makes them illegal.
In recent years American consumers have been defrauded out of $100 million annually by international con artists who send the communications primarily from Nigeria and other West African countries.
This is how the typical scheme works: The e-mail or envelope arrives unexpectedly in your mailbox.
It contains a confidential business proposal from a mysterious Nigerian government official who offers the reader a unique business opportunity to earn millions of dollars.
The proposal offers a 25% commission for assistance in transferring surplus funds of up to $38 million (obtained from "over-invoiced government contracts") from Nigeria to the United States.
The solicitations request the reader to provide a bank account number to complete the transaction.
"Investors" who respond to the offer will be required to pay a never-ending assortment of legal fees, personal expenses and government bribes until the victim is drained of all assets.
Please do not respond to these fraudulent business proposals in any way.
If you have other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our Office by calling (804) 786-2071 and asking for our Computer Crimes Unit.
There also is a very helpful web site called the Nigeria 419 Coalition that deals with the topic of Nigerian scam letters.
On this site under the heading, "What To Do If You Receive A Nigerian Scam/419 Letter," there are instructions about sending the e-mail you received to the US Secret Service Task Force.
