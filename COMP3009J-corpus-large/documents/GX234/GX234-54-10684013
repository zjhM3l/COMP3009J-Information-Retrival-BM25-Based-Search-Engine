What does this data set describe?
Title: ACMP Coastal Zone Management Boundaries Abstract: The Alaska Coastal Management Program (ACMP) Coastal Zone boundary database is a statewide 1:250,000-scale or better vector representation of the Alaska Coastal Zone Management Boundaries.
It consists of geographic attribute and textual data automated and maintained with ESRI software.
The Alaska Coastal Zone Boundary database was originally developed by the University of Alaska Environment and Natural Resources Institute.
In a 1996 revision to the Lake and Peninsula Coastal Management Program, the inland coastal zone boundary was expanded to include "all lands and waters within the Borough boundary, except for perennially snow-capped mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes."
AeroMap U.S. was tasked with the process of creating the revised Lake and Peninsula Borough Coastal Management Program Coastal Zone boundary using a) 1:63360 USGS topographic data, and b) Lake and Peninsula Coastal Management Program Coastal Zone boundary definition and map (provided by DGC) as a guide.
Supplemental_Information: The way in which the coastal zone is defined varies throughout the state.
The Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska Atlas provides a description of boundary placement for each of 117 1:250,000 USGS quadrangles.
The coastal zone boundary definitions are as follows: Federal Lands: Excluded from Alaska's coastal zone boundaries are "those lands owned, leased, held in trust or whose use is otherwise by law subject solely to the discretion of the Federal Government, its officers or agents" (15CFR 923.33).
All uses and activities on excluded federal lands that directly affect the coastal area must be consistent to the maximum extent practical with the ACMP and are subject to the consistency provisions of Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended.
Seaward Coastal Zone Boundary: The statewide seaward coastal zone boundary is the "outer limit of the United States territorial sea" (15 CFR 923.32), which is the "three geographic mile line" (43 CFR 3301.1).
The statewide seaward boundary depicted was extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf Official Protraction Diagram map series (Bureau of Land Management, October 1977).
Prince William Sound Outside of Coastal Districts: The inland coastal zone boundary includes entire (minor) islands and the lands and waters within (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce/hemlock forest, (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.
Southeast Alaska Outside of Coastal Districts: The inland coastal zone boundary includes entire (minor) islands and the lands and waters within (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce/hemlock forest, (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.
Aleutians East Borough: The state-approved inland coastal zone boundary includes all islands, and the lands and waters other than perennially snow-capped peaks, active volcanic peaks, and glaciers.
Reference to 1:63,360 or larger source information may be necessary to delineate perennially snow-capped peaks.
Aleutians West CRSA: The inland coastal boundary in the Aleutians West CRSA includes all islands.
The island of Adak is excluded from the Aleutians West CRSA boundary.
Municipality of Anchorage: The inland coastal boundary of the Municipality of Anchorage along the coast between the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Potter Creek includes all lands and waters within: (1) a zone extending 1,320 feet inland, measured horizontally, from the extent of the 100-year coastal flood; (2) the 100-year flood- plain or 200 feet from the center (whichever is greater) of each river and stream intersected by the 1,320-foot zone up to the 1,000-foot elevation contour; and (3) other areas as delineated on this map (map #94, Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska, ACMP, June 1988).
The inland boundary in watersheds of the upper Knik River and south of Potter Creek includes all lands and waters within the 1,000-foot elevation contour.
Reference to 1:25,000 or 1:63,360 USGS topographic maps, Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate maps, or the Anchorage Coastal Management Program may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether the use or activity lie within the coastal zone (Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska, Alaska Coastal Zone Management Program, 1988).
City of Angoon: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the City of Angoon.
Bering Straits CRSA: The Bering Straits CRSA inland coastal zone boundary encompasses a combination of selected watersheds, drainage basins, and uniform one-mile corridors from ordinary high water along each side of fish streams and rivers that provide habitat for important populations of anadromous fish (Map 3-1).In addition, all offshore islands within the Bering Straits CRSA (including St. Lawrence Island) are included in their entirety.
To protect anadromous fish resources and habitats in the areas with greatest potential for mineral development, the Bering Straits CRSA coastal area boundary includes watersheds and drainages where mineral potential is rated as high or very high by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR).
For lands within the CRSA south of Cape Denbigh where mineral potential has not been recently evaluated by the ADNR, the potential for mineral development has been associated with highly mineralized terranes, as identified by the Arctic Environmental Information and Data Center in a map series published in 1982 (Volume 2, Map 7-1).
Areas inland from the interim coastal boundary with identified mineral resources of lesser potential have not been included in the coastal area boundary due to the reduced likelihood of development in the foreseeable future.
Inland from the interim coastal boundary, rivers and streams which support anadromous fish in areas where the likelihood of mineral or other development is low are included in the coastal area boundary through provision of a corridor extending one mile from the ordinary high water mark on both sides of the stream, or from the outermost active channel within braided or split-channel floodplains.
This corridor extends upstream to one mile above the limits of known distribution of anadromous fish.The Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary also provides for an inland setback of two miles from the marine coastal shoreline where bluffs are adjacent to or in close proximity to the coast.
Application of the 200-foot elevation biophysical criteria for the interim coastal boundary is inappropriate where bluffs higher than 200 feet adjoin or are in relatively close proximity to marine waters; in some instances, the interim coastal boundary does not even encompass the coastal bluff.
In these situations, an inland boundary has been prescribed to encompass areas clearly within a zone of marine coastal influence and in which uses and activities could have direct and significant impacts on coastal habitats and coastally-dependent resources.Map 3-1 shows that the coastal area boundary south of the Inglutalik River to the southern limits of the CRSA is comprised of the interim coastal boundary, one mile corridors along anadromous fish streams, and limited extent mineralized areas within portions of the drainage basin of the Unalakleet, Shaktoolik, Ungalik, and Inglutalik Rivers.From the Koyuk River west to the Sinuk River, extensive and contiguous zones of high mineral potential encompass the watersheds of the Koyuk, Tubutulik, Fish, Niukluk, and Sinuk Rivers within stream reaches utilized by anadromous fish.
The portions of these watersheds which emanate from high potential mineralized areas inland from the inland boundary are included within the coastal boundary.
Coastally-associated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline are included in the coastal boundary near Bald Head, and between Moses Point and Cape Darby.
The City of Nome has developed its own coastal management program, and the area encompassed by the Nome district is not included within the Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary.Anadromous fish habitats in rivers draining to Imuruk Basin and Port Clarence include non-mineralized areas south of the Basin, and extensive mineralized zones in the Kuzitrin, Noxapaga, Agaigpuk, and American Rivers.
Watersheds and portions of drainage basins which originate in these high potential mineral areas are included in the coastal area boundary.
Where mineralized areas are not present within the watersheds of anadromous fish streams, one mile corridors along the watercourse are delineated.
Coastally-associated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline of Port Clarence south and east of Teller are included within the coastal boundary.
West of Port Clarence to Cape Prince of Wales, and north along the coast to Shishmaref Inlet, anadromous fish habitats and high potential mineral areas are more widely distributed and interspersed, creating a coastal boundary comprised of smaller watersheds, portions of anadromous fish stream drainage basins, and one mile corridors along anadromous streams where high mineral potential has not been identified.
The coastal topography northeast from Cape Prince of Wales changes to a broad coastal plain which extends inland up to 15 miles before foothills are encountered.
West of Brevig Lagoon near Lost River, coastally-associated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline are included in the coastal area boundary.
From Shishmaref Inlet north to the common boundary with the NANA CRSA, the broad coastal plain is principally encompassed by the interim coastal boundary and shorter drainage systems which have not been documented to support anadromous fish.
This area does not contain identified mineralized areas adjacent to the coast, but mineralized areas are present in the upper portions of stream watersheds.In the coastal boundary regions described above, the transition between watershed or drainage basin criteria and one mile corridor criteria follows the most reasonable and appropriate features available (drainage divides, topography, political boundaries) to appropriately represent resource concerns and to provide an identifiable coastal boundary.
Some areas surrounded by the coastal area, have not currently been documented to provide anadromous fish habitats, and at present are considered low potential for mineral development or other uses and activities with the likelihood of direct and significant impacts to coastal resources.Permit Notification Areas: Some areas outside the Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary could be affected by development activities, but there is less certainty that activities occurring in these areas could result in direct and significant impacts to coastal resources.
These areas are classified as "Permit Notification Areas" (PNA), and are shown on Map 3-1.
The areas include wetlands south of St. Michael, portions of the uplands along the southern part of the Serpentine River watershed, and portions of the Fish River and Tubutulik River watersheds.
Authorizing and permitting agencies must notify the Bering Straits CRSA of permit applications which are received for activities in the PNA.
The CRSA and the agencies then evaluate each project on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the project is likely to have direct and significant impacts on coastal resources within the coastal boundary.
If a project is likely to have such impacts, the project will be subject to the same consistency review procedures applied to uses and activities which occur within the coastal area boundary (see Chapter 6, Implementation).
Bristol Bay CRSA: The inland coastal zone boundary for the Bristol Bay CRSA includes: (1) The interim coastal boundary designated by state, which includes the 200-foot contour, and isolated hills; (2) All water bodies designated in the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, and Migration of Anadromous Fish, plus a one (1) mile corridor from ordinary high water (OHW) on each bank; and (3) All tributaries to these aforementioned designated waterbodies, plus a 200 foot corridor from ordinary high water (OHW) on each bank.
This coastal boundary is graphically depicted on Map 2 of the district program.
The tributaries identified in (3) are not delineated due to limitations of map scale.
Reference to 1:63,360 or larger maps or the anadromous fish catalog may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply.
City of Bethel: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the City of Bethel.
Bristol Bay Borough: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the Bristol Bay Borough.
CeÃ±aliulriit CRSA: The inland coastal zone boundary for the CeÃ±aliulriit CRSA is defined as: (1) All lands and waters within the 200-foot elevation contour, isolated hills, and all islands; (2) All water bodies designated in the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, and Migration of Anadromous Fish (ADFG 1999), plus a corridor extending from ordinary high water on each bank landward one mile or to the highest surrounding contour, whichever is less; and (3) All tributaries to these aforementioned designated water bodies, plus a corridor extending from ordinary high water on each bank landward 200 feet.
An exception is made for tributaries whose confluence with an anadromous stream is located inland from any coastal district boundary.
The tributaries identified in (3) are not delineated due to limitations of map scale.
Reference to 1:63,360 or larger maps or the anadromous fish catalog may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply.
City of Cordova: The Cordova inland coastal zone boundary may change with a significant amendment to its coastal management program in 2001.
The 1986 Cordova Coastal Management Program defines the limits of the inland coastal zone as extending from the western edge of the right-of-way of the State highway (a combination of New England Cannery Road, Railroad Avenue, Copper River Highway, and Three Mile Road) seaward to the Cordova city limits.
The Cordova Coastal Zone also includes that portion of Eyak Lake Area which Merits Special Attention which lies within the city limits as of 1986, and the area between Chase Avenue and the Copper River Highway.
Notably, there are two exceptions where the zone extends uphill of the State highway.
These are Ski Hill and the Fleming Creek, including the lagoon at the mouth of Fleming Creek.
Along the lagoon and creek, the zone includes all land that is encompassed by a setback of 50 feet from the center of the stream, or the line at mean high tide along the lagoon.
As there are few natural or manmade features to indicate a demarcation line, the 50-foot setback was employed.
This distance was deemed sufficient to control development adjacent to the water.
At Ski Hill, the zone would include those lands designated in the 1976 comprehensive plan as publicly owned in the Ski Hill area, and a large platted, but undeveloped area lying between Ski Hill and the developed area in central Cordova.
City of Craig: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within City of Craig.
City of Haines: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the City of Haines.

The inland coastal zone boundary in the remainder of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough includes entire (minor) islands and the lands and waters within (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce/hemlock forest, (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.
The Standards and Guidelines of the Alaska Coastal Management Act and the Forest Service management regulations will continue to operate in areas of the Borough outside the current Coastal Management district boundaries.
City of Klawock: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the city of Klawock.
Kodiak Island Borough: All islands within the boundaries of the Kodiak Island Borough in 1983 (east of Shelikof Strait) are included in the coastal zone.
On March 5, 1990, the Alaska Legislature tacitly approved a Local Boundary Commission decision approving the annexation of a portion of the Alaska Peninsula by the Kodiak Island Borough.
The annexation area essentially follows the ridge line along the Alaska Peninsula from Cape Douglas on the north to Wide Bay on the south and includes the Semidi Islands and Chirikof Island.
The inland coastal zone boundary in this portion of the Borough includes all islands and the lands and waters within (1) the 1,000-foot elevation contour draining into the Pacific Ocean, and isolated hills; (2) one mile measured from ordinary high water of each bank of all anadromous fish waters designated in "An Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for the Spawning, Rearing and Migration of Anadromous Fishes"; and (3) 200 feet measured from ordinary high water of each bank of all tributaries to the waters described in (2).
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.

5) The drainage area, other than the watersheds of the Kivalina, Wulik, Noatak, Kugruk and Inmachuk Rivers, of the estuarine and marine waters of the Kotzebue Sound and Chukchi Sea.
6) All villages, including Kotzebue.
Drainage areas are defined as a corridor extending five miles either side of any water connected by surface or subsurface flow (i.e. wet tundra area) to the larger water body specified.
The major rivers and other drainage areas provide important spawning, rearing, and overwintering habitats for significant populations of anadromous fish within the region (Maps 3 and 4 of the Map Atlas).
City of Nome: The inland coastal zone boundary within the City of Nome includes all lands and waters up to the 200-foot elevation contour.
North Slope Borough: The inland coastal zone boundary is divided into two sectors, the mid-Beaufort coastal sector and the Point Hope/Point Lay coastal sector (Map 1).
The mid-Beaufort coastal sector lies between the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPRA).
The Point Hope/Point Lay coastal sector lies between the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska and the NANA Coastal Resource Service Area.
The North Slope Borough coastal zone boundary extends inland from the interim boundary (a line drawn roughly 25 to 30 miles inland from the coast for most of the borough as depicted in Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska) as follows: (1) in the mid-Beaufort sector the boundary extends inland along selected streams to include all anadromous fish spawning and overwintering habitat and (2) in the Point Hope/Point Lay sector the boundary extends inland to include anadromous fish spawning and overwintering habitat on the Kukpuk River.
The inland boundary extends inland from the interim boundary along the Kukpuk, Chandler, Anaktuvuk, Kanayut, Nanushuk (including May and Cobblestone Creeks), Itkillik, Sagavanirktok (including Accomplishment and Section Creeks), Ridbon, Lupine, Echooka, Ivishak, Saviukviayak (including Flood Creek), Shaviovik, Kavik, Canning and Marsh Fork drainages.
Along each stream, a one-mile corridor from mean high water is included within the coastal zone.
City of Pelican: The inland coastal zone boundary includes all lands and waters within the City of Pelican.
City and Borough of Sitka: The inland coastal zone for the City and Borough of Sitka includes entire (minor) islands and the lands and waters within (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce/hemlock forest (generally between 2,000 and 2,500 feet), (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.

City of Yakutat: The inland coastal zone boundary for the City and Borough of Yakutat includes all islands and the lands and waters within: (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce and hemlock forest, (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.
Note: According to the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), who now maintains the OCS Protraction Diagram map series, the outer limit of the United States territorial sea is actually the three nautical mile line, where one nautical mile is 1852 meters.
One should not confuse a nautical (aka geographic) mile with a statute mile, which is approximately 1609 meters.
The seaward boundary is subject to change due to physical changes in the shoreline resulting from coastal erosion, accretion, or other causes.
MMS uses criteria (in addition to the three nautical mile limit) to determine the location of the boundary for federal/state waters.
Refer to the OCS Protraction Diagram map series for additional information.

Why was the data set created?
This database was designed for two major overviews of the coastal zone: a statewide compilation of coastal zone and coastal district boundaries, and an individual 1:250,000-scale quadrangle basis.
This database is intended to generally locate the boundaries of the local management districts of the coastal zone.

How were the data generated, processed, and modified?
Date: 01-Mar-1994 (process 1 of 3) All coastal zone maps were digitized from 7-mil stable mylar overlays on 1:250000 scale quads by the Alaska Department of Fish 
Data represented with broken line symbols on the source were automated in continuous lines through the center of the dashed symbols.
Lines on the sources that ended on the border of the map were checked on the adjacent maps to assure their continuation, and in some cases required confirmation from ADF
In rare cases unresolved matches were flagged with CZ-CODE = 9.
Blueline reproductions were provided for 30 of the 1:250,000-scale revision quadrangles on which the final inland boundary determination of the coastal zone was indicated.
As digitizing proceeded, this line was interpreted on the source mylar as the linework was automated.
Basemap quadrangles were provided and source maps further clarified by ADF
In a few instances data entry staff were directed to follow specific basemap features rather those on the mylar source, to capture seaward or district boundaries more accurately.
All linework was captured through the process of manual digitizing using a Calcomp 9500 digitizing table with .001 inch resolution.
All quads were mounted on the table with an RMS error of .004 inches or better.
Mounting was based upon protracted quad corners acquired from ADNR LRIS.
The ARC/INFO Arcedit module was used to capture the data.
Automation proceeded quad by quad within the coastal zone and the appropriate coastal zone code was added to the feature attribute table for each arc.
Primary editing was performed to eliminate obvious errors, and the coverage was built with line topology.
Paper check plots for each quad reproduced the line symbology of the atlas using a custom AML.
This paper plot was reviewed by ADF
Final corrections were made where necessary, and the topology recreated.
Construction of the statewide dataset was a two-step process.
The first step commenced following approval by ADF
If feature positions along the edges of quadrangles were not immediately and obviously reconcilable the source maps were used to resolve discrepancies where possible.
ADF
In some cases closure boundaries had to be created to completely close polygons.
This occurred, for example, in south-coastal areas where the seaward boundary around an island extended geographically into an area of ocean not covered by USGS basemaps.
In these cases the polygon was closed with an arc connecting the dangling arcs.
These boundaries were given a special CZ-CODE of 9 to indicate that their precise nature is unknown.
If a coastal district line was discontinuous on the source maps then no attempts were made to guess its proper placement: the source maps were followed faithfully.
In refinement of this database at some future time these lines will require resolution of their correct coding.
In the second step the individual zones were projected into an Albers Equal Area Conic projection, and assembled into a single coverage for the state.
The procedures for edgematching and decision-making followed the same protocols as the first step.
Final processing involved edgematching, closing polygons as described above, adding and coding polygon labels, and building the coverage with polygon topology.
Thirty mylar plots of ADF
These plots were produced using a HP DesignJet plotter.

Date: 31-Jul-2001 (process 2 of 3) Using the Hydrographic layer of the USGS DLGs and digitizing, new Coastal Zone Boundaries were created for the Lake and Peninsula Borough.
The current USGS DLGs were downloaded from 
The data were imported into ArcView software and queried for the "glaciers and perennial snowfields" linework.
These data were reprojected into Albers from UTM.
Volcanoes are currently defined by the borough as those volcanoes that fall within the Lake and Peninsula District boundary, are active, have identifiable calderas and are not otherwise captured as a snow-capped mountain or glacier.
Currently, the only volcano to meet these criteria is Aniakchak.
Future revisions to the data within the Lake and Peninsula Borough boundary may occur if there is a change in the volcano definition.
Other active volcanoes within the borough are: Mt. Katmai, Novarupta, Trident, Martin, Peulik and Ukinrek.
The calderas were digitized using the USGS DRGs and AutoCad.
The data were then imported into ArcView and reprojected into Albers from their respective UTM zones.
These data were then combined with the DLG data.
To incorporate the new data, the CZDIST coverage was used to "erase" the existing interior Lake and Peninsula coastal zones.
The new data were then "unioned" with the Czalbers data.
Linework was cleaned and checked for correct attributes.
The new SOURCE attribute was added to all lines.

How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?
1.
How well have the observations been checked? All attributes created during the creation process were verified by displaying the lines and polygons in both the database and the spatial coverage, but no formal tests were performed.
2.
How accurate are the geographic locations? The boundary placement has been compiled to be accurate for use at 1:250,000-scale.
Accuracy of these boundaries portrayed at larger scales can not be assured.
3.
How accurate are the heights or depths? N/A 4.
Where are the gaps in the data? What is missing? The coastal zone boundary is dependent on the shoreline and/or edges of rivers and bays as delineated on USGS 15- minute Topographic Maps.
The edges or borders of the boundary might change as the natural land changes or better maps and aerial photography become available.
The boundary was not based on legal parcels or definitions; therefore, the core boundary is a management/research boundary and not a legal boundary.
All line data were captured using a minimum vertex separation (weed tolerance) of 50 meters.
For those special cases in which features were particularly small, the weed tolerance was manually set to a smaller value more appropriate for the capture of those features.
5.
How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology? These data are believed to be logically consistent, though no tests were performed.
Line geometry is topologically clean.
