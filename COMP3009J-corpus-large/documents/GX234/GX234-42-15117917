They are believed to be caused by prions (short for proteinaceous infectious particles), which are abnormal proteins transmitted genetically from one animal to another, or that occur spontaneously.
There at least four types of TSEs found in animals: scrapie of sheep and goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of hooved animals and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as "mad cow disease").
TSEs have also been found in humans.
The TSEs that occur in humans are transmitted genetically, may occur spontaneously, or may occur as a result of being treated with natural human growth hormone.
A small percentage of cases are also transmitted iatrongenically (via contaminated surgical equipment, or cornea or dura mater transplants).
The diseases transmitted to humans include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Schneinker syndrome, kuru and fatal familial insomnia.
TSEs tend to progress rapidly and usually culminate in death a few months to a few years after symptoms begin.
Following is a breakdown of the various TSEs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ TSEs in Animals [BlueShadedSquare.gif] Scrapie has been identified in sheep and goats for more than 300 years.
Along with progressive degenerative brain disease (which may manifest as a change in personality, lack of coordination or unsteady gait), the affected animal will scratch itself to the point of self-mutilation.
(Hence the name "scrapie.")
There have been no accounts of scrapie in humans or other animals.
[BlueShadedSquare.gif] Chronic wasting disease (CWD) primarily affects deer, but has also been diagnosed in elk.
The animals become listless, emaciated, polyuric (have an excessive secretion of urine), polydipsic (are excessively thirsty), and they also drool excessively.
Deer affected by the disease were originally thought to be suffering from a nutritional deficiency, but in 1978 lesions were discovered in the brain like those seen in TSE.
So far CWD has been identified in free roaming deer and elk in Wyoming and Colorado, as well as in captive, farmed herds of elk in Nebraska, South Dakota and Oklahoma.
Surveillance systems have been established to monitor CWD in captive and hunted deer and elk. [BlueShadedSquare.gif]
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, more commonly known as "mad cow disease") was first identified in 1986 by British veterinarians.
Affected animals exhibit nervousness, heightened senses, weight loss and diminished milk production.
As the disease progresses, the animals have difficulty walking and holding up their heads.
By 1992 nearly 1,000 per week cases were reported in Britain.
Since then, the United States has maintained a BSE surveillance system on both the state and federal levels.
There is a strict enforcement of import restrictions on ruminants (animals which are characterized by chewing again that which has already been swallowed) and ruminant products from any countries where BSE exists, and a domestic FDA ban on animal-derived feeds.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ TSEs in Humans TSEs in Humans The causes of the four recognizable encephalopathies that occur in humans are, at least in part, inherited.
The one exception may be kuru, whose victims have been confined to a cannibalistic tribe in New Guinea where the brains of departed relatives are eaten.
[BlueShadedSquare.gif] Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the prototypical human TSE.
It is rare, occurring at a rate of one per million worldwide.
Primary symptoms of CJD are dementia, followed by rapid mental deterioration.
Other symptoms include myoclonus (irregular, involuntary contraction of a muscle), rigidity, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary oscillation of the eyeballs), tremors and visual deficits.
CJD is not contagious person to person, although cases have arisen from various types of tissue transplants and from human growth hormone injections.
Hospital guidelines have been developed to avoid those types of transmission.
A new variant of CJD was detected in 1995, now referred to as vCJD.

Both disorders are fatal brain diseases with unusually long incubation periods and are caused by an unconventional transmissible agent.
Humans may develop vCJD after eating infected products from cattle with mad cow disease.
Symptoms may include pain or paresthesias (a sensation of prickling, tingling or creeping on the skin), psychosis, depression and anxiety.
Clinical differences between vCJD and CJD include the following: In vCJD, psychological disorders and sensory deficits are typically more pronounced when the disease is first detected than they are with CJD. 99% of CJD victims are 35 or older, while vCJD victims are younger, with a median age of 27.5.
Patients with vCJD have a relatively longer duration of illness (median of 14 months as opposed to 4.5 months); additionally, vCJD is strongly linked to exposure, probably through food, to BSE.
Finally, vCJD patients tend to develop amyloid plaques in the brain, while CJD patients do not.
Since the incubation period for vCJD is unknown, possible cases of vCJD in the next few years range from hundreds to tens of thousands.
