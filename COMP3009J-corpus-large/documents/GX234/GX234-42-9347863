The ICSW advocates for Iowa women, working to equalize women's opportunities and to promote full participation by women in the economic, political, and social life of the state.
Established in 1972 by the Iowa Legislature, the ICSW is a division of the Department of Human Rights.
The ICSW is composed of nine citizens appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Iowa Senate.
Two members of the Senate, two members of the Iowa House of Representatives, and the director of the Department of Human Rights, serve ex officio.
The ICSW represents the interests of women in a number of areas including pensions, elder care, sexual harassment, welfare, insurance, divorce, nontraditional jobs, displaced homemakers, pay equity, housing, domestic violence, sexual assault, education, and credit.
It also serves as a clearinghouse for information on these and many other topics of interest to women and women's equity.
The ICSW is a responsive, visible advocacy agency for Iowa women's needs and provides a basis for statewide study and action on issues affecting women.
Through research, education, legislative action, and special projects, the ICSW is a strong voice for women's rights.
ICSW (continued)
Annually, the ICSW researches and submits a program of legislative priorities to the Governor and the General Assembly in the areas of aging issues and long-term care, economics, education, health, insurance, violence against women, welfare reform, justice, and government.
The ICSW also advocates for women's interests at the federal level, testifies on behalf of women at legislative hearings, and monitors pending legislation for its impact on women.
As is legislatively mandated, the ICSW administers grant funds to programs that provide services to Iowans in Transition.
It also administers grant funds for training on issues of violence against women.
