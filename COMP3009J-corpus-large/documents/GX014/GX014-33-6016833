Neutropenia = low neutrophils
Slide 21 - CBC Summary * Quick and easy assessment of numbers of blood cells * Relatively inexpensive * No single test tells us more about a blood disorder * Measures all three cell types (RBC, WBC, platelets) * Provides other valuable details
Slide 22 - Causes of Anemia * Decreased production + Decreased reticulocytes * Increased destruction + Increased reticulocytes * Blood loss + Increased reticulocytes
Slide 23 - Definitions * Aplastic Anemia (AA): + Pancytopenia due to decreased production + Hypocellular bone marrow * Leukemia: + Malignant proliferation of immature cells * Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): + Cytopenia with hypercellular bone marrow
Slide 24 - Bone Marrow Equipment This slide shows a picture of Bone Marrow Equipment
Slide 25 - Bone Marrow Biopsy This slide shows a picture of nomral and aplastic bone marrow
Slide 26 - Normal Bone Marrow Aspirate This slide shows pictures of Normal Bone Marrow Aspirate Erythroid (red cells) and Myeloid (white cells)
Slide 27 - Aplastic Anemia Bone Marrow Aspirate This slide shows a picture of Aplastic Anemia Bone Marrow Aspirate
Slide 28 - Bone Marrow Iron This slide shows a picture of Bone Marrow Iron
Slide 29 - Leukemia Bone Marrow This slide shows a picture of Leukemia Bone Marrow
Slide 30 - Hematopoiesis * Formation and development of blood cells * Takes place in the bone marrow * Involves "stem cells"
Slide 31 This slide shows a picture of a Hematopoietic Tree
Slide 32 - Hematopoiesis This slide shows an illustration of Hematopoiesis
Slide 33 - BM Cultures * CFU-E: colony-forming unit, erythroid * BFU-E: burst-forming unit, erythroid * CFU-C: colony-forming unit in culture * CFU-GM: colony-forming unit, granulocyte-macrophage
Slide 34 - CFU-E and BFU-E This slide shows a picture of CFU-E and BFU-E
Slide 35 - MDS Diagnostic Criteria Major Intermediate Minor Overt dysplasia Suggestive dysplasia MPO deficiency Clonal cytogenetics
Dual esterase + PAS+ erythroblasts Ring sideroblasts
MDS = 1 major, or 1 intermediate + 1 minor.
Overt dysplasia = 2 cell lines.
Suggestive = 1 cell line.
Slide 36 - Dysplastic Marrow Features in Morphologic MDS * Erythroid: megaloblastic, multinucleation, nuclear fragments, increased immature forms, ring sideroblasts * Myeloid: increased immature forms, hypo/hyper-granulation * Megakaryocytes: hypo-/hyper-lobulated, small forms, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio
Slide 37 - Bone Marrow in MDS - Erythroid This slide shows a picture of Bone Marrow in MDS - Erythroid
Slide 38 - Bone Marrow in MDS - myeloid and megakaryocytic This slide shows pictures of Bone Marrow in MDS - myeloid and megakaryocytic
Slide 39 - FAB CLASSIFICATION * No MD * SRA = refractory anemia * RARS = ring sideroblasts * RAEB = RA with excess blasts (5-20%) * CMML = chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, PB monocytes 
Slide 40 - Hematopoiesis This slide shows an illustration of Hematopoiesis
Slide 41 - Blood and Marrow MDS Study * Aspirate: Morphology * Biopsy: Cellularity * Cytochemistry: PAS, MPO, dual esterase, iron * Flow cytometry: Lymphocytes, granulocytes * Oncogenes: p53, p21 * Cytogenetics: Classical G banding, FISH, SKY
