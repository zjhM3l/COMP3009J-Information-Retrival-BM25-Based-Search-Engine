Big Thicket National Preserve _______________________________________ Birding Hot Spots Big Thicket National Preserve was designated as a "Globally Important Bird Area" in July 2001 by the American Bird Conservancy.
This designation underscores the significance of the Preserve in this region of Texas as protected public lands offering habitat for avifauna.
Bird migrations peak between late March and early May in and around the Preserve.
Dense tree canopies throughout most of the Preserve make birding a challenge and just that much more rewarding.
The last reported sighting of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the Big Thicket area was May 1971.
The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is officially listed as extinct.
Big Thicket National Preserve is part of "The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail - Upper Texas Coast."
The Upper Texas Coast map of this trail lists the Big Thicket Loop with 19 stops.
