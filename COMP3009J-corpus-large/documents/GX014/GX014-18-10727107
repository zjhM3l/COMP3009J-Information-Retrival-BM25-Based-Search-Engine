Marine Electricians Galapagos Islands, Ecuador OPPORTUNITY: The U.S. Department of the Interior's (DOI) International Technical Assistance Program (ITAP) is seeking qualified DOI marine electricians to provide approximately 2-3 weeks of technical assistance in the Galapagos National Park and surrounding Marine Reserve.
BACKGROUND: DOI ITAP provides assistance to developing countries on subjects of Departmental expertise, on a reimbursable basis.
The program is currently operating in seventeen countries with support from organizations such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Since 1995, DOI has partnered with USAID/Ecuador to provide technical assistance to selected protected areas in Ecuador, including Galapagos National Park.
The Galapagos National Park Service (GNPS) has a fleet of boats which range in size from small, fast patrol launches to large ocean vessels--all with complex machinery and electrical systems.
However, GNPS personnel lack proper training and experience in installation, operation and maintenance of electrical systems.
GNPS staff first need to develop a basic understanding of electricity, electronics and technical electrical drawings.
Then, the staff need to learn how to create, install, operate and maintain electrical systems.
ASSIGNMENT: A DOI marine electrician will provide training to several GNPS staff on: basic theory of electricity, including AC current, motors and electronics; reading electrical drawings; use of 3 phase and 1 phase, and voltage change 440/220/120; DC power; construction of alarm systems for engines; use of measuring instruments such as voltmeters; revision of electrical devices in motors, winches, generators; preventive maintenance; and safety.
SCHEDULE: This assignment is expected to cover a 2-3 week period in fall 2003.
The technical assistance will be provided in the Galapagos National Park and surrounding Marine Reserve.
PRE- AND POST-TRIP DUTIES: All travel and in-country logistics will be handled by DOI.
Background material will be provided to the selected individuals prior to departure.
The selected individuals will be expected to work in collaboration with the DOI ITAP manager and USAID/Ecuador on the preparation and follow-up for the technical assistance over phone and email.
Within 3 weeks of the completion of the trip, the team will provide the DOI ITAP manager a brief draft trip report of the trip events, evaluations made, and recommendations for future related training and technical assistance in the Galapagos.
COSTS: The International Technical Assistance Program will cover all travel costs associated with this assignment (round-trip airfare, lodging, meals, immunizations, etc.).
The salaries of the team members, however, will be paid by their employing DOI agency for the duration of the international assignment, including pre- and post-trip obligations.
