Common sunflower [Helianthus annuus L.][HELAN]
Cockerell
GENERAL DESCRIPTION: * common sunflower: Summer annual with coarse foliage and showy yellow flowers, to 3 m tall.
Plants are highly variable wild forms of the cultivated sunflower.
Native to the U.S. * Texas blueweed: Erect herbaceous perennial, to 0.7 m tall, with bluish-green foliage and creeping roots.
New shoots from root buds often create dense patches of plants.
Introduced from south central U.S. and northern Mexico.
SEEDLINGS:common sunflower: Cotyledons oblong, 15-40 mm long, joined at the bases, smooth.
First few true leaves opposite, dull green, covered with short bristly hairs that are rough to touch.
Margins weakly round-toothed.
Subsequent leaves alternate.
No description available for Texas blueweed.
MATURE PLANT:Boths species have a strong pungent odor, especially when crushed.
* common sunflower: Stems typically highly branched.
Foliage covered with stiff hairs that are rough to touch.
Lower leaves often opposite; upper leaves mostly alternate and smaller.
Leaves on long stalks, heart-shaped to ovate, mostly with cordate bases, 10-40 cm long, and often 3-veined from the base.
Margins coarsely toothed.
* Texas blueweed: Stems often sparsely covered with short stiff hairs.
Leaves typically glabrous or hairy on the margins (ciliate), sessile, bluish-green, covered with a whitish film (glaucous), mostly opposite, oblong to lanceolate, 3-8 cm long.
Margins wavy, entire to shallowly lobed.

ROOTS and UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES: * common sunflower: Seedlings initially taprooted; develops a fibrous root system with maturity.
* Texas blueweed: Develops an extensive system of woody horizontal creeping roots with buds every few inches.
Root fragments can produce new shoots from buds.
Plants are shallow-rooted in uncultivated soils, but develop deeper root systems on cultivated land.
FLOWERS:Showy composite flower heads solitary on long peduncles.
Ray flowers yellow.
* common sunflower: February-October.
Flower head receptacles 1.5-3.5(20) cm across.
Unit of disk flowers flattened on top, usually dark reddish or purplish-brown.
Ray flower corollas mostly greater than 2.5 cm long.
Disk flower corollas 5-8 mm long with red to purple or yellow lobes.
Receptacle scales (chaffy bracts) deeply 3-lobed, mostly glabrous.
Phyllaries typically greater than 4 mm wide, ciliate.
* Texas blueweed: June-November.
Flower head receptacles 1.2-2.5 cm across.
Unit of disk flowers rounded on top, yellowish.
Ray flower corollas about 1 cm long.
Disk flower corollas 4-5 mm long with red lobes.
Receptacle scales (chaffy bracts) hairy at the tips, entire or 3-lobed.
FRUITS and SEEDS:Similar to those of commercial sunflower.
Pappus scales 2(4), deciduous. * common sunflower: Achenes 3-15 mm long.
Pappus scales 2-3.5 mm long.
* Texas blueweed: Achenes about 3 mm long.
Pappus scales about 2 mm long.

HABITAT: * common sunflower: Disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, especially cereal and safflower fields, shrublands.
Often infests fertile soils.
* Texas blueweed: Roadsides, irrigated fields, stream and ditch banks, low drainage areas.
Grows best on cultivated soils and often infests alkaline or saline soils.
DISTRIBUTION: * common sunflower: Throughout California.
To 1900 m (6250 ft).
* Texas blueweed: Sacramento Valley (c Tehama Co.), San Francisco Bay region (w Alameda Co.), South Coast (cw San Luis Obispo, c Santa Barbara, n 
To 300 m (1000 ft).
PROPAGATION/PHENOLOGY: * common sunflower: Reproduces by seed.
Seedlings can emerge from depths of at least 10 cm.
Mature plants can tolerate temperatures to - 2Ã¯Â¿Â½ C, and seedlings are less sensitive to freezing temperatures than mature plants.
* Texas blueweed: Reproduces by vegetative clones from roots and by seed.
Seed viability is often low.
MANAGEMENT FAVORING/DISCOURAGING SURVIVAL:Cultivation (to a depth of 20 cm at least every 2 months for Texas blueweed) reduces survival.
SIMILAR SPECIES:Unlike common sunflower, prairie sunflower [Helianthus petiolaris Nutt. ssp. petiolaris][HELPE]
Disturbed sites in the San Francisco Bay region and Southern California, excluding deserts.
To 450 m (1475 ft).
Maximilian sunflower [Helianthus maximilianii Schrader][HELMA]
It has short rhizome-like roots.
Unlike Texas blueweed, Maximilian sunflower lacks blue-green glaucous foliage and has alternate entire leaves 10-30 cm long, usually folded along the midribs, and without wavy margins.
In addition, disk flower corolla lobes are yellow.
Disturbed sites in southern San Joaquin Valley (Fresno Co.)

CONTROL METHODS:
Prevention: Texas blueweed is an aggressive perennial sunflower that is native to the grasslands of the south central United States.
It naturally persists in low densities in native grasslands, but thrives in cultivated or heavily disturbed areas.
Its reproductive strategy is primarily vegetative, from root buds on lateral roots.
Seed studies from Texas have shown less than 1% of the total seed produced are viable.
However, blueweed seed may have reached California in contaminated alfalfa or oats grown in Texas.
Blueweed is highly competitive in several crops and cropping systems including cotton, wheat, and sorghum.
Texas blueweed is a class A noxious weed in California.
In agricultural fields, prevent new blueweed infestations by planting certified crop seed and cleaning equipment after working in infested fields.
Mechanical: The root system of Texas blueweed is composed of two distinct parts: an extensive network of shallow lateral roots with numerous root buds, and deeply penetrating feeder roots.
New shoots arise from root buds on the laterals and form dense semi-circular patches.
Hoeing, grubbing, or hand pulling small patches may be effective, if continually repeated for several years.
Intensive cultivation repeated throughout the growing season for at least two years has been effective in eradicating blueweed.
This requires plowing to a minimum depth of seven inches at monthly or bimonthly intervals.
Infrequent cultivation will likely spread the weed, as rootstocks may be severed and dragged by tillage equipment.
Tillage implements should be thoroughly cleaned after working in infested areas, to prevent spread of root pieces to new fields.
There is no information available regarding mowing as a control strategy.
Mowing plants may prevent seed production, but should not be done after seed set.
Grazing: Livestock may graze young, newly emerged shoots, but tend to avoid plants as they mature.
Maintaining a healthy, competitive range may prevent blueweed from becoming established.
However, it will persist in native grasslands and may increase if overgrazing occurs.
Chemical: Certain herbicides have provided control of blueweed in the south central United States.
However, repeated applications may be necessary, and control may vary depending upon the year.
Dicamba, 2,4-D, MCPA, and picloram have been reported to control blueweed.
Clopyralid, which is now labeled for use in California rangelands, is very effective on common sunflowers and may also control or suppress blueweed.
Imazapyr and glyphosate may also be effective for blueweed control.
Refer to the herbicide label for rates and timings.
