Glossary
Box Seats - Box seats are generally regarded as the best seats in the stadium; that is, closest to the field with the best view of the action.
In baseball, the box seats are behind home plate, whereas in football, the box seats are around the 50 yard line.
College Draft - Draft system for sports franchises to bid on college players.
In general, the teams with the worst records select earlier than teams with better records.
The rules for drafting players among the leagues vary, in some leagues the number of players drafted are limited, whereas in the baseball there is no limitation.
Expansion Draft - Draft system whereby expansion sports franchises obtain players from the existing sports franchises in their league.
Expansion Sports Franchise - The addition of a new sports franchise to the league through league expansion (increase in the number of sports franchises in the league).
Farm Team - A farm team is where the big league clubs "grow" players.
Skills are refined and worked on, and then as a player develops, he moves up through the system until he reaches the major league level.
Most big league teams have at least 4 minor league farm teams: AAA being the highest, followed by AA, then at least one, and sometimes two A clubs.
If there are two A clubs, one is usually high and one is low.
There are also various short season, winter leagues, etc., where players can go to retain their skill level year round.
Free Agency - Free agency in its purest form, is a status in which the rights to a player's athletic services are not owned by a sports franchise and may be shopped around by the player in a quest for the most attractive bid.
Before 1970, many player contracts contained a reserve clause which bound a player to a team for life unless a team chose to sell the contract.
Salary Cap System - A salary cap system establishes an overall wage framework that provides both a maximum amount of payroll allowed for each sports franchise and a minimum payroll floor that each sports franchise must pay.
Salary caps are generally expressed as a percentage of gross average sports franchise revenues for the league.
Sports Franchise - A sports franchise in a professional sports league generally includes the right to: 1.
be the sports league's sole provider of the professional sport within a given geographical area, 2.
be protected by league rules and regulations from intra-league business competition, 3.
share in the proceeds of future league expansion, 4.
share equally with other sports franchises in the league in the revenue from all single network television contracts negotiated on a league-wide basis, 5.
sell local broadcast rights for preseason television and for both pre-season and regular season radio, 6.
share with other sports franchises in the league in revenue from national merchandising, 7.
sell programs and advertising space therein at home games, 8.
participate in the college draft and the expansion draft (for expansion sports franchises), and 9.
share in the league's goodwill.
Right of First Refusal - A right of first refusal permits a sports franchise to match any offer made to one of its current players by another sports franchise and thus retain the player's services.
The right of first refusal generally applies only to restricted free agents, that is; for example players having a specified amount of limited experience.
Uniform Player Contract - The major sports leagues require that all players sign a uniform player contract that contains provisions prescribed by the league.
