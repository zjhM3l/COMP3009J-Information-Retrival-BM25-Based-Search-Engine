U.S. Secretary Of Transportation Norman Y.
Mineta Honors Coast Guard In Texas
HOUSTON U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y.
Mineta today honored 12 Houston-based Coast Guardsmen and six Coast Guard units for their heroic actions in rescuing over 250 individuals during Tropical Storm Allison.
Since being appointed Secretary of Transportation by President Bush, I have seen first-hand the dedication and service of the men and women of Coast Guard, said Secretary Mineta.
From Key West to Alaska and across the oceans, you have demonstrated their flexibility, adaptability and heroism.
The rescues in the Houston area were a unique assignment for the Coast Guard, which typically responds to incidents in the open seas.
Power lines, unknown water depths, trees and buildings made the Houston rescues especially challenging.
The Coast Guards swift actions resulted in the rescue of more than 250 people caught in the wake of Tropical Storm Allison.
During a ceremony at U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston, Secretary Mineta and Rep. John A. Culberson (7^th-TX) joined Adm. James M. Loy, Commandant of the Coast Guard; Rear Adm. Roy J. Casto, Eighth Coast Guard District Commander; Vince Patton, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard; and Houston Mayor Lee Brown in presenting the following awards:
Air Medal
Petty Officer Chris Monville
Aviation Survival Technician Third Class
Petty Officer Monville was instrumental in saving several lives during the height of the flooding.
Deploying from 100 feet or more, he rescued a pregnant woman in labor and later, attaching himself to the rescue litter, breathed for a quadriplegic victim after he was removed from his ventilator.
Petty Officer Keith R. Armstrong, Air Station Houston
Aviation Maintenance Technician First Class
When space and weight limits forced the aircrafts rescue swimmer to remain behind, Petty Officer Armstrong served as both flight mechanic and EMT during the medevac of a critically ill woman.
His final case required him to hoist a quadriplegic girl from a flooded house where power lines and trees forced a hoist altitude of over 120-feet.
Petty Officer Jason D. Burridge, Air Station Houston
Aviation Maintenance Technician Second Class
Guided the pilot through difficult high-hover hoists, maneuvering the rescue basket below trees and clear of power lines to perform rescues from cars and rooftops.
His contributions were crucial in the rescue of 21 people in 20 hoists.
Chief Petty Officer Robert Ayres
Chief Aviation Survival Technician
Serving as the rescue swimmer aboard the first aircraft to deploy during the floods, Chief Ayers was instrumental in the safe rescue of 21 people by assisting the pilot to navigate around power lines, and by accepting the risks of 100-foot hoists to reach flood victims.
Lieutenant Darrel Creacy, Air Station Houston
Co-pilot
Lieutenant Creacy was instrumental in the rescue of 21 people from rising floodwaters.
Utilizing his experience from the Victoria, Texas floods in 1998, and his hometown knowledge of Houston, he provided perspective on fast-water urban rescues.
Lieutenant Commander Steven Seiberling, Air Station Houston
Aircraft Commander
Lieutenant Commander Steven Seiberling rescued 21 people in 20 hoists.
During these rescues, to avoid further endangering people with the aircrafts rotorwash, hoists were performed from 100 feet in the air with the rotor blades overlapping power lines.
Commendation Medal
Captain Donald Thompson, Commander U.S. Coast Guard Group Galveston
Incident Commander
Captain Thompson coordinated the Coast Guards overall response efforts during the flood resulting in the rescue of 260 people during a 36-hour period.
Many marine incidents, including barge breakaways and chemical spills, were dealt with through the Incident Command Center preventing millions of dollars in collateral damage.
Achievement Medal
Petty Officer David I. Becker, Group Galveston
Quartermaster First Class
As a watchstander in the Group Galveston Operations Center, Petty Officer Becker coordinated and prioritized more than 800 incoming phone calls for help and used web-based technology to convert street addresses into latitude and longitude, enabling rescue aircraft to quickly arrive on scene and rescue 82 people.
Petty Officer Stanley Mingus, Marine Safety Office Houston
Boatswains Mate First Class
As the coxswain of a 14-foot smallboat, Petty Officer Mingus led his crew through the swift currents and rapidly rising waters of a flooded northeast Houston subdivision, safely transporting 57 people from their flooded homes to nearby shelters.
LT. Jeffrey W. Novak
SAR Supervisor, Vessel Traffic Service Office Houston
LT Novak personally directed the efforts of 40 search and rescue responders during 12 missions to assist in the rescue of 180 people from urban flash flooding conditions during a 36-hour period.
Letter of Commendation
Petty Officer Douglas Gemar, Station Galveston
Boatswain Mate Third Class
While serving as the crewmember aboard a flood punt, Petty Officer Gemar personally assisted in four group rescues of residents requiring waterborne evacuations from flooded residences.
Petty Officer Jeanne King, Marine Safety Office Corpus Christi
Marine Safety Technician Third Class
Petty Officer Jeanne King, joining the response forces from Corpus Christi as a first-responder along the Houston Ship Channel, located 30 drums of unknown chemical content floating in the ship channel and quickly catalogued and documented them, resulting in their safe removal by follow-up crews.
Secretary Mineta also awarded U.S. Coast Guard Unit Commendation awards to the crews of Air Station Houston, Group Galveston, Marine Safety Office Houston, Marine Safety Unit Galveston, Coast Guard cutter Harry Claiborne and Vessel Traffic Service Houston/Galveston.
The Coast Guard saves lives every day and answers about 40,000 calls for help every year.
Aircraft and crews activated for the response in Houston included six helicopters, two jets, two cargo planes, and two Disaster Response Units.
Whether saving lives, cleaning up after oil spills or interdicting illegal migrants and drugs, the Coast Guard is always ready to protect our shores and our citizens.
