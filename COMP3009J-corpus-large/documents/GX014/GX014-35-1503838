The Mural Arts Program is dedicated to the elimination of graffiti vandalism and the expansion of educational visual arts opportunities throughout the Philadelphia region.
Artists and a diverse youth population work together to create public murals, thereby strengthening neighborhood associations and improving the quality of life for all community residents.
Since moving to the Recreation Department in June of 1996, this organization has grown.
Their service now includes: * Art Workshops in recreation centers throughout the city.
(This includes a comprehensive Visual Arts curriculum, mural painting technique and art history/art appreciation).
* Community Murals * Business Mural Partnerships
BACKGROUND The Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network was formed in 1984, to help eliminate graffiti and to provide former graffiti-writers with educational and vocational opportunities.
Because so many wall-writers expressed an interest in art, a mural/art component of the program was developed.
Since 1984, former wall-writers (both those recommended by the courts and those who have come voluntarily) have been trained in the techniques and aesthetics of mural painting.
Each year, in partnership with several major art institutions, The Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network also offered After-School workshops and a summer arts program which involved hundreds of young people throughout the city.
The workshops culminated each winter in an art show and art auction, with proceeds going to the young artists.
THE PRESENT Today there are over 2,500 Anti-Graffiti Network murals on the sides of schools, recreation centers, housing projects, and on public walls throughout Philadelphia.
Some of these murals have been designed and executed entirely by former wall-writers.
Others have been painted by groups of younger artists in the summer programs.
Some have been painted by the professional artists on staff or created in collaborations with well known Philadelphia artists.
The work of the mural program has been featured in local newspapers, national magazines, and television feature stories.
In 1992, the program was one of ten local initiatives (out of 2,500 applicants) to receive the Innovative Cities Award from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Ford Foundation.
Before creating a mural, artists engage in a dialogue with community residents to arrive at a theme and design which is agreeable to all parties.
This process encourages a sense of involvement and community ownership of the finished art, which results in the murals being both respected and protected.
THE FUTURE * To continue and expand the Citywide Mural Program.
* To design and paint murals on recreation centers throughout the city, as part of the Recreation Department's campaign to become graffiti-free.
* To develop an arts curriculum based on mural painting which will be offered in recreation centers and community centers around the city.
* To expand educational arts opportunities for interested and gifted Philadelphia youth throughout the collaborations with local art schools (secondary and college levels.
