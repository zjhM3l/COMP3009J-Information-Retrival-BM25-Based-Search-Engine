The FY 2003 TRQ for imports of raw cane sugar into the United States is set at 1,117,195 metric tons raw value (1,231,497 short tons raw value).
This amount represents the level to which the United States is committed under the Uruguay Round Agreement.
The allocation for Mexico provided for under the North American Free Trade Agreement will be made at a later date.
Certificates of Quota Eligibility (CQEs) will be issued to allow Brazil, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines to ship up to 25 percent of each country's allocation at the low-tier tariff during each quarter of FY 2003.
Argentina, Australia, Guatemala and Peru will be allowed to ship up to 50 percent of their initial allocations in the first six months of FY 2003.
Allocations not entered with the U.S. Customs Service during any quarter or six-month period may be entered in any subsequent period.
For all other countries, CQEs corresponding to each country's allocation may be entered at the low-tier tariff at any time during the fiscal year.
In addition, USDA has established the FY 2003 refined sugar TRQ at 37,000 metric tons raw value (40,786 short tons raw value) for which the sucrose content, by weight, in the dry state, must have a polarimeter reading of 99.5 degrees or more.
This refined sugar TRQ includes 22,000 metric tons raw value, the minimum level to which the United States is committed under the Uruguay Round Agreement, and an additional 15,000 metric tons raw value for specialty sugars.
With the additional 15,000 tons, the total specialty sugar allocation is 16,656 metric tons raw value (18,360 short tons raw value).
USDA will administer this allocation in two tranches.
The first, totaling 1,656 metric tons, will open Oct. 30.
All specialty sugars are eligible for entry under this tranche.
A second tranche, totaling 15,000 tons, will open on Nov. 19.
It will be reserved for organic sugar and other specialty sugars not currently commercially produced in the United States or reasonably available from domestic sources.
