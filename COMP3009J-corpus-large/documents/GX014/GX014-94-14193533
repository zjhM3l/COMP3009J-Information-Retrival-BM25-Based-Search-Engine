Chapter 5 - Season Ticket Revenue
Industry Practice
Categories of Seating
A major revenue source for a sports franchise is its ticket receipts.
There are normally three categories of seats: regular or general admission seats, club seats, and luxury or skybox suites.
A regular seat ticket entitles a sports fan admittance to the stadium for a specific game or a specific season of games.
Generally, this category of seat contains no added benefits and the cost of the ticket is normally determined by seat location.
Regular seat tickets can be sold on a game-by-game basis, although the majority are sold on a season ticket basis.
Regular season seat tickets can be sold for a single season or for multiple seasons.
For the sports franchise, the sale of season tickets ensures a stream of income for a specified time frame, as well as fan turn-out which can impact ancillary income; for example, parking revenue, concession revenue, etc.
Normally, club seat tickets cost more than regular seat tickets, and in some cases as much as double.
This additional cost is primarily due to the club seat location in the stadium, offering patrons a better view of the action; however, the increased cost is also due to the added benefits usually afforded these patrons.
Club seat tickets entitle the ticket holders to admittance to the game, usually through a separate entrance from the general public; moreover, usually these sports fans also have access to a club facility at which they may purchase concessions in climate controlled surroundings before, during, or after the game.
Additionally, the club area may include a lounge area in which the sports fans may socialize before, during, or after the game.
Closed circuit television coverage allowing the patrons continued coverage of the field action while away from their seats is not uncommon in these facilities.
Club seat ticket holders are often offered the right to acquire parking privileges close to the stadium.
In the skybox category, the patron, normally a corporation, purchases a box of seats rather than a single seat.
The number of seats in each box can vary within a particular stadium, depending on the stadium design and configuration.
Similarly, the number of skyboxes varies from stadium to stadium.
Skyboxes are the most expensive category of seats.
This is not only due to the number of seats acquired, but also due to the facility and benefits provided as part of the skybox package.
Usually, skyboxes are elaborate facilities, containing climate control, comfort seating, closed circuit television equipment, as well as kitchen and bar facilities.
It is not uncommon for skybox patrons to also receive a preferred parking location either adjacent to the stadium or in close proximity.
Club seat tickets and skyboxes are normally sold on a multiple season basis.
This ensures the sports franchise a steady income stream for a specific number of years.
Accounting for Season Tickets
Accounting for revenue from the sale of regular single season ticket sales is straight forward.
For both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) purposes and for tax purposes, the revenue is recorded as the games are played.
This is true even if the playing season begins in one tax year and ends in the next tax year.
Usually, the sale of multiple year season tickets requires a commitment from the sports fan to purchase season tickets for a specified number of years.
Regardless of the seat category, the sports franchise normally issues terms and conditions, outlining the rights and obligations of both the ticket holder and the sports franchise.
The terms and conditions usually specify the number of years for which the sports fan is obligated to purchase tickets, the cost of tickets per season (including any potential price increases), consequences to the ticket holder in the event of default, and other miscellaneous provisions.
Multiple year season ticket sales, regardless of seat category, often require a security deposit.
The terms and conditions usually contain provisions regarding the security deposit, including cancellation, application, and refund provisions.

Audit Issues
1.
Whether the reporting of advance payments on multiple season ticket sales can be deferred, or instead can be included in gross income in the tax year received; and 2.
Whether amounts treated by the sports franchise as non-taxable security deposits are, instead, taxable advance payments.
Tax Law
Fixed 
Generally, payments received in advance are income to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers in the year of receipt, provided there is no restriction on the use of such payments.
This income recognition rule holds true even though the advance payments are returnable upon the happening of some specified event.
For accrual basis taxpayers, deferral of prepayments for future services is permitted, provided the services do not extend after the tax year following the year of receipt.
Chapter 3 addresses the general year of income inclusion rules and Rev. Proc. 71-21, 1971-2 C.B. 549.
While the general rule for tax purposes is that payments received for services to be performed in the future must be included in gross income in the taxable year of receipt, several courts have allowed deferral of prepaid income when the contract obligations to perform the services are fixed and determinable.
Artnell Co. v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968), Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, 530 F.2d 1367 (Ct. Cl. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 867 (1976).
In Artnell the court allowed the deferral of prepaid single season baseball tickets because unlike American Automobile Association v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1961), and Schlude v. Commissioner, 572 U.S. 128 (1963), the time and extent of future services was certain (except for rained out games, the baseball games were played on a fixed schedule).
The court in Boise Cascade Corp. also allowed the deferral of prepaid engineering services until the year the services were performed because performance was required on fixed dates or as expeditiously as possible.
These courts reasoned "there were situations when deferral so clearly reflected income that it must be permitted."
In the action on decision on Boise Cascade Corp., dated February 19, 1986, the Service stated:
We believe that the reasoning of the Court of Claims is incorrect.
The so-called 'fixed and definite' or 'certainty of performance' test, which suggests that income deferral might be possible if certain standards are met for the matching of deferred income with future services and expenses, (see Artnell v. Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968)) is premised on a misinterpretation of the Supreme Court's holdings in Schlude and A.A.A.
In those cases, the Supreme Court cited as an 'additional ground' (Schlude, at 135) for disallowing income deferral the fact that the advance payments related to services which were to be performed without relation to fixed dates in the future.
From this holding, it is argued that the Supreme Court 'left an opening' (Artnell at 984) allowing for deferral if the extent and time of future performance are 'certain'.
However, there is no implication that the Supreme Court, in disallowing deferral of income in Schlude, A.A.A. and Michigan, intended expressly or impliedly to state a positive rule allowing for income deferral.
To the contrary, advance payments for services to be rendered in future years and received without restriction as to use, are income in the year received by an accrual basis taxpayer.
RCA Corp. v. United States, 664 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1981); Simplified Tax Records, Inc. v. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 75 (1963); Popular Library, Inc. v. Commissioner, 39 T.C. 1092 (1963).
Moreover, the fixed-and-definite theory, which argues by implication from the 'additional ground' in Schlude and A.A.A., overlooks the primary ground upon which the Supreme Court relied in refusing income deferral: the 'long-standing' (at 134) principle that 'accounting systems Schlude deferring prepaid income could be rejected by the Commissioner' (Id.) pursuant to the broad discretion given him by I.R.C. section 446.
With certain limited exceptions, Service position is that all the events that fix the right to receive income occur when (1) the required performance takes place, (2) payment is due, or (3) payment is made, whichever happens first.
See: Rev. Rul. 80-308, 1980-2 C.B. 162; Rev. Rul. 79-292, 1979-2 C.B. 287; Rev. Rul. 79-195, 1979-1 C.B. 177.
The Service disagreed with both the Artnell and Boise Cascade decisions, and in response to the Artnell decision published Rev. Proc. 71 21.
In the Action on Decision on Artnell, dated July 27, 1971, Chief Counsel stated "the Service will not follow Artnell to the extent the rules for deferral could be deemed to be broader than those contained in Rev. Proc. 71-21."
Advance Payment Versus Deposit
A distinction between a deposit in the nature of a loan and an advance payment turns on the nature of the rights and obligations that are assumed when the deposit is made.
The leading case addressing the taxability of customer deposits is the Supreme Court's opinion in Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power 
In this case, the Supreme Court applied what has become known as the "complete dominion test" to determine whether customer deposits should be included in taxable income when received.
In Indianapolis Power 
The deposits were collected pursuant to terms established by a public utilities regulatory authority.
The deposits would accrue interest if held for more than 12 months.
The utility would refund the deposits upon termination of service or earlier if the customer demonstrated acceptable credit (by making timely payments for a certain period).
The customer could receive a cash refund or could elect to apply the deposit as payment of his electric bill.
The utility did not segregate the deposits, and the deposits were subject to its use and control.
One of the major factors considered by the Supreme Court was the fact that the customers in this case could cancel at any time.
The Court stated:
Here in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment to purchase a specified quantity of electricity, or indeed to purchase any electricity at all.
[Footnote 6] IPL's right to keep the money depends upon the customer's purchase of electricity, and upon his later decision to have the deposit applied to future bills, not merely upon the utility's adherence to its contractual duties.
The Supreme Court stated in Footnote 6:
A customer, for example, might terminate service the day after making the deposit.
Also, IPL's dominion over a deposit remains incomplete even after the customer begins buying electricity.
As has been noted, the deposit typically is set at twice the customer's estimated monthly bill.
So long as the customer pays his bills in a timely fashion, the money he owes the utility (for electricity used but not yet paid for) almost always will be less than the amount of the deposit.
If this were not the case, the deposit would provide inadequate protection.
Thus, through the period the deposit is held, at least a portion is likely to be money that IPL has no real assurance of ever retaining.
The Supreme Court held that control over the deposits, unrestricted use of the funds, and nonpayment of interest were not controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer exercised complete dominion over deposits received or is obligated to repay the deposits.
The controlling factor was that, at the time deposits were made, the utility had no guarantee that it would be allowed to retain them.
The utility acquired the deposits subject to an express obligation to repay at some future date (at the time of termination of service or earlier, if the customer established good credit).
The Supreme Court noted:
The individual who makes an advance payment retains no right to insist upon the return of the funds.
On the other hand, a customer submitting a deposit retains the right to insist upon repayment in cash, even though he may choose to apply the deposit to purchase goods.
***
An advance payment, like the deposits at issue here, concededly protects the seller against the risk that it would be able to collect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services.
But an advance payment does much more; it protects against the risk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller performs.
*** Here, in contrast, a customer submitting a deposit made no commitment.
In section 3.03 of Rev. Proc. 91-31, 1991-1 C.B. 566, the Service stated:
Change in treatment of deposits.
If a utility company consistently includes customer deposits in gross income in the year of receipt and those deposits are not taxed upon receipt under the decision in Indianapolis Power, a change in the treatment of those deposits is a change in method of accounting.

Tax Law Application
Except perhaps for multiple season ticket contracts covering just two regular seasons, most multiple season contracts will not meet the requirement under Rev. Proc. 71-21 that the services be provided by the end of the tax year following the year of receipt.
This Rev. Proc. 71-21 requirement is addressed in Chapter 3.
There are significant differences between Indianapolis Power 
First, the deposits in Indianapolis Power 
Advance payments/deposits required by sports franchises normally are exactly equal to the cost of one year's season ticket.
Second, the customers in Indianapolis Power 
Multiple year season ticket holders, on the other hand, are usually obligated to purchase tickets for a specified number of years, which may range from 3 to 10 years, depending on the sports franchise and the seat category.
The customers in Indianapolis Power 
Thus, the customers controlled both the timing and the method of their refunds.
In contrast, multiple year season ticket contracts often do not contain a cancellation provision whereby the ticket holder will receive an unconditional refund.
Sports franchise multiple year season ticket contracts that do provide for "early" refunds often contain restrictions on the timing of the refund or the amount of the refund.
For example, the contract may specify a refund will only be made if the ticket is resold and that the refund will be reduced by a reselling charge or cancellation charge.
As a regulated utility, the taxpayer in Indianapolis Power 
Additionally, unclaimed deposits were required to be transferred to the State.
While sports franchises are members of their respective leagues, they are not regulated entities.
Thus, there are no industry regulations governing the accounting of a sports franchise's season ticket advance payments/deposits.
Moreover, any unclaimed advance payments/deposits remain with the sports franchise.
Another factor is the rights the sports franchise possesses with respect to the advance payments/deposits and the season ticket contracts.
In a number of sports franchise cases, the sports franchise pledged the advance payments/deposits and season ticket contracts as security for third party financing.
As stated earlier, control over the deposits and unrestricted use of funds are not the controlling factors in determining whether a taxpayer has complete dominion over the deposits and is obligated to repay deposits.
Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes.
The Supreme Court noted in Indianapolis Power 
When the Commissioner examines privately structured transactions, the true understanding of the parties, of course, may not be apparent.
It may be that a transfer of funds, though nominally a loan, may conceal an unstated agreement that the money is to be applied to the purchase of goods or services.
Generally, a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue is not going to be a black and white issue.
Each sports franchise's potential advance payment/deposit issue must be evaluated based on the sports franchise's unique facts and circumstances.

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in developing a sports franchise advance payment/deposit issue include: 1.
The season ticket application packages.
This may consist of the actual application submitted by a prospective season ticket holder, along with any attachments such as seating selections, payment options, etc.
If different applications are used for different categories of seats, each type should be secured.
The applications should provide basic information such as application fee required, cost of ticket (per season), location of seating, etc. 2.
Sample copy of season ticket agreements (original, as well as any later amendments, or terms in any form) for each category of seat, including club seats.
In some cases, the terms and conditions are significantly different for regular season tickets, club seats, and skyboxes.
3.
A breakdown of the total number of seats in each seat category.
A listing of season ticket holders, including name, purchase date of ticket, total purchase price, date and amount of the advance payment/deposit, subsequent payments (if any), and remaining amount due.
4.
The payment plan agreement for each category of seat, which outlines the various payment options available to the season ticket holders.
Sometimes sports franchises will offer the ticket holder the option to pay annually or pay monthly.
The various payment plan agreements will specify the amount of each periodic payment, how many payments are due, when the payments are due, etc. 5.
Sample cover letter to ticket holders transmitting coupon books for those who opted to pay by monthly check, and if available, a sample coupon book.
Similarly, a sample confirmation letter or signature authorization, if any, sent to those who opted for an automatic monthly withdrawal to pay for their tickets.
6.
A copy of the sports franchise's policy regarding liquidating damages, cancellation fees, resale fees, etc., when the multiple year season ticket agreements were entered into.
If the sports franchise has a written policy, retain a copy for the case file workpapers.
If the agreements or policies have changed over time, secure a copy of all agreement and policy changes through the date the examination is closed.
Some policy changes may apply retroactively.
7.
Listing of ticket holders who requested refunds of their deposits.
The list should reflect the date the refund was requested, the date the refund was made, as well as the amount of the refund.
8.
Sample packages of cancellation requests for each seat category.
This would include the request from the ticket holder, the response from the team, any default letters sent, etc. 9.
Sample renewal letters sent to ticket holders whose contracts were due to expire.
Examiners need to analyze these letters to determine the disposition of any advance payment/deposit which may have been paid up front by the ticket holder.
10.
Media packages for the marketing of skyboxes.
These often have separate marketing campaigns which are targeted to the larger local businesses.
The contracts utilized for multiple season tickets, regardless of seat category, should be carefully analyzed.
Additionally, it may be helpful to use a look-back approach.
Securing refund packages may give some insight as to any unstated agreements.
These packages may consist of refund requests from the ticket holder and response letters from the sports franchise, as well as the final letter transmitting or denying the refund.
Depending on the length of time the sports franchise has been in existence, it may be helpful to trace the disposition of advance payments/deposits for those ticket holders who do not renew their seats.
The invoice and correspondence sent for the final season should be inspected to ascertain if the sports franchise automatically applies the advance payment/deposit against the final season's ticket price.
In developing a potential advance payment versus deposit issue, the examiner needs to look beyond the form of the sports franchise's privately structured contracts and agreements, and to focus on the substance of the rights and obligations of parties under the season ticket agreements.
This includes consideration of unstated agreements and understandings among the parties.
Substance versus form is controlling for tax purposes.
Because the multiple year season ticket revenue issues addressed in this chapter involve the timing of the sports franchise's reporting of season ticket revenue, they constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for multiple year season contract revenue.
Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising season ticket revenue issues.

Potential Emerging Issue
Some districts have raised the question of whether advance payments on season contracts are advance payments for property rights versus advance payments for services.
Rev. Proc. 71-21 only applies to advance payments for services.
Chapter 4 addresses the case law in this area and a similar issue for broadcasting rights.
Chapter 3 addresses a similar issue for sponsorship agreements that convey exclusivity rights to the sponsor.
This issue is currently under review by the Sports Franchise ISP Team and should be discussed with the ISP before proposing an adjustment to the taxpayer.
