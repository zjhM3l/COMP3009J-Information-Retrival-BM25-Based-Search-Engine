Chapter 8 - Stadium Issues
Industry Practice
The nineties have been a time of sports stadium construction and sports stadium expansion.
The increasing significance of revenue generated by club seats and luxury suites, which offer an advantage to new and renovated stadiums, is a major impetus for stadium expansion.
Expansion sports franchises and relocated sports franchises generally have new or renovated stadiums.
In addition, established sports franchises are commonly pursuing stadium expansion or, in some instances, new stadiums.
A major factor in a sports franchise's financial success includes having a favorable stadium deal.
Numerous cities have proven their willingness to mortgage their futures through taxes and the sale of bonds to attract or keep a sports franchise.
As a result of new stadium construction and city concessions, sports franchises in larger markets, once thought to have an insurmountable economic advantage over franchises in smaller markets, have, in many instances, been surpassed in profits and value by their smaller market counterparts.
The willingness of cities to build stadiums and the large increases in revenues related to the new stadiums creates an environment where it appears that in many leagues a sports franchise will need new stadiums and favorable concessions packages to remain competitive in their league.
The sports franchise will either own its stadium or lease it from another party.
The stadium owner may be an entity related to the sports franchise, a public entity, or an unrelated third party.
The sports franchise's stadium interests, leased or owned, are a strong component of the sports franchise's overall value; accordingly, the agreements between the sports franchise and the local sports authority tend to be heavily negotiated, lengthy, and complex.
It is not uncommon for the owner of a sports franchise to also own other entities related to the sports franchise.
For instance, one entity may own the actual sports franchise, while another separate entity may own the sport facility or hold the long-term lease to the facility.
Additionally, another related entity could hold the concession contract, while yet another can provide the parking.
The ways in which ancillary services can be segregated into separate entities is almost limitless.
Moreover, most sports franchise owners also own other businesses which, while unrelated to sports franchise operations (such as a television or radio station), may be enhanced by the ownership of a professional sports team.
Examiners should consider whether the agreements among an owner's businesses are entered into on an arms-length basis.
Since these related party transactions will, in all likelihood, be unique, a thorough analysis is required to determine the true nature of the transactions.
When related party transactions are determined to be at less than arms length, IRC section 482 may be used to reallocate income and expenses in order to reflect the proper taxable income.
The applicability of IRC section 267 should also be considered for transactions among related parties.
Because there are different audit issues and audit risk for a sports franchise which owns its stadium and a sports franchise which leases its stadium, the ownership and lease of a sports stadium are addressed separately in this chapter.

Stadium Ownership
Overview
As with all real estate owned, there are burdens and benefits that go with a sports franchise's ownership of its stadium.
The sports franchise that owns its stadium will have a large capital asset on its balance sheet, and significant depreciation will be claimed.
Rental expense will be drastically reduced in comparison to a sport franchise that leases its stadium.
Unless the city has made concessions (which is not unlikely), the sports franchise will probably have significant property taxes.
A sports franchise that owns its stadium is also likely to have a higher payroll than a sports franchise that leases its stadium.
Stadium ownership by a sports franchise or an entity related to the sports franchise is generally achieved through construction or acquisition.
In both instances, the basis of the asset will be the costs directly and indirectly chargeable to the stadium and related facility assets.
In computing depreciation, the value of the land is excluded from the depreciable assets.
With new construction, the determination of land value is generally provided in a separate acquisition closing statement; however, when an existing stadium is acquired, the determination of land value is more problematic.
The contract on the acquisition of an existing stadium should allocate the acquisition price as negotiated by buyers and sellers among the various assets acquired.
Even though the buyer and seller have agreed on the purchase/sale price allocations, the examiner is not prevented from challenging allocations to reflect their actual fair market values.
- Return to Table of Contents - __________________________________________________________________
Audit Issues
1.
This issue relates to whether the allocation to land versus buildings and other depreciable assets is proper.
As with any other purchase of real estate, the value allocated to land should be reviewed to determine its reasonableness.
2.
Whether the depreciable assets have been assigned proper recovery periods is a further issue.
There are various structural components which are considered to be part of the stadium structure.
Some components, such as stadium seats, the score board and message board have a considerably shorter life than the stadium structure.
Therefore, it is important to determine that assets have been appropriately classified and the correct recovery period is applied in calculating depreciation.
3.
For stadiums constructed using tax exempt bonds, another issue is whether the sports franchise properly used the alternative depreciation system versus the regular depreciation system.
Recovery Periods
A sports stadium is a single purpose structure in that it provides spectator space for the viewing of sports and other events.
It is limited to this functional use and is not readily adaptable to other more general business use or activities.
A sports stadium is nonresidential real property.
Accordingly, the stadium structure and its structural components normally have a recovery period of 39 years.
The term "structural components" includes parts of the building such as: walls; partitions; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings such as paneling or tiling; windows and doors; all components (whether in, on, or adjacent to the building) of a central air conditioning or heating system, including motors, compressors, pipes and ducts; plumbing and plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and bathtubs; electric wiring and lighting fixtures; chimneys; escalators and elevators, including all components thereof; sprinkler systems; fire escapes; and other components relating to the operation or maintenance of a building.
There are certain stadium-related assets which are considered personal property in nature and are, therefore, entitled to a shorter recovery period than the stadium structure and its structural components.
Rev. Rul. 69-170, 1969-1 C.B. 28, addresses whether stadium seats and other miscellaneous items associated with a sports stadium qualify as IRC section 38 property for purposes of investment credit.
This ruling indirectly provides guidance on what assets, associated with a sports stadium, qualify for recovery periods separate from (and thereby qualifying for shorter recovery periods) the stadium building and its structural components.
The taxpayer in Rev. Rul. 69-170 operated a concrete and steel baseball stadium.
The items of property in question were the stadium seats, score boards and message board (including equipment and circuitry), field lights, backstop, batter's eye screen, foul and flag poles, and signs.
The stadium seats were wooden with metal frames and were attached to the stadium with bolts that were embedded in the concrete floor.
The backstop was located behind home plate and was made of wire mesh attached by cables to the stadium structure.
The batter's eye screen was located in center field and consisted of a metallic screen across steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts.
The foul and flag poles were four steel poles embedded in concrete and were separate from the stadium structure.
The score boards and message board were in the nature of electrical signs.
Both were mounted on large steel poles, attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts.
These boards were separate and apart from the stadium structure.
The field lights consisted of eight clusters of lights, each cluster having approximately 200 bulbs.
Each cluster of lights was supported by steel poles that were attached to concrete foundations with steel bolts.
Six of these steel poles were attached to foundations that were part of the stadium structure while the other two had foundations set apart from the structure.
The signs consisted of numerous directional and traffic signs located in the parking lots and traffic lanes adjacent to the stadium.
The Service ruled the stadium seats, the backstop, the flagpoles mounted on the stadium, and the equipment and circuitry contained in or attached to the score boards, and the message board were tangible personal property.
In contrast, the Service ruled the score boards and message board (excluding equipment and circuitry), field lights (including those mounted on the stadium), batter's eye screen, foul line poles, flagpoles (excluding those mounted on the stadium), and sign structures (including the basic signs) were other tangible property.
A change in the useful life of property under IRC section 167 is not a change in method of accounting.
Treas.
Reg. section 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(b).
The allowed or allowable depreciation provisions apply to IRC section 167, useful life changes.
A change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168 is a change in method of accounting.
Accordingly, the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions do not apply to recovery period changes under IRC section 168.
Instead, the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method provisions apply.
Tax Exempt Bond Financing
IRC section 168(g) requires the use of the alternative depreciation system for tax exempt bond- financed property.
Under the alternative depreciation method, the straight line method is used and the applicable recovery periods are:
Recovery Period
1.
Property not described in 2 or 3, the class life 2.
Personal property with no class life, 12 years 3.
Nonresidential real and residential rental property, 40 years

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained for sports franchises that own their sports stadium include: 1.
stadium agreement(s), 2.
purchase/sale contract(s), 3.
appraisals, 4.
real property tax assessments, 5.
tangible tax returns, and 6.
depreciation schedules and workpapers.
Inspection of real property tax assessments and tangible tax returns filed is often a quick and easy way to determine the examination potential of allocation issues.
Chapter 10 addresses purchase/sale price allocations in more detail.
Consider whether the sports franchise is improperly treating categories of assets as being separate from the stadium building and its structural components.
The sports franchise's recovery period characterizations of tangible personal property should be reviewed.
Apply the allowed or allowable depreciation provisions to IRC section 167 useful life changes.
Apply the IRC section 481(a) and IRC section 446 change in accounting method adjustment computation provisions and change in accounting method examination procedures for a change in the recovery period of a class of assets under IRC section 168.

Stadium Leases
Overview
If the stadium is being leased by the sports franchise, then leasehold improvements are a potential issue area.
The general rule is that depreciation of improvements to real property, subject to a lease, is calculated in the same manner as the depreciation deduction for the underlying property would have been calculated had the property been placed in service at the same time as the addition or improvement, without regard to the lease term.
The IRC section 467 rental agreement provisions may apply to a sports franchise's lease arrangements.
Audit Issues
1.
Whether amounts claimed as repair and maintenance expenses are lease improvements that should be capitalized under IRC section 263.
2.
Whether depreciation is being properly computed on leasehold improvements.
3.
Whether IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 apply to lease payments to related parties.
4.
Whether IRC section 467 is properly applied to rental arrangements.
Leasehold Improvements
Since a stadium lease is generally long term in nature, the examiner should consider whether amounts classified by the sports franchise as repair and maintenance expenditures are instead leasehold improvements that should be capitalized.
The right to claim depreciation is not predicated on ownership of property, but on an investment in the property.
The cost of improvements made by a lessee are generally depreciable.
IRC section 168(i)(8)(A).
Under IRC section 168, the depreciation of a capital asset is computed without regard to the lease term; thus, the cost of the improvement is recovered over the applicable recovery period.
If, upon termination of the lease, the lessee does not retain the improvements, gain or loss is computed by reference to the adjusted basis in the improvements.
IRC section 168(i)(8)(B).
If the leasehold improvements are financed with tax exempt proceeds, under IRC section 168(g)(3)(A) the recovery period used for purposes of the alternative depreciation system is not less than 125 percent of the lease term.
IRC Section 467 Rental Agreements
IRC section 467 rental agreements include leases in which the sum of the lease payments are in excess of $250,000, and either (1) at least one amount, allocable to the use of the property in one calendar year, is payable after the close of the subsequent calendar year, or (2) there are periodic increases in the rent.
IRC section 467 requires both the lessor and lessee to report rental income and expense (and interest on rent) using an accrual method of accounting.
Under IRC section 467, one of three different accrual methods may apply depending on the circumstances: 1.
constant rental accrual; 2.
accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, or 3.
accrual in accordance with the allocation of rents provided in the rental agreement, adjusted to take into account present value concepts.
The proper IRC section 467 accrual method must be determined on a lease-by-lease basis.
The constant rental method of IRC section 467(b)(2) applies when: (1) the rental agreement contains no allocation of rents, or (2) the rental agreement contains an allocation with stepped rents, a principal purpose for providing the stepped rents is avoidance of tax, and the agreement is either a leaseback or long-term agreement.
If a rental agreement does not specify how much rent is allocable to the periods under the lease, the rent payment schedule should be treated as the rent allocation schedule.
Because almost all rental agreements contain rent payment schedules, rarely will a rental agreement be subject to the constant rental accrual method because of a failure to allocate rent.
If the constant rental method applies, the agreement of the parties concerning the allocation of rent will be totally disregarded, and the rent leveling provisions of IRC section 467(b)(2) will determine the income and expenses for each taxable year during the rental period.
The constant rental amount is defined in IRC section 467(e)(1) as the amount which, if paid as of the close of each lease period under the agreement, would result in an aggregate present value equal to the present value of the aggregate payments required under the agreement.
Section 1.467-3 of the proposed IRC section 467 regulations provides a formula for determining the constant rental method.
For an IRC section 467 rental agreement for which the constant rental method does not apply, rents are generally recognized as specified in the rental agreement.
The parties will be required to report the rent allocable to the period on the accrual basis regardless of their method of accounting; thus, there will be "matching" on an accrual basis by both lessors and lessees.
If the payment of rent is deferred and adequate interest is not charged on the deferred rent, the amount of rent allocated to a period must be discounted to its present value, and interest on the unpaid rent must be taken into account as it accrues.
One reasonable method for discounting rent to present value is contained in section 1.467-2 of the proposed regulations.
The section 467 regulations also apply IRC section 467 rules to rental agreements providing for prepaid rent and/or decreasing rents.
In some cases a sports franchise may lease a stadium from a tax-exempt entity.
In such cases, if the rental agreement has decreasing rents, and if it is subject to the final section 467 regulations, application of the constant rental method should be considered.
The above constitutes just an overview of the detailed IRC section 467 provisions.
More detailed guidance on IRC section 467 can be found in the Construction ISP team's coordinated issue papers entitled: * Section 467 Rental Agreements - The Constant Rate Method, and * Section 467 Rental Agreements - The Economic Accrual Method.
Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in developing the sports franchise stadium lease include: 1.
lease agreements, 2.
concession agreements, 3.
audited financial statements (the terms of the lease agreements and related party transactions should be disclosed in the footnotes), 4.
workpapers and schedules on the application of IRC section 467, 5.
copies of the returns of any related entity returns involved, and 6.
workpapers and schedules reconciling the amount deducted on the return with the amounts per the books (Schedule M-1).
This should include year end accruals.
Large repair and maintenance costs should be reviewed to determine if they are in the nature of a capital improvement.
If the lease payments are to a related party, then IRC section 267 or IRC section 482 may apply.
Generally, under IRC section 267, related entities are required to use the same method of accounting so that there is no mismatching of income and expense between the two parties.
To clearly reflect income and prevent the evasion of taxes, IRC section 482 enables examiners to re-allocate income and expense among entities when the transactions are not at arms length.
With respect to IRC section 467, the first step is to determine if you have an IRC section 467 rental agreement.
The second step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method applies.
The third step is to determine whether the constant rental method or the economic accrual method provisions were properly applied by the sports franchise.
Because the application of IRC section 467 involves the timing of the sports franchise's lease expenses, IRC section 467 issues constitute a change in the sports franchise's method of accounting for leases.
Accordingly, examiners need to follow the change in method of accounting issue procedures in raising an IRC section 467 issue.
