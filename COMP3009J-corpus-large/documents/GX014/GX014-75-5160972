CWT Coded Wire Tag (CWT) Overview Coded Wire Tags (CWT) are small pieces (0.25 x 0.5 or 1.0 mm) of stainless steel wire that are injected into the snouts of juvenile salmon and steelhead.
Each tag is etched with a binary code that identifies its release group.
Until recently all tagged fish also had their adipose fin removed.
The adipose clip is the external flag identifying which adult fish bear a CWT to samplers, processors and fishers.
Heads of all adipose clipped fish recovered in Delta waters are sent to a lab where the tags are found using very sensitive metal detectors, dissected out of the head and decoded.
Release, catch/sample and recovery data are merged and estimates of contribution of tag groups to sampled fisheries are updated regularly.
This stock identification tool is used by researchers and managers to evaluate and estimate survival, and find out where release groups are caught.
The CWT release and recovery program is an integral part of a large coordinated program.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Overview
SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text.
Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and composited into previously rendered objects.
Text can be in any XML namespace suitable to the application, which enhances searchability and accessibility of the SVG graphics.
The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects, template objects and extensibility.
SVG drawings can be dynamic and interactive.
The Document Object Model (DOM) for SVG, which includes the full XML DOM, allows for straightforward and efficient vector graphics animation via scripting.
A rich set of event handlers such as onmouseover and onclick can be assigned to any SVG graphical object.
Because of its compatibility and leveraging of other Web standards, features like scripting can be done on SVG elements and other XML elements from different namespaces simultaneously within the same Web page.
