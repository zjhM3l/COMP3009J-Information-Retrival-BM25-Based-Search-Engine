Chapter 11 - League Expansion
Overview
Over the last decade, many sports leagues have added new sports franchises to their leagues through league expansion.
League expansion results in a significant payment by the expansion sports franchise ownership group to the league, which is then usually divided among the established sports franchises in the league.
The expansion sports franchise grants the new franchisee the exclusive right to hold league games in a specified geographical area.
Ancillary assets and rights are also transferred to the expansion sports franchise.
As part of its sports franchise, the expansion sports franchise generally has an equal right to share in future league revenue.
A major source of league revenue is revenue from national broadcasting rights and league sponsorship rights.
In most instances, the expansion sports franchise obtains the same rights and obligations as the already established sports franchises in the league.
This includes participation in league voting.
An expansion draft is often included, in which the expansion sports franchise is able to obtain the rights to player contracts held by the established sports franchises in the league.
In addition, league expansion often grants the new sports franchise additional draft picks in future player drafts.
The two major asset categories transferred for tax purposes to the expansion sports franchise are: (1) the sports franchise intangible asset, and (2) the right to acquire player contracts from the established sports franchises in the sports league.
Potential issues exist concerning whether additional intangible assets that are separable from the franchise intangible asset are also transferred from the league and the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise.
There will typically be an expansion agreement between the league and the expansion sports franchise.
As a general rule, both the expansion sports franchise and the established sports franchises are bound by the allocation of the expansion price among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement.
However, the Service is not bound by the expansion price allocation among the asset components reflected in the expansion agreement.
In First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981) the Tax Court held the Service was not bound by the allocation of costs by the sports league and the expansion sports franchise.
Generally, what is addressed in Chapter 10 on the purchase and sale of a sports franchise also applies to new sports franchises created in a sports league expansion.
Instead of reiterating what is addressed in Chapter 10, this chapter focuses on aspects unique to league expansion.

Audit Issues
1.
Whether the expansion agreement allocations among the assets transferred properly reflect the relative fair market values of the asset categories.
Specific consideration of the IRC section 1056 player contract allocation provisions are warranted.

3.
Whether the existing sports franchises in the league and the expansion sports franchise used the expansion agreement purchase/sale price allocations in their respective tax returns.
4.
Whether the expansion sports franchise properly computed its basis in the assets acquired.
Specific consideration of IRC section 1056 is warranted.
5.

Tax Law Application
Established Sports Franchises
Rev. Rul. 71-123, 1971-1 C.B. 227, addresses a professional football league expansion.
The expansion agreement granting the new sports franchise provided that the expansion sports franchise was to pay a stated amount to the sports league.
A portion of the payment was to be retained by the league, with the balance distributed among the league's established sports franchises.
Under the expansion agreement, the new sports franchise made the payments in question as consideration for the assignment of three player contracts by each of the established sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise.
The amount distributed to each of the established sports franchises exceeded the value of the three player contracts transferred.
The Service concluded that the amount received by the established sports franchises for their three player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise were taxed based on the guidance given in Rev. Rul. 67-380, 1967-2 C.B. 291.
This resulted in IRC section 1231 gains and IRC section 1245 ordinary income recapture to the established sports franchises on the sale of their player contracts.
The player contract amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4), which is addressed in Chapter 10, does not apply in computing an existing sports franchise's IRC section 1245 gains on player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise.
This is based on the legislative history behind IRC section 1245(a)(4), which indicates the player amalgamation rule only applies if a sports franchise, together with substantially all of its player contracts, is sold.
S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 Vol. 3 C.B. 128, reflects "The special recapture rules [IRC section 1245(a)(4)] would only apply in the case of the sale or exchange of the entire sports franchise and not in the case of the sale or exchange of individual player contracts."2 Footnote 2 reflects "The sale of an individual player contract will continue to be governed by the general recapture rule of sec. 1245."
Refer to Chapter 12 for additional guidance on the sale of individual player contracts.
In Rev. Rul, 71-123, the Service also concluded that the amounts received by the existing sports franchises in excess of the amounts allocable to player contracts was received by them for their franchise property right.
The Service held "the new franchise is a valuable property right that was created by the old teams *** the grant of the franchise was the sale of a capital asset by the old teams to the new team."
Therefore, the gain attributable to the franchise property rights was held to be capital gain under IRC section 1222.
In Rev. Rul. 71-583, 1971-2 C.B. 312, the Service addressed a similar situation.
In conjunction with the league's expansion, an expansion team was established in the same geographical area as an existing league franchise.
Because of this, the existing franchise was awarded a greater share of the expansion payment from the new sports franchise.
This was due to the existing franchise's relinquishment of part of its exclusive right to host games within its geographical area.
The Service concluded that even though the existing sports franchise received more than the league's other franchises (due to its greater relinquishment of property rights), the Service's ruling in Rev. Rul. 71-123 applies.
The Service held that "the amount received by the instant taxpayer for the relinquishment of its exclusive territorial rights is an amount received for the sale of a capital asset and resulted in a capital gain to the extent of the amount received."
[underlining added.]
"To the extent of the amount received" is significant in that it reflects the established sports franchise has no tax basis in the relinquishment of part of its exclusive territorial rights which is part of the franchise intangible asset.
This reflects the Service's position that the established sports franchises do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion.
Since they do not have a determinable tax basis in the portion of their franchise property rights transferred to the new sports franchise, the full amount allocated to their franchise property rights constitutes capital gains to the established sports franchises.
However, in First Northwest Industries v. Commissioner, 649 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1981), remanding 70 T.C. 817, 843 (1978), the Tax Court rejected the government's argument that the taxpayer did not have a tax basis in the franchise property rights transferred to an expansion sports franchise.
In its April 26, 1979 Action on Decision, the Service stated "The court [Tax Court] erred in holding that an existing team may offset expansion proceeds by a ratable portion of its franchise acquisition costs."
Whether the taxpayer was entitled to claim a tax basis in the franchise property rights was appealed to the Ninth Circuit.
The Ninth Circuit concluded:
"A portion of the remaining 'basic nonterminable rights' was transferred.9 The Tax Court made no attempt, however, to determine the cost of these rights.
Only if their cost can be satisfactorily ascertained may taxpayer subtract its basis in the portion transferred.10 See United States v. Laird, 556 F.2d 1224 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S.Ct. 729, 54 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978) (permitting amortization of player contracts because they had ascertainable value and limited useful life); Ralph W. Fullerton Co. v. United States, 550 F.2d 548 (9th Cir. 1977) (refusing to permit loss deduction for lost accounts where cost of individual accounts could not be satisfactorily ascertained).
All of the 'basic nonterminable rights' acquired by taxpayer derive value from the league's goodwill, and sale of new teams is a 'portioning out' of NBA goodwill.
See Rev. Rul. 71-583.
The critical question on remand will be whether there is sufficient evidence to allocate the $1,000,000 cost between those rights which were and those which were not transferred.
Recognizing that they all are related to goodwill does not resolve the question.
On remand, the Tax Court will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to ascertain the cost of the rights which were transferred.
If there is, taxpayer may subtract its basis."
Footnote number 9 reflects the rights in question, to "include the right to share in national broadcasting revenues, all-star and playoff game proceeds, expansion proceeds, and proceeds of NBA promotional and advertising activities."
As addressed above in Rev. Rul. 71-123 and Rev. Rul. 71-583, the Service's position remains that the franchise property rights transferred in a league expansion (1) do not have an ascertainable value separate from the retained franchise property rights, and (2) do not have a determinable useful life.

Expansion Sports Franchises
The same general tax provisions that apply to the purchase of an existing sports franchise also apply to the purchase of an expansion sports franchise.
Refer to Chapter 10 for additional guidance on the tax treatment given to the acquisition of a sports franchise through league expansion.
It has been asserted that IRC section 1056 does not apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion, because it does not constitute the sale or exchange of an existing sports franchise.
The government's position is that IRC section 1056 applies to the creation of a new sports franchise as part of a league expansion.
The above coverage of Rev. Rul. 71-123 and 71-583 reflects how the Service treats the creation of a new sports franchise in a league expansion as the sale or exchange of player contracts and relinquishment of part of each of the established teams' franchise property rights.
In addition, S. Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1976), 1976-3 C. B. 128, in addressing IRC section 1056 specifically states:
" The committee amendment provides that in the case of the sale or exchange of a sports franchise (or the creation of a new franchise) the amount of consideration allocated to a player contract by the transferee shall not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the contract in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer and gain (if any recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the player contract.
[underlining added]"
Accordingly, just as the provisions of IRC section 1056 apply to the purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise, the provisions of IRC section 1056 also apply to the creation of a new sports franchise via league expansion.
The IRC section 1056 provisions are addressed in detail in Chapter 10.
Example -- League Expansion
The successful sports league decides to expand by one sports franchise.
The expansion sports franchise purchase/sale price is established to be $100 million.
In addition to the numerous sports franchise property rights transferred on the awarding of the expansion franchise, the expansion franchise is entitled to acquire 3 player contracts from each of the 10 established sports franchises in the Successful sports league.
A Successful sports league committee is to negotiate with the expansion sports franchise's representatives on the fair market value of each of 30 player contracts to be transferred to the expansion sports franchise.
Each of the 10 established sports franchises is to receive an amount equal to the agreed on fair market value of its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion franchise.
Since the total fair market value of all 30 player contracts is anticipated to be substantially less than $100 million, the expansion agreement provides that the balance of the $100 million ($100 million less the agreed on fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred) is to be distributed equally among the ten established sports franchises.
The expansion agreement provides that $10 million of the balance of the $100 million not allocated to player contracts is allocated to XYZ intangible asset.
The remaining balance of the $100 million is to then be allocated to the sports franchise property right.
The sports league committee and expansion sports franchise subsequently agree that the fair market value of the 30 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise is $50 million.
Accordingly, under the expansion agreement: * 50 million is allocated to player contracts, * 10 million is allocated to the XYZ intangible, and * 40 million is allocated to the sports franchise property rights.
ABC, one of the 10 established Successful sports league franchises, had its 3 player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise valued under the agreement at $6 million ($6 million of the total $50 million fair market value of the 30 player contracts is attributable to ABC's 3 player contracts).
Accordingly, under the expansion agreement, ABC received $6 million for its player contracts, $1 million (1/10 of $10 million) for its share of the XYZ intangible, and $4 million (1/10 of $40 million) for its sports franchise property rights.
ABC's tax consequences include a likely $1 million capital gain on the XYZ intangible and a $4 million capital gain on the franchise property rights.
If ABC claimed a tax basis in either the XYZ intangible or its franchise property rights, then this would appear to be an examination issue.
Because the player amalgamation rule of IRC section 1245(a)(4) does not apply, the computation of ABC's IRC section 1245 recapture gains on the 3 player contracts is computed individually for each player contract.
The following summarizes for each of ABC's 3 player contracts (1) the sales price (fair market value) under the expansion agreement, (2) ABC's adjusted basis, (3) ABC's total gain, and (4) ABC's prior player contract amortization.
ABC's Fair Market Value ABC's Adjusted Basis ABC's Gain Prior Year Amortization Strong Player Contract $3 M $1 M $2 M $1 M Fast Player Contract $2 M $1 M $1 M $2 M Big Player Contract $1 M $1 M 0 $1 M Totals $6 M $3 M $3 M $4 M
$1 million of ABC's Strong Player Contract gain of $2 million is IRC section 1245 recapture income, and the $1 million balance is an IRC section 1231 gain.
ABC's Fast Player Contract gain of $1 million is all IRC section 1245 recapture income.
ABC has no gain on its Big player contract.
Accordingly, ABC's player contract gains are summarized as follows: IRC Sec. 1245 Recapture IRC Sec. 1231 Gain ABC's Total Gain Strong Player Contract $1 M $1 M $2 M Fast Player Contract $1 M 0 $1 M Big Player Contract 0 0 0 Totals $2 M $1 M $3 M
If the player contract amalgamation rule was improperly used, the entire $3 million gain on player contracts would all be IRC section 1245 recapture income since the prior year amortization on all 3 player contracts exceeded the $3 million total gain.
Under IRC section 1056, the new sports franchise's tax basis in the 3 player contracts acquired from ABC is $6 million.
This consists of ABC's adjusted basis in the 3 contracts of $3 million plus ABC's gain on the 3 player contracts of $3 million.
Based on the expansion agreement and the application of IRC section 1056, the expansion sports franchise's tax basis is: Player Contracts $ XX million (see comment below) The XYZ intangible asset $ 10 million The franchise intangible asset $ 40 million Total Basis $ 50 million plus $ XX million
The expansion sports franchise's tax basis includes its player contract basis amount of $6 million from ABC's 3 player contracts plus its player contract basis amounts (under IRC section 1056) from each of the 9 other established sports franchises in the Successful sports league.
The IRC section 1056 basis amount in the 3 contracts transferred from ABC equal the fair market value assigned to ABC's player contracts because ABC reported (recognized) the realized gain on each of its 3 player contracts.
This is not necessarily the case for the player contracts received from the 9 other established sports franchises.
This will not be the case to the extent that the other established sports franchises have a tax loss, or realized but unrecognized gains on any of their player contracts transferred to the expansion sports franchise.
If the expansion sports franchise claims amortization on the XYZ intangible, this would appear to be an examination issue.

Examination Techniques
Documents and information that should be obtained in developing sports league expansion purchase/sale issues include: 1.
the expansion agreement, 2.
all league and expansion sports franchise correspondence on the expansion agreement negotiations, understandings, etc., 3.
all valuation studies conducted, 4.
the expansion sports franchise agreement, 5.
the required information previously furnished by the established league sports franchises to the expansion sports franchise and the Service in accordance with IRC section 1060(b), and IRC section 1056(c) and the regulations, and 6.
your taxpayer's tax return schedules and workpapers on the league expansion purchase/sale.
Refer to Chapter 10 for coverage of examination techniques common to both a purchase/sale of an existing sports franchise and the purchase/sale of an expansion sports franchise.
As noted in Chapter 10, examination changes to the purchase/sale agreement are usually "whipsaw" adjustments that have tax consequences to both parties in the purchase/sale of an established sports franchise.
The "whipsaw" issue tax consequences of a reallocation in a sports league expansion agreement can be significant.
For example, consider the NFL which had 28 sports franchises prior to its expansion in 1993.
An examination issue on one of the NFL's 31 sports franchises, in which the expansion agreement allocation is changed, has "whipsaw" issue potential for the other 30 teams in the sports league.
Accordingly, the national ISP sports team is considering a requirement that before a sports franchise league expansion agreement allocation is challenged during an examination, the examiner must first coordinate the potential reallocation issue with the ISP sports team.
