I have to list the advantages and the disadvatages of the hubble telescope.
There was not really any specific detail on this but i did find some information.
If this can be taken in to some consideration that will most appreciated.
Thank You Very Much.

1/4/2002 I have a 8 year old son who is in a gifted and talented program through his elementary school.
All he talks about is what he wants to be when grows up.
My son wants to be the President or CEO of NASA when he grows up.
He does not want to be an astronaut, but he wants to know about NASA in general.
Could someone direct me to an information or educational area for children interested in this line of work.
He wants to some day visit a NASA Center and maybe meet some of your managers etc.
Thank you for your help and I hope to hear from someone soon.

Nice Web Info 1/12/2000 Can centrifical force be equal to the effect of gravity? 1/10/2000 We bought my son an ETX70 and then an ETX90 Meade Telescopes for Christmas.
He is having a very hard time deciding which one to keep.
We have the 90 for 30 days.
He is very interested in tracking the Hubble Telescope.
Is this possible with his telescope.
I like the 90 because the moon and other stars appear closer and the clarity is better but my son says that it moves too fast.
He also likes the Onstar system that automatically comes with the 70.
Is there any way to track the Hubble on a nightly basis? If I can get the coordinates for him, he would be greatly appreicative.
Thanks so much, Linda McKinley The University of Texas at Austin Please feel free to send any information to: Max McKinley 112 Angelia Drive Cedar Creek, Tx. 78612 1/7/2000 An excellent and very informative site.

I know nothing much about astronomy but this website has been a real eye opener for me! What happened to Neil Armstrong.....Where is he these days????? ( I dont think he took a small step, I think he took a giant leap and jumped of the end of the earth never to be seen again!! Ashame really!!) Was there ever life on Mars?...Also i watched some program that talked about "the wobble theory"; did they discover more solar systems like ours that we live in??? Well..i think i'll add this site to my favourites! Got to go so i'll see you all later! Ali-Jon Rashidi aged 20 United Kingdom Goodbye 1/4/2000 HELLO, I'M FROM MEXICO CITY AND I THINK THATA THE HUBBLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE WORLD AND IN THE HISTORY, QUESTION:IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THE VIBRATION OF THE MOON TO AMPLIFY THE RADIO WAVES? APOLINAR CHAVEZ 1/3/2000 I belong to the North Jersey Astronomical Group.
I act as the Librarian of a small collection.
Somebody has to do it.
Neat site you have.
1/3/2000 Is it possible to use the telescope to detect Gamma Ray bursters? I realize that you would have to get accurate localization from other sources 1st.
Could they narrow down the direction enough to let you point the Hubble at it? EMB:) 1/3/2000 Nice site! I found you by accident and I am glad I did! You're on my favorites list now.
1/2/2000 1.
When will the Hubble start operation capturing those wonderful images like it has earlier ? 2.
Was Meade the contract Mfg. of the hubble telescope (or part of the optical system)? Thanks, D.N. Bennett Analog Field Engineer For Texas Instruments Inc.
Novi, Michigan 1/2/2000 Great site for current events in the classroom! Some students can truly appreciate being able to access hubble information so easily! Keep it up and it will only get better! 1/2/2000 ? 1/2/2000 Terriffic job to the many professioanls who contributed to the successful STS-Service Mission on the Hubble Space Tele.
I have been following Hubble's pictures for some time and have put together a fine assembly of pictures in a powerpoint presentation for friends college courses and the public to increse awearness of Hubble's impact on the knowledge of the Universe.
What one picture can do the the imaginings and curosity of a child is that wonderment we all feel when gazing up into the heavens.

12/30/1999 how can i take a look from outher space to the planet earth this is the first time i visit your site and is big fun greetings from small holland and the big soccer club FEYENOORD 12/30/1999 great site 12/30/1999 Guten Morgen aus luzern 12/30/1999 how can i get live feed from the hubble.
12/29/1999 Congrats on the latest "Hubble Fix"! I'm glad to see its still doin its thing up there.
Its been years since I've followed any of the Shuttle missions but since we discovered it was carried on our "dish" TV network, I was able to follow daily most of the mission either live or through re-caps.
My personal stats are...
Male Married (27) yrs 48 years old (2) children, girl 17yrs, boy 15yrs HOBBIES...Ham Radio, computers, active Seti@home member.
I work to much and play to little Keep up the good work O 12/29/1999 Happy New Year from city of Modena, Italy.
It would appeal to to me to have of the gadgets of memory of your mission, where I can buy? Thanks.
Excused the errors 12/29/1999 You have an really good page with lotsa informations.
GO on! 12/29/1999 Excellent site.
Left NASA/Goddard 2 years ago (supported the HST Servicing Mission 2).
It was great to see the pictures of the people that I used to work with.
It is a major accomplishment of the people who supported the mission.
I do not think people realize the effort, which goes into supporting a mission like this.
Great job! Devin Tailor (PGT Toolman).
12/29/1999 I AM 90 YEARS OLD, TALKED ABOUT HOBBLE WITH GRAND CHILDREN.
CAN'T FIND THE HEIGHT OF IT /HOW MANY FLOORS?/ FOUND THE WEIGHT IN SPACE /!6.000 METERS.
I ASKED SOME OTHER ADDRESS AND THEY WOULD'NT ANSWER UNLESS I SENT THEM: "cnshd" what on earth is it? Anyhow not important just interest for conversation 12/29/1999 I AM 90 YEARS OLD, TALKED ABOUT HOBBLE WITH GRAND CHILDREN.

Anyhow not important just interest for conversation 12/29/1999 Keep up he good work! 12/29/1999 THIS IS GREAT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THRER IS ANY SCREEN SAVERS THAT I CAN DOWNLOAD FORM THE HUBBLE THANK YOU DAVID DRISKILL 12/29/1999 I would like to see actuall pictures of what hubble has taken.
Do you have a specific site for these? If so how current are they? 12/28/1999 You are doing great! I was suprised how quickly the Hubble was repaired [or updated].
I know your time was cut short so I was wondering what services were done and which were left undone.
12/28/1999 I am so happy the Hubble will be up and running again - can't wait for new images and new discoveries ! 12/28/1999 12/28/99 To the Crew of SM3A - What a magnificent performance! What a job! We have followed this mission from the beginning, and can't believe how flawlessly, how intrepidly, you guys fixed OUR Hubble (in spite of glitches).
Well, actually, yes we can: we know how well you trained.
We know how hard you worked.
We are proud that this was an international crew.
Know how important this instrument is to us, though we may be bricklayer, accountant, or teacher.
It is our sharp eye on the universe, our window on creation, our time machine.
Thank you gentlemen.
Thank you NASA(people).
Robert 
Most politicians need education.
I wish we could see more time spent also on seti search.
I do my best to convince the mich. congressmen and reps of the importance of coming out of the dark ages and research the benefits of science and the programs of Nasa.
Hopefully we will see a successful year in the space program and more funds for nasa work., Happy new year and thanks again for a wonderful home page.
Don Gillette 12/28/1999 STS103 demonstrates, once again, the value of trained human presence in space to achieve delicate operations.
Human dexterity will be difficult to achieve with automated stand-alone robots for some time to come.
Hopefully, ISS missions will resume soon to continue showing the value of human presence in space.
Eventhough it has been a while since I worked at JSC, I still follow the space program with great interest.
Looking forward to future STS and ISS flights.
Thanks 12/28/1999 I'am very interested to your works.Thank yow very much.
From Italy luigi tosi 12/28/1999 i am a arhitecht and designer,how can a help for the nasa , 12/28/1999 How's the temperature in space? Is it too cold? or too hot? Thanks! 12/28/1999 I ALWAYS BEEN INTRESTED IN SPACE AND SPACE TRAVEL.
EVERY SHUTTLE MISSION I WATCH IT TAKE OFF AND TRY TO WATCH IT LAND.
AND WHAT IT IS DOING IN SPACE.
WE HAVE A LOCAL TV NETWORK I WATCH THAT SHOWS WHAT IS GOING ON.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
AND THANK YOU FOR THIS WEB SIGHT IT IS VERY INTRESTING 12/28/1999 what,s the real lifetime of hst? how often does it require replacments? by the way, thanks for this real christmas present, best luck for the astronauts.
zoltan from hungary? 12/28/1999 which is nasa`s next step on the mars project? please send me information about what are you doing now and which will be your next projects.
12/27/1999 Great site.
I wrote a paper on the Hubble and have been monitoring the Great One ever since.
NASA RULES 12/27/1999 NASA, You are doing great.
The Web pages are fantastic, it is great to be able to get the photographic and video images in almost live and live time.
Is there any way to get all of the released images on a cd? The high resolution pictures are incredible.
Thanks JT 12/27/1999 Hello, I just came here tonight.
I'll probably e-mail you about things at a latter date.
12/27/1999 Dear Sir: With the prepairing of the hubble space telescope is there any chance useing it to search for the lost Mars Lander that was launch months ago that was lost months ago.
You can contact me at sbillings@comnet.ca I try to keep up with all the Nasa information i can.
Really injoy this web.Hope you stay online Robert Billings 12/27/1999 I just want to thank the crew for the wonderful picture of the moon rising over Earth! It ment a lot for someone who for now can only dream about going up there herself:).
But I will one day ! Thanx again! 12/27/1999 Congratulations.
Excellent coverage of the operation.
Kept me up into early hours of the morning.
Only a P75 but Realplayer G2 seemed to do the trick though the images were a bit broken up at times.
Sound pretty good.
12/27/1999 Dear shuttle-crew Welcome home after doing your wonderfull job up there!!!! Jo Smits, 5823CH 17, The Netherlands.
12/27/1999 Realy enjoyed watching but towards the end the net was so colgged that I missed the touch down lets hope things can be improved for the next mission, looking forward to the next.
12/27/1999 Als Schweizer bin ich sehr stolz, dass "unser" Herr Claude Nicollier an dieser sehr erfolgreichen Mission mitgearbeitet hat.
Ich mÃ¶chte ihm und der ganzen Crew auf diesem Wege herzlich gratulieren und wÃ¼nsche allen die diese Message lesen, ein gutes neues Jahr.
Happy landing Claude !! Freudliche GrÃ¼sse Space-Kusi 12/27/1999 To the Crew of STS-103: Good work! We knew you could do it! Scott 
12/27/1999 good site 12/27/1999 good 12/27/1999 I have really enjoyed being with the NASA website this morning and watching the wind-down of this wonderful mission.
Thanks so much for the wonderful images and all the other neet stuff.
12/27/1999 Felicitations Ã  toute l'Ã©quipe et Ã  Claude qui a fait un travail superbe dans le vide sidÃ©ral.
Happy Y2k Un pÃ©diatre rencontrÃ© au mess de Payerne 12/27/1999 please tell me how do you have o2 in a small ship for all the people to have? 12/27/1999 U know people: It is very nice what u are doing but ... u need artists up there, u need better pictures, not tecnical quality but artistic quality ... get it? Artists are the only people that can bring something to latter share, well that would be too much, painters,etc, but in the betwen take some photographer, so we can enjoy the realy beauty off our planet.
My opinion people, thanks for the work u do, love u all.
Frank.
12/27/1999 Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous mission.
Thank you so much for all of the information and coverage.
All of the missions are fun to keep track of but Hubble is special.
(I have a gorgeous photo of HST as wallpaper on my computer.)
12/27/1999 I would like to receive information about all kind of events in the mission, because I am very interested about this issues.
thanks.
12/27/1999 I have been following with great interest, I live in the UK and watching every move and hearing every sound on the pc shows that every one all over the world can follow progress in the making, I will of cause be watching for up and coming chances to join in on future shuttle launches etc 12/27/1999 Hi Guys, Enjoyed the live video feeds from the latest Hubble Space walks...The picture quality is very good thru my cable modem.
Thanks for the opportunity for access to the misson, Mr Reinke 12/27/1999 Hi, We are unable to download live video pictures in Quicktime from Hubble,Can you help us? regards Damian 
12/27/1999 Thanks for doing a great job.
Nicholas Age 6 12/27/1999 with the gyros, will scientists be able to see further into space?will there be control of the Hubble telescope?will HST be able to better assist with any work done with a retry for an unmanned flight;i.e triagulation,assit as a attennna between earth and mars? or have infrared or other optics that will assist in visualizing the depths of mars.?thank you for your time.and good luck.
12/27/1999 Hi! nice thing you did there! congratulations! and its nice to see my uncle here on this page.
keep on taking pictures! 12/27/1999 Great stuff.
I thought Hubble was going to damage Orbiter when it was loaded in the bay.
A dangerous job well done.
Keep on the good work for humanity's sake.
12/27/1999 Hi...
My name is Mel Dawson.
I have been an avid African-American amatuer Astronomer since I have been 12 years old.
As rare as that may seem, it was the dream of my mentor Gary Barabino, and myself that one day an astronomical observatory could be placed in orbit to survey the Heavens in the vaccuum of space, which would be devoyed of the turbulence caused by our earth bound atmosphere.
It gives me great pleasure that our dreams and aspirations have come true with the Hubble Space Telescope.
The investment in this venture is definitely one of our civilizations most credible undertakings.
By studing the remotely distant objects of our past, I believe we will become closer to understanding the origination of our universe.
I know with the HST we will undoubtably shorten the distance and time it will take to accomplish this effort.
Astronomy has propelled me, my family, and career to levels far and beyond the stereotypical prejudgements that were established in yesteryear.
I feel confident that with Godspeed your diligents will continue to solve the intricate puzzles that makes this universe tick, via exploration by the Hubble Space telescope.
Sincerely, Melvin Dawson 12/27/1999 Congratulations NASA Happy New Millennium from 'Glorious DEVON' UK 12/27/1999 Great job on the Hubble misson.
I look forward to future flights and new insights into the universe from Hubble.
Again, many thanks for a job well done.
12/27/1999 Great job on the Hubble misson.
I look forward to future flights and new insights into the universe from Hubble.
Again, many thanks for a job well done.
12/27/1999 nasa, you people are doing a great job with the space program.
were those pictures that came back to earth on christmas nite with the lightening, storms breaking out allover the world? were all those ones that where over south america storms breaking out? was wondering.
it looked like a war zone with bombs going off almost continually.
is this their rainy season or something? 12/27/1999 i would like to know about the retired monkees from the space progra. are they being cared for in their retirement? 12/26/1999 Thank You for your brave and daring repair to the Hubble!! 12/26/1999 I am a Canadian fan,from Montreal.I have watch the hole flight from the bigening,and I find it amazing the way you guys are staying cool.....Tank,s for the best show on earth and for keeping science such a interesting field Johnny Lajoie 12/26/1999 Great job to the crew, and the web page crew.

12/26/1999 I have enjoyed watching the nasa channel over the past seven days.
I have even taped a lot of the sessions.
The program was watched from take off the the capsure of the hubble telescope.
12/26/1999 Hi there Discovery-Team! Great job out there in the skys! Keep up the good work.
Especially Claude for the excellent work on exchanging Hubble's brains (now that's what I call precision-work (*grin*)).
Hope you have a safe return and that NASA won't encounter any y2k-Bugs.
Max 12/26/1999 Just to think that one day earthlings will visit the outte most reaches of the heavens... wow! Keep on truckin' 12/26/1999 Greetings,This just bogels the mind as to what is out there.
And all we can do is look, but with out you doing what you do best we coudnt even do that.
This Earth is such a small place, why cant people learn to get along with one other.
12/26/1999 what future missions do you have planned? 12/26/1999 Outstanding.
You are living my dream.
Since a child I have been fascinated with all things above the atmosphere, and wanting to visit them.
But, alas, that is not for me, it is for you.
Keep it up with Mars, and the rest of them.

Bristol U.K. 12/26/1999 I am new on the web and my first site that I visited was Nasa, as I am very interested in space technology and astrophysics.
I am 41 years old and from my early days I was very interested in star formations and was lucky to see the whole space adventure of your country and I was pourd during the 1969 touch down on the moon and still I am very exited with this event.
Now, I wish all of you best wishs for the new year and for the new millinium.
Thaank you for your attention.
Joseph Vella "St. John" Bordin Str Pieta' MSD 09 Malta Europe 12/26/1999 I think that this is a great site.

Isle of Gran Canaria(Spain) 12/26/1999 Great Job, Guy's out in space.
You really know how to Space walk.
12/26/1999 per aspera ad astra !! 12/26/1999 God Bless you! My kids check on you daily.Thank you for all that you do.Portland Oregon USA 12/26/1999 This has to be the COOLEST site Ive had the pleasure of visiting in a while.
Thank you so much for this.
The information is incredibly interesting and the pictures way awesome! Keep up the good work! Cheers from NEW ZEALAND! Grace S. 12/25/1999 Thank you for metricating your CosmicKids pages to the extent of adding the metric equivalents of quantities parenthetically.
Perhaps you did this as a result of my comment two months ago.
No matter; you did it and that's great! First, a short comment: the unit name kilometer should not be capitalized unless it is the first word of a sentence.
This is true of all unit names in the international metric system; normal rules of grammar apply to unit names, including capitalization and plurals.
Second, may I point out that your conversions exaggerate the precisions, though.
For example, on your main CosmicKids page http://hubble.gsfc.nasa.gov/classrm.html you state, "NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is sending a brave seven-member crew about 370 miles (595.33 Kilometers) above Earth to tune-up the Hubble Space Telescope."
If the stated altitude is to the nearest mile (at best!), then the distance should be given to the nearest 1 km (actually, the nearest 2 km would suffice probably).
The inadvertent impact of overly specifying conversions makes the metric units look needlessly complicated, especially for younger students.
NIST has some excellent guidance on converting to the correct precision in NIST Special Publication 811 ("Guide for the Use of the International System of Units(SI)"), Section B.7.2.
This is available online at http://physics.nist.gov/Document/sp811.pdf I'm sure that there are many scientists and engineers at GSFC who can help you with this.
I would be glad to provide some free guidance, too, if that would be useful.
best regards, James R. Frysinger College of Charleston Dept. of Physics and Astronomy 12/25/1999 I am born in 11/24/62.
Micro-wave, hi-fi set miniature, compact disc, internet and ....NASA ! Some food get hot on my micro-wave, during this time (and listening a CD from my hi-fi), I'm connected by internet to see this beautiful pictures about the Discovery hubble mission on the NASA web site ! Who can tell me it was possible 25 years ago ? absolutely fantastic.
Thank you.
Bruno Biagio from Barcelona.
12/25/1999 The Discussion Board was a great idea! I enjoyed interacting and also reading the postings of others to see what interested them.
This helps me appreciate better where my college students "are coming from".
I hope that you continue to run discussion boards again for other missions and that you also pass this neat idea along to other NASA centers.
best regards, James R. Frysinger College of Charleston Dept. of Physics and Astronomy 12/25/1999 I like the site!!! thanks 12/25/1999 I thouroughly enjoyed visitnig this site, as i felt that I was part of the mission.
Well done to the crew and support of this mission.
Kassiem Adams,Cape Town, South Africa.
12/25/1999 Congratulation for all hubble mission during last holiday i wish my kid can be like you 12/25/1999 soo, I find a link to discussion board and "Kread our guestbook" but HOW i ask again, does one leave a MESSAGE! Why not a discernable link? James R Durbin, former Santiago station employee.

Merci de nous avoir fait rÃªver et je te souhaite un Bon Millnium.
I wisch for the Discovery Members a Merry christmas and good New Millenium.
Congratulation for the Great Job on the Hubble.
Torrent FranÃ§ois 12/25/1999 I would like to know also whether there is a site to view what the Hubble is seeing in either present time (especially or otherwise.
You're doing great.
Let's hope the future is bright for NASA money-wise (maybe an answer to that can be given).
What is the schedule for Mars? Also any future plans for a base on our moon? Thanks David Schram http://www.whisp.com/~dschram Think You're Healthy? - Not Yet 12/25/1999 Is there a site for viewing Hubble images inreal time (ie see what the telescope is viewing at any one time )? Anyway congradulations on a great mission.
Ray Spencer 12/25/1999 We enjoy the Web-site.
It gives us the most up-to-date information, and there is so much to read and look at.
Thank you....

I'm always curious about the Hubble scope and its progress.
Thanks.
12/25/1999 Wem darf ich danken fÃ¼r die unvergesslichen Bilder des Universums, welches das HST uns allen liefert? Dem unglaublichen Mut und Einsatz der Astronauten im All gilt mein Dank hier im Besonderen.
Die Bilder gaben mir Einsicht, dass es dort draussen viele Dinge gibt die wir Menschen wissen sollten um auch unser Leben hier auf dieser Welt in neuem Licht zu entdecken.
Special thanks to Mr. Nicollier and all Americans this great support of Life on Space! 12/25/1999 DOING JUST GREAT 12/25/1999 please advise me by e-mail on the next mission to go up.
12/25/1999 For nighttime re-entries, MORE re-entry information needs to be given to the public.
It is the thrill of a life-time to see the shuttle re-enter the atmosphere.
Re-entry paths and times for the affected area will give public support a boost.
12/25/1999 Ich mÃ¶chte gerne von euch einen Pin oder AufnÃ¤her haben, in Deutschland ist soetwas nicht zu bekommen.
Falls doch schreibt mir bitte wo! ( MissionsaufnÃ¤her ) 12/25/1999 Merry Christmas and have a Happy New Year!!! 12/25/1999 This is a very cool web site.
I haven't seen robotic camera technology being used like this before.
Though, If I were a member of staff, I might get a bit annoyed knowing that people could zoom away in to my face at any time whilst I was working! Another cool robot site can be viewed at http://www.freedom.artm.ulst.ac.uk Sure, you're not interested, but what the heck! Cahal 12/25/1999 Bom primeiramente queria dizer gosto do site da NASA e queria que vc pudessem me mandar fotos do planeta marte (solo) 12/25/1999 I THINK YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OUT THERE,BUT PEOPLE DOWN HERE WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU KEEK HIDING WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH THE FACE ON MARS 12/25/1999 Keep up the good work.
Good luck on your missions in the upcoming year 12/25/1999 ciao da flavio e alessandro videociak lissone (MI) ITALY 12/25/1999 Great work, both in space and on this web site !! My children and I thourouhgly enjoyed watching the videos and checking out the live feed cams... makes us all feel a little closer to what you are doing! You all are true heros.
12/25/1999 QUAL A EXTENCAO DA SUPERFICIE LUNAR,E QUAL A SUA COMPOSISAO? QUAL A MAIS PROFUNDA E MAIOR CRATERA LUNAR? DE QUE SAO COMPOSTOS OS METEOROS E COMETAS? 12/25/1999 I think that the Hubble has been(and is)a great gift to mankind! 12/25/1999 Great Claude Nicollier and the whole crew, you will bring us the marvellous Heaven a little bit closer.
Merry Christmas.

I desperately want a QSL card of this mission Edgar Abraham ZS6AFF 100 Swart Street OUDORP KLERKSDORP ZIP 2571 South Africa 12/25/1999 How Do I send a message to the Astronauts.
I desperately want a QSL card of this mission Edgar Abraham ZS6AFF 100 Swart Street OUDORP KLERKSDORP ZIP 2571 South Africa 12/25/1999 how many people are occupied by the project hubble thanks 12/25/1999 The mission to fix and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most important space missions of the last 10 years.
Our scientific information on cosmic distances, luminosities, and spectra are improved independently of our knowledge of the correct bolometric corrections to apply to starlight by this important apparatus.
And it is connected with our visionary sensibilities, our ability to pick out meaningful scenes from the stardust, so that Hubble enthusiasts have become eager readers of the tea-leaves of space.
Charting the heavens with Hubble leads us not only to better data on the atomic objects of study, the stars and other objects, but also allows us to map the scenes we find in the stardust onto maps of the celestial sphere, so we find out more about how imaging nebulae and imaging galaxies sub-illustrate the story we find in the constellations.
The appearance of the nebulae as they are rotated must fit in with the transformation of the constellation symbols as they move across the sky, as Orion rises like a proud wing, then stands in his Winter Cresent of Stars wearing his wing like a robe, the horsehead nebula B33 dangling from his belt as Leo bolts up from behind to pursue him, the two seperated by the long, astonishing tapestry of NGC 2264, crowned by S.Monocerotis.
Hubble will help make the cosmic symbolism more accessible to our vision as it helps us refine our models of the stars.
12/25/1999 Merry christmas! Great job on the Hubble!!! 12/25/1999 As this will be the last Shuttle flight of the 20th Century are there any plans to commemorate the first flight of the 21st? A set of postage stamps for example postmarked Cape Canaveral would be one way to reach the many thousands of like minded people who would like something to remember the efforts of ALL those involved in Space Exploration by! A signed photograph of the crew of this current mision at the end of the 20th Century would be gratefully received if it is at all possible! Sincerely Martin Dewhurst 77 Park Way, Pound Hill, Crawley, West Sussex,RH10 3BS,U.K.
12/25/1999 Hallo Claude, Du bist einfach super!! 12/25/1999 merry x-mas and happy 2000 from Belgium keep up the good work! 12/25/1999 Merry Christmas from Arizona, I am not sure if anyone from NASA really reads these, or if they are just there for the public, but I applaud the work that you ALL do, and Wish you all a Happy Holiday, and a Safe and sucessful New year.
12/25/1999 This is agreat website.
I have always been interested about learning more about space travel ways to learn more the launches and more from nasa. 12/25/1999 Discovery: You are doing just great.
Many of us in Canada are watching you.
Merry Christmas.
We pray for you in your work and for your safe return.
Bruce Crozier 12/25/1999 You men and women are doing one hell of a job.
I am proud to be a part of this great nation.
Thank you all for your dedication and hard work.
12/25/1999 What photographic equiptment was used on this mission? Why wasn't flash used in many of the photographs? Fill in flash would of enhanced many of your shots.
Just wondering.
As a photographer I dream of being on the shuttle or space station as a photojournalist some day.
12/25/1999 Hi, everyone.
This is an awsome site as far as I am concerned.
Great information site for learning about the various aspects of the timelines involved in producing a successful mission.
I have always kept track by news and media sources, but for some reason, neglected to consider the internet.
I am glad I have.
This has given me a chance to download info and video files to show my children.
OK, who am I kidding.
I love it more that they like it.
But it is still a great way to add more knowledge to the ole gray matter.
Thanks for doing this site, George W. Giesenhagen Kewanee, Illinois 12/25/1999 I think this web site is AWESOME!!!! 12/25/1999 I am proud to be able to live in such an exciting time of exploration.
The NASA people are truly an inspiration!! Great Job and keep up the great work! God Bless! 12/24/1999 To all the people behind the scenes that have made space exploration a reality, I thank you.
I want to wish all of a Merry Christmas and awonderfully great New Century!! With many more fabulous discoveries ahead.
Keep up the good work and God Bless.
12/24/1999 I really apreciate having this be available to all of us who couldn't come along.
Thank you for fixing our telescope, and have a safe landing........Denny Wright 12/24/1999 Good luck, astronauts! Best wishes from your Brazilian friend.
12/24/1999 My daughter ask,"In space is time any different than on earth?" Does an hour in space seem the same as an hour on earth? 12/24/1999 My daughter ask,"In space is time any different than on earth?" Does an hour in space seem the same as an hour on earth? 12/24/1999 Are you having Turkey and all the fixin's tommorrow night and how do you keep the bird from flying away? 12/24/1999 Spotted Santa? I expect a photo soon.
Dodi Davies 12/24/1999 Very nice pages form the hubbel 12/24/1999 why not send one of the shuttles to the moon or mars,it would be cheaper in the long run especially getting it back than getting it there.Arthur c clarkes book greatings carbon based bipeds chapter six uses of the moon will explain all.
12/24/1999 you are doing a great job the views are out of this world hope that you all have a very good xmas 12/24/1999 how expensif is a flight of a space shuttle? 12/24/1999 When the shuttle captures the HST, how close are the orbits? If the two are in slightly different orbits, how are the forces handled? 12/24/1999 I am really enjoying the coverage of the repair mission.
Its about time that the Hubble got fixed.
The entire US and the world should be thankful for the work that goes into all of the shuttle missions as NASA does what it does best.
12/24/1999 I enjoy reading the messages and seeing the pictures from space.
12/24/1999 Karen Shramke Lee Buschman 12/24/1999 Enjoy the up to date information on your web site, keep up the good work! 12/24/1999 I have followed the Space Programme since day one,and it has been awesome.The only real setback,was the fire allthose years ago on Apollo One,it still hurts all these years later.
TO THE CREW OF DISCOVERY -- A MERRY CHRISTMAS A HAPPY NEW YEAR GOD SPEED TO A SAFE LANDING 12/24/1999 Great job 12/24/1999 You all do a very fine job and have my support.
I wish everyone at NASA a Merry Christmas and A very Happy New Year.
May all your missions be safe.
12/24/1999 Dears First of all I want profit this time to wish a Merry Christmas and Happy New.
I have got no questios for the moment, but I want to thank you very much for your efforts to help us to understand the Universe thaat we, The Humanity belongs.
I can not imagine where were we without assistance aand tenacity.
Miguel Angelo Barreto da moura from Cape Verde 12/24/1999 Viele GrÃ¼ÃŸe aus Wildau (Deutschland) Super Seiten !!! 12/24/1999 Great site.
Thank you for the updated information and real life experience.
It is a true education.
Sincerely, Judy and Jessica Middleburg Florida 12/24/1999 Friday December 24.1999.
Dear HubbleCrew: I think you guys are doing a great job with your mission, keep up the good work., When you get the pictures up and running again you need to show more 3-d images and galaxys forming., also I think you need to show really faraway galaxies., Thank you., Sincerley, ChrisHill., Also(StarTrekFan.)
12/24/1999 Hello.
Great job.
Godspeed and Merry Christmas to you all.
Get that Telescope humming again! 12/24/1999 Comments: As I said in my Christmas Message I feel that the work you do is very important and vital to the future of mankind.
If we plan on being around for the years and millenniums to come, we must do what is required to ensure mankind's survival.
One of the things we must do is, improve our ability to handle any eventuality.
I believe one way we can do this is by increasing our ability to Live work and play in Space.
We must make the use of Space profitable.
In order to make space profitable we must get more people involved and ready to work in this environment and instill professionalism in these future workers.
I can think of a few industries, which may make a profit listed below.
I am also aware that we need to make more technological break-throughs in a number of areas: R
Tim 12/24/1999 Very impressed with the way the Crew have fixed the Hubble.
Bet the view is awesome.
12/24/1999 Good job!!!! 12/24/1999 May the Holidays be especially significant to those of you in space.
May everyone in Nasa keep their chin up and plow on ahead with akk your important work.
I have foolowed space expolration ever since Sputnik I went up on my twelth birthday.
While the reasons for the "Race for Space" may have changed, we nonetheless need to explore our future homes.
12/24/1999 Hi my name is Denys Alvarez I like the study of the stars when I grow up I would like to be an astronomer.Keep up the good work.
12/24/1999 YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB AND DOING IT FAST!!!! 12/24/1999 Super!! I might not want to work there with the eyes of the internet on me, but a great way to "visit" without the hassle.
Nice job 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas everybody, who are living on the Planet and working on the orbit.
12/24/1999 Merry Christmas!!! I write you from MADRID(Spain).We hope you are all fine at the return of this so hard mission.Also I want to send a message to Pedro Duque (ESA Astronaut), who was here last year giving a confference with the rest of STS-95 Shuttle Crew: Pedro haber cuando te volvemos a ver por alli arriba, un saludo de un amigo y vecino de tu barrio.
Since I saw them so near me, I`ve been follow all the shuttle space trips with so much interest.
Have a nice home return, and good luck guys!!! Angel Gago Oliveira.
Madrid.
angelgago@mundivia.es 12/24/1999 I've been following the space program since the early days of Viking and Redstone.
NASA has come a long way since then.
You have a tough job ahead of you because most people don't understand what it takes to put men or machines in space.
They also don't realize the interaction between space and world technololy.
GOD BLESS YOU AND BRING YOU HOME SAFELY.
12/24/1999 Hi gentlemen I am Ganesh, from Bangalore, INDIA.
I like to ask you, how could astronauts up there in space keep there body fit, so that they could not have much difficulty when they return to mother earth.
Thanks, looking forward to your reply.
12/24/1999 How many further missions to Mars are in the planning stage and are there other missions ready to launch at this time? 12/24/1999 Good Luck to all 12/24/1999 I have been wondering (since the astronauts had so much trouble with the bolts on the hubble telescope) why they dont use some other type of fasteners, to secure the different components in the telescope, such as magnets.
I would think that in the vacume of space there wouldn't be anything that would be able to jar such components loose.
12/24/1999 I'm a computer network engineer.
I'm glad to hear that Y2K computer problem is not only on earth as well in the space too.
Since a young fellow I'm interested in space and space communication such as Ham-Radio.
How do you navigate through the space without a collision with some old items circle around the globe.
So your speed must be up to 25'000 km/hour.
I wish you a good time up in the space and I wish you merry X-Mas and a happy new year 2000.
With kind regards - Wolfgang Sidler - Switzerland http://www.wolfgang-sidler.com (w.sidler@tic.ch) 12/24/1999 I am a Pharmacist and I've been following the Space program from the beginning.
My question is that at one point years ago the space Crew took amphetamines.
I would like an answer to this to clear my mind, and I'm sure that I would also take something to go to space.
thanks and let me say whatever the cost I'm willing to pay taxes for this.........
12/24/1999 We are looking forward to the resumption of the observations, although I'm a novice back-yard stargazer, I find the Deep Space photos awe-inspiring! 12/24/1999 I am a Pharmacist and I've been following the Space 12/24/1999 Meka nang niyamai! 12/24/1999 I was born 500 year too early.
12/24/1999 Im very surprise to see a Intel 486 into Hubble because is my computer processor 12/24/1999 See anything unusual especially around Christmas? Not in space, but down here.
Anyway, watch out for a fast moving sleigh, a bunch of raindeer and a Jolly Old Man in Red! We wouldn't want any collisions!!! 12/24/1999 Doing real good up there.
To bad you can't push that reset button on the MPL..ha.
Have A Safe Trip Home!! TEXAS.
12/24/1999 Merry Christmas to the Shuttle crew from Sunny South Africa, 12/24/1999 The images from space are INCREDIBLE! Thank you for making them available! 12/24/1999 Thanks to NASA's weather speculation for the August total eclipse of the sun I was able to see the total eclipse at Karlsruhe in Germany.
An experience my wife and I will never forget:-) 12/24/1999 You guys are doing great.
I always look forward to coming here! 12/24/1999 I would like to tell you that I like your site.
I like especially the pic's.
Merry X-mas and a happy new year.
Special for Mr. Claude Nicollier: Joyeux noel et und bonnÃ© heureuse anneÃ©....
Volker Schmekel, Bern (Switzerland) 12/24/1999 What is the maximum time that the back-pack support system can keep an astronaut safely on a space walk? What kind of safety backups are in place in event of a component failure in the back-pack? 12/24/1999 Great job with both the telescope programs and the web site.
The discoveries are beyond amazing.
12/24/1999 I think this is a wonderful site and to see those gentlemen actually work over my computer is amazing.
I wish you all a Merry Christmas, those that fly and stay on the ground! Ric Valentyn - Edmonton, Alberta, Canada 12/23/1999 As you work on the Hubble telescope, are all tools tethered? Also, on December 22, about 1:44 am from our location in Lawton, Oklahoma, we were to see thew moon as much as 14% brighter.
How was the view from the shuttle? 12/23/1999 Alan Rhodes Science Teacher McCluer High School 1896 S New Florissant Road Florissant, Misouri 63033 12/23/1999 Having just finished reading what happened to the old Soviet Buran shuttle project, you're doing awfully damn well.
I also believe it's a shame NASA does not consider a degree in Geography sufficiently scientific to get into the space program.
12/23/1999 THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT PICTURES, I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE LIFTOFF! I AM 6 YEARS OLD, PLEASE FIX THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE SO THAT THE WORLD CAN SEE PICTURES FROM THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE ON THIS SITE AT A FUTURE DATE.
MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.
YOU ARE THE LUCKY FEW WHO ARE AT THIS MOMENT A HANDFUL OF ASTRONAUTS TO WALK AND LIVE IN SPACE.
HOPEFULLY IN MY LIFETIME I MAY GET TO DO THE SAME.
MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL OF YOU.
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
MICHAEL NORRIS BURLINGTON, ON CANADA AGE 6 12/23/1999 FANTISTIC JOB! KEEP IT UP.
I FULLY SUPPORT THE SPACE PROGRAM AND ALWAYS WILL.
BRIAN 12/23/1999 AL Krusky Jr. age 39 Canada.. despite the amount of dollars being spent on the space program I believe the money was well spent..
just as any new field of technology some things and experiments are not going work..
I have watched the space program since I was a child.. often thinking about how many miles that golf ball has gone to date.
I believe the public despite its complaints do so enjoy watching and cheering NASA to victory..
I have seen many a victory from NASA..
I was waiting just as your scientists to hear the first audio stream from Mars. disappointed however we will hear audio and I will be listening.
for the phones.
It still amazes me about the computer technology NASA used in their earlier moon mishons, I can only imagine the amount of power your systems have today.
I would have loved using this site as a child..
this site is a great idea.
My wife and my self look forward to hearing from you.. always wanted to see that launch vehicle you still have service.
great work to all of you..
AL ANN KRUSKY..
12/23/1999 I don't really have any questions, but I would like to tell you how much I enjoy the opportunities this site provides for those of us who follow the space program with passion, but will never be able to make the "journey".
Thank you for keeping the world informed.

12/23/1999 What is it like in space 12/23/1999 I feel that NASA has the best web site on the internet,It makes one proud to be american,With the work that is being done by our Astronauts repairing the Hubble telescope, The great web site that we have to follow it.
Keep up the good work.
12/23/1999 Why is there a loss of signal during the Shuttle's orbit.
I thought there were enough relay satellites so there would be a continuous signal.
When is this problem going to be corrected? Is there going to be an IMAX movie about Hubble to that the public can see the quality of the photographs Hubble has produced? What has Hubble learned about the center of our galaxy? Can we now predict the age of our galaxy? What is the farthest distance that Hubble can see? Has Hubble been used to photograph any of the planets and their moons? Why does the broadcast.com signal jerk around? If I had a direct NASA TV signal would there be a smooth picture? I am using the broadband (300K) signal.
12/23/1999 i would like to know when or how to see astronauts at work 12/23/1999 There are still folks out here who believe in the importance of the work NASA is doing.
The Lunar landings, the unmanned Mars exploratory missions, and the planetary fly-bys rank as the most exciting and most significant achievements of this millenium.
I'm still hoping for a manned mission to Mars within my lifetime (I'm 52).
Please make it so! 12/23/1999 Great job gang! I've been watching the live feed over the internet and it's simply fantastic! Merry Christmas.
12/23/1999 God Speed.
We love you 12/23/1999 GOOD LUCK AND GOD SPEED 12/23/1999 I have been following the space program since Sheppard did his suborbital flight! This is such a treat...I was missing the launches on t.v.
I am so glad to have found this web site.
Keep up the good work!!! Thanks 12/23/1999 Hallo! Die Info,s die Ihr anbietet sind wirklich sehr interessant.
Die Bilder aus dem All einzigartig schÃ¶n.
Es wÃ¤re allerdings besser, wenn Ihr die Live Video Ãœbertragung Ã¶fter zeigen wÃ¼rdet.
Ansonsten macht weiter so und viel GlÃ¼ck fÃ¼r die Zukunft.

With gratitude, Jennifer Capella (yes, same name as the star in Aurige, I named myself after that!) 12/23/1999 how is it in space during Christmas and also do you get a chance to see any Christmas lights.
did you prasnts with you I will like to go up in with you from alan 12/23/1999 To all the Crew and Team "keep safe".
Thanks NASA for a great site, I wish all web pages were as good as yours.
12/23/1999 I THINK NASA IS THE BEST THING ON THE INTERNET.
AND HAS THE BEST OF THE BEST WEB SITES.
AND THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE IS MAKING THE FUTURE OF SPACE TO SEE MORE CLEAR TO UNDERSTAND.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. 12/23/1999 visited your site today as a novice internet user. i am very impressed.
thanks for your open information supply.
-- wim de morree / pe0wdm / the netherlands -- 12/23/1999 We are thrilled to be able to communicate with the crew.
May all at NASA have a blessed holiday season.
Bill and Kitty Gietzen trudy1709@aol.com 12/23/1999 Hello Nasa, this is a very good Site.
I wish the Nasa and the Crouw a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Greats from LÃ¼denscheid/Germany/Europe 12/23/1999 I would like to wish all Members at the Shuttle merry Christmas !!!! And all People at the Mission Control too.
God bless you ..
And I wish you good Luck 
After visiting your greatfull sites I learned that the stars are very,very great and I'm very,very small.
I visitet your sites the first time, but surly not the last time.It's very interresting.Merry Christmas, a happy new year and good luck for the future from a small town in Germany.
12/23/1999 Farewell, DF-224 - congratulations on a job well done! Some of us will miss you especially...
Best of luck to everyone on the ops teams, especially FSW, DMS, PCS, and DMS.
Have an excellent holiday and new year! In a way I wish I could support this mission, but I must admit that it's been more fun watching STOCC web-cam while my kids are napping.
Take care of that new computer! - Jennifer Love 12/23/1999 This is my first visit to your site.
I plan to be a regular visitor.
Yhanks for inviting me. 12/23/1999 I want to Know what is the orbit called that Hubble maintains and what does that mean really? Does it stay in one place over the earth or does it circle the earth? If so how does it compensate when focusing on a point in the Universe.
Please respond! 12/23/1999 Hello I'm sitting in a dark room in Lancashire, England with only the light from my screen and the flashing christmas lights next to me.
It's great to feel at one with space and my fello man, where ever he may be.
I feel vey humble (or should that be hubble) to be watching.
Maybe one day I will take a more active part.
Here to all the TEAM it's a great show, keep it up and Gods Speed on your return.
Michael 12/23/1999 REMARKABLE WORK FOLKS!!!! GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS RESPECTFULLY YOURS, WILLIAM HOLLY 12/23/1999 Great site!!! 12/23/1999 very good.
12/23/1999 A perfect job and the right co ordinatiion among hundreds of people involved in this spectacular mission.
Congratulations to everyone involved.
Waiting for the pictures of their 2nd EVA Kris Krishnan 12/23/1999 Merry Christmas!!!! 12/23/1999 Just a big thanks for keeping us all up to date on this mission.
I believe our future and our past are out in the stars.
Thanks again.
12/23/1999 It is really great to have such a complete Website to keep up on NASA doings.
It sure beats trying to catch the 20 seconds every now and then they have on TV news.
12/23/1999 Merry Christmas to all the staff at Nasa, and a special holiday greating to the shuttle crew and their continued success of this repair mission.
I wish the crew could be home with their family and friends for the holidays, but I am very thankful for their dedication, as well as the ground crews, to put Hubble back into service again.
It is such a magnificent eye to our universe.
Bless you all.
I know the gyros have been problematic in the past, are these replacements employing any newer technology to make them more reliable? 12/23/1999 You aare doing great.The pictures from space on excellent.
12/23/1999 Hello, I am a big fan of the shuttle missions.
I remember getting up very early to watch the first shuttle launch when I was a kid.
I remember where I was when I heard the terrible news of Challenger.
I hope the shuttle program cotinues to have success in its missions.
12/23/1999 I love to watch "my" space thru the lenses of that gorgeous telescope.
I hope that one day I'll visit the US and also NASA.
Keep on running and explore "our" space ... 12/23/1999 This is so cool!! I loved watching your live video cam!! Thanks a lot! Keep up the good work! I support you 100%!!I hope you continue to recieve funding in order to continue exploring lifes greatest mystery! 12/23/1999 No question just want to give you guys a AT A BOY ! .
Keep up the good work and Gods speed Edgar T. 12/23/1999 What dose it take to get a job as a tech for nasa 12/23/1999 Great site.This is my first time but it won be my last that is for sure.Tank,s for all the documentations and keep up the superb work.
12/23/1999 Dear NASA, this is a great site and I thank you for making it available to all of us who think this space program is amazing! I set my alarm when I was in Elementary school to watch John Glen on his first mission and since then I've been totally hooked! Please make more video available as I think this is so awesome and I could watch it all day if I didn't have to work! Congratualtions on another successful mission and keep up the good work; We as Americans are so proud! Lets continue to strive for more knowledge and working together to achieve it.
What God created we're just starting to explore and with His grace we will go where no man has gone before.
12/23/1999 Great site.
I'll be coming back to this again and again.
12/22/1999 Thank You! You at NASA are the stuff that dreams are made of! It has been more than 35 years since I read Robert Heinline's "Have Space Suit Will Travel", and Dr. Asimov's "Foundation Trilogy".
"The Voyage of the Space Beagle" by A.E. Van Voigt also comes to mind when I read articles about "Freedom", the world's new Space Station and Mr. Hubble's telescope.
It gives me a great sense of pride (read that as goosebumps) to think that my generation is the one to have initiated exploration of the Greatest Frontier on the grandest of scales, and in the face of all of the trials, tribulations, and failures, WE HAVE NOT QUIT.
To paraphrase 'Q', Space is full of things, both wondrous and gross, but it is not safe.
So be carefull out there.
Whether you know it or not, I'm right there alongside you hoping that maybe, someday, I'll really get to go too.

It's become a favorite site for the family! 12/22/1999 Wonderful site.Godspeed to STS103 crew,and all the people of NASA Merry Christmas.
12/22/1999 I love the study of space.
Looking OK from here.
12/22/1999 Doing fine... 12/22/1999 Where can I find information about the experiment schedule for a specific shuttle mission? I am interested in what experiments are being done during a mission.
12/22/1999 Tell you how your doing, Guys your doing just GREAT, All of America should be PROUD.
12/22/1999 FANTASTIC! WHAT A WAY TO GO INTO THE NEW MILLINIUM! FANTASTIC! 12/22/1999 just looking on the aol and thought i would look up nasa site was really surprised to find it.
I have a 8th grader who is studing the solar system in science and he realy enjoys finding information on it.
I was really little when we landed on the moon.
Keep up the great work and i hope our nasa keeps getting all the support it needs.
It`s all new to us rather when been up there more then 10 times.
Ever mission is a little different and new.
Good luck always.
12/22/1999 It is great to see the shuttle flying again after such long gap with such a spectacular mission.It is also good to see Michael Foale in space again.I wish him and the crew of Dicovery all the success with mission and I wish everyone at NASA a merry christmas and a happy new year from everyonein London 12/22/1999 An Excellent site , I have enjoyed looking at the pictures from the Hubble at stsci.edu and followed their link to this page a job well done.
12/22/1999 merry christmas to all associated with the hubble telescope and thank you for the space pictures Ienjoy looking at them on my computer.
thanks maybellene australia 12/22/1999 I'm overwhelmed from everything in space technology and space flight.
I deeply regret that TV does not bring more live from the missions.
I'm Swiss and proud that Nicollier is also a Swiss and performes such a great job.
My hamradio call is hb9cmt.

I love every minute of it.
I think it shoud be brodcast on network television.
Thanks for sharing the missions with us.
Dan Turchan 12/22/1999 Hello Those graphics are really beautiful on the mission simulation,these computers are really getting cool,yeah I was a Space Craft Electrical installer on the apollo program back in 1965,That was really wonderful when they touched down the flying beadstead on the moon I went to NAA
I have been watching the real video on the web and have enjoyed it very much and have relayed the information on various local nets in the amateur band.
Thanks and good luck to all.
Arthur Z. Rowe - N1ORC 12/22/1999 I would like to wish a very Merry Christmas to the crew now working on the Hubble space telescope.
It would be nice if they could be with their families for the holiday, but I understand their work is also very important to them.
Anyway, good luck and Happy Holidays!!! Wendi 12/22/1999 Great site, very informative 12/22/1999 bravo to nasa and all the crews that make it go.
what you are doing is vital to us in the 21st century.
how does the ordinary citizen like me be most helpful, not only to the continuation of our space program, but to its strengthening? 12/22/1999 I still have faith in NASA! 12/22/1999 Iam intersted in the gyroscopes aboard the hubble telescopes ..
how often must they be serviced?????? I am also curious as to who manufactred the "gyros" as the company I am an inspector ( Quality engineer ).......
is one of the largest gyroscope manufacturers in the world....
I also want to wish all the staff a merry christmas and a happy new year!!!!!!!! 12/22/1999 Thank you for a wonderful and very educational web site.
My sons and I enjoy learning about the space program and one day would love a chance to go in space too.
12/22/1999 Good luck from Switzerland.
Werner Zehnder, Arnegg, Switzerland 12/22/1999 i have watch a lot of your mission i never seen on stars in the backgrond.all that blackness you would think you would see at least see one star 12/22/1999 I wwish you had more live broadcasts on your website.
I grew up during our journey to the moon, and have loved it ever since.
We go to launches every chance we get.
Please show more.
WB 12/22/1999 Dear NASA Team, I think you are doing a real good job, and I love to watch your NASA TV.
Is there any possibility to get it over sattelite here in Germany? Because watching NASA TV over Internet is pretty expencive as long as we don't have flatrates here.
There is only one thing I don't like in your reports.
That you often use miles instead of kilometers.
Most people in Germany can't really imagine how far a mile is.
And I think its the same in most other countrys.
Of course we could look it somerwhere up and than calculate how far it is in kilometers, but that is very disturbing during reading or watching NASA TV.
O.K. Thats it.
James R. Frysinger has writen a comment about that allready earlier in that Guestbook.
Good look with your mission.
Stefan Fisches 12/22/1999 Dear NASA, I am absolutely overwhelmed by the positive responences that I have just finished reading on this page! It must be wonderful to have so much support from Americans and the World! Thank you for wonderful sights that you have developed during the last few years.
I've had the NASA,KSC,JSC,JPL, ect., sights in my bookmark list for some time and visit often.
I used to complain that I couldn't find enough info about the Space Program, now I don't have enough time to stay current with all of your pages.
Much praise to the Web page designers for the constuction of all sights.
Keep up the great work and Thank You.
To the astronauts aboard STS-103, to the ground crews and support staff, may the Higher Power that put us in this time and place, hold you and your families in the palm of His hand and keep you safe! Happy Chrismas! and have FUN!!! Ed Yates, Cranston, Rhode Island, USA 12/22/1999 Albert Holm (NASA Goddard) is my brother inlaw.
If you see him, please wish him Merry Christmas and a Happy New year.

Most I like your part about the Hubble telescope.
please send me some information.
Yours PHILIPP 12/22/1999 I would like to know when HUBBLE was launched, in which Shuttle, and the distance from Earth.
thank you very mucj. 12/22/1999 May God bless all those men and women involved in furtherance of our meager knowledge of our vast universe.
Will the answer to our beliefs be revealed through our humanly efforts? In our time? By the Creator Himself? 12/22/1999 Godspeed to all on STS103 from all on the home planet.
Wish I could be with you guys.
Must be a terrific view! Roll on when ordinary citizens are allowed to go into space! Can't wait!.
God Speed and Happy Christmas! Excellent website! From Eastbourne, Southern England 12/22/1999 HI! 12/22/1999 To all a very Merry Christmas and safe return from the Hubble.
12/22/1999 I would like to download Pictures from HTS that could be used as walpaper on my PC.
Can you help me? Thanks!! 12/22/1999 For All the Best for 2000.
Jan Hummeling Holland Homepage www.casema.net/~cwm 12/22/1999 We have orbited the earth for years with the shuttle, when is the shuttle going to the moon? Could the shuttle land and take off where there is no gravity? When are you going to launch two shuttles into space? Are you going to build a space station? 12/22/1999 Gosta Froleen froleen@spray.se 12/22/1999 Hello, I'me looking for a live video feed from Discovery can you guys help me, I want to watch the whole thing them working on the hubble. however this site here is very nice your doing good so far lets see some over the sholder camera angle dig 12/22/1999 I love your site, it's very easy to find what you're looking for.
As far as the mission, I'm very glad it's being done cause we can all use " a big eye in the sky " not to mention more recent pictures on APOD.
Much love, have a MERRY X-MAS, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 12/22/1999 I love your site, it's very easy to find what you're looking for.

Much love, have a MERRY X-MAS, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. 12/22/1999 why couldnt the fuel tanks been used to help build apart of the space station,instead of letting them fall back to earth and burn up? 12/22/1999 Great site.
I enjoyed many informative items this evening.
This is my first visit to the NASA website.
12/22/1999 the temperature they show on the view of the mission/where is that temp. located 12/22/1999 I really enjoy the still pictures and the informative text you are posting about the mission.
I cannot view the video because I am learning another operating system, Linux, and don't know yet how to download and view video under Linux at this time.
Thank you for all the up to date information on the Hubble Space Telescope mission.
12/22/1999 I love the adventure of travel and Thank our Lord we are being about to enjoy this miracle from home.
Thank you all.
Happy Holidays from a Pribilovian from St. Paul Island , Alaska in Anchorage.
12/21/1999 Merry Christmas 
12/21/1999 NASA's Space Programme were really cool 12/21/1999 Iam Josh Neuroth from yakima Wa.
Keep up the good work and come home to us .Have a merry merry chisttmas.And a happy new year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 12/21/1999 Great job.
Keep up the good work.
12/21/1999 Great job on this site.
Can't get too much of the pictures or video.
Is there a way to see more coverage of shuttle flights without having a satellite feed? 12/21/1999 What is the Temperature outside the shuttle? 12/21/1999 It's a real shame that some people just can't wrap their tiny minds around the concept of space exploration and it's meaning to the human species.
I cannot blame them completely, however.
NASA (or Lockheed) needs to make a better effort to explain WHY they do things instead of just WHAT they are doing.
Good luck with this the 3rd servicing mission! 12/21/1999 From Rockvale, TN NASA has one of the most interesting sites on the internet.
Information is always being updated.
The pictures being returned by the Hubble are incredible.
Information from the Hubble pictures and the other space observatories NASA is deloying will continue to challenge our concepts of space and the origins of the universe.
12/21/1999 My name is Nathan Hayden and I love space.
I had my mom decorate my room like Neptune.
I would love more information on the space mission to MARS, and the Hubble repairs.
I am 7 years old.
(My mom is helping me to learn more about space.)
12/21/1999 MERRY CHRISTMAS TO THE CREW OF DISCOVERY MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND KEEP YOU SAFE 12/21/1999 Outstanding effort by NASA! I'm so pleased and proud to see this vital mission go forward.
The work here is so important to all of us in the understanding of our world and universe.
All the Best and Godspeed.
12/21/1999 Have been logging on to this site for quite some time now.
It's great how you keep old retired folk like me up to date on the missions and the associated experiments/reasons for.
Thanks to all at NASA, have Happy Holidays and prayers are with you for many more successes! 12/21/1999 I'm from upstate NY and I love this site also like watching to the new NASA TV station I sit and watch every chance I get it is very interesting 12/21/1999 I'm tired of all the NASA hype over missions that are one failure after another, wasting billions upon billions.
Considering the original inflated HST cost plus the equally costly immediate "corrections" to the original botched manufacture (about the same as original cost), and now with these $1-billion-a-shot "repair" missions, the Hubble is the most poorly constructed and costly telescope ever conceived.
12/21/1999 I like your site, it is informative and uptodate 12/21/1999 Very interesting...from sunny South Africa! 12/21/1999 Very interesting...from sunny South Africa! 12/21/1999 Just like to keep up-to-day 12/21/1999 Our prayers are with you all.Merry Christmas 12/21/1999 This is a great site! I have always been interested in what's going on.
Is there a way to find out what job opportunities are with NASA? 12/21/1999 Quisiera por favor recibir informacion acerca de fotos o nuevos descubrimientos en esta area.Los saluda amistosamente desde Argentina!!!!!!! Gaston(un fan del cielo) 12/21/1999 Quisiera por favor recibir informacion acerca de fotos o nuevos descubrimientos en esta area.Los saluda amistosamente desde Argentina!!!!!!! Gaston(un fan del cielo) 12/21/1999 Keep up the good work! 12/21/1999 Hello could you tell me if i can see the current shuttle mission in the night sky and at what times i am living in county Cork in Ireland.Contact me by e mail.
12/21/1999 A wonderfull achievement.hope to see more foto's of the acutal repair.
it's easier to explain the kids 12/21/1999 Excellent page: very user friendly and splendidly designed.
As an imaging specialist, I would like more information from you on resolution/size of images before beginning to download if possible.
Thank you for the quality! H.J.P.
Arnold, Space Frontiers Limited, UK. 12/21/1999 Thanks, Good Luck and Godspeed.
12/21/1999 Nice job on the web site.
Looking forward to the repairs and getting the telescope back on track.
I am sure that you have alot of science just waiting to be done.
Good luck!!! 12/21/1999 A great project!!! Thanks to all who made it possible.
I'm PROUD to be an American.
"Wyoming Bill" 12/21/1999 12/21/99 I just love your web site.
It is so interesting.
I think that it is great to have Hubble's eyes in space.
Happy Holidays and clear viewing! Kathlyn Houston, Texas 12/21/1999 Mike Hindelie ParkGille2aol.com 12/21/1999 Allways a great site Good Luck to you all 
IÂ´m always fascinated when a spacecraft launches to the orbit or anywere else.
I would love to work for the space programm in the future.
So keep it going!! 12/21/1999 I just read that the Hubble telescope will be retrieved after its mission ends.
I was worried about its fate.
It deserves a special place at the Smithsonian.
I believe that Hubble is the greatest accomplishment man has ever done.
It has added more to mans understanding of the universe then any other thing, human or otherwise.
I'm looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and seeing Hubble "face to face" one day.
Thank you for making my day! 12/21/1999 Why can't we put a satellite in orbit around Mars, and position it so it could monitor any future landings? And why isn't there anymore interest in manned moon missions? We should have had a base on the moon years ago.
12/21/1999 Would like to see more video of real time otherwise you are doing a fine job 12/21/1999 Is there a direct TV link to this Shuttle Mission? I recall watching hours and hours of live link driect from the shuttle during an earlier Hubble repair mission.
Does NASA have a continuous TV broadcast on some cable channel or network? 12/21/1999 How far behind schedule is NASA in the implementation of the SPACE STATION? What is Canada contribution ($'s) for the the SPACE station? Thanks, DR 12/21/1999 Why does it cost 250 million a month to keep the Hubble in orbit? Where does most of the cost acurred? 12/21/1999 Au bientÃ´t "VÃ©tÃ©ran" de l'espace Claude Nicollier toutes mes fÃ©licitations et meilleurs voeux pour le prochain millÃ©naire.
Carlo Crivelli 12/21/1999 Merry christmas and happy new year! 12/21/1999 My dad was in the space program in one form or another for almost 30 years.
I grew up with NASA and all that led up to it's inception.
He was a troubleshooter for Boeing.
You name it, he tested it.
He worked with the Air Force at MC Connell AFB in Wichita,Kansas.
I don't want the space program to end.
I wish it was not SO expensive, but I feel it is worth it.
Good luck on all of your missions.
Let's look to the stars.
12/21/1999 Hi My name is Grant Ewart, i am aged 13, I live in Arbroath, a small town in Scotland.
I am quite interested in space travel and if you could give me updates on the Discovery mission.
Thanks 12/21/1999 I'm an 11 year old G.A.T.E. student at Chippewa elementary school when I get older I want to work for N.A.S.A. weather it is building the shutlles or being on them.
12/21/1999 I enjoyed the pictures HUBBLE took, and was wondering if you could release more pictures of mars taken by Surveyor.
I have only seen a few and was hoping more would be released.
I heard about 30,000 pics were taken a day while it was operational.
Why were so few only shown? 12/21/1999 Great web site.
Keep up the good work, thanks for the big work.
Clear skies, Serhan Ã–nÃ¼r from Turkey 12/21/1999 Congrats For the splendid job,I wish the crew and all those people how are involved with this event Seasons Greetings and A Save return for the crew Richard 12/21/1999 I've watched launches ever since I can remember.
I wish the launches would interupt programming like it did when I was a kid.
IT IS A BIG DEAL!!!!! I'm still amazed at what you do.
NASA and all you astronauts, keep up the good work.
God Bless and Happy Holidays!!! 12/20/1999 I have enjoyed all the images from HST and good luck with a speedy repair mission.
I think being able to access via internet is fantastic.
I have been a rooftop astronomer for 44 years.
Keep up the good work.
12/20/1999 My son and myself try to watch every launch when ever possible.
During the launch on the 19th.he asked me a question that I really could not answer and really did not think about it untill then.
Could you please tell us the total length,in feet,of the entire rocket assembly and the length of the space shuttle its self.
Any information would be appreciated, thanks.
Greg Kudlak 12/20/1999 No question.
was told to leave message 12/20/1999 What is the projected lifespan of the repairs that are scheduled to be done on this mission? 12/20/1999 Would like more information on the Space Station.
12/20/1999 It has been a great experience for me to follow NASA and the missions into space.
Why can't I see stars from NASA TV while observing space and the shrttle 12/20/1999 In reflecting on what has happened to the two Mars programs, I still believe that NASA is still second to none.
Our space agency is leaps and bounds over any other country on this planet.
The world looks to NASA when they talk about space exploration, and I would like to take this time to wish the current crew of the space shuttle mission a big good luck!! I am sure they will succeed and thus allow the entire world to marvel at the accomplishments that Americans can do when we work together for a common good.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a great tool for all of mankind.
I will be using images from Hubble in my classroom next semester when we work with our Space Unit.
GO NASA!! And God Bless America.
12/20/1999 What can I say, I am proud to be an American.
Keep up the good work and stay safe.
Happy Holidays.
N. L. Dondlinger UW Oshkosh 12/20/1999 How is possible to have any informations about live video of shuttle crew (time of connection with Real Video, for example); I would see video during TV connection with Astronauts ! Thank you for your attention.
Dr. Nicola Corbascio, Italy 12/20/1999 From Manchester New Hampshire At the age of 69 I have followed NASA since our own Allen Shepard took that historic flight many years ago.
And the sad day of our teacher Christa tragic flight.
All I can say is One giant step for all mankind is in the hands of NASA and the LORD.
God Bless you all Ed Russell 12/20/1999 Keep up the good work!! I hope to be up there one day!! 12/20/1999 Thank You,Crew 
Fix that Hubble! We love the pictures of Reality, the Universe, and Everything! Keep doing that Cosmic Dance around our little Rock.
12/20/1999 This is the best web sit on the internet.
Keep me up to date.
Thank you very much for your hard work.
12/20/1999 Je suis remplis d'admiration pour ce que vous faites pour la recherche spatiale.
C'est grandiose ! VoilÃ  de l'argent bien dÃ©pensÃ©.
Je souhaite Ã  tous ceux qui collaborent Ã  ces projets, du plus petit manoeuvre au grand directeur, en passant par les astronautes, une rÃ©ussite totale.
Que le 21Ã©me siÃ¨cle soit le votre.
Continuez Ã  nous faire rÃªver, s.v.p. Je suis trÃ¨s intÃ©ressÃ© par l'achat des deux badges commÃ©morant la mission actuelle STS-103 (HST 3A ET STS CREW) Si je pouvais avoir celle de Mr NICOLLIER, it'll be so nice ! Kidding..
MERCI, SO LONG. 12/20/1999 .
12/20/1999 Hi! I'm a ham operator my call is kc5qvd someday I would like to talk to the space shuttle crew.
I enjoyed looking at the web-site.
I would like to wish all of them a safe trip there and back.
and most of all merry christmas.
Thanks Doug/kc5qvd 73 12/20/1999 I would like to see a second HST build someday.
I am sure there is enough telescope exploration to be done , to support such a project.
12/20/1999 Good Luck Everyone Merry Christmas and a Happy New Millenium.
Michael 12/20/1999 Hello from NJ USA.
The last time I checked into shuttle/Hubble update that site was not giving me updated information as of 12/20/99.
I have been interested in the manned/umanned space programs from an early age of 8 years old and here I am year later at 44 years of age and I am still very much interested in NASA space program unmanned and manned space flight 12/20/1999 I am a first time vistor to your guest book,however I am a long time suppter to nasa and the men and woman of nasa that keep the dream alive 12/20/1999 Congratulations on yesterdays launch! I appreciate the many benefits that NASA brings to mankind, keep up the good work.
12/20/1999 GLAD ALL IS GOING WELL GOOD LUCK BERNIE 12/20/1999 I read about the launch of the "Discovery."
on the BBC News Web Site (wonderful news coverage).
Along side the article was you web site.
I'm always so impressed by the marvelouse American Engineering in space .
12/20/1999 I have been an avid Science Fiction buff since I was a kid in the 50's.
I never dreamed at the beauty and splendid colors we would see from the Hubble telescope.
Thanks very much for a dream come true.
12/20/1999 Bravo on getting STS-103 off to a great start.
Hubble will open its eyes to the universe as our little planet celebrates its millennium.
It good to see such productivity in the name of science.
Again, great job to everyone involved! 12/20/1999 the hubble space telescope is one of the best developments since God said let there be light, for now we can see just what he did. for the heavens declare the Glory of God and space shows forth his handyworks(Psalms). the hubble is an extreamly necessary tool for space exploration and is of untold scientific value sincerely tim Macaluso Organic Chemist California State University Sacramento (CSUS) 12/20/1999 I like millions of other people, will be watching as you service Hubble.
Don't let that put you off.
We're not watching to see if you make a mistake, we're watching because you are doing precisely what we want to do.
Best of luck Merry Christmas from Australia.
Yours sincerely Alan Erskine tdbear@mpx.com.au 12/20/1999 I find that you are in wrong way !! 12/20/1999 Viel GlÃ¼ck euch allen bei der Reparatur des Hubels.
Claude Nicollier wie ist das GefÃ¼hl zu wissen, das Sie demnÃ¤chst in das All aussteigen werden.
Gruss dany 12/20/1999 Hi SHUTTLE crew hope you have a happy xmass in space and a good mission.
plase could you send me a photo of you in space thankyou . yours kevin G7VNP 12/20/1999 What can I say? Season's greetings to you all together with my hopes and prayers for all on board Discovery.
May there be many more successful missions to come! 12/20/1999 There is a posibility to send e-mail christmas cards and regards to the crew? 12/19/1999 Beautiful Launch! 12/19/1999 keep up the good work.
thank you 12/19/1999 I want to thank the Congressional sponsors for the funding they help to provide for Space exploration.
I have Great joy and pride when I watch the space shuttle liftoff.
We are the greatest nation on this earth.
It is our responsablity to be the ones to explore the universe.
We have the means and expertise to do this.
But the biggist problem is funding.
We were ok to spend the money to beat the Russians at the time.
Thats why we were able to get to the moon first.
We had a big goal, beat the Russians.
Now we don't have the Russians, so now do we just stop.
No more goals? The biggest goal now is the desire to "know, wonder, dream," whats out there.
And in persueing these dreams we benefit from the discovers in technology and accomplihment.
Investigate what we have recieved from the space exploration, "sips", microwave food in pouches,electronics in smaller more comlpexed packages.
The future is ours to control.
Lets don't blow it now.
I always reflect on the big blunders that others have done, IBM selling Intel, they are sorry now.
IBM selling Microsoft, "OOPS" we did it again.
Lets don't "oops" with Space exploration now.
Get the the money to NASA so they can do the right and most efficent job possible.
Thank you.
12/19/1999 Do uou post any live pictures from the shuttle while in orbit ? If yes , can you send me the url ? Thanks 12/19/1999 Thank you for bringing space travel to us.
Watching the lift off of Discovery on NASA TV tonight was amazing.
I am a teacher and I am currently involved in the Mars Milleneum Project with my students.
Watching the lift off still leaves me in wonder.
I can remember watching when man made his first steps on the moon.
I look forward to the day when we take our first steps on Mars.
Thank you to congress for the continued funding to the space program.
Thank you for bringing the adventure and education to us.
Our prayers are with you.

Thomas Iversen (Denmark) 12/18/1999 Dear Friends of the NASA! I'm an very interested man for exploring of space.
Thank you for the fantastic informations, videos and pictures from space and the space-shuttle mission.
I hope, the mission of STS-103 Columbia will be succesful, so we all can see live pictures from hubble teleskop.
I wish you all the best for the crew and the mission of STS 103.
Tomorrow I will see the launch at your live web-cam. Gratings from Berlin,Germany Hubert Berndt 12/18/1999 A GREAT SITE AS ALLWAYS.Keep up the good work people,make this one just like a fun walk in the park. 12/18/1999 I wish you good luck for the Hubble Repair mission! 12/18/1999 Good Luck to the Crew for STS-103 Service Mission to HST In the future, are there any plans to look for more extra-solarsystem planets using HST and Chandra? Thanks.
12/18/1999 My family and I are brand new to the web, and the more we see on the web the more I realized how we have the whole world in our home.
I came upon your site this evening (12-17-99), and tomorrow I will inform the kids not only is the world at our finger tips, but also the universe.
thank you for putting this up for us and all to see.
Please lord be with the women and men who go.
12/18/1999 the pictures that hubble sends back are just absolutely breathtaking.
I marvel at the wonders of our galaxy.
One of my favorite pictures is of m-57 ring.
my daughter is study- ing the solar system in school and i find this site and the astronomy picture of the day to be very informative.
thank you for the pictures and insight into our galaxy Robert Rider Dominique Rider 12/18/1999 I think it's really cool, all the pix from the HST.
What would be even cooler would be allowing people to accually view the pix from HST at the same time you were viewing it.Is it possible? 12/17/1999 It seems only yesterday we completed SM-2.
Even though I am retired now, my thoughts and interest are still with all of you, especially those professionals working in the STOCC.
I intend to follow this mission via the internet.
That kind of makes me part of it again.
Go get'em team! Arnold "Arnie" Boone (Retired) 12/17/1999 My children (two boys, 10 and 8 y.o.) and me have been very interested to visit your site! Thanks ever so much...
it's great! Best greetings, Lionel Fivaz FÃ©lix-Emmanuel Fivaz TimothÃ©e Fivaz From: CH - 2300 La Chaux-deFonds Switzerland 12/17/1999 we have alot to learn, thanks to you we can go to the moon and beyond....
12/17/1999 I'm in my 40s and have always wanted to be an Astronaut.
I love everything about space and am always amazed at the data that comes back from Hubble or from space missions.
Since NASA started NASA Television when a mission is going up, I'm glued to the channel from lift off until Touch Down and feel that I'm on board.
I feel it's very important to have these missions for our life time and for the future.
I can't wait until the Space Lab is fully up and going.
My best experience so far is the one time the video camera was turned on during the landing a couple of years ago, I really felt like I was on board!!! the very first time.
I think I was just as excited as the crew was.
Good Luck with this mission and fixing the Hubble.
12/17/1999 I'm really enjoing the site, keep up the great work! 12/17/1999 Dear NASA Administrators and Staff: All my life, I've had the luxury of looking up at the most amazing spectacle that human kind has ever known, but how often have I actually done it? How often have I marveled at the wonders of space and what answers may be waiting for us there? How often have I taken the time to relish the planet on which I live? Far too seldom, in all cases.
Recently, I bought myself a Meade LX50 8" telescope, and have found a renewed fascination with the wonders above.
I have also found a real joy in following the efforts of NASA.
I have marveled at your successes, and I have shouted mental encouragement in those moments of frustration.
I guess most of all, I'd like to thank you all for your continued quest -- for the dedication and constant striving to go further, learn more, and accomplish greater things.
There's a closing line that a lot of people involved in astronomy use as their closing tag line to email messages, and it says just about everything that needs to be said, regarding the stars, and life in general.
I wish it to you now.
"Clear skies!" Keep up the excellent work! Thanks for your dedication! Never stop pushing the envelope! Sincerely, Todd A. Merrifield Grand Rapids, Michigan 12/17/1999 Gentlemen, Since my visit to Kennedy Space Center in 1981 I am very much interested in all NASA operations.
As a new member of the INTERNET family I look often to your home-page.
12/17/1999 Looking foward to visiting NASA-TV on the net during this service mission to The Hubble Space Telescope.
Thanks for putting NASA-TV on the internet.
12/17/1999 thanks for the continued great coverage of the latest shuttle launch.I have been interested in the space program since it's beginning and have been able to listen and /or watch many previous missions from the mercury days with Allen Shepherd to the disaster of challenger and on into the past launches leading to this mission.
I am also a collector of mission and launch photos and would like to know where I can get imfo. concerning a series of photos called the space shuttle collection.
Please keep up the great work,and I hope to hear from you about the photos.
I am employed at Mississinewa High School in Gas City ,Indiana . thanks again for all you do, and the very best holiday wishes to you all.
Have a safe launch,and a successful mission,and return home safely thanks 12/16/1999 Thanks for the experience of being a part of the launch it's great for the mind.
Also, Thank you, Congress for the funding.
12/16/1999 Dear,Nasa Myfamily is soon going to The Kennedy Space Center.
Last time we were we had just missed the launhing,Iwas really sad.
Got to go Know!! From,stephanie 12/16/1999 Nice site.
I'm doing a report about the mission for my astronomy class.
This was very helpful.
Good luck! 12/16/1999 I cannot tell you how exciting the return on the investment to develop and launch as well as continue to service the HST has been to mankind.
I have always been very pro-space since I was a very small child but when I see accomplishments such as the telescope, Apollo, and hopefully Cassini, it makes me wish we could forge ahead with the ISS, the next generation telescope, and manned missions to Mars with much greater commitments.
Best of luck in the quest for knowledge from the great last frontier and from political money raising campains as well.
Kurt Brink 12/16/1999 Great job! Some of the best pictures I've ever seen.I hope they get off before the new yaer.
I know the support crews are unhappy with the late launch.But, better safe than sorry.
Gods speed 12/16/1999 Right now I have nothing to say thank you.
12/16/1999 HST got wonderful univers images.
But I cannot explain in English.
I pray success of 3A mission.
12/16/1999 Good Luck and God Speed to our missions.

YOURS KEES DEGRAAF, OAKVILLE, ONTARIO, CANADA 12/15/1999 What is the shuttle flight veiw for the milleneum.
12/15/1999 Hello N.A.S.A.
We have not had our Computer for long,and a friend told us about your Website.
This is not the first time we have visited your site but the first time we have E-Mailed you.
Please could you settle an argument for us.
How does sound travel through space as it is making our hair fall out with everyone saying they are right.
We have another question if this is alright.
Would it be possible to put a Camera in the FlightDeck of the Space Shuttle to watch the launch that way for us on the outside.
Hope you do not mind the question's and we wish all of the Space Shuttle crew a safe and sucessful Voyage.
12/15/1999 A very good site this is.
12/14/1999 Our prayers and best wishes are with you.
Godspeed.
12/14/1999 What is the future for the hubble space telescopes over the next 10 years? And is there any other projects in the works for another space telescope? 12/14/1999 sending every new information to my E-mail 12/14/1999 Dear Mr Claude Nicollier, though I may not be able to attend the launch, I'll be logging daily onto STS-103 website for the latest updates on you and the rest of the crew.
May you have a good flight! Good luck!!! All the best from your Singaporean friend, Sharon Hee :) 12/14/1999 How much longer can we reasonably expect Hubble continue to function so well as it does.

12/12/1999 You are doing well ! Sorry for you about the Mars landings although the mess in your handling of inches, feet / millimeters, meters has a little flavour of Goofy.
Best of luck to your Shuttle Mision.
Thanks for your good information Jorgen Norby.
12/12/1999 i think the hubble space telescope is money well spent,i am glad to see you are still looking after it because without it we would not know half as much as we do now.i understand that there is another telescope going up as well as hst i hope it performs equally as well.keep up the good work.
From a life long fan. 12/12/1999 Great web site.
love to visit in person, but disability prevents me! how about a live video feed from hubble ! regards john. 12/11/1999 Congratulations for such a great webpage full of information.
Since I was a child I was looking for a chance to be closer to the space or those several mission programs.
However, it`s only a dream to be a part of it, but your webpage keeps the dream alive.
The best wishes to the next shuttle crew for the STS-103! (Lars Eller/Germany) 12/11/1999 What are you looking at now??? 12/11/1999 L.S.
One time i hope to pay a visit at your site.
12/11/1999 You are doing great! Please keep it up.
12/11/1999 turn hubble to our moon ? is it possible to see where we first landed and if there are any objects left on the suface by our first lander, what about the flag left there ?can hubble get that clear of picture ? 12/11/1999 Great I visited NASA in january, as 40th birthday present.
I would very much love to see a shuttel launch, and hope to return soon.
The whole visit to Kennedy center and the Cape tour, is something I have dreamed of since I watched the space programe in the early 60`s. John Fathers, Oxford, England.
12/11/1999 what a beautiful picture, from the other part of the world.
here from the netherlands! can hardly wait to see the launch on my homecomputer! 12/11/1999 good luck. saying a prayer 12/11/1999 You are doing very well 12/10/1999 The pictures was very beautiful! I'm a Space Shuttle fun but unfortunateli, I didn`t found a picture from touchdown.
If it is possible, I want to ask a picture about a touchdown by e-mail.
Elore is ksznm! 12/10/1999 I am doing an extra credit report on this shuttle mission.
I would like to recieve any updates or special information possible.
Thank you, Jacob 12/10/1999 When will the international spacestaition be finished? 12/10/1999 The 1967 Navy gave me a 16-week Aviation Electronics Course in ten weeks -- FAST TRACKER ! I am so very proud of our NASA Space Program -- even with a couple Mars landers hushing their communication before the completion of the mission.
The pictures from the moons of Saturn are the best.
Mars exploration will come.
12/10/1999 Will a second more modern "hubble" be funded and launched in the near future? 12/10/1999 The Nasa, Shuttle, Hubble, Mars - sites - absolutely great! What a discovery! Peter Bietenholz, Uitikon/Switzerland 12/10/1999 Can i get picture from hst from deep space via email? 12/10/1999 Keep up the outstanding work!!!!! 12/10/1999 I was watching Nasa television and was intrigued by the sewing involved in your repair for the telscope.
I design clothes and sew.
Good luck with your rolls of fabulous fabric!!! 12/9/1999 Hello NASA!! Please.
Tell me more about SETI and missions Best regards, Marco 12/9/1999 muito legal....eu gosto muito de ver isso!!!!! 12/9/1999 LUNAR CALENDAR : THE FIRST DAY WAS : DEC.07.1999 FOR YEMEN AND LYBIA DEC.08.1999 FOR SAOUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, TUNIS AND ALGERIA DEC.09.1999 FOR MOROCCO CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHETHER THIS IS POSSIBLE AND IF SO PLS EXPLAIN...
BEST REGARDS JAMAL HONISCH CASABLANCA/MOROCCO 12/9/1999 The interactive cam manoeuvring facility is a truley beautiful piece of kit enabling me to view anywhere in the room, i'll be back during the day next time.
12/9/1999 Is it possible to receive CD-ROM of images for slow-connected people ? Thanks and good luck ! 12/9/1999 The way NASA offer us to understand and follow what is on about the shuttle missions (espacially this one) is as amazing as the mission itself.
Thank you for your website wich is a reference for me.
I wish you ( all the crew members and all the technicians teams) a full succes for this mission.
As many people, you must know that our eyes and our heart goes with you.
If a lot off people just do not care about space, i think we are a few to think that what you are doing is in a way, the best humanity can do, of course in a technological way, but may be (in fact i am sure) on other way too, and specially spiritual i think.
Looking deep in space and time with Hubble, is another way to ask the same old questions about us.
People who get the honnor to serv this search, may be gets a beat of the answer.
They have my deepest respect and admiration.
From Brittanny, where i look tonight to the moon and the stars, i would like to tell you how much i feel what you are doing is important, far away from just scientific results(wich are also important).
I see your face on those pictures, astronauts and technicians, and the only thing i can say to sum up my feeling is : God bless you all for what you are doing.
Thank you.
Guy-Christophe Coppel 12/9/1999 Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Tay Za Lin and I'm a Ithaca High School student in New York.
I would like to have some information from NASA.
So, please contact me back!! Respectfully, Tay Za Lin 12/9/1999 Iwould like to know more and you people (nasa) have the coolist web site 12/9/1999 Good luck Discovery crew.
Tex Rouse, 39 Squadron Royal Air Force.
12/9/1999 Nice site... 12/9/1999 Thankyou so much for this webpage, and keeping us informed on everything happening in space.
12/9/1999 You need to update more often.
12/9/1999 It's great to be able to find out the latest about the Hubble Space telescope.
Thank you for making this site.
12/9/1999 I love your site! It is well done.
I am a senior quality engineer at GSFC supporting the Crew Aids and Tools (CATs) for HST.
It is really great to be able to show your site to my friends and family.
Thanks so much for all your efforts.
Well done! 12/9/1999 What a fantastic website! i have just found you and this is the sort of place that realy gets me going! We all owe you a debt of thanks for all the hard work and sacrifice that you go through.
Mother nature and humanity are relying on you all to get the eggs out(off)of this basket before its to late.
M.Dawson, Student, England 12/9/1999 I think that you are doing great with the maintainance of the hubble telescope, but one thing disturbs me how come those two mars probes were so unlucku? 12/9/1999 You are doing fine.
May be excellent.
Since, I am from India i did not know what time difference is betwwen EST and here in Chennai.
Is it possible for u send me the time which i have to login to view the live video feed from HST.
Thank you, yours, Sampath Kumar.
12/9/1999 Yes,I would like to which arew the fastest spaceship that reach out of earth and how long it takes? Thank you 12/9/1999 i watched the latest mars mission live with nasa. you have a great site and i share your lose very keenly.
space exploration is very very nessecary because we will someday expand our boundries from this planet.
i regret that budget cuts have reduced us to this.
is it time to remember and use the kiss principal on our missions? i mean, instead of building a small very complicated piece of hardware that will break or fail easily, couldn't we make a more durable craft with less, such as a camera and a couple of experiments that would excite the public and maybe get their interest up? i mean , distastful as it maybe nasa is in show-biz also.
we can accomplish alot ,slowly if we hook the public.
my heart was riding with the probe ,but the average joe doesn't understand and probably never will.
he will be interested if u dramatize it in the right way.
12/8/1999 i am a malaysian chinese, i am 20 now i love astronomy very much, but malaysian is not so interested with it i am very admire all employments working in nasa, and american have so much of change to know about the space i think all nasa employees have do the best good job NASA, i love u 12/8/1999 yeah I think that the most important thing right now is getting a man to mars.... so why arnt you motivated to doing that...
What happened to the NASA in the 60s?????????? 12/8/1999 Great Job and Holiday Greetings! The inspiration of Christmas Spirit is still the most powerful expression of universal.
Angel Resto of PR. 12/8/1999 Our local cable TV station carries NASA TV every time there is a scheduled launch and my whole family loves to watch the liftoff and everything in between to the landing.
My 4yr old grandson watches the lift offs with me if they are at a reasonable time.
I like having him watch them with me because it is history in the making and maybe some day he will look back and say I remember seeing that when it happened.
12/8/1999 Well-made site , is there a way to get some deeper tecnical inf. ? (I am a tech. student) 12/8/1999 This site is great.
I love it.
The Hubble Space Telescope has changed my life and it is very much apart of my life.
If anything happened to it....tragically I would need to just take a week off to feel better.
It's part of me. 12/8/1999 I am interrested in doing computer animations of missions, satellites, etc.
Who would be the best person to contact.
12/8/1999 Just found your website.
Pictures and layout are excellent.
Keep the data coming.
12/8/1999 Love the website and all the GREAT information! Keep up the excellent work!! 12/7/1999 Go Discovery!!!! 12/7/1999 Great! 12/7/1999 Great job! Hope you get the KSC cam working soon.
12/7/1999 Keep up the good work !! 12/7/1999 Dear Sirs, A job well done,on the layout of the Servicing Mission 3A Website.
I do the public tours at GSFC on the weekends.
I have mentioned your website on my public tours of STOCC.
It would be nice if you would have a schematic of the layout of the instruments and hardware inside the HST.
I hope you can get the ICam at STOCC working soon.
Good Luck with the Mission.

Best Regards, Jerry Lawler 12/3/1999 Hi I'm Cathrin from Switzerland As I have an 8 year old son who is very interested in the space shuttle I had to find the Nasa page, as soon as we installed Internet.
From time to time we look through the pages and always find something interesting.
We are very proud of "our" Claude Nicollier.
We hope that he has a successful flight, and wish him all the luck when he is doing his space walk.
Sure enough we will all sit in front of the TV, when he is starting! Greetings from Cathrin and Pascal 12/2/1999 Dear Sir, I'm a 25 y/o male that lives in IL, I have been in the E.M.S.
Field for the past 7 yrs.
I love the NASA program and have always dreamed to veiw our great plantet from space! But I know that will never happen.
But I still hope that one day I will be able to work for NASA on one of the many saftey teams.
I have not had much luck finding jobs for that subject on the internet but maybe one day I will, any advise were to look? Also can you please tell me were I can get mission patches, I would like to start collecting them.
Thank-you for taking the time to read my letter, nad hopfully I can vigure out how to watch the launch on Dec. 11 on the internet.
Thank-You Kindly Josh Maxwell 12/2/1999 Greetings to Steve Smith.....from Wadsworth, Ohio.....

12/1/1999 I worked for Martin on the External Tank for 13 years, retired in October of 94.
I was lucky enough to see the launch of the Hubble Telescope.
This web site is the only way I have to keep up with the activity and I thank you for that.
12/1/1999 from where we are and where you are looking to in the havens to gave a prospicked dricktion of where I am looking from Idaho Springs Colo.
USA Skipper ps Ilove looking at what you are dowing. thank you 11/30/1999 I cannot see stars in any of the gallery photos of past EVA's.
Just a black background.
Could this be because it is day time and stars only show up while you are on the dark side? I understand about the blue skies due to the upper atmosphere from the ground.
If there were no atmosphere surrounding the planet, would we see a black sky in the daytime.
Thanks 11/29/1999 What should I do to become an astronaut, currntly i am in Air Force ROTC at Norwich University, with a physics major.
I have perfect vision and health.
what else do I need? 11/29/1999 Doing a great job.

Sincerely, Edwin Lumunon 11/17/1999 this web site is cool sorry about the hubble 11/17/1999 My daughter and I will be in the Orlando area 12/04-12/12/99 celebrating her 21st birthday.
We would like to watch the SM3A Mission launch.
Can you give us info as to what we need to do, if anything, to watch, best place to watch etc.
I remember watching John Glenn's orbit on my grandmother's black/white TV and thinking how really great it would be to watch from close up.
We're giving up a day at Disney World to come see this.
Any info you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
11/17/1999 hey cool space stuff way ta go 11/17/1999 Dear Webmaster and affiliates, The website is very impressive in its content and layout.
I am sure most of the surfers would agree that NASA holds alot of the world's vision in the works.
Currently I can't make use of everything the site offers but, I looking forward to viewing more of it in the near future.
The research and viewing pleasure of the site are well worth it.
Thank you very much, JR Luna 11/17/1999 Fantastic site! Keep up the wonderful work, and best of wishes getting Hubble back into service.
11/16/1999 I enjoy the varied details of your information.
Keep up the good work!!! :-) 11/16/1999 Hi nice site, i would like too see some images taken from hubble did i miss these or are they in there somewhere? Keep up the good work Regards Tony Atkinson (Derby uk) 11/16/1999 You guys are doing a great job, and hopefully we will be able to continue downloading information from you.
Best of luck with the upcoming flight.
See if you can't get more press coverage in the upper Midwest (Wisconsin in particular), will you? 11/16/1999 It think that you website is amazing and its true.
I am a big fan of the universe and that stuff.
Its really cool 11/16/1999 I like the work that NASA is doing, but can't be alittle mroe offial then it is now.
You homepage is great, but is there were more pictures it would be the best homepage I have ever seen.
11/16/1999 Welcome! My name is Jabub Salwa.
I come from Poland.
This page is very good.
You are making a very good job!!! 11/16/1999 I like this page as a refrence to the HST. 11/16/1999 Hello I am doing a research paper on the solar systum.
I would like you to send me some information.
On the telescopes and the solar systum thank you 11/16/1999 Hello I am doing a research paper on the solar systum.
I would like you to send me some onfromation. thank you 11/16/1999 HI, HERE IS FELIX FROM GERMANY AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A GREAT SITE AND THAT YOU ARE MAKING A VERY GOOD JOB !!! 11/16/1999 This website is really cool and I think that the Advanced Space Academy was really swift.
The one in Alabama that I went to was awesome, but I think that they should give more information for the most current situations that nasa is working on: the truth about the world.
This website is great and I think nasa is doing a real good job.
but I was wondering that in NASA, the actual MOCR(mission control) area, if there is a real position with the title SSPI that speaks only to Space station-that was the position I had in academy and in our EDM.
I'm definitely going back.
I think you guys should publicize it better.
11/16/1999 I'd trade places with anyone at NASA in a heartbeat !! 11/16/1999 I was wondering if I can get a launch pass to see the launch.
I was hoping that my former employer, J
I had hoped to see this launch, because I worked for 4 years on the advanced computer(HST486) doing design, development, and testing.
Is there someone that I could talk to about this? Thank you 11/16/1999 first time I see it.
Excellent site.
11/16/1999 Ohh, You are doing very good.
It's a good sith. 11/16/1999 This is a great website! Blessings to you in your efforts to revive Hubble.
It's worth it.
Hubble is a truly amazing piece of work! 11/16/1999 I feel you're doing your best to return HST operative and healthy ! 11/16/1999 i am a student, 17 years old and i started loving astronomy since my childhood.
i think i'll visit frequently this site.
11/16/1999 too great! Iwant to be part of you 11/16/1999 You guys are doing perfectly, is nice to see live what happening inside of nasa.
Thanks 11/16/1999 Hi all, I feel a bit stupid asking this question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.
I sure you have people far brighter than me.
It's my understanding that the hubble has a 386 on board right now.
Knowing that many 386's don't boot come y2k, does the computer have anything to do with the telescope's navagation or ability to stay in space? Will it's 486 replacement be y2k compliant? Finally, why not put a pentium in it? just wondering, dave 11/15/1999 amazing!!!!!!very intresting!!!!! 11/15/1999 I think the page is really cool.
It has plenty of useful information and really cool images! 11/15/1999 Site looks super! 11/15/1999 A perfect work for the humanity,an eye for same people observe a new place to live.
11/15/1999 JUST FINE! 11/15/1999 Hello! I'm Korean.
I'like NASA! I don't have e-mail address.
sorry..
11/15/1999 Very exciting...good luck.
Also, Time magazine had an item a few months ago indicating that interested people with computers could somehow aid in the search for extra-terrestial contacts.
I'm interested but I lost the site info and have had no success find it.
Could you help me locate the appropriate people? 11/15/1999 I think this is great.
11/14/1999 My humble opinion is that you are doing very well on three fronts.
a) the subject matter is unmatchably interesting b) the layout of the site is appealing and friendly to use c) the currentness of data makes this desireable There is certainly a great endorsement by your neighbour to the north on all the wonderfull work that is done in the United States in the attempt to better understand and know about the last and vast frontier.
11/14/1999 I am 9 years old.
I made a model of the Hubble Space Telescope for school (4th grade science.)
My mom (Becky Sorensen) used to work with Mr. Russ Werneth.
TTFN Ta Ta For Now Your Friend, Lisa Beth Sorensen 11/14/1999 Keep up the good work and good luck! 11/14/1999 Thank you Hubble for the most wonderfull sites.
