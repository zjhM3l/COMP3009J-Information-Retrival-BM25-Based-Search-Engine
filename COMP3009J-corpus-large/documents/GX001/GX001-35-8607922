Mandatory Ship Reporting System
Collisions with ships are a major source of injury and death of the critically endangered northern right whale.
In an effort to reduce the number of ship strikes, NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard have developed and implemented Mandatory Ship Reporting Systems.
The systems were endorsed by the International Maritime Organization - a specialized organization of the United Nations.
The systems became operational in July 1999.
When ships greater than 300 gross tons enter two key right whale habitats - one off the northeast U.S. and one off the southeast U.S.-- they are required to report to a shore-based station.
In return, ships receive a message about right whales, their vulnerability to ship strikes, precautionary measures the ship can take to avoid hitting a whale, and locations of recent sightings.
The links to this web page provide additional information on the Ship Reporting System, how and when reporting is to be done, and general information on right whales.

The program is a cooperative effort by a number of agencies and organizations.
It has been lead by the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, and NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service.
The Marine Mammal Commission and NOAA's National Ocean Service have strongly endorsed the program, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare provided technical assistance.
Congressional legislation that provided the Coast Guard with the authority to implement the system came from an effort lead by Congressman William Delahunt (D-MA), with endorsements by Senator John F. Kerry (D-MA) and the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation, as well as Congressman Wayne Gilchrist (D-MD).
The program also received endorsements from the Chamber of Shipping of America, and the Northeast and Southeast U.S. Teams for the Implementation of the Right Whale Recovery Plan.
