[background.jpg] Chris Dodd has been at the forefront of federal policies that recognize the changing role of women in the workplace.
He has helped make it easier for women to balance the responsibilities of work and home by:
* Leading the fight for seven years to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows working parents to take unpaid leave to care for their newborn or adopted child, or a child, parent or spouse who is seriously ill.
* Introducing a measure that will expand the benefits of FMLA to 13 million additional Americans.
* Writing and winning passage of landmark legislation designed to increase the quality, availability and affordability of child care.
* Sponsoring the Middle Income Tax Relief and Family Preservation Act, which greatly benefitted female-headed households through specific tax exemptions.
* Working to further improve the quality of child care by maintaining crucial day care health and safety standards.
* Introducing the Child Care for Working Families Act of 1997 to help working families afford quality child care, addressing a critical shortage across the country.
* Urging passage of comprehensive health insurance for children and cosponsoring legislation that would provide insurance coverage for 5 million children.
* Proposing legislation to assist thousands of mothers enrolled in higher education with campus-based child care.
* Introducing a bill that will allow the IRS to withhold the tax refunds of "deadbeat" parents and give states additional resources to locate delinquent parents, ensuring that all children receive a minimum amount of support.
Dodd has also been an active proponent of equal rights and opportunities for women in all sectors of our society.
Dodd:
* Proposed an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.
* Authored the resolution urging a broad interpretation of Title IX, the law requiring schools to equally fund men's and women's sports programs, and was principal cosponsor of legislation to overturn a 1984 Supreme Court decision which ruled that the Title IX regulations applied only to a specific program, not the entire educational institution.
* Supported the Equal Remedies Act, which corrected shortcomings in the Civil Rights Employment Act that limit compensation for victims of sexual harrassment and discrimination.
* Led the fight to restore Civil Rights protections for women, minorities and the elderly that were stripped by certain Supreme Court decisions in 1990.
In order to protect the reproductive rights of women and ensure their health and safety, Senator Dodd:
* Cosponsored the Freedom of Choice Act to codify a women's right to reproductive choice outlined by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision and voted against a Constitutional Amendment stating that the right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution.
* Fought to overturn a proposal that would limit a doctor's ability to discuss options available to pregnant women in federally-funded clinics and consistently opposed efforts to deny federal funds to poor women who need abortions because their lives are in danger, or who are victims of rape or incest.
* Currently supports the Women's Health 
Chris Dodd has focused a great deal of effort on women's health and on protecting women from the horror of domestic violence and spousal abuse.
He has succeeded in:
* Sponsoring the main federal initiative that funds prevention, treatment, and shelter services for victims of domestic abuse and violence.
* Writing an amendment to include coverage of mammography screenings under the Medicare program.
* Leading the fight against threats to maternal and child health programs, childhood immunizations and other cost-effective pre- and post-natal services.
* Helping to ban "drive-thru deliveries" by requiring that insurance companies pay for 48 hours of hospital care for new mothers and babies.
