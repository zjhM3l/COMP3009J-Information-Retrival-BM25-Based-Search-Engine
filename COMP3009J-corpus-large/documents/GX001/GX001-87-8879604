After a 30-orbit chase, Discovery astronauts completed a successful rendezvous Tuesday evening with the Hubble Space Telescope, grappling it with the robotic arm and latching it into the orbiter's cargo bay.
Controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center had placed the space telescope in an attitude with its closed aperture pointed toward Earth.
Commander Curt Brown guided Discovery through an approach from below and fly-around.
Then, Mission Specialist Jean-Francois Clervoy reached out with the shuttle's robotic arm to grip a grapple fixture on Hubble.
The grapple was made at 6:34 p.m.
Central time, one day, 23 hours and 44 minutes after Discovery's launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Clervoy used the arm to rotate the space telescope and bring its base into the cargo bay.
Hubble, gleaming silver in its Mylar insulation flanked by golden-colored solar arrays, was firmly attached to the Flight Support System in Discovery's cargo by a little after 7:30 p.m. Hubble is as tall as a four-story building.
With a maximum diameter of 14 feet, it is about the size of a railroad tank car.
The Flight Support System is a U-shaped device with a circular platform between the U's arms now supporting the space telescope.
The system provides power from Discovery to the telescope and can rotate and tilt it to facilitate access to its various compartments by space-walking astronauts.
An initial, carefully choreographed survey using a camera at the end of the robotic arm was made.
Camera surveys of Hubble's condition will continue during the crew's sleep period, scheduled to begin about 12:50 a.m.
Wednesday.
The first of three planned space walks to repair and upgrade Hubble equipment is scheduled to begin at 1:40 p.m. Wednesday, though astronauts may get an early start.
If they can get ahead of schedule, they may be able to perform some tasks that had been scheduled for the cancelled fourth spacewalk.
On Wednesday, Mission Specialist and Payload Commander Steve Smith and Mission Specialist John Grunsfeld will first replace the telescope's three Rate Sensor Units.
Each contains two gyroscopes.
The second major task is installation of six Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits between Hubble's solar panels and its six 10-year-old batteries.
The cell telephone-sized kits are designed to prevent any overheating or overcharging of those batteries.
Discovery's systems continue to function well as the astronauts wind up final preparations for Wednesday's space walks and prepare for sleep.
The spacecraft was in an orbit with a high point of 380 statute miles and a low point of 355 miles.
The next Mission Control Center status report will be issued at 11 a.m.
Wednesday or as events warrant.

HST Project Update - Tuesday, December 21, 11:55 PM EST
Rendezvous Graces the Houston Sky
At the very moment Space Shuttle Discovery closed in on Hubble, the drama played out in the night sky over Houston.
Though most of the team were committed to consoles in Mission Control, several of us ran outside to witness the nighttime spectacular.
At 6:34 CST, Hubble and Discovery streaked into view from the south and passed above Mission Control.
Though actually about 25 feet apart, the two appeared joined as a single, barbell-shaped light.
They graced the Houston sky for about 3 minutes before disappearing into shadow.
What an amazing moment!
Hubble and Discovery will make nightly appearances over Houston for the rest of the mission.
After release, Hubble will appear three more times before the turn of the millennium.

HST Project Update - Tuesday, December 21, 9:00 PM EST,
"Please come out of the cold and stay for Christmas!"
At 7:34 PM EST, Discovery completed a sequence of ballet-like maneuvers with Hubble that resulted in a firm mechanical link between the two spacecraft.
This operation proceeded without a hitch even though Hubble is in an unusual orientation because it was in safe hold.
Instead of a normal approach where Discovery would come up from the "aft end" of Hubble, it approached from the aperture door "front end".
A delicate operation by robot arm operator Jean-Francois Clervoy rotated the Hubble into a position for berthing with the Flight Support System (FSS) berthing ring.
At 9:00 PM EST, the robot arm successfully placed the Hubble on the FSS, and the three FSS latches locked on to Hubble.
Hubble's source of electrical power was then switched over from its solar arrays to the orbiter, completing the most visible parts of the rendezvous/grapple/berthing operation.
Hubble looks absolutely beautiful on the Discovery's video cameras.
We feel as if we are welcoming home an old friend we have not seen for three years.

Kennedy Space Center Space Shuttle Status Report
MISSION: STS-103 -- 3rd HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION VEHICLE Discovery/OV-103 LOCATION:On orbit ORBITAL ALTITUDE and INCLINATION:317 nautical miles/28.45 degrees
Work in progress: Space Shuttle Discovery continues to perform very well on orbit as the flight crew prepares to rendezvous with, grapple and service the Hubble Space Telescope.
Following Discovery's launch last night, workers completed a preliminary walk down of Launch Pad 39B.
Inspectors report only minimal damage at the pad.
Just before noon today, the solid rocket booster recovery ships began towing operations and are expected to arrive at Hangar AF Tuesday at about 4:30 a.m.
Both boosters are reported to be in good condition following last night's splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.

HST Project Update - Tuesday, December 21, noon EST
Discovery is performing extremely well in orbit.
We hear that "it is the best it has ever been."
The new color printer is still having problems.
New software drivers are being sent up to Discovery to try to solve the problem.
All Discovery and Hubble systems are ready for rendezvous and berthing late this afternoon.
The Hubble Team is making some final cable clearance checks for a contingency case during the computer installation tomorrow.

Johnson Space Center STS-103 Status Report # 04 Tuesday, December, 21, 1999 - 11:00 a.m. EST
Discovery is on track for its rendezvous with the Hubble Space Telescope this afternoon, culminating in the planned capture of the 12.5-ton observatory at 6:41 p.m. CST.
In recognition of today's activities, the seven astronauts aboard Discovery were awakened at 9:20 a.m. today to the song "Rendezvous" by Bruce Springsteen.
While the crew slept, the Shuttle continued to close in on the Hubble Space Telescope at a rate of about 125 statute miles with each 90 minute long orbit of Earth.
At the time the crew woke this morning, Discovery trailed the telescope by about 330 statute miles.
The crew will fire the Shuttle's thrusters at 12:38 p.m. today to slightly raise Discovery's orbit and slow the closing rate on Hubble.
Another engine firing will be conducted about 48 minutes later to further adjust the closing rate and aim Discovery to reach a point eight nautical miles behind the telescope -- the starting point for the final phase of the rendezvous -- about three hours later.
Just before Discovery reaches that point, European astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy will power up the robotic arm and lift it to a position just above its latches along the left edge of the Shuttle cargo bay.
At 4:28 p.m., Discovery will reach the starting point and fire its thrusters again to begin the final phase of rendezvous, putting the Shuttle on a course to directly intercept the telescope on the next orbit of Earth.
As Discovery closes the final distance to Hubble, four small course correction engine firings will fine-tune the approach and Clervoy will raise the arm high above the payload bay, poised to latch onto the Hubble's grapple fixture.
When Discovery reaches a point about half a mile away and directly beneath the telescope, Commander Curt Brown will take over manual control of the Shuttle.
Brown, assisted by Pilot Scott Kelly, will gently maneuver the 110-ton Shuttle to within 35 feet of the orbiting observatory to allow Clervoy to capture it with the arm.
After the arm has latched onto the telescope, Clervoy will lower it into a cradle in the aft cargo bay.
Using controls in the aft cockpit of Discovery, Payload Commander Steve Smith will then latch the telescope in place, where it will remain for the next four days.
Hubble is planned to be latched into the bay at about 7 p.m.
Once the telescope has been secured in the payload bay, Clervoy will release the arm and use it to perform a television survey of the Hubble's exterior.
The first of three planned Hubble maintenance spacewalks is planned to begin at 1:40 p.m. Wednesday.
The next Mission Control Center status report will be issued at 11 p.m. central time or as events warrant.

GSFC Space Telescope Operations Control Center Update
Controllers spent a quiet night in the STOCC monitoring Hubble's systems.
They report ground systems here in the STOCC continue to perform flawlessly, and work is proceeding as planned for this evening's capture of the Telescope.
Anticipation is growing here in the STOCC for tonight's grapple and berthing of the Telescope.
It has been three years since engineers got their last up-close look at the Telescope, and they are anxious to see and hear from the crew on the condition of the orbiting observatory.
Controllers in the STOCC will perform a number of key steps today in preparation for tonight's capture of Hubble.
About 6 hours prior to grapple, controllers will power up Hubble's backup computer.
This backup computer controls a set of 3 mechanical gyroscopes, completely different from the gyroscopes that are being replaced during this servicing mission.
These backup gyros cannot be used for the extremely precise pointing required for Hubble to stay locked on to its stellar targets, but they will keep the Telescope stable for the delicate rendezvous and capture activity tonight.
Though the Telescope has been in orbit nearly 10 years, these backup gyroscopes were turned on and checked out for the first time two weeks ago in preparation for the mission, and they operated perfectly.
Immediately after grapple, the astronauts will send commands to Hubble to place it in a drift mode.
This will prevent the Telescope from using its onboard attitude control systems to compensate for any small movements placed on the Telescope after the astronauts grab it with Discovery's robot arm.
Once berthed in Discovery's payload bay, controllers will disconnect the Hubble solar arrays.
During the servicing mission, Hubble will receive its electrical power from the orbiter's fuel cells.
Discovery also will provide a relay for data from the Hubble while it is berthed in the payload bay.
Normally, these data are down-linked to Goddard directly, via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite system.
But while the Hubble is being worked on, the data stream will flow to Goddard via the orbiter.
The onboard portion of this communications loop was successfully checked out yesterday.
Also completed yesterday was the visual inspection of the Space Support Equipment.
These are the two major fixtures in Discovery's payload bay - the Flight Support System and the Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier.
The Flight Support System, which is the platform the Hubble sits in during the servicing mission, has been moved into position to accept the Telescope.
After capture, as the astronauts install new equipment on Hubble, the STOCC team will immediately test it.
Later, while the crew sleeps, ground controllers will perform more detailed checkouts.
At the end of the mission, the STOCC team will deploy Hubble's high gain antennas and open its aperture door.
They will reactivate and check out all Hubble equipment powered off during the servicing call.
Then, Discovery's robot arm will release Hubble and normal science operations will resume.
