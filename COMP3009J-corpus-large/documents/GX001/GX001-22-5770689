My Daddy is writing this letter for me.
I was looking at the moon this morning and thought it looked really big and bright.
Daddy said it was happy because it could see people up in space again in the shuttle.
I asked why they were there and he said they were there to fix the big telescope, the Hubble.
He said you were doing it so we could see other places in space like our moon that are further away.
He said you would be up there on Christmas day.
I was worried you wouldn't get any presents but he says you were all happy to wait until after christmas to get your presents and that your present to all of us was fixing the Hubble.
Then daddy showed me some pictures that the Hubble telescope took, they're neet! Thank you for your Christmas present and have a Merry Christmas and safe return home.
Love Emily 12/24/1999 From all the staff at the MILA tracking station, have a fantastic Christmas.

As you orbit above God's blue oasis in the desert of the Milky Way, please reflect on the true meaning of Christmas and the value of your contribution to the endless quest we as the human race, with our divine right to learn about the universe we live in, pursue with the help of the Hubble telescope.
You are true pioneers in our exploration of space, and without your expertise, our eye on the universe would remain shut.
Thank you all for this true gift to us, the people of the Earth.

12/24/1999 SPACE SURGERY: AN ORIGINAL LIMERICK FOR THE SHUTTLE CREW There once was a space 'scope named Hubble, That got into some serious trouble.
It lost its mind And promptly went blind, So the shuttle was launched on the double.
The shuttle crew said, "Come what may, We're up here to save the day!" The crew took a look, Then extended the hook And gathered Hubble into the bay.
The CPU needed a fix So the 'scope could resume taking pix.
The crew took out the brain To remove the strain, Then implanted a 486.
The 486 may be slow, But in space it's quite cold, we all know.
In conditions so rough, The chip must be tough To transmit new data below.
So we're glad the crew knows how to fly, Because otherwise Hubble would die.
We need Hubble's eyes To search through the skies For answers to questions we ply.
We all love this holiday gift.
When the Hubble was blind, we were mift.
We're glad you were there To make that repair.
May your flight home be safe and swift.
--With best wishes from Tamara Homan and Flo Spotswood Ready 12/24/1999 Working on Christmas day may be disappointing but great achievements require time, money and a lot of hard work.
All people on the Earth and I are in debt with You and Your families for Your devotion to the development of science and technology.
I wish to all of You and Your families a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

You sacraficed so that we all may benefit.

12/24/1999 Merry Christmas, Thank's for your help, we will all enjoy the fruits of your labors for years to come.
Hurry home! Terry Dardas 12/24/1999 12/24/99 Dear Shuttle Astronauts of the 12/99 Hubble Mission, You have the great privilege to be in orbit around our planet at this time.
Know that, although you are few in number, compared to the many humans down here--many, many minds soar with you.
I'm writing this after viewing the Internet (APOD) picture of the Hubble, the Shuttle bay, and the limb of Earth in the background.
What an opportunity we all have, to live in a world where views like this, (of our planet from space) are available to humankind for the first time.
We are, I believe, all connected.
You are literally there, yet we down here are able to feel some small part of the awe you feel, through the pictures.
Or, perhaps, we are able to feel all of the awe which you must set aside to concentrate on working to help the Hubble.
The Hubble...which will then be able to better feed more pictures to we human beings, to fuel our imaginations, our dreams, our hopes, our understanding of the universe.
Interconnecting us further.
Some of us down here have worked to make your mission possible.
If it were possible to see a network of all who've helped create the mission, we would no doubt be amazed at how vast it is.
We all did our jobs, so you might be there to represent us all.
I hope that you will join me, in this season, this time of ending of a century, in hoping for: * more unity among humankind * more gratefulness for our unique planet * more calmness * more people daily grasping what a privilege it is to live on this planet * more understanding that a more positive future is truly possible, if we imagine it and work towards it.
Today, I send you my greetings.
I hope they ring true for you all, remind you of all we have to do, much longer than this holiday season.
Your co-worker in building a better world, Joyce in Seattle js@AlwaysPure.com 12/24/1999 M.C. guys! Hey are ya'll gettin' double time and a half for working the holiday? Be Safe 12/24/1999 merry christmas gentelman just wanted to say that you are doing a fine job keep up the good work.

Perhaps you could take a photo of Santa Claus for me? I'm sure you'll have great visibility at the 12/24/1999 ... so you take it? I require you a good home journey and the best for your families.
12/24/1999 " MERRY XMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR" 12/24/1999 Sehr geehrter Herr Nicollier Ich verfolge ab und zu das Raumfahrtsprogramm der NASA und bin gerade davon fasziniert und beeindruckt wie aufwendig und auch anstrengend die ganze Vorbereitungszeit und der tatschliche Aufwand sein muss um "nur" scheinbar kleine technische Probleme zu lsen, die auf der Erde vielleicht nur wenige Stunden oder Tage in Anspruch nehmen wrden.
Ich wnsche Ihnen und Ihrer Familie und Ihren Crewmitgliedern sowie allen, die an Ihrem sicheren Aufenthalt im Orbit und Rckkehr arbeiten Momente der Entspannung und Entlastung von Sorgen und Nten und Anstrengungen.
Ich wnsche Ihnen und allen Feiertage und ein Gutes Neues Jahr 2000, welche Sie und alle anderen nach Ihrer und deren Auffassung und Wnschen feiern und geniessen knnen.
Mit freundlichen Grssen und Happy Landing auch an Ihre Crewmitglieder und an die Bodenstation Albert Blarer, Schweiz 12/24/1999 Greatings people of the sky! I'm Francesco from Verona, Italy.
I wish you Mary Christmas and happy new Years.
You are so far in the space but so close in our heart.
Bye 12/24/1999 I think that the world from your actual orbit is like a huge " Presepe " .
Merry Christmas !!!!!! Vincenzo Genualdi Via Sferracavallo 148/d - 90148 - Palermo (ITALIA) 12/24/1999 I envy you flying high above Mother Earth.
I wish I could have gone with you.
I can think of no better way to appreciate this planet and its people than to view it from orbit.
Especially during Christmas when we finally remember Jesus Christ and what he did for this small planet many centuries ago.
We should be thinking of Him all during the year, not just in December.
As you orbit Earth, please think about the sacrifices He made for us.
They are not unlike the sacrifices our own astronauts are making for us every time they ride a shuttle into orbit.
There are those of us down here that are extremely proud of you people, we know and understand the risks you take and we appreciate your commitment and dedication.
God, how I wish I could go with you.
To ride the man-made fire to the heavens.
I would give anything to ride with you.
And to look down upon the Earth, on Christmas, to see what Jesus found so important to save...
Merry Christmas to the crew of STS-103! 12/24/1999 Hello Discovery Crew, I am an Iowa/Nebraska boy living in Santa Cruz, CA for the last 20 years and as a kid would launch the model rockets as far into the sky as possible.
Chaseing them down and finding them was a whole other challange.
I am always looking foward to seeing what new discoveries the Hubble Telescope can give us and I think it is so cool that we can send a Shuttle mission up there to fix and peform maintaince on it that it just toys with the imagination.
I really respect that the whole crew is going to be working during the Hollidays but I'll be happy and proud to take any bodies place in the future.
I'm 42 and will always have the disire to travel up there.
I would like to extend my wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Safe and Happy Landing.
May the 21st century bring bigger and better trips to all.
I'll bet everyone up there can see a great view of Santa doing his mission on the night of 24/25.
Take Care, Safe Mission, Happy Hollidays, Todd Martin Prather - toddmprather@aol.com 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas to all of you.
God Bless.
12/24/1999 A message from Katherine and Alastair Gordon in England.
Katherine (age 9) wants to be an astronaut and Alastair (age 8) wants to work at NASA.
We are both very interested in rockets.
We have been flying model rockets at our local club.
One of our rockets takes pictures.
Alastair wants to ask Michael Foale how he got to work at NASA.
Katherine wants to ask Michael Foale "how do you manage to see what you are doing while you are repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, as it is very dark in space?" We wish you a Merry Christmas, a successful mission and a safe return to Earth in time for the new millenium.
Best wishes Katherine and Alastair Gordon Abbots Bromley Staffordshire England 12/24/1999 Greeting to the crew of STS-103, A satellite tracking website says we should be able to see you tonight (Dec 24) at 6 PM local mountain time.

You folks are the best! God Bless... 12/24/1999 As you circle between Heaven and our globe, please say a little prayer for the world that 50 years from now everyone's children and grandchildren might enjoy the blessings of peace, love and a clean, safe Earth.

Here on the school, we're bored, as usual, but I wish you a merry X-mas! Happy landings, greetings Martijn 12/24/1999 Hi guys ! I think it's great that you're up there keeping Mr Telescope company over Christmas.
I bet he really appreciates not having to spend X-mas eve all by himself.
And for all the gifts he has given us over the last years, he really deserves a few presents of his own.
And you know what ? I heard that a few new gyros is just what he wished for ! Good luck and Merry Christmas ! Anders, Sweden 12/24/1999 Salut les aminches ! Bande d'enfoires, j'aimerais bien etre a votre place, en ce moment.

We are sure you are doing a good job with the Hubble and we hope your safe return.
Carlos F. Yoldi 12/24/1999 Dear Discovery Crew, I used the Hubble as part of my graduate work at UCLA so I feel a special connection to it.
It may not be said often enough, but the astronomical community owes you a great debt for undertaking this enormous task of keeping HST functioning.
Thank you, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and a safe return home :) Dr. Varoujan Gorjian NRC fellow at JPL Glendale, Ca. 12/24/1999 Hyvaa joulua! Ei muuta kuin 'skooppi kondikseen ja maihin millenium-bileisiin.

Wish you a nice X-mas, in touch with the cosmic forces and a happy new year back on earth, together with your loved ones.
Jan Berman (male, age 66) 12/24/1999 A Christmas Poem for the Astronauts...
Is it possible to decorate a tree when you're floating around in zero G? Can the stockings get hung by the air lock with care? And is there any room for Santa there? Will dinner feature turkey and gravy? Or will it be more like rations from the Navy? By now you're probably hoping this poem will end! So I'll conclude by wishing you Merry Christmas brave men! From those of us who can only dream, thanks for allowing us to live a little through your adventures! 12/24/1999 Gentlemen, Although you may have heard such words from others, my family and I do appreciate you giving up your time with family and friends -- as well as the incredible sacrifices always required for the work that you do.
As a citizen of the United States (as well as a member of the human race!), Godspeed on your efforts to repair our finest eyes on the heavens.
Happy holidays to all, and all our hopes for a safe and speedy return home.
I wish I could be up there with you.

Well done on the Mission so far and keep up the good work.
Enjoy the view, you've got the best one around, I wish I could be there to share it with you...! Give our regards to Hubble... looking forward to more stunning pictures of our Universe.
From James, Jane 
This American tax-payer is very appreciative.
I hope that this mission was self-actualizing and rewarding enough for each of you that the angst of being away from loved ones, family, and home on Christmas was lessened.
Merry Christmas to all of you.
Thanks again for a job well done.
12/24/1999 WOW.
Merry Christmas from St. Pete., FLA 12/24/1999 Salut Claude, Je te souhaite une bonne expedition....courage mon gars. bonne fte and a happy millennium.
We are very proud to have you (first europeen) in the outer-space.
You will continue the traditions of succesfull missions startet by Piccards. best regards from zurich Marco 12/24/1999 Dear SHUTTLE crew - You don't know me ( duh!!! ) But I just found this web-site and thought that I might be arrogant enough that the persons in charge might actually allow my message to be sent! I would like to thank all of you for your courage - bravery - tenacity - and frankly - the guts that it takes to do what you guys and gals are committed to - i.e., forwarding our collective experience in space.
Each flight has it's own risks and dangers - and any number of possible complications available.
While we down here go about our daily lives fairly secure in the knowledge that tomorrow will ( sic ) hopefully - pretty much go the same as today - you all are truly living on the edge - and I thought that you may enjoy knowing that there are at least a few of us here on terra firma - that completely appreciate the potential sacrifice that you take with each flight.
SEMPER FI - AND SINCE i CANNOT EXPECT TO SPEAK FOR ANYONE BUT MYSELF - Thank you for your dedication to that which you do! p.s. - Oh yeah - Merry Christmas - The LAST of this millenium - except for the next one! But who's counting?! Jay Sigal 6068 Jacaranda Way Unit "F" Carpinteria, CA 93013 (805) 684.3498 12/24/1999 Dear Nauts, I am from India.
Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year.
See If you can find Santa floating around somewhere Mihir 12/24/1999 Happy Holidays - Hubble has provided more than a fundamental leap in our knowledge of the universe - it has also returned some of the most beautiful and awesome images ever collected.
I cannot imagine a project more professionally rewarding and personally exciting than working on one of humanity's most spectacularly successful efforts to broaden our understanding and knowledge.
May you bask in the satisfaction of an important job well done, and have a safe, happy return to Earth and your families.
Good Luck, Lee, Ellen, and Emily Aubel 12/24/1999 GOD !!!! I'd love to be up there with you right now.
Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ! Be safe and be cool.

From Topeka, Kansas.!!!! GodSpeed And Happy Holidays 12/24/1999 I've looked over the route that NORAD thinks Santa is taking on Christmas.
Wrong, wrong, wrong! The way I calculate it, Santa will be knocking on your hatch at 13:18:26 GMT on the 25th.
He has asked me to relay that he is tired of milk and cookies.
I think that he would like a double expresso and a dark chocolate truffle.
Rudi likes schnapps.
Up, up, and away.

How wonderful it must be, to be among the lucky few, who look down upon our beautiful earth.
I'm sure this will be one Christmas you will never forget where you were or what you were doing, and neither will your children or grandchildren.
Happy landings! And a joyous New Year....
Yikes! It's almost 2000!!! Thanks again for doing your job so well, and God bless you all.

Our hearts and minds are supporting you.
12/24/1999 Dear STS-103 Crew, Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this holy season.
We've all had to work on some holiday! At my job, I'm reminded regularly of our County's motto: "The noblest motive is the Public Good".
It helps to remember that when you'd rather be home with your family and friends.
"And there in front of them was the star they had seen rising...The sight of the star filled them with delight."
--Mthw 2:10 Safe journey!--The Stremski Family, San Diego County 12/24/1999 Well done, you magnificent men in your flying machine.
Two fantastic space walks, and one more to go.
The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the greatest achievements of modern times, and there can be no better way to end the twentieth century than your work to keep it operating.
A personal thank you from somebody who's enjoyed all the wonderful HST images.
12/24/1999 Thanks for all the great work you are doing to get the Hubble back into operating condition.
They say it is better to give than it is to receive and you certainly have exemplified that.
In so doing you have given a great gift back to the world and there are a great many grateful people as a result of your hard work and sacrifice.
Best wishes to you and your families and have a safe and speedy return home.
12/24/1999 Muchas felicidades!! 12/24/1999 Congratulations to your great success.

I hope to could read his official book about his biography in some years.
Best Regards George Kaderli - Biel (City of SWATCH) - Switzerland 12/24/1999 Hello fellow travellers.
I am still awed by live video from the Shuttle.
What a beautiful place the earth is.
I have a season's greetings of sorts: A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in The lobby discussing their recent tournament victories.
After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse.
"But why?" they asked, as they moved off.
"Because," he said,.................
"I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
I can hear the groans from space already.
Have a safe trip home.
12/24/1999 Christmas Greetings from a local radio station in Sweden.
We have already told our listeners about your adventures in space.
Maybe you could give them a wave from up there.

FROM THE MELLEMS IN MICHIGAN 12/24/1999 Greetings to the crew of Discovery, On behalf of my 5 and 7 year old children, would you please do us a favor? On Christmas Eve, please watch toward the North Pole and keep an eye on Santa.
They wouldn't want him to get lost on such an important night.
Thanks very much.
P.S.
Keep an eye open to the East, you never know when a new star may appear in that direction.
12/24/1999 Hey wasup ALL YOU AstroNutS!! How's it up there, up above the earth's atmosphere? I bet the view is spectacular! I'm just one of the many billions of people on this planet that constantly imagines about being up there in space...I know, however that one day, it will become a reality.
Well, continue on with your miSSion, get that hubble fixed up so that we can continue learning more about our wonderful universe.
Don't work to hard, and remember: Safety First! i'll be watching the news to hear of your safe returns.
Peace Out from The Earth...
Serge (UF student, freshman) 12/24/1999 I think of you now as I think of all who travel high up into the night before you.
I do, because unlike most, you are able to get a glimps of what Jodi Foster "saw" in the movie CONTACT.
Ironically you not only are able to see the beauty of your home away from home, but you are on a magnificent mission repairing the very thing that brings such magnificent beauty back to all of us -- and to you again when each of you returns.
I have always longed to travel silently through the night as you all do now.
It is not only because of such imagery, but it is also for the thrill beyond the technical and scientific work that you all must do.
I dream at night of what lift-offs must be like sitting with your knees to the sky -- your backs to the earth.
I long to feel the rumble and the rattle of the millions of tons of material around and below you as the accellaration begins to build to levels only an astronaut must be able to fully appreciate.
I once wrote Alan Shepard a letter when I was 12 asking him if I would ever walk on the moon.
I was thinking he might supply a definite answer about people like me (who are not like you -- but who only can imagine) and to my surprize, Mr Shepard wrote back to me telling me I would "most likely see that day."
As a child, my imagination was satisfactorily boosted to a new level.
I am 50 now, and although I myself can only still dream of magnificent lift-offs and incredable space walks as those you have ta hours.
I would want simply to look and to do it all day and all night long (if you can still call them "days" and "nights" as you know them at home).
Thank you for fixing our Hubble again.
And thank you for rekindling my childhood imagination.
You are among the few who know what it is like to float among the stars in such a fragile existance, where emotions and spirituality must stir your souls to entirely new levels.
I think of you often as you fly over me on this Christmas Eve night.
Charles Bradley Harvard, Massachusetts 12/24/1999 I'm here just to congratulate all the CREW member of the HST for their talented work and including the crew in the ground.
May you all have a Merry Christmas and a Happy Millenium Year (Y2K)...

please when you arrive to hert send to us a fotograf of the hert from the space family garcia barron enrique garcia 12/24/1999 Hello everyone, My name is Bill.
I'm 18 years old and live in Rock Springs, Wyoming.
My dad and I are very much into the Space Shuttle Program.
My dad used to work for NASA for about five years and I'm into Space Shuttle mechanics and aerodynamics.
I hope one day I'll be able to go up into space.
For now I have to be satisfied with launching backyard rockets.
I'm sure you all have a lot of other messages to read so I'll keep this as short as I can.
I've just never sent a message to people in space before.
I'm sure glad I got this opportunity.
Well, I'll be praying for your safe return, in the meantime I'd just like to say MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! God speed, Bill Ahlstrom 12/24/1999 Hello everybody in low Earth orbit aboard the Shuttle Discovery.
I just wanted to wish you all Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
I work in the public programs at Lowell Observatory and during my presentations I have be showing NASA TV and we have been watching the crew working on the Hubble.
Everybody in my tours has enjoyed it and has been really amazed by the work you all are doing.
You guys are doing a great job! Have a Happy Holidays and a safe journey home, Bob MacArthur Lowell Observatory 12/24/1999 Great job! thanks for all.
You've got yourself a new job: time opticians because thanks to your work, we'll see better through time.
Have a very Merry Christmas up there and count the Christmas trees with Hubble! 12/24/1999 Have a happy and safe merry christmas as you soar through the heavens and may God guide you back to earth on a safe landing! 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas! And thanks for spending your holiday fixing the Hubble Space Telescope.
As an amatuer astronomer, I feel that Hubble plays a key role in rekindling our countries interest in space and it's exploration.
The sad truth is that if it weren't for Hubble's pictures, the vast majority of the people in this country would have no idea that we are still working hard at exploring space.
Space is no longer exciting to the masses, except when there is something to see.
Thanks and hurry home, Jon Clark Livermore, Ca. 12/24/1999 Happy Holidays as you circle the globe! So many people appreciate your hard work that lets us see deeper into space than ever before.

It is the soldier, not the poet, Who has given us freedom of speech.
It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, Who has given us the freedom to demonstrate.
It is the soldier, Who salutes the flag, Who serves beneath the flag, And whose coffin is draped by the flag, Who allows the protestor to burn the flag.
Father Denis Edward O'Brien, USMC 12/24/1999 Hey there! My name is David and I am a student at ASU, Go Devils, I am going to declair my major next semester, Aerospace Enginnering with an austrony minor, hopefully.
It's my dream to one day visit the starts even though its far fetched its still always been a dream of mine.
Well, hows the view? Just wanted to ask is space realy as exciting as it seems? Being here on Earth I can just imagine the feeling of launching into space and then feeling yourself just lift up and loose gravity.
Also, I don't know exacty how your siduated when you guys sleep, like do you have a window to look out while your strape into your bed? I know if I was up there I would not be able to sleep for days I would just look out into the stars and gaze at all the wonders of the universe.
Exactly how much brighter are the stars in space? Well, I understand your all busy but stop and look around and see if you can see Santa for me will ya!! lol Well, good luck and happy holidays!! Admiring you from below, David Chaney P.S.
Sorry about the spelling no one ever acused me of being and english major! 12/24/1999 Thank you for being in space when we are here on our Earth.
We will be celebrating the holiday but will not forget you above serving your country and our future.
Thanks again you great folks for being so brave.
Love and joy to you all.
John(34),Edward(5),Erin(11), and Janet(ageless) we are all fans of NASA and pray you will come home safe every time you go up.
12/24/1999 Dear Astronauts of the STS-103 repair mission of the Hubble Space Telescope.
I have great respect and admiration for your work in space and in particular for your present mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope which I consider one of the most sophisticated instruments ever built.
My son Kevin(8) and myself(60) are following every day the progress of your service mission on the World Wide Web and are wishing you a Merry Christmas and a save return to earth.
Message for Mr. Claude Nicollier: Congratulations for your remarkable career as a scientist and astronaut.
You are in my opinion the ideal example for the young Swiss proving them that also a citizen of a small Country like ours can become a member of the best reputed space scientists and astronauts provided one is prepared to go the long and hard way you did.
Felicitation! Joyeux Nol et bon retour la terre.
Kurt Frenkel CH-8600 Dbendorf/Switzerland 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas, Happy New Year to all you guys up in the Shuttle.
I only wish someday to be able to see in person what you can see right now, looking out the windows.
I'd write more, but bandwidth on your end will be limited.
Have fun, make us proud to be human.

David Hunter 12/24/1999 Dear shuttle crew, What I would give to be up in earth orbit with all of you.
It must be truly an unspeakable feeling to see our beautiful earth from your viewpoint not to mention the stars and planets.
I, and I'm sure everyone here, wish you the best in helping the Hubble better suit all of our needs to see the wonderful sights of our universe.

Godspeed to the crew of STS-103 -- Curt, Jean-Francois, Michael, John, Scott, Claude, and Steven -- and Merry Christmas to you and your families.

The crew weightless, sleeping, all in their beds with visions of fixed telescopes and mission success in thier heads.
When all of a sudden the wake up call came from the ground I floated from my bed to listen to the sound.
It was ground control in houston, they played Christmas music, to us far aloft, they wished us a Merry Christmas and said....
"Take the day off!!" Merry Christmas to the crew of Discovery.
I am glad to see the intrest in this mission from a great many people down here.
Many thanks for your hard work.
Have a safe return home.
Craig Preston 12/24/1999 I would like to wish the Discovery Crew a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year/Millenium! I'm sure missing Christmas Day with your families is a little disappointing, but just remember all of the hard work you have put in to train as an astronaut and specifically this mission.
Celebrating the awe of God's work from a perspective most of us will never have the opportunity to enjoy first-hand should certainly make up for missing or delaying your family holiday gatherings.
As a graduate engineering student and a "life-long" space exploration enthusiast, I have an extreme admiration and respect for the work that the NASA researchers, ground crews, and astronauts do and hope to some day be a part of the NASA team.
I would certainly give up more than just one holiday (plus the 2 years of training, etc.) for just 1 hour in space! Once again, Happy Holidays and best wishes for a successful mission and the safest of returns!!! 12/24/1999 Hello Discovery Crew, Wishing you all the success with the Hubble repair mission 3A.
If you get the chance, take a look out one of the shuttle windows and look at the Earth with the miriad of stars surrounding it.
Remembering that 2000 years ago, a star led three travelers to a stable.
It was at this stable that these travelers found true peace.
May the star that each one of you follow bring you true peace.
WE Love what you are doing for us and our future in space.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Paul, Justin 
Ed Bickel 12/24/1999 Dear Astronauts, Merry Christmas! I'm a Chinese who is now 17 Years old.
I love looking at the specular skybodies, and I enjoy Hubble's pictures very much.
Oh, thank you for the great devotion to sky, REMEMBER ME TO HST.
THANK HER TOO.
Wish you and HST well in 2000.
Dong Su-bo 12/24/1999 Greetings from Mexico! I wish you a successfully mission and a happy return to Earth.
Also I wish you a very happy Christmas and a happy New Year.
Sincerely, Carlos Cantu.
