In addition to the annual King County Fair, the King County Fairgrounds hosts several other Northwest favorites, including the Scottish Highland Games, Ramrod Bicycle Race, and the Olympic Kennel Club Dog Show.
The Goodwill Games equestrian competition was held here in 1990, and other event producers, including Walt Disney's PremEars in the Park, have found the King County Fairgrounds a great location for special events.
Facilities available for rent range from the entire 72-acre grounds to the intimate setting of the historic log cabin Field House.
Several buildings at the Fairgrounds were originally constructed for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair-the same World's Fair made famous by a visit from Elvis Presley and the film called "It Happened at the World's Fair."
These buildings were moved to the Fairgrounds after the World's Fair was completed.
If you are planning a unique wedding reception, birthday party, company picnic, concert, tradeshow, convention, or animal/livestock exhibition, the King County Fairgrounds is the place to go.

The premier event at the Fairgrounds is the annual King County Fair, which was founded in 1863 when Abraham Lincoln was president and the Washington Territory was 26 years from statehood.
It began as a simple celebration of agriculture and originally took place in the Georgetown area south of Seattle.
The King County Fair moved to Renton around 1900, and then to Enumclaw after World War II.
The King County Fair is one of the last honest-to-goodness country fairs with country performers, animals, a rodeo, fun food, carnival rides 
There's still a lot of real country dirt at the King County Fair because we haven't paved over much of the grass!
