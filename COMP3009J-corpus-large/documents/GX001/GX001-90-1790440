* ARCO's 1997 production of crude oil makes it the ninth largest producer in the region, accounting for [ * * * ] percent of total regional production.
* ARCO's 1997 Form 10-K at page 2 shows that at the end of 1997 the company's net proved reserves of crude oil in the United States amounted to 2.131 billion barrels.
* ARCO's 1997 Form 10-K does not isolate regional reserves from U.S. reserves.
However, ARCO's 1998 annual report states that ARCO has 492 million barrels in proved reserves in the lower 48 states (i.e., excluding Alaska and Hawaii, but including other PADD V states).^ (11) We estimated that, in 1997, ARCO's net proved regional reserves were at least 387 million barrels.
* According to page 4 of ARCO's 1997 Form 10-K, as of December 31, 1997, the company had 334,000 proved net undeveloped acres and 331,000 proved net developed acres of oil and gas properties in the lower 48 states (excluding 1,659,000 acres held by Vastar).
* According to pages 3-4 of ARCO's 1997 Form 10-K, as of December 31, 1997, ARCO was in the process of drilling 47 net wells in the United States, had completed 438 net exploratory and development wells in 1997, and had 5,146 net productive oil wells (excludes productive wells held or drilled by Vastar).
* According to page 53 of ARCO's 1997 Form 10-K, in 1997 ARCO incurred $1.212 billion worth of capital expenditures for property acquisition, exploration, and production activities in the United States.
* As an additional measure of ARCO's stake in the regional industry over the long term, we divided its 1997 estimated regional reserves by its regional production.
The resulting value indicates that ARCO can produce for [ * * * ] years at its 1997 rate, assuming it does not purchase or find more reserves, before depleting its reserves.
The above data supports that ARCO has a substantial and long-term stake in the regional crude-oil industry.

* According to page 119 of Phillips' 1997 Form 10-K, as of December 31, 1997, Phillips was in the process of drilling 24 net wells in the United States, had completed 140 net exploratory and development wells in 1997, and had 2,876 net productive oil wells.
* As an additional measure of Phillips' stake in the regional industry over the long term, we divided its 1997 estimated regional reserves by its regional production.
The resulting value indicates that Phillips can produce for 8.25 years at its 1997 rate, assuming it does not purchase or find more reserves, before depleting its reserves.
The above data supports that Phillips has a substantial and long-term stake in the regional crude-oil industry.
Shell
The following facts regarding Shell's oil exploration, development and production activities are relevant to its stake in the domestic industry.
* In its July 26, 1999, survey response, Shell reported that in 1997 it produced 149.65 million barrels of crude oil in the United States, including 100.010 million barrels in the region.
* Shell's 1997 production of crude oil makes it the second largest producer of crude oil in the region, accounting for approximately 6.5 percent of total regional production.
* In 1997 Shell, in combination with its equity holdings in other producers of crude oil, held 1,736 million barrels of proven crude-oil reserves in the United States.
See Shell's 1998 Form 10-K, at 12.
* Because Shell's 1997 Form 10-K does not distinguish regional reserves from U.S. reserves, we calculated an estimated minimum regional reserve for the company^ (20).
Based on this estimation, for 1997, we determined that Shell had at least 1,065 million barrels of net proven regional reserves.
* According to page 8 of Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at the end of 1997 the company had 6.809 million net undeveloped acres and 1.199 million net developed acres of oil and gas properties in the United States.
* Shell's regional exploration, development, and production operations employ more than 2,200 workers in the region.^ (21) * In 1997 Shell owned 1,803 net wells in the United States that were producing or were capable of producing oil.
In 1997 Shell also held equity interests in over 8,148 net wells in the United States that were producing or were capable of producing oil.
See 1998 Form 10-K, at 8.
* In 1997 Shell completed 32 net exploratory and 99 net development oil and gas wells in the United States.
See 1998 Form 10-K, at 8.
* Shell's 1997 net income from its U.S. exploration and production operations was $1,060 million.
See Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at 6.
* In 1997 Shell spent $2.229 billion on property acquisition, exploration and production in the United States.
See Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at 7.
* Domestically, Shell produces crude oil in 12 states, the Gulf of Mexico, and offshore California.
In 1997, domestic onshore production accounted for 50 percent of Shell's crude-oil production.
See Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at 4.
* At the end of 1997 Shell held interests in 1,023 tracts in the Gulf of Mexico, 696 of which are in water depths exceeding 1,500 feet, comprising more than one- fifth of the industry's deepwater leaseholds.
See Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at 4.
* Shell undertakes substantial initiatives in enhanced and supplemental recovery operations in the region to produce crude oil which could not be recovered by natural reservoir forces.
In 1997, its CO[2] injection projects in West Texas accounted for 21,214 barrels per day or almost 8 percent of its regional crude-oil production.
See Shell's 1997 Form 10-K, at 5.
* As an additional measure of Shell's stake in the regional industry over the long term, we divided its 1997 regional reserves by its regional production.
The resulting value indicates that Shell can produce for 9.66 years at its 1997 rate, assuming it does not purchase or find more reserves, before depleting its reserves.
The above data supports that Shell has a substantial and long-term stake in the regional crude-oil industry.
Texaco
The following facts regarding Texaco's oil exploration, development and production activities are relevant to its stake in the domestic industry.
* In its July 27, 1999, survey response, Texaco reported that in 1997 it produced 144.554 million barrels of crude oil in the United States, including 68.539 million barrels in the region.
* Texaco's 1997 production of crude oil makes it the fifth largest producer in the region, accounting for 4.5 percent of total regional production.
* Texaco's 1997 10-K form at page 64 shows that at the end of 1997 the company's net proven reserves of crude oil in the United States amounted to 1.767 billion barrels.
* Because neither Texaco's 1997 10-K form nor its 1998 10-K form allows us to isolate regional reserves from U.S. reserves, we estimated Texaco's net proven reserves located in the region^ (22).
We estimated that, in 1997, Texaco's net proven regional reserves were at least 970.9 million barrels.
* According to page 7 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, as of December 31, 1997, the company had 5.529 million proved net undeveloped acres and 1.875 million proved net developed acres of oil and gas properties in the United States.
* According to page 7 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, Texaco had 19,110 net wells in the United States producing or capable of producing oil in 1997.
* According to page 8 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, Texaco was in the process of drilling 87 net wells in the United States and 883 net development wells in 1997.
* According to page 8 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, Texaco completed 32 productive exploratory oil wells in the United States in 1997.
* According to page 34 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, Texaco invested $3.183 billion in exploration and production (not including refining and marketing activities) in 1997.
* According to its July 27, 1999, survey response, Texaco had $7.9 billion of exploration and production assets in the United States.
* According to page 27 of Texaco's 1997 Form 10-K, Texaco earned $957 million after taxes from exploration and production activities in the United States.
* Texaco's 1997 10-K form states at page 65 that, "in the United States, liquid and gas reserves were added from the Monterey Resources acquisition and drilling that extended the productive limits of existing fields, such as the McAllen Ranch field in Texas and Caillou Island field onshore Louisiana.
Other drilling-related reserve increases resulted from the new field discovery of Ewing Bank Block 963 and new sand discovery at Mound Point, both offshore Louisiana."
* Texaco's 1997 10-K form states at page 6 that "solid cash flow and earnings are generated by core upstream assets around the world, aided by our advanced technologies and alliance-forming skills.
Examples: our aggressive exploration and production activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico."
* Texaco's 1997 10-K form states at page 7 that "{i}n 1997, we increased our upstream capital budget by 32 percent (excluding the Monterey Resources acquisition) to add reserves and to develop projects" including projects in the Gulf of Mexico.
* As an additional measure of Texaco's stake in the regional industry over the long term, we divided its 1997 estimated regional reserves by its regional production.
The resulting value indicates that Texaco can produce for 14.2 years at its 1997 rate, assuming it does not purchase or find more reserves, before depleting its reserves.
The above data supports that Texaco has a substantial and long-term stake in the regional crude-oil industry.

We estimated Shell's proven regional reserves using the following steps: 1) we calculated the depletion rate for the region and for the United States for BP-Amoco, Marathon, Chevron, and Fina, the only opposing importers for which we had proven reserves and production for both the region and the United States as a whole; 2) we determined the largest absolute difference between the regional depletion rate and the U.S. depletion rate on both an absolute and percentage basis (in this case, the difference for Chevron was 0.78 years, which was 8.17 percent of Chevron's U.S. depletion rate); 3) we calculated Shell's depletion rate (reserves divided by production) for the United States as a whole, which was 11.6 years; 4) as a conservative measure, we deducted 0.95 years from Shell's depletion rate (we chose the percentage amount because 8.17 percent of 11.6 years is 0.95 years, which is larger than 0.78 years), which resulted in an estimated regional depletion rate of 10.7 years; 5) finally, we multiplied the estimated regional depletion rate by Shell's regional production to calculate the estimated minimum regional reserves.

We estimated Texaco's proven regional reserves using the following steps: 1) we calculated the depletion rate for the region and for the United States for BP-Amoco, Marathon, Chevron, and Fina, the only opposing importers for which we had proven reserves and production for both the region and the United States as a whole; 2) we determined the largest absolute difference between the regional depletion rate and the U.S. depletion rate on both an absolute and percentage basis (in this case, the difference for Chevron was 0.78 years, which was 8.17 percent of Chevron's U.S. depletion rate); 3) we calculated Texaco's depletion rate (reserves divided by production) for the United States as a whole, which was 15.43 years; 4) as a conservative measure, we deducted 1.26 years from Texaco's depletion rate (we chose the percentage amount because 8.17 percent of 15.4 years is 1.26 years, which is larger than 0.78 years), which resulted in an estimated regional depletion rate of 14.17 years; 5) finally, we multiplied the estimated regional depletion rate by Texaco's regional production to calculate the estimated minimum regional reserves.
