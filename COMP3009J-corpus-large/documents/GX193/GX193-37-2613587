The SunWise School Program
The SunWise School Pilot Program is spreading rapidly.
The 25 participating schools in 14 states will grow to more than 100 schools in 32 states in the next phase of the pilot program.
The SunWise School Program teaches children and their care givers how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun.
Overexposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays have long been known to cause sunburn, but it has also been linked to increased incidences of skin cancer (the most common form of cancer), eye damage, premature aging of the skin, and suppression of the immune system.
Children are particularly at risk since most of the average person's lifetime sun exposure occurs before the age of 18.
The SunWise School Program is an environmental and health education program which has classroom-based, school-based, and community-based components targeting sun-safe behavior in elementary schoolchildren.
EPA is inviting schools across the country to participate in the SunWise Pilot.
To obtain a registration form, or for more information, visit the web site at http://www.epa.gov/sunwise or contact Kristin Kenausis at (202) 564-2289, or e-mail her at kenausis.kristan@epa.gov.

Renovated Washington, D.C.
School Hosts EPA Training on Indoor Air Quality
In response to a call by President Clinton, the Environmental Protection Agency developed the Urban Schools Initiative.
This demonstration project improved the indoor air quality in Charles Young Elementary, a Washington, D.C. public school, based on guidance in EPA's Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Action Kit.
To protect the considerable investments and to ensure the longevity of the improvements made at the school, a preventive maintenance strategy will be developed.
Other schools will be able to benefit from what was learned during the Charles Young School project.
The D.C.
Public School system, EPA, and Environmental Health and Engineering, Inc. teamed up to train over 200 public school employees and officials on indoor air quality.
Two training sessions were held at Charles Young Elementary on July 27, 1999.
All of the participants received IAQ Tools for Schools Action Kits and heard presentations on School Indoor Air Quality, Ventilation, and the Urban Schools Initiative.
Cheryl Eason and Keith Keemer from the D.C. government's Radon Office will assist a number of D.C. public schools as they implement the Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Action Kit in a pilot program this school year.

Indoor Air Quality Guidance for New-Construction and Renovated Schools
EPA's Indoor Environments Division has begun an effort to develop indoor air quality guidance for new-construction and renovated schools.
The guidance will focus on key points for good indoor air quality that school designers (engineers and architects) should consider when designing schools.
The purpose of the guidance is to provide information on school design that will protect children's health and enhance the learning environments of new and renovated schools.
It is expected that this guidance will be available on EPA's web site, and will include interactive software for designers.
The initial release of this guidance package is planned for late 2000.
For more information, please contact Greg Brunner, (202) 564-9052.

Health Care Providers Helping to Prevent Environmentally-Related Illnesses __________________________________________________________________
School Nurses Work to Improve Air in Schools
The National Association of School Nurses (NASN) and EPA's Indoor Environments Division recently have begun working together on improving indoor air quality and addressing asthma triggers in schools.
With over 10,000 school nurse members and 48 state affiliates, the nurses have taken on an expanded role in the past decade such as teaching on health topics in the classroom, providing parent health education, facilitating staff wellness programs, participating in community health affairs and numerous other activities in addition to delivering traditional health care.
NASN is currently developing asthma modules to educate school communities on the seriousness of asthma and the environmental triggers which increase the frequency and severity of attacks.
These asthma modules will be delivered by school nurses at staff meetings, PTA meetings and in student health classes.
In June, NASN hosted their 31st National Conference in Providence, Rhode Island.
195 school nurses attended EPA's session on IAQ Tools for Schools and asthma.
The attendees showed great interest in the IAQ Tools for Schools Action Kit and many have gone back to their schools and started implementing the kit.

Elemental Mercury Exposures in Children - A Workshop to Examine the Scope of the Problem and Opportunities for Prevention
In the past year, there have been several incidents involving serious mercury exposures to children in EPA Region 5 (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, WI) resulting in acute illnesses.
In response to these incidents, a Mercury Exposures in Children conference committee was organized by EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to better understand the issue and determine possible prevention strategies.
The key activity of this committee was to convene a workshop to explore the scope of the problem and opportunities for prevention with key parties such as State and local health departments.
The one-day workshop 
The specific goals of the workshop were to: 1) share and compile current information on the potential sources that have resulted in exposure or the potential for elemental mercury exposure in children; 2) identify what is being done in Region 5 to prevent acute exposure to mercury; and 3) to determine how EPA, ATSDR, the State health and environmental agencies, and their partners can further reduce the potential for elemental mercury exposure to children.
The agenda covered issues related to prevention of mercury exposure including mercury reduction projects, mercury disposal, and educational projects and materials for the prevention of mercury exposure.
For more information contact: Colleen Olsberg, EPA Region 5- (312) 353-4686.

Summer of Environmental Fun at...
Bankhead Courts
EPA's Region 4 conducted a multi-faceted environmental educational program for the Bankhead Courts Community Summer Camp "campers."
Operation Dignity, a non-profit organization, asked EPA to provide environmental education and information to these campers from Bankhead Courts, an environmental justice community.
As part of the camp program, EPA conducted a Public Service Announcement (PSA) Contest for the campers during National Lead Prevention Week.
The campers learned about lead poisoning and watched the "It's Our World" PSAs that were created and produced by Region 3.
Afterwards, the campers got to write, direct, and produce their own PSAs.
The 1st place prize was awarded for a creative rap song addressing childhood lead poisoning.
All participants received a Certificate of Appreciation.

Eleven Communities are Participating in EPA's Child Health Champion Campaign
The Child Health Champion Campaign is a pilot program designed to empower local citizens and communities to take steps toward protecting their children from environmental health threats such as lead paint in homes and asthma-causing pollutants.
Eleven communities were selected for the pilot period.
Each community has assessed and prioritized environmental hazards to children in that community, set community-specific goals for the selected hazards, and established Action Plans to meet each of the goals.
Communities have started to implement their Plans.
The Community Team in Prichard, Alabama has placed more than 60 Child Health Champion signs in high visibility areas (such as on Stop Signs) throughout the City and the Chippewa Cree Community Team erected a Child Health Champion tent at the annual Rocky Boy Pow-Wow in Box Elder, Montana which provided information to parents and adults about ways to reduce or eliminate environmental health hazards such as pesticides, lead, and environmental tobacco smoke.
A national evaluation is being conducted of the pilot to determine future plans for the expansion of the Child Health Champion Campaign.
For more information please contact Liz Blackburn at (202) 564-2192.

Understanding the Relationship Between Environmental Risks and Children's Health __________________________________________________________________
Environmental Pollutant Exposure to Children
The Environmental Pollutant Exposure to Children (EPEC) Workgroup is working to compile exposure information for a list of environmental pollutants that have potential health impacts for children in EPA Region 5.
This project will be addressing such questions as: Does exposure to environmental pollutants represent a health concern for children living in EPA Region 5? What are the pollutants of concern and what are the health concerns? It is anticipated that the information gleaned from this project will be used in the national Children's Health Testing program to identify particular chemicals that will be the focal point of efforts by the program and to identify gaps in information that exist for chemicals to be tested.
Better information on children's exposures to environmental pollutants will reduce data gaps in knowledge which should improve estimates of risk to children.
For more information, contact: Colleen Olsberg EPA Region 5- (312) 353-4686.

EPA Announces Pesticide Cancellation
EPA has announced cancellation agreements and risk reduction strategies to increase protections for American families and their children from risks posed by two of the oldest, most widely used chemical compounds that remain in use as pesticides today.
EPA is eliminating use of methyl parathion on all fruits and many vegetables.
The Agency is reducing application rates of azinphos methyl and requiring practices that will result in significant reductions in allowable residues on apples, pears, and peaches.
In addition, EPA is calling for new studies of neurological and developmental effects on hundreds of pesticides to better understand their effects on children.
These studies will enhance EPA's ability to evaluate pesticides more protectively than ever before.
For further information, contact Claire Gesalman in the Communication Services Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs, at (703) 308-3260.

EPA's International Activities to Protect Children's Health __________________________________________________________________
Protecting Children's Health Worldwide
The EPA's leadership in building international cooperation and technical capability is an essential part of the U.S. role in promoting children's environmental health in international organizations and other nations.
In June 1999, EPA led a U.S. delegation to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Third Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health which included more than 900 participants, including 72 ministers of environment and health.
The London Declaration, adopted by 50 countries from the WHO European Region, affirmed their commitment to specific measures that will reduce the harmful effects of environmental degradation on human health.
Specifically, the member states agreed to give greater emphasis in all relevant programs on the need to prevent exposure of children to environmental threats, recognizing the special vulnerability of children and reproductive health to environmental threats.
They agreed to endorse the priorities highlighted at the Conference on preventive strategies on asthma and allergies, childhood accidents and injuries, environmental tobacco smoke, and areas of emerging concern about effects of the environment on children's health.
