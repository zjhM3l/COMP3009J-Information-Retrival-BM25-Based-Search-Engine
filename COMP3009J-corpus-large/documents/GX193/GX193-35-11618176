Working with States __________________________________________________________________
Environmental Council of the States (ECOS)/Association of State Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO
EPA (OCHP and the Indoor Environments Division) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are supporting the development and implementation of a national action agenda to reduce environmental triggers of childhood asthma led by ECOS and ASTHO.
In August 2001, a first-ever meeting of high level state environment and health officials resulted in the establishment of a vision statement and goals for the national asthma action agenda.
ECOS passed a resolution endorsing this work in late August.
Four topic meetings have been held around the country addressing key areas (environmental data and asthma surveillance, indoor environments in homes, schools/childcare settings, and outdoor environments).
Recommendations from each of the four 'topic' meetings were compiled by a steering committee (made up of state environment and health officials) into a national action agenda.
This working draft action agenda is available for distribution.
States will be offered the opportunity to apply for pilot projects based on the national agenda, and ASTHO and ECOS plan to issue a joint policy statement endorsing and publicizing the agenda.

Boston Summit on Childhood Lead Poisoning: "Let's End It"
At the day-long Boston Summit on Childhood Lead Poisoning, the Mayor of the City of Boston, Tom Menino, stated that the city has the infrastructure in place to be the first city in the nation to end childhood lead poisoning.
Community leaders and policy-makers outlined a plan to end childhood lead poisoning within three years in Boston.
Currently, an estimated 90,400 Boston homes contain lead-based paint that could be a potential hazard.
The New England Region of EPA has provided more than $2 million to support these lead prevention efforts.

EPA's Lead Awareness Program in Head Start
The EPA is teaming up with Head Start to focus on the effects of lead exposure on a child's growth and development.
Head Start was chosen, because its clients are at a greater risk for lead poisoning than the general population.
An educational packet and curriculum will be provided to the health and educational staff, while parents will receive current EPA lead poisoning prevention literature.
For more information, contact Bob Camara at camara.robert@epa.gov.

Lead Based Paint Program: East Palo Alto, CA
In order to prevent childhood lead poisoning by insuring lead-based paint disclosure, EPA's Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Program initiated the Community Focus Project in East Palo Alto, because it has a low-income, minority population with older housing stock and children under six.
EPA issued a grant for nurses to conduct lead screening.
The program also provides workshops on lead poisoning prevention.
EPA provided the City of East Palo Alto with graphics and the theme, "Lead Hurts Kids", for a large billboard that will be up along the heavily traveled Highway 101.
EPA has also funding for inspections of all property management firms, real estate offices and apartment building complexes of 5+ units in the East Palo Alto, California.
Because of a low rate of compliance, EPA used a compliance assistance approach and plans to reinspect non-compliant facilities within two years.
For more information, contact Helen K. Burke, Lead Compliance Officer, (415) 947-4171.

Region 7 Lead Poisoning Prevention Program
EPA's Region 7 received funding from the EPA's Office of Children's Health Protection to conduct 158 inspections of larger apartment managers in Region 7; this resulted in approximately 800 lease reviews.
Over 23,000 residential target housing units were impacted by these inspections, many of which were occupied by young children.

Study of Asthma Rates: Oakland, California
EPA has provided resources to the American Lung Association (ALA) of the East Bay area for an effort to enhance data collection on asthma.
The funds have been leveraged to ensure an asthma question appears on the "core" California Healthy Kids Survey for 5, 7, 9, and 11th graders.
The EPA money was also useful in getting a private foundation, the California Endowment, to fund continuing the California Healthy Kids Survey.

Children's Micro-Environmental Exposures to Air Toxics in Three California Communities: Crockett, Wilmington, and Boyle Heights
California State Law (SB25) requires the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to complete an ambitious review of children's exposure to air pollutants.
ARB is funding a $400,000 study of children's exposure.
The study will use indoor, personal, and outdoor monitoring to assess exposures to PM2.5, PM10, elemental carbon/diesel, volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide.
This study, which focuses on children in environmental justice communities, will yield important data than will assist EPA and ARB in children's environmental health protection.
Preliminary results are due next year.
For more information, contact Bill Jones, (415) 947-4276.

National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Bus Study
In coordination with State and local air pollution control agencies, EPA has provided NRDC with a grant to conduct in-depth analysis of diesel exhaust from school buses in the Los Angeles area with monitoring at school bus stops and at school.
The project should provide data useful for estimating a child's exposure to diesel school bus exhaust and support anti-idling measures.
For more information, contact Sylvia Dugre, (415) 947-4149.

Quantitative Assessment of Risk for Sensitive Populations
EPA Region 7 is partnering with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the states and tribes to collect health data for incidences of lead and mercury poisonings, respiratory illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, childhood cancer and lung cancer, diabetes and AIDs.
This information is being input along with census and environmental contaminant data to allow more effective internal strategic planning to protect vulnerable populations.
