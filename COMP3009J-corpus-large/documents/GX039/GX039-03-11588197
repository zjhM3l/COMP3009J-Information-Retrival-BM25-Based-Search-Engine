Each Public Health Perspective focuses on a single topic and contains information and commentary on discoveries of genetic variants, related disease outcomes, and the complex social, legal, and ethical issues surrounding genetic discoveries.
Topics are examined from a public health perspective, and readers are encouraged to participate in an ongoing discussion in the readers forum.
This month, we are examining the topic Obesity and Genetics: A Public Health Perspective (February 2002)
As a nation, we need to respond as vigorously to this (obesity) epidemic as we do to an infectious disease epidemicNational efforts are needed to encourage physical activity and better nutrition and to conduct research to identify effective educational, behavioral, and environmental approaches to control and prevent obesity."
Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, Director Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
"Obesity and Genetics: A Public Health Perspective" is a collaborative effort by the CDC's Office of Genomics and Disease Prevention and the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity at CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
Please direct additional questions and inquires about obesity and overweight to Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity.

chromosome button Public Health Perspective Obesity and Genetics: A Public Health Perspective
Studies are showing that the genes are not destiny but are still a significant factor in developing obesity
.
Studying the genetics of obesity will lead us to a greater understanding of the metabolic condition of obesity and help us to explore new options for prevention and treatment.
chromosome button The Problem of Obesity "Today, in the developed world, the incidence of obesity is rising and there are now as many obese people in the world as there are people suffering from hunger."
Phillip Campbell, Editor, Nature and Ritu Dhand, Associate Editor, Nature.
Nature 404 (6778):631 April 6, 2000
Obesity and Overweight: Basics about Overweight and Obesity "Obesity is defined as an excessively high amount of body fat or adipose tissue in relation to lean body mass.
The amount of body fat (or adiposity) includes concern for both the distribution of fat throughout the body and the size of the adipose tissue deposits.
Overweight refers to increased body weight in relation to height, when compared to some standard of acceptable or desirable weights."
The Obesity Epidemic
Adults Recent results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 indicate that an estimated 61 percent of U.S. adults are either overweight or obese, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more.
Children The percentage of children and adolescents who are defined as overweight has more than doubled since the early1970s.
About 13 percent of children and adolescents are now seriously overweight.
The Cost of Obesity in the United States Americans spend $33 billion annually on weight-loss products and services.
(This figure represents consumer dollars spent in the early 1990s on all efforts at weight loss or weight maintenance including low-calorie foods, artificially sweetened products such as diet sodas, and memberships to commercial weight-loss centers.)
chromosome button Genetics of Obesity
"If some environmental variables manifest themselves only on certain genotypes, efforts to prevent obesity at a public health level can be focused on recognition and counseling of susceptible individuals.
In addition, appreciating the importance of genetic variation as an underlying cause helps to dispel the notion that obesity represents an individual defect in behavior with no biological basis and provides a starting point for efforts to identify the genes involved."
Gregory S. Barash, I. Sadaf Farooqi and Stephen O'Rahilly Nature 2000; 404:644-651

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III Leptin Data.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) announces the release of the NHANES III Leptin Data.
The Leptin data is a study sample consisted of 6415 participants aged greater than 20 years who were randomly assigned to be examined in the morning exam after an overnight fast.
This data is useful in epidemiological or statistical studies.
Note: the released data is in flat text format and a SAS program is provided to read the flat data.
The user is advised to have someone who knows SAS data step to adapt the provided SAS program to his or her specific SAS environment.
