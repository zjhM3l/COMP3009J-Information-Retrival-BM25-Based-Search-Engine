Saturday and Sunday, in pouring rain, 13 Plainville, Conn., residents participated in search-and-rescue training organized by the East Granby and Plainville Civil Air Patrol squadrons at Rainbow Reservoir.
The Plainville team, also known as the Charles K. Hamilton Squadron, is a Civil Air Patrol unit based at Plainville's Robertson Airport.
The team is a composite group made up of youngsters and adults, all passionate about flying.
The adults are professional pilots, air guardsmen, and parents, while the children are junior and high school students who come from Plainville and area towns.
Over the weekend, squadron seniors and cadets took part in a regional search-and-rescue ground training exercise.
They were part of a group of 65 New Englanders who made it to Rainbow Reservoir in East Granby despite the rain.
The two-phase training started on Saturday with compass and map reading.
Paul Marsters, a professional compass teacher from Westover Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, instructed.
Marsters, who usually teaches college-level intensive map and compass courses, led the air patrol teams through using quadrants (grid maps).
Later Saturday, the teams also learned how to move people on stretchers in emergency situations as part of the emergency medical training taught by Lt. Gerry Fledge, a National Air Guardsman from the Plainville squadron
.
On Sunday, the teams were able to apply knowledge learned in the classroom in an all-day field training.
The trainees learned how to locate ELT emergency beacons using an L-PER, an antenna-type box that picks up radio signals.
ELT emergency beacons are radio transmitters which emit a beep and help to locate the black box in a damaged airplane.
This method is widely used in rescue efforts.
The cadets also learned how to work with dogs during rescue missions.
During the Sunday training, the teams went out into the woods with dogs to locate fake injured people.
They learned how to use the radio to evacuate people, as well.
In order to use the radios, all participants -- including the younger children -- have to be radio certified.
These certification trainings are offered through the local Civil Air Patrol squadrons.
Based on the compass classroom knowledge, all teams conducted a daytime and a nighttime search.
Both during the day and night, teams used numbered surveying flags to mark off the search areas and plot compass courses.
This allowed everyone to search the whole area in a systematic manner.
All participants wore military fatigues, as well as night reflecting vests and glow sticks.
Out of the New England groups, the Plainville squadron came in second in all phases of the training.
The pouring rain prevented the arrival of the Trooper 1 helicopter, but the Plainville team had already done a helicopter rescue training last Tuesday at Brainard Airfield in Hartford.
"The training was a lot of fun," says Joseph Trujillo, a seventh-grade pupil from Southington.
"I learned things that in the future might help me find a missing person.
I also got to meet a lot of new people through the training."
Joseph's mother, Robin Trujillo, is a senior member with the Civil Air Patrol.
She helped with the weekend training, along with her husband, Jose, a state trooper, who worked with the emergency services.
Civil Air Patrol acts as the auxiliary to the Air Force.
In emergency situations, they help to coordinate rescue missions.
If there are missing children or the elderly, the Civil Air Patrol helps in the search.
Last year, after the events of Sept. 11, the team transported blood to New York City.
The younger squadron members also participate in state emergency search and rescue missions, but must be certified to help.
The Plainville Civil Air Patrol team meets every Tuesday at Trinity Covenant Church.
Membership is open to anyone from grade six and older who is interested in aviation.
The Civil Air Patrol team offers free flying lessons to children and adults.
The Robertson Airport pilots donate their time to train people, and the flying students are issued aerospace and leadership books to study.
Full scholarships are also available for those who want to make flying a career.
