TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ REGISTRATION OF TEN INTERSPECIFIC GERMPLASMS DERIVED FROM WILD PERENNIAL SUNFLOWER Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Wild sunflowers are the ancestors of cultivated sunflower.
The ancestors possess considerable variability for many morphological and physiological traits.
The problem is that many of the species are very distant relatives of the cultivated sunflower so the breeding of the wild relatives with cultivated sunflower can be difficult.
Wild perennial sunflower are the most distantly related ancestors, but are a good potential source of genes for pest resistance for cultivated sunflower.
Efforts to utilize many of these species are hampered by poor germination, crossability and sterility problems, and culturing difficulties.
Development of interspecific breeding materials which overcome many of these problems would greatly facilitate the use of the wild perennial species.
Ten interspecific germplasm lines have been developed which contain genes transferred from four different perennial species.
The germplasm lines exhibit an annual growth habit, varying degrees of branching, and lower oil content than cultivated hybrids.
Utilization of these germplasm lines in sunflower breeding programs has the potential of increasing the genetic diversity for pest resistance and decreasing the genetic vulnerability of cultivated sunflower.
