FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 29, 2001
SCHUMER MASS TRANSIT CREDIT COULD SAVE WESTCHESTER COMMUTERS HUNDREDS PER YEAR
Schumer Unveils New Initiative To More Than Double Federal Mass Transit Benefit For Local Commuters
Standing at the White Plains MetroNorth Station, US Senator Charles E. Schumer today unveiled a plan that could save Westchester mass transit commuters hundreds of dollars per year in transportation costs.
Schumer's proposal, to be introduced as legislation this week, would more than double the amount of money that employers can set aside per month for employee mass transit expenses.
The increase would put the mass transit benefit in line with one the federal government provides to employers to help cover employee parking costs.
"The mass transit subsidy program is a great idea, but it is undermined by the fact that we provide a parking benefit that is more than twice as large," said Schumer.
"My proposal will boost the mass transit subsidy to reward commuters who choose mass transit and make drivers think twice about getting in their cars.
For Westchester commuters who use Bee Line and Metro North, the increase could mean hundreds of dollars per year in savings."
The federal government currently provides employers with the option of setting aside up to $65 per month of an employee's pre-tax income to pay for his or her commuting costs.
That income - up to $780 per year - is exempt from both federal income taxes and from employers' payroll taxes.
The program also gives employers the option of providing the $65 per month benefit as a supplement to the employee's salary.
While the program is designed to encourage commuters to use mass transit, it is undermined by another federal program which provides a much larger set aside - $175 per month - for employee parking expenses.
Moreover, the current $65 benefit is far below the monthly expense incurred by commuters who rely on mass transit systems.
The average MetroNorth commuter currently pays $170 per month to get to and from New York City.
Commuters who travel between White Plains and Grand Central Station, for example, shell out $176 on MetroNorth in addition to whatever local transportation they require.
Schumer's legislation - the Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2001 - would boost the mass transit set aside from $65 to $175 per month.
The increase would make up to $2,100 of an employee's pre- tax income exempt from federal income taxes.
It also gives an employer the option of providing this benefit on a tax free basis as an addition to an employee's salary.
Schumer said that he was confident that employers would respond to employee requests and offer the benefit.
In 1998, for example, when the federal transit benefit was increased to $65 and New York City Transportation authorities created the unlimited ride MetroCard, the number of companies offering transit subsidies increased from 8,000 to 13,000 in just two years.
"Simply stated, the daily drive between Westchester and New York City is a nightmare.
Thousands of Westchester drivers are looking for a better way," said Schumer.
"If we make can make taking mass transit to work financially attractive, commuters will be more than happy to leave their car keys at home."
The bill, which will be cosponsored by Republican Senators John Warner and Rick Santorum, has broad bipartisan support and the endorsement of groups ranging from the Sierra Club, to Environmental Defense, to the US Conference of Mayors.
Westchester County Transportation Commissioner Larry Salley; TransitCenter Inc. President and CEO Larry Filler; and Beverly Dolinsky, head of the MTA's Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee joined Schumer at a press conference to announce the legislation.
